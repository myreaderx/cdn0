As part of that effort, we have a range of existing programs to enable security researchers to report security issues they have found. For example, you can report vulnerabilities in Android code via the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/\">Android Security Rewards Program</a> (ASR), and vulnerabilities in popular third-party Android apps through the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/play-rewards/\">Google Play Security Rewards Program</a>. Google releases ASR reports in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) based code through the <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/bulletin\">Android Security Bulletins</a> (ASB). These reports are issues that could impact all Android based devices. All Android partners must adopt ASB changes in order to declare the current month’s Android security patch level (SPL). But until recently, we didn’t have a clear way to process Google-discovered security issues outside of AOSP code that are unique to a much smaller set of specific Android OEMs. The APVI aims to close this gap, adding another layer of security for this targeted set of Android OEMs. </p> <h2> Improving Android OEM device security </h2> <p> The APVI covers Google-discovered issues that could potentially affect the security posture of an Android device or its user and is aligned to <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html\">ISO/IEC 29147:2018</a> Information technology -- Security techniques -- Vulnerability disclosure recommendations. The initiative covers a wide range of issues impacting device code that is not serviced or maintained by Google (these are handled by the Android Security Bulletins). </p> <h2> Protecting Android users </h2> <p> The APVI has already processed a number of security issues, improving user protection against permissions bypasses, execution of code in the kernel, credential leaks and generation of unencrypted backups. Below are a few examples of what we’ve found, the impact and OEM remediation efforts. </p> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nTpHLu-IblM/X3Y_myWMxFI/AAAAAAAAPtg/QyPs221KSq01gZPmiUsfocm48ZsSVCwogCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/bypass2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:125px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nTpHLu-IblM/X3Y_myWMxFI/AAAAAAAAPtg/QyPs221KSq01gZPmiUsfocm48ZsSVCwogCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/bypass2.png\" data-original-width=\"1251\" data-original-height=\"1353\" align=\"left\" /></a> <i><em>Permission Bypass</em></i> <p> In some versions of a third-party pre-installed over-the-air (OTA) update solution, a custom system service in the Android framework exposed privileged APIs directly to the OTA app. The service ran as the system user and did not require any permissions to access, instead checking for knowledge of a hardcoded password. The operations available varied across versions, but always allowed access to sensitive APIs, such as silently installing/uninstalling APKs, enabling/disabling apps and granting app permissions. This service appeared in the code base for many device builds across many OEMs, however it wasn’t always registered or exposed to apps. We’ve worked with impacted OEMs to make them aware of this security issue and provided guidance on how to remove or disable the affected code. </p> <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/XYVy4pmVLI0/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KtLnfw6tYuk/X3ZAiDFKHsI/AAAAAAAAPts/jGY8T75TVhAfceE9TSiSVNp-wZP_epoxgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/credLeak2.png \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:125px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KtLnfw6tYuk/X3ZAiDFKHsI/AAAAAAAAPts/jGY8T75TVhAfceE9TSiSVNp-wZP_epoxgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/credLeak2.png  \" data-original-width=\"1251\" data-original-height=\"1353\" align=\"left\" /></a> <i><em>Credential Leak</em></i> <p> A popular web browser pre-installed on many devices included a built-in password manager for sites visited by the user. The interface for this feature was exposed to WebView through JavaScript loaded in the context of each web page. A malicious site could have accessed the full contents of the user’s credential store. The credentials are encrypted at rest, but used a weak algorithm (DES) and a known, hardcoded key. This issue was reported to the developer and updates for the app were issued to users. </p> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G2HUvBTITnI/X3ZA7BvsZcI/AAAAAAAAPt0/L2DG0nH7y7Y6bL3f-ISCg8jZUlAqPXC-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/overlyPriv2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:125px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G2HUvBTITnI/X3ZA7BvsZcI/AAAAAAAAPt0/L2DG0nH7y7Y6bL3f-ISCg8jZUlAqPXC-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/overlyPriv2.png\" data-original-width=\"1251\" data-original-height=\"1353\" align=\"left\" /></a> <i><em>Overly-Privileged Apps</em></i> <p> The <strong><code>checkUidPermission</code></strong> method in the <strong><code>PackageManagerService</code></strong> class was modified in the framework code for some devices to allow special permissions access to some apps. In one version, the method granted apps with the shared user ID <code>com.google.uid.shared</code> any permission they requested and apps signed with the same key as the <code>com.google.android.gsf</code> package any permission in their manifest. Another version of the modification allowed apps matching a list of package names and signatures to pass runtime permission checks even if the permission was not in their manifest. These issues have been fixed by the OEMs. <h2> More information </h2> <p> Keep an eye out at <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/apvi/issues/list?q=&amp;can=1\">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/apvi/</a> for future disclosures of Google-discovered security issues under this program, or find more information there on issues that have already been disclosed. </p> <p> <em>Acknowledgements:<strong> </strong>Scott Roberts, Shailesh Saini and Łukasz Siewierski, Android Security and Privacy Team</em> </p> \n     <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n      <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=XYVy4pmVLI0:nkyqwX_vWpE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n      <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=XYVy4pmVLI0:nkyqwX_vWpE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=XYVy4pmVLI0:nkyqwX_vWpE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n     </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/XYVy4pmVLI0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></p></p></img> \n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 17:04:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NpQFWMPBINE/X3Y-sUMQvFI/AAAAAAAAPtU/rMcR1U6s2U441OQNsAxD4qRDBdKFF0HnwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/apviBlogHero%2B%25281%2529.png","linkMd5":"0106570bcd299cd9b91410cadcc4b2b9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn5@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-18-36-991_27dcb5a9c82e5457.webp","destWidth":1367,"destHeight":769,"sourceBytes":115234,"destBytes":45096,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NpQFWMPBINE/X3Y-sUMQvFI/AAAAAAAAPtU/rMcR1U6s2U441OQNsAxD4qRDBdKFF0HnwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/apviBlogHero%2B%25281%2529.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn5@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-18-36-991_27dcb5a9c82e5457.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nTpHLu-IblM/X3Y_myWMxFI/AAAAAAAAPtg/QyPs221KSq01gZPmiUsfocm48ZsSVCwogCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/bypass2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-18-50-122_39ea589fbfe4fa47.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KtLnfw6tYuk/X3ZAiDFKHsI/AAAAAAAAPts/jGY8T75TVhAfceE9TSiSVNp-wZP_epoxgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/credLeak2.png  ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-18-50-529_e3a046b65a832412.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G2HUvBTITnI/X3ZA7BvsZcI/AAAAAAAAPt0/L2DG0nH7y7Y6bL3f-ISCg8jZUlAqPXC-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/overlyPriv2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-18-50-279_3866cd0a8d42de1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn9@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-18-46-082_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=XYVy4pmVLI0:nkyqwX_vWpE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-18-50-332_233d91bfe17074bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/XYVy4pmVLI0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn12@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-18-50-170_88d8af02cce4c0bb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249497520},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:17","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:17","title":"Improve Your Game with Texture Compression Format Targeting","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/VZNjo5AlLGQ/improve-your-game-with-texture.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\" https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpIt2H61tyY/X2i21MKWoBI/AAAAAAAAPqY/RCPqrrwVR0MVPbHjsFl5eff9ECLEuBGDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252816%2529.png  \"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/VZNjo5AlLGQ/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpIt2H61tyY/X2i21MKWoBI/AAAAAAAAPqY/RCPqrrwVR0MVPbHjsFl5eff9ECLEuBGDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252816%2529.png  \"> <p><em>Posted by Yafit Becher, Product Manager &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dagalpin?lang=en\">Dan Galpin</a>, Developer Advocate </em><p> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpIt2H61tyY/X2i21MKWoBI/AAAAAAAAPqY/RCPqrrwVR0MVPbHjsFl5eff9ECLEuBGDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252816%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpIt2H61tyY/X2i21MKWoBI/AAAAAAAAPqY/RCPqrrwVR0MVPbHjsFl5eff9ECLEuBGDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252816%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Play Asset Delivery downloads the best supported texture for the device</p> <p> Google Play Asset Delivery allows you to publish an Android App Bundle to Google Play containing all the resources your game needs. It offers multiple delivery modes, auto-updates, compression, and delta patching, all hosted at no cost to you. </p> <p> As of today, you can use Google Play Asset Delivery to include textures in multiple texture compression formats in your Android App Bundle and Google Play will automatically deliver the assets with the best supported texture compression format for each device. With Texture Compression Format Targeting, you can start using ASTC for devices that support it while falling back to ETC2/ETC1 to devices that don’t. The Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) format offers advantages, such as improved rendering performance, faster load times, a smaller in-memory footprint, better battery life, and improved visual quality. You can even dramatically reduce your download size and on-device footprint by optimizing the tradeoff between size and quality. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXPpQPiPV9U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Higher bandwidth version of much of this information </p> <p> Android App Bundle will be the required publishing format for all new games and apps as of August 2021, which means that Google Play Asset Delivery will be required for new games that want Google Play to host more than 150MB of assets. Texture format targeting provides value even for smaller games due to the advantages of newer texture compression formats. </p> <h2>Texture compression</h2> <p> Texture compression is a form of lossy image compression that allows the GPU to render directly from the compressed texture using specialized silicon blocks, reducing the texture memory and memory bandwidth required to render the texture. As GPUs have gotten more advanced, more sophisticated texture compression formats have been developed, but not all GPUs can take advantage of them. </p> <p> ASTC was released in 2012 to give developers more flexibility in trading compression size vs image quality. It compresses using fixed 128-bit block sizes, but allows for variable block footprints from 4x4 (8 bits per texel) to 12x12 (.89 bits per texel). </p> \n    <center> \n     <div id=\"flexParent\"> \n      <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/VZNjo5AlLGQ/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YM_tZBLvaFE/X2i8mxx4tyI/AAAAAAAAPqo/PfbUey3eJHAFqgYGY9Ne6jA6-ZLSBXwsACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252817%2529.png  \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width: 215px\" id=\"flexImg\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/VZNjo5AlLGQ/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YM_tZBLvaFE/X2i8mxx4tyI/AAAAAAAAPqo/PfbUey3eJHAFqgYGY9Ne6jA6-ZLSBXwsACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252817%2529.png \" alt=\"Texture compression format image\" /></a> \n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jS33iGldcXY/X2i9EaRk8XI/AAAAAAAAPqw/wCWwI5li8IEeb9rP8-FP2qjoXNK79LrAwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/unnamed%2B%25283%2529.png  \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width: 215px\" id=\"flexImg\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jS33iGldcXY/X2i9EaRk8XI/AAAAAAAAPqw/wCWwI5li8IEeb9rP8-FP2qjoXNK79LrAwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/unnamed%2B%25283%2529.png \" alt=\" Texture compression format image\" /></a> \n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2t_uIHdEkhc/X2i9SNGaYbI/AAAAAAAAPq0/RK91xzP48f0QKUUc544PhmXLHVtZQ19SQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252818%2529.png \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width: 215px\" id=\"flexImg\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/VZNjo5AlLGQ/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2t_uIHdEkhc/X2i9SNGaYbI/AAAAAAAAPq0/RK91xzP48f0QKUUc544PhmXLHVtZQ19SQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252818%2529.png\" alt=\"Texture compression format image\" /></a> \n     </div> \n    </center> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Googleplex from Google Earth at 12x12 (.89 BPT), 6x5 (4.27 BPT), 4x4 (8 BPT) </p> <p> This allows almost any type of texture to be used in compressed form, and allows for textures to occupy much less space in RAM — up to 36x less space compared to uncompressed 2D textures depending on quality.

It is only natural that as part of this evolution, we’ve come to entrust our phones with our most private information, and in many ways treat them as extensions of our digital and physical identities. </p> <p> This trust is paramount to the Android Security team. The team focuses on ensuring that Android devices respect the privacy and sensitivity of user data. A fundamental aspect of this work centers around the lockscreen, which acts as the proverbial front door to our devices. After all, the lockscreen <em>ensures</em> that only the intended user(s) of a device can access their private data. </p> <p> This blog post outlines recent improvements around how users interact with the lockscreen on Android devices and more generally with authentication. In particular, we focus on two categories of authentication that present both immense potential as well as potentially immense risk if not designed well: biometrics and environmental modalities. </p> <h1>The tiered authentication model</h1> <p> Before getting into the details of lockscreen and authentication improvements, we first want to establish some context to help relate these improvements to each other. A good way to envision these changes is to fit them into the framework of the <strong><em>tiered authentication model</em></strong>, a conceptual classification of all the different authentication modalities on Android, how they relate to each other, and how they are constrained based on this classification. </p> <p> The model itself is fairly simple, classifying authentication modalities into three buckets of decreasing levels of security and commensurately increasing constraints. The primary tier is the least constrained in the sense that users only need to re-enter a primary modality under certain situations (for example, after each boot or every 72 hours) in order to use its capability. The secondary and tertiary tiers are more constrained because they cannot be set up and used without having a primary modality enrolled first and they have more constraints further restricting their capabilities. </p> \n  <ol> \n   <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n    <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qtzuYCAvjoQ/X2lNMKMvw2I/AAAAAAAADDU/a0_N6Zn2o3U0DqpQvdjdMk4DON5UFYi3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Image%2B%2523%2B1.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"548\" data-original-width=\"1338\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qtzuYCAvjoQ/X2lNMKMvw2I/AAAAAAAADDU/a0_N6Zn2o3U0DqpQvdjdMk4DON5UFYi3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Image%2B%2523%2B1.png\" /></a>\n   </div> \n   <li><strong><em>Primary Tier - Knowledge Factor</em></strong>: The first tier consists of modalities that rely on knowledge factors, or something the user knows, for example, a PIN, pattern, or password. Good high-entropy knowledge factors, such as complex passwords that are hard to guess, offer the highest potential guarantee of identity. <p> Knowledge factors are especially useful on Android becauses devices offer hardware backed brute-force protection with exponential-backoff, meaning Android devices prevent attackers from repeatedly guessing a PIN, pattern, or password by having hardware backed timeouts after every 5 incorrect attempts. Knowledge factors also confer additional benefits to all users that use them, such as <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based\">File Based Encryption</a> (FBE) and <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/google-and-android-have-your-back-by.html\">encrypted device backup</a>. </p> <li><strong><em>Secondary Tier - Biometrics</em></strong>: The second tier consists primarily of biometrics, or <em>something the user <strong>is</strong></em>. Face or fingerprint based authentications are examples of secondary authentication modalities. Biometrics offer a more convenient but potentially less secure way of confirming your identity with a device. <p> We will delve into Android biometrics in the next section. </p> <li><strong><em>The Tertiary Tier - Environmental</em></strong>: The last tier includes modalities that rely on <em>something the user <strong>has</strong></em>. This could either be a physical token, such as with Smart Lock’s Trusted Devices where a phone can be unlocked when paired with a safelisted bluetooth device. Or it could be something inherent to the physical environment around the device, such as with Smart Lock’s Trusted Places where a phone can be unlocked when it is taken to a safelisted location. <br> <h3> Improvements to tertiary authentication</h3> <p> While both Trusted Places and Trusted Devices (and tertiary modalities in general) offer convenient ways to get access to the contents of your device, the fundamental issue they share is that they are ultimately a <strong><em>poor proxy for user identity</em></strong>. For example, an attacker could unlock a misplaced phone that uses Trusted Place simply by driving it past the user's home, or with moderate amount of effort, spoofing a GPS signal using off-the-shelf Software Defined Radios and some mild scripting. Similarly with Trusted Device, access to a safelisted bluetooth device also gives access to all data on the user’s phone. </p> <p> Because of this, a major improvement has been made to the environmental tier in Android 10. <strong><em>The Tertiary tier was switched from an active unlock mechanism into an extending unlock mechanism instead</em></strong>. In this new mode, a tertiary tier modality can no longer unlock a locked device. Instead, if the device is first unlocked using either a primary or secondary modality, it can continue to keep it in the unlocked state for a maximum of four hours. </p> </br></li> </li></li>\n  </ol> <h1>A closer look at Android biometrics</h1> <p> Biometric implementations come with a wide variety of security characteristics, so we rely on the following two key factors to determine the security of a particular implementation: </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li><strong><em>Architectural security</em></strong>: The resilience of a biometric pipeline against kernel or platform compromise. A pipeline is considered secure if kernel and platform compromises don’t grant the ability to either read raw biometric data, or inject synthetic data into the pipeline to influence an authentication decision. <li><strong><em>Spoofability</em></strong>: Is measured using the Spoof Acceptance Rate (SAR). SAR is a metric first introduced in Android P, and is intended to measure how resilient a biometric is against a dedicated attacker. Read more about SAR and its measurement in <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/biometric/measure\">Measuring Biometric Unlock Security</a>. </li> </li>\n  </ol> <p> We use these two factors to classify biometrics into one of three different classes in decreasing order of security: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Class 3 (formerly Strong) <li>Class 2 (formerly Weak) <li>Class 1 (formerly Convenience) </li> </li></li>\n  </ul> <p> Each class comes with an associated set of constraints that aim to balance their ease of use with the level of security they offer. </p> <p> These constraints reflect the length of time before a biometric falls back to primary authentication, and the allowed application integration. For example, a Class 3 biometric enjoys the longest timeouts and offers all integration options for apps, while a Class 1 biometric has the shortest timeouts and no options for app integration. You can see a summary of the details in the table below, or the full details in the <a href=\"https://source.android.com/compatibility/cdd\">Android Android Compatibility Definition Document</a> (CDD). </p> \n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TU7Ma2SiBj0/X2lNc_psCSI/AAAAAAAADDg/5Wu5cv5AuCYc0et5U0mJ3250QmyQXpUxgCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B2020-09-21%2Bat%2B5.57.22%2BPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"650\" data-original-width=\"1024\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TU7Ma2SiBj0/X2lNc_psCSI/AAAAAAAADDg/5Wu5cv5AuCYc0et5U0mJ3250QmyQXpUxgCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B2020-09-21%2Bat%2B5.57.22%2BPM.png\" /></a>\n  </div> <p> <sup>1</sup> App integration means exposing an API to apps (e.g., via integration with BiometricPrompt/BiometricManager, androidx.biometric, or FIDO2 APIs) </p> <p> <sup>2</sup> Keystore integration means integrating Keystore, e.g., to release app auth-bound keys </p> <h2>Benefits and caveats</h2> <p> Biometrics provide convenience to users while maintaining a high level of security. Because users need to set up a primary authentication modality in order to use biometrics, it helps boost the lockscreen adoption (we see an average of 20% higher lockscreen adoption on devices that offer biometrics versus those that do not). This allows more users to benefit from the security features that the lockscreen provides: gates unauthorized access to sensitive user data and also confers other advantages of a primary authentication modality to these users, such as encrypted backups. Finally, biometrics also help reduce <strong>shoulder surfing</strong> attacks in which an attacker tries to reproduce a PIN, pattern, or password after observing a user entering the credential. </p> <p> However, it is important that users understand the trade-offs involved with the use of biometrics. Primary among these is that <strong><em>no biometric system is foolproof. This is true not just on Android, but across all operating systems, form-factors, and technologies.</em></strong> For example, a face biometric implementation might be fooled by family members who resemble the user or a 3D mask of the user. A fingerprint biometric implementation could potentially be bypassed by a spoof made from latent fingerprints of the user. Although anti-spoofing or Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) technologies have been actively developed to mitigate such spoofing attacks, they are mitigations, not preventions. </p> <p> One effort that Android has made to mitigate the potential risk of using biometrics is the lockdown mode introduced in Android P. Android users can use this feature to temporarily disable biometrics, together with Smart Lock (for example, Trusted Places and Trusted Devices) as well as notifications on the lock screen, when they feel the need to do so. </p> <p> To use the lockdown mode, users first need to set up a primary authentication modality and then enable it in settings. The exact setting where the lockdown mode can be enabled varies by device models, and on a Google Pixel 4 device it is under Settings &gt; Display &gt; Lock screen &gt; Show lockdown option. Once enabled, users can trigger the lockdown mode by holding the power button and then clicking the Lockdown icon on the power menu. A device in lockdown mode will return to the non-lockdown state after a primary authentication modality (such as a PIN, pattern, or password) is used to unlock the device. </p> <h1>BiometricPrompt - New APIs</h1> <p> In order for developers to benefit from the security guarantee provided by Android biometrics and to easily integrate biometric authentication into their apps to better protect sensitive user data, we introduced the <strong><code>BiometricPrompt</code></strong> APIs in Android P. <p> There are several benefits of using the BiometricPrompt APIs. Most importantly, these APIs allow app developers to target biometrics in a modality-agnostic way across different Android devices (that is, BiometricPrompt can be used as a single integration point for various biometric modalities supported on devices), while controlling the security guarantees that the authentication needs to provide (such as requiring Class 3 or Class 2 biometrics, with device credential as a fallback). In this way, it helps protect app data with a second layer of defenses (in addition to the lockscreen) and in turn respects the sensitivity of user data. Furthermore, BiometricPrompt provides a persistent UI with customization options for certain information (for example, title and description), offering a consistent user experience across biometric modalities and across Android devices. </p> <p> As shown in the following architecture diagram, apps can integrate with biometrics on Android devices through either the framework API or the support library (that is, <strong><code>androidx.biometric</code></strong> for backward compatibility). One thing to note is that <code>FingerprintManager</code> is deprecated because developers are encouraged to migrate to <code>BiometricPrompt</code> for modality-agnostic authentications. \n    <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HNEEtL6ROKY/X2lOHwJQbmI/AAAAAAAADD0/0fmcbIdU2o0NDu_NrNIXtNEka7PKYDaowCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B2020-09-21%2Bat%2B6.06.16%2BPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"628\" data-original-width=\"1034\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HNEEtL6ROKY/X2lOHwJQbmI/AAAAAAAADD0/0fmcbIdU2o0NDu_NrNIXtNEka7PKYDaowCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B2020-09-21%2Bat%2B6.06.16%2BPM.png\" /></a>\n    </div> <h2>Improvements to BiometricPrompt</h2> <p> Android 10 introduced the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager\">BiometricManager</a></code> class that developers can use to query the availability of biometric authentication and included fingerprint and face authentication integration for <code>BiometricPrompt</code>. <p> In Android 11, we introduce new features such as the <code>BiometricManager.Authenticators </code>interface which allows developers to specify the authentication types accepted by their apps, as well as additional support for auth-per-use keys within the <code>BiometricPrompt</code> class. </p> <p> More details can be found in the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features#biometric-auth\">Android 11 preview</a> and <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/biometric\">Android Biometrics</a> documentation.

Listening carefully to their feedback is an important part of how we continue to make Android better with each release and improve how mobile app stores work. In an April 2019 <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/improving-update-process-with-your.html\">blog post</a> we shared some updates we made to Android APIs and Play Policies based on developer feedback. And today, we wanted to share some additional insights we’ve gained from developer feedback and how we’re taking that input to improve Google Play and Android. Some of the key themes we’ve heard include: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Supporting developers’ ability to choose how they distribute their apps through multiple app stores on different platforms (mobile, PC, and console), each with their own business model competing in a healthy marketplace; <li>Clarifying our policies regarding who needs to use Google Play’s billing system and who does not; <li>Ensuring equal treatment for all apps, including first-party and third-party apps, on our platforms; <li>Allowing developers to connect and communicate directly with their customers; <li>Enabling innovation and ensuring our policies embrace new technologies that can help drive the consumer experience forward. </li> </li></li></li></li>\n  </ul> <p> We’d like to share our perspective on each of these points. </p> <h2>Choice of stores</h2> <p> We believe that developers should have a choice in how they distribute their apps and that stores should compete for the consumer’s and the developer’s business. Choice has always been a core tenet of Android, and it’s why consumers have always had control over which apps they use, be it their keyboard, messaging app, phone dialer, or app store. </p> <p> Android has always allowed people to get apps from multiple app stores. In fact, most Android devices ship with at least two app stores preinstalled, and consumers are able to install additional app stores. Each store is able to decide its own business model and consumer features. This openness means that even if a developer and Google do not agree on business terms the developer can still distribute on the Android platform. This is why Fortnite, for example, is available directly from Epic's store or from other app stores including Samsung's Galaxy App store. </p> <p> That said, some developers have given us feedback on how we can make the user experience for installing another app store on their device even better. In response to that feedback, we will be making changes in Android 12 (next year’s Android release) to make it even easier for people to use other app stores on their devices while being careful not to compromise the safety measures Android has in place. We are designing all this now and look forward to sharing more in the future! </p> <h2>Clarity on billing policies</h2> <p> As we mentioned, each Android app store is able to decide its own business model and consumer features. For Google Play, users expect a safe, secure and seamless experience, and developers come to Play for powerful tools and services that help them build and grow their businesses. Our developer policies are designed to help us deliver on these expectations and Google Play's billing system is a cornerstone of our ongoing commitment. Consumers get the benefit of a trusted system that allows them to safely, securely, and seamlessly buy from developers worldwide. Google protects consumers’ payment info with multiple layers of security, using one of the world’s <a href=\"https://privacy.google.com/your-security.html\">most advanced</a> security infrastructures. For developers, Google Play’s billing system provides an easy way for billions of Android users to transact with them using their local, preferred method of payment. </p> <p> We’ve <a href=\"https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/payments/\">always required</a> developers who distribute their apps on Play to use Google Play’s billing system if they offer in-app purchases of digital goods, and pay a service fee from a percentage of the purchase. To be clear, this policy is only applicable to less than 3% of developers with apps on Google Play. We only collect a service fee if the developer charges users to download their app or they sell in-app digital items, and we think that is fair. Not only does this approach allow us to continuously reinvest in the platform, this business model aligns our success directly with the success of developers. </p> <p> But we have heard feedback that our policy language could be more clear regarding which types of transactions require the use of Google Play’s billing system, and that the current language was causing confusion. We want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied consistently and fairly to all developers, and so we have clarified the language in our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9992660\">Payments Policy</a> to be more explicit that all developers selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play’s billing system. </p> <p> Again, this isn’t new. This has always been the intention of this long standing policy and this clarification will not affect the vast majority of developers with apps on Google Play. Less than 3% of developers with apps on Play sold digital goods over the last 12 months, and of this 3%, the vast majority (nearly 97%) already use Google Play's billing. But for those who already have an app on Google Play that requires technical work to integrate our billing system, we do not want to unduly disrupt their roadmaps and are giving a year (until September 30, 2021) to complete any needed updates. And of course we will require Google’s apps that do not already use Google Play’s billing system to make the necessary updates as well. </p> <h2>Equal treatment</h2> <p> Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google’s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they're third-party apps or our own apps. In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google’s competitors in our Editors Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google's own apps. </p> <h2>Communicating with customers</h2> <p> Developers have told us it is very important to be able to speak directly with their customers without significant restrictions. As app developers ourselves, we agree wholeheartedly and our policies have always allowed this. </p> <p> That said, developers have asked whether they can communicate with their customers directly about pricing, offers, and alternative ways to pay beyond their app via email or other channels. To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer’s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play. </p> <p> We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly. </p> <h2>Enabling innovation</h2> <p> Developers are coming up with cool things all the time. Using their feedback, we are always trying to adjust our approach to ensure that we continue to help enable new forms of innovation. For example, recent innovations in game streaming have generated new game experiences that are available on Google Play, including Microsoft’s recent launch of Xbox cloud gaming in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamepass&amp;hl=en_US\">Xbox Game Pass</a> Android app. </p> <h2>Keep the feedback coming</h2> <p> We really appreciate all the feedback we have received from our developer community and believe the Android ecosystem has never been a more exciting place to be. </p> <p> It is exciting to see developers such as Duolingo, Truecaller, Hyperconnect, Any.do, and Viber be so successful and grow their business on Android and reach a diverse audience. These kinds of services delight consumers and we are thrilled to have built a platform that can support them. </p> <p> We’ve also published some additional frequently asked developer questions <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/commerce-update-faqs.html \">here</a>. </p>\n  <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n   <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=mHZmYIMHYSo:0aVHhtGNjF4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n   <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=mHZmYIMHYSo:0aVHhtGNjF4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=mHZmYIMHYSo:0aVHhtGNjF4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n  </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/mHZmYIMHYSo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"e06151c2831110b3bcdd8625b3faf2b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn9@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-18-46-082_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn9@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-18-46-082_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=mHZmYIMHYSo:0aVHhtGNjF4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn66@2020_1/2020/10/09/13-18-50-423_fdb9386c5f032788.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/mHZmYIMHYSo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn25@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-18-50-126_bd9c40d2c6c7fd95.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249497521},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:17","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:17","title":"Answering your FAQs about Google Play billing","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/oScJclL9FxA/commerce-update-faqs.html","description":"<p><em>Posted by Mrinalini Loew, Group Product Manager </em><p> <p> We are committed to providing powerful tools and services to help developers build and grow their businesses while ensuring a safe, secure and seamless experience for users. Today we are <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">addressing</a> some of the most common themes we hear in feedback from developers. Below are a few frequently asked developer questions that we thought would also be helpful to address. </p> <h3>Q: Can I distribute my app via other Android app stores or through my website? </h3> <p> A: Yes, you can distribute your app however you like! As an open ecosystem, most Android devices come preinstalled with more than one store - and users can install others. Android provides developers the freedom and flexibility to distribute apps through other Android app stores, directly via websites, or device preloads, all without using Google Play’s billing system. </p> <h3>Q: What apps need to use Google Play's billing system?</h3> <p> A: All apps distributed on Google Play that are offering in-app purchases of digital goods need to use Google Play’s billing system. Our payments policy has always required this. Less than 3% of developers with apps on Play sold digital goods over the last 12 months, and of this 3%, the vast majority (nearly 97%) already use Google Play's billing. For those few developers that need to update their apps, they will have until September 30, 2021 to make those changes. New apps submitted after January 20, 2021 will need to be in compliance. </p> <h3>Q: Many businesses have needed to move their previously physical services online (e.g. digital live events). Will these apps need to use Google Play’s billing?</h3> <p> A: We recognize that the global pandemic has resulted in many businesses having to navigate the challenges of moving their physical business to digital and engaging customers in a new way, for example, moving in-person experiences and classes online. For the next 12 months, these businesses will not need to comply with our payments policy, and we will continue to reassess the situation over the next year. For developers undergoing these changes, we're eager to hear from you and work with you to help you reach new users and grow your online businesses, while enabling a consistent and safe user experience online. </p> <h3>Q: Do Google’s apps have to follow this policy too?</h3> <p> A: Yes. Google Play’s developer policies - including the requirement that apps use Google Play’s billing system for in-app purchases of digital goods - apply to all apps on Play, including Google’s own apps. </p> <h3>Q: Can I communicate with my users about alternate ways to pay?</h3> <p> A: Yes. Outside of your app you are free to communicate with them about alternative purchase options. You can use email marketing and other channels outside of the app to provide subscription offers and even special pricing. </p> <h3>Q: Can I communicate with my users about promotions on other platforms?</h3> <p> A: Of course. We're an app developer too, and we know how important it is not to restrict your ability to communicate with your users. You can email them or otherwise communicate outside of the app information about your offerings, even if they are different on Google Play than in other places. </p> <h3>Q: Can I have different app features, prices and experience depending on the platform?</h3> <p> A: Yes. It is your service and business, it is up to you. We do not require parity across platforms. You can create different versions of your app to support different platforms, features and pricing models. </p> <h3>Q: Can I offer a consumption-only (reader) app on Play?</h3> <p> A: Yes. Google Play allows any app to be consumption-only, even if it is part of a paid service. For example, a user could login when the app opens and the user could access content paid for somewhere else. </p> <h3>Q: Does your billing policy change depending on what category my app is in?</h3> <p> A: No. Business or consumer apps, and verticals like music or email are all treated the same on Google Play. </p> <h3>Q: Can I offer my customers refunds directly?</h3> <p> A: Yes. We understand the importance of maintaining the relationship with your customers. You can continue to issue refunds to your customers and other customer support directly. </p> <h3>Q: Will Google Play allow cloud gaming apps?</h3> <p> A: Yes. Cloud game streaming apps that comply with Play’s policies from any developer are welcome on Google Play. </p> <p> For more examples and best practices for in-app purchases, visit this Play Academy <a
