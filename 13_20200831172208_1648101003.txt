In as little as 20 minutes, the drug works its magic, pain is reduced, and you can exercise or go about your day without any problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I’ve gotten on in years, I’ve noticed myself reaching for the mega-bottle of ibuprofen in the medicine cabinet more and more often in order to alleviate my aching joints and tendons so I can engage in or recover from my weightlifting training. Getting old stinks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then a few months ago, I caught wind of some studies saying that taking ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could hurt my precious, precious gainz because they prevent inflammation from occurring after exercise. Inflammation is necessary for muscle repair and is what allows a muscle to get bigger and stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, crap. Would I have to forgo the ibuprofen and train in pain lest it negate all the effort I put into my workouts? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided to investigate. Here is my report. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What Are NSAIDs and How Do They Relieve Pain?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ibuprofen is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID for short. NSAIDs are the most widely used group of medications designed to reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. Ibuprofen is the most commonly used NSAID, and often referred to by the Advil brand name. Aspirin and naproxen (Aleve) are a couple other varieties. A popular topical NSAID is diclofenac (Voltaren gel). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NSAIDs work by blocking your body’s production of the chemicals associated with pain and inflammation, specifically enzymes called cyclooxygenases (COX). There are two forms of COX: COX-1 and COX-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most NSAIDs work by blocking both forms of COX. These are called non-selective NSAIDs and include the most commonly used varieties: aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some NSAIDs only block COX-2 and are called selective NSAIDs. Celebrex is a selective NSAID. You usually need a doctor’s prescription to take a selective NSAID. For the purposes of this article, the focus will be on over-the-counter non-selective NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most oral NSAIDs like Advil or Aleve take about 20 to 30 minutes to start working after ingestion. The pain reduction they offer lasts for 4-6 hours (Advil) or 8-12 hours (Aleve). A topical NSAID, like diclofenac, takes about the same amount of time to work, but doesn’t last as long.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Do NSAIDs Hurt Your Athletic Gains/Performance?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we know how NSAIDs work to alleviate pain: they block two enzymes that are produced during the inflammatory process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the million-dollar question: if inflammation drives muscle growth, and NSAIDs inhibit inflammation, will popping a few ibuprofen before you train diminish the results of your workouts?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short answer: probably not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long answer: read on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, several reports have been floating around that NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, can get in the way of training adaptations that allow you to lift more weight and run faster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theory is that by reducing the inflammation necessary for rebuilding damaged muscle after training, you prevent your muscles from adapting and getting bigger and stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11832356/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2002 study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is often trotted out to confirm this theory. In it, researchers found that individuals who took ibuprofen after training saw reduced protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is the process your muscles use to turn proteins into new muscle tissue. What’s more, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4043321/\">studies on mice</a> have shown a similar effect from ibuprofen consumption on reduced protein synthesis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many gym bros use that study to confirm their decision to never pop “Vitamin I” after training — even if they’re in a lot of pain — as they’re worried it will hurt their gainz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21160058/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">follow-up study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done in 2011 by the same guy who did the 2002 study found that taking ibuprofen did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inhibit muscle protein synthesis. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18461099/\">Subsequent studie</a>s have found that ibuprofen has little or no effect on muscle growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what gives? If inflammation is required for rebuilding damaged muscle after training, how can taking an anti-inflammatory NOT get in the way of that process? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, if inflammation just depended on COX enzymes, then yeah, NSAIDs would get in the way of muscle adaptation. But inflammation doesn’t just rely on COX enzymes. Like most physiological processes, inflammation is complex and involves several different chemicals and enzymes. Even if you take some ibuprofen before or after training, you’ll still have a bit of an inflammatory reaction, which will allow muscle growth to occur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So bottom line: taking NSAIDs before or after training likely doesn’t have any adverse effect on your strength or muscle growth. In fact, it’s probably the case that taking ibuprofen before training can actually help increase muscle size and strength and allow you to run faster and longer. Not because there’s actually a muscle-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enhancing </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">property in ibuprofen; several studies have shown that NSAIDs don’t provide any short-term performance advantages. Rather, by reducing the pain you’re experiencing, the ibuprofen allows you to train — to still get in your workout even if you’re suffering a few aches — which allows you to consistently exercise, which allows you to get stronger in the long-term. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Use NSAIDs to Manage Pain While Training</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if NSAIDs don’t hurt your athletic performance, you can pop Advil like Flinstone vitamins, right? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not so fast, tiger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NSAIDs are drugs and carry risks, particularly if you take a lot of them for a long time. The most common side effect of taking too much ibuprofen or naproxen is stomach bleeding. Kidney failure and high blood pressure are other potential side effects of the high, prolonged use of NSAIDs.</span></p>\n<h3>For Short-Term Pain Management, Take NSAIDs </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you tweaked your back or have some acute pain that’s preventing you from training, feel free to take the recommended dose of Advil or Aleve to reduce the pain. Don’t go over the recommended dosage. For ibuprofen, that’s 200-400 mg (1-2 capsules/pills of Advil) every 4-6 hours; the maximum daily dose is 1,200 mg. For naproxen, the recommended dose is 220-440 mg (1 to 2 capsules of Aleve) for the first dose and 220 mg every 8-12 hours thereafter; the maximum daily dose is 660 mg. </span></p>\n<h3>For Long-Term Pain Management, Address the Bigger, Underlying Issues</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking the maximum daily dose of an NSAID for a few days shouldn’t cause any potentially damaging side effects. If, after a few days of beginning your NSAID regimen, you’re still experiencing pain that gets in the way of training, you’ll need to take a step back to see what’s causing that pain. Perhaps the form you’re using while weightlifting or running is faulty and needs to be improved. Maybe some body part is hurting because of overuse, and you just need to modify the type of exercises you’re doing to allow the muscle/tendon that’s hurting to completely heal. Or perhaps you just need to dial things back a bit with how hard and how often you train. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-483-what-really-works-for-exercise-recovery/\">Maybe it’s a dose of vitamin “R” — recovery — that you need.</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve experienced this personally with my own training. Over the past five years, I’ve had battles with tendonitis in different parts of my body: </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/dealing-with-bicep-tendonitis-a-multi-step-approach/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bicep tendonitis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-treat-adductor-tendonitis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adductor tendonitis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and, most recently, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-benefits-of-hanging-for-strength-and-mobility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoulder tendonitis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever I first start experiencing the pain from tendonitis, I’ll begin an Advil regimen. I’ll take 400 mg before I train and then another 400 mg 4-6 hours later. Usually, after a few days, the pain goes away, and I stop taking the Advil. But if I’m still experiencing pain after a week, I’ll modify my training to allow whatever is hurting to heal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, when I had a bad case of adductor tendonitis a few years ago, I switched from regular low-bar squats to pin squats. I did this until I could squat to depth again without any pain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And earlier this year, I had a mighty struggle with shoulder tendonitis that flared up when I bench pressed. So my barbell coach had me do dumbbell bench presses instead, which didn’t cause any pain and allowed me to still train the bench press movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re a runner, modifying your training might mean alternating days of running and weightlifting (which can help by not only giving your running muscles a rest but by strengthening them against injury), the kind of terrain you run on (e.g., one day on pavement; one on a trail; one on a treadmill), and even your shoes; own at least a couple different pairs, and toggle between them. (</span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/4-bulletproof-ways-to-prevent-running-injuries/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more tips on avoiding running injuries, check out this article.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick for long-term pain management is finding alternate movements or programming that allow you to work out without any pain so you can heal up and get back to training normally.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, after making modifications to your workouts, you’re still experiencing spots of localized pain that make things uncomfortable, you can try rubbing some Voltaren gel on the area that’s hurting. As mentioned above, Voltaren is the brand name for a topical NSAID called diclofenac. It’s used to reduce mild to moderate pain in people with arthritis, but it can be used for other aches too. Because diclofenac is used topically rather than consumed orally like Advil, it has a much lower absorption rate, and can be used over the long-term with minimal side effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I’ve got some chronic pain that I’m working on rehabbing, I’ll rub some Voltaren gel in the area about 20 minutes before training. It doesn’t completely eliminate the pain, but it takes the edge off, for sure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary: don’t be afraid to take an NSAID to manage your exercise-related pain for a few days. Follow the instructions on the bottle and only take the recommended daily maximum dose. If you’re still experiencing pain after a few days, stop and address the underlying causes of the pain. This may require modifying your exercise program. Figure out movements that don’t hurt, but still allow you to train. If you still need something to reduce the pain, try a topical NSAID like Voltaren.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/does-ibuprofen-help-or-hurt-your-workouts/\">Does Ibuprofen Help or Hurt Your Workouts?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/l5w9MRpEisI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 22:07:00 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a624b77803781d28c96edd545640c3ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/ADVIL_HEADER.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-21-46-270_80994370316e9bf9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/l5w9MRpEisI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-46-242_19c1d3b030ecefb6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894486318},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:26","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:26","title":"8 Personal Finance Lessons from Benjamin Franklin","link":"http://artofmanliness.com/?p=22781","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22782\" title=\"ben1\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/ben1.jpg\" alt=\"older benjamin franklin in chair reading papers painting \" width=\"425\" height=\"535\"></img></p>\n<p><em>With our archives now 3,500+ articles deep, we’ve decided to republish a classic piece each Friday to help our newer readers discover some of the best, evergreen gems from the past. This article was originally published in February 2012.</em></p>\n<p>Benjamin Franklin rose from 17-year-old runaway to successful printer, newspaperman, author, inventor, diplomat, and statesman. His great success came from living the virtues of frugality and industry, and his life offers us many personal finance lessons that apply to modern men just as much as they did to those living in colonial America. So without further ado, let’s dive right into uncovering some of Ben’s timeless wisdom:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Understand the True Value of Things</strong></h3>\n<p>Benjamin Franklin learned one of his first, and most important, personal finance lessons as a boy. When he was seven, he saw another boy blowing a whistle and was so charmed by its sound that he offered the boy all the money in his pockets for it. The boy eagerly agreed to the deal. Young Franklin was delighted with his new possession and blew the whistle happily all over the house. But his satisfaction was cut short when his brothers and sisters, finding out how much he had paid for it, informed him that he had forked over four times as much money as it was worth. “The reflection gave me more chagrin,” Franklin recalled, “than the whistle gave me pleasure.”</p>\n<p>But as Franklin shared in a letter to a friend, he took an invaluable lesson away from his youthful mistake:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This, however, was afterward of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don’t give too much for the whistle; and I saved my money.</p>\n<p>As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.</p>\n<p>When I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, This man gives too much for his whistle.</p>\n<p>When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect, He pays indeed, said I, too much for his whistle.</p>\n<p>If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth, Poor man, said I, you pay too much for your whistle.</p>\n<p>When I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, Mistaken man, said I, you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle.</p>\n<p>If I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, Alas! say I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle…</p>\n<p>In short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles. </p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>2. Be Self-Sufficient</strong></h3>\n<p>Franklin’s father at first wanted him to go into the ministry, but then decided that the boy would follow in his own footsteps and become a candlemaker. But Franklin did not enjoy that trade, and his father, worried he’d go off to sea, took him around to observe other craftsmen at work, hoping that another trade might spark the young man’s interest. While Franklin did not become a bricklayer or carpenter, this experience did inspire the DIY spirit within him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools. And it has been often useful to me, to have learned so much by it, as to be able to do some trifling jobs in the house, when a workman was not at hand, and to construct little machines for my experiments, at the moment when the intention of making these was warm in my mind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Franklin’s penchant for self-reliance also led him to learn how to make his own meals (using the money saved on boarding costs to buy more books), and perhaps most importantly, it helped propel his career as a printer. At the time, there was no foundry in America that made casting type, which was crucial for the printer’s trade. So instead of purchasing the equipment from England and waiting for it to arrive, Franklin initially crafted his own type — becoming the first person in America to do so — and also made his own woodcuts, printer’s ink, engraved copperplate vignettes, and plate-press.</p>\n<p>As Franklin shared in his autobiography, he believed that learning to be self-sufficient not only saved you money, but led to greater happiness as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. This sum may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. </p></blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. Invest in Yourself</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>From my infancy I was passionately fond of reading, and all the money that came into my hands was laid out in the purchasing of books.</p>\n<p>This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repaired in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allowed myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolics of any kind; and my industry in my business continued as indefatigable as it was necessary. </p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to have more time and money in the long-term, then in the short-term you need to invest some of your money, and a lot of your time, in yourself. Instead of squandering these valuable resources on fleeting pleasures, invest them in things that further your health, relationships, education, and career and will reap rich dividends down the road.</p>\n<p>Franklin invested in himself by becoming a voracious reader; all of his spare money and time went to accumulating as much knowledge about the world as possible; by wisely managing his expenditures in these vital departments of life, Franklin created a future for himself where it was possible for a man who had only a few years of formal education to become a world-renowned writer, scientist, and diplomat.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Surround Yourself with Friends Who Share Your Values</strong></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22785 size-full\" title=\"junto\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/junto.jpg\" alt=\"benjamin franklin junto meeting of men library drawing \" width=\"452\" height=\"324\"></img></p>\n<blockquote><p>For myself, I immediately got into work at Palmer’s, a famous printing-house in Bartholomew Close, where I continued near a year. I was pretty diligent, but I spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings at plays and public amusements. We had nearly consumed all my pistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth. He seemed quite to have forgotten his wife and child, and I by degrees my engagements with Miss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to let her know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of the great <em>errata </em>of my life, which I could wish to correct if I were to live it over again. In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept unable to pay my passage. </p></blockquote>\n<p>When Franklin was still starting out in the printing business and living in London, he palled around with his friend, James Ralph. While Franklin worked hard at a printing house, the flighty Ralph, who had arrived in London without a dollar to his name, half-hardheartedly and unsuccessfully looked for work as an actor, clerk, and journalist, and borrowed money from Franklin to fund his unemployment.</p>\n<p>The two friends later had a falling out, and Ralph never repaid Franklin the 27 pounds (“a great sum out of my small earnings!” Franklin recalled) that he owed him.</p>\n<p>After this experience, Franklin was much more judicious about whom he associated with, and spent his life seeking out men and women who shared his high values and <a title=\"Iron Sharpens Iron: The Power of Master Mind Groups\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/iron-sharpens-iron-the-power-of-master-mind-groups/\">forming mutual self-improvement groups, like the Junto</a>, where he and his friends could challenge each other’s ideas and help elevate each other’s hearts and minds.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Don’t Compromise Your Integrity for Money</strong></h3>\n<p>While Benjamin Franklin had great ambitions to rise in the world, he was unwilling to compromise his integrity in order to do so. For Franklin, the key to being able to choose principles over filthy lucre was to not end up so enslaved to luxury that you become willing to do anything to maintain your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>This is well-illustrated by Franklin’s response to a man who wished to pay to publish a piece in Franklin’s newly established newspaper, <em>The Pennsylvania Gazette:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>I have perused your piece, and find it to be scurrilous and defamatory. To determine whether I should publish it or not, I went home in the evening, purchased a two penny loaf at the baker’s, and with water from the pump made my supper; I then wrapped myself up in my great coat, and laid down on the floor and slept till morning, when, on another loaf and a mug of water, I made my breakfast. From this regimen I feel no inconvenience whatever. Finding I can live in this manner, I have formed a determination never to prostitute my press to the purposes of corruption, and abuse of this kind, for the sake of gaining a more comfortable subsistence. </p></blockquote>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22784\" title=\"printer\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/printer.jpg\" alt=\"young benjamin franklin printer working machine painting \" width=\"398\" height=\"513\"></img></p>\n<h3><strong>6. Steady Diligence Is the Way to Wealth</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of suddenly growing rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty. –From Franklin’s “<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manvotional-young-benjamin-franklins-plan-of-conduct/\">Plan for Future Conduct</a>,” written at age 20</p></blockquote>\n<p>Franklin’s was not an overnight success story; it took him a decade to move from runaway, to apprentice in many printing shops and houses both Stateside and in London (where he did the dirty jobs for superiors who were anything but), to opening his own shop, and turning it into a profitable business. During that time he lived a spartan lifestyle and was far more industrious than any of his competitors.</p>\n<p>Thus he encouraged others to realize their ambitions as he had, with patient, steady efforts, and he did not turn a kind eye to the various “get-rich-quick” schemes that were put forth during his day.</p>\n<p>In one of his “Busy-Body” essays, Franklin went after those who spent their time digging for pirate treasure that had supposedly been left buried along the river, lamenting that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Men, otherwise of very good sense, have been drawn into this practice through an overweening desire of sudden wealth and an easy credulity of what they so earnestly wished might be true; while the rational and most certain methods of acquiring riches by industry and frugality are neglected or forgotten.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Franklin cleverly concluded his essay by quoting the words his imaginary friend “Agricola” offered his son when he gave him a good farm:</p>\n<blockquote><p>‘My son,’ said he, ‘I give thee now a valuable parcel of land; I assure thee I have found a considerable quantity of gold by digging there<em>; </em>thee mayest do the same; but thee must carefully observe this, never to dig more than plow-deep.’</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>7. Time Is Money</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>‘What price the price of that book?’ at length asked a man who had been dawdling for an hour in the front store of Benjamin Franklin’s newspaper establishment. ‘One dollar,’ replied the clerk. ‘One dollar,’ echoed the lounger; ‘can’t you take less than that?’ ‘One dollar is the price,’ was the answer.</p>\n<p>The would-be purchaser looked over the books on sale a while longer, and then inquired: ‘Is Mr. Franklin in?’ ‘Yes,’ said the clerk, ‘he is very busy in the press-room.’ ‘Well, I want to see him,’ persisted the man. The proprietor was called, and the stranger asked: ‘What is the lowest, Mr. Franklin, that you can take for that book?’ ‘One dollar and a quarter,’ was the prompt rejoinder. ‘One dollar and a quarter! Why, your clerk asked me only a dollar just now.’ ‘True,” said Franklin,’ and I could have better afforded to take a dollar than to leave my work.’</p>\n<p>The man seemed surprised; but, wishing to end a parley of his own seeking, he demanded: ‘Well, come now, tell me your lowest price for this book.’ ‘One dollar and a half,’ replied Franklin. ‘A dollar and a half! Why, you offered it yourself for a dollar and a quarter.’ ‘Yes,’ said Franklin coolly, ‘and I could better have taken that price than a dollar and a half now.’</p>\n<p>The man silently laid the money on the counter, took his book, and left the store, having received a salutary lesson from a master in the art of transmuting time, at will, into either wealth or wisdom. –From <em>Pushing to the Front </em>by Orison Swett Marden</p></blockquote>\n<p>Time is money. It was Franklin who first promulgated this famous phrase. These days it’s not terribly fashionable to support this maxim; to some it makes you sound like a capitalistic drudge instead of a passionate adventurer; “Time is not money! It is an opportunity to swim with the dolphins!” Yet Franklin understood that wisely using one’s time was essential to building one’s wealth, and that the more wealth you acquired, the more of your passions you would be free to pursue. By hustling his colonial butt off, Franklin was able to retire from the printing business at age 42, leaving the next half of his life open for doing whatever he wished.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22783\" title=\"bf\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/bf.jpg\" alt=\"benjamin franklin at table with men discussing papers painting\" width=\"498\" height=\"339\"></img></p>\n<h3><strong>8. The Accumulation of Money Is a Means to an End</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>Your sentiments of the general Foible of Mankind, in the pursuit of wealth to no end, are expressed in a manner that gave me great pleasure in reading. They are extremely just; at least they are perfectly agreeable to mine. But London citizens, they say, are ambitious of what they call <em>dying worth</em> a great Sum: The very notion seems to me absurd; and just the same as if a man should run in debt for 1000 Superfluities, to the End that when he should be stript of all, and imprisoned by his Creditors, it might be said he <em>broke worth </em>a great Sum. I imagine that what we have above what we can use is not properly ours<em>, </em>tho’ we possess it, and that the rich Man, who must die<em>, </em>was no more worth what he leaves, than the debtor who must pay.” –From a letter from BF to William Strahan</p></blockquote>\n<p>While someone who is only superficially familiar with Franklin’s biography and his famous maxims might come away with the notion that he was merely a prudish, penny-pinching acquisitive capitalist who thought only of money, nothing could be further from the truth. For Franklin the pursuit of wealth was merely a means to an end. And that end was gaining the “leisure to read, study, make experiments, and converse at large with such ingenious and worthy men, as are pleased to honor me with their friendship or acquaintance, on such points as may produce something for the common benefit of mankind, uninterrupted by the little cares and fatigues of business.” Franklin’s early retirement from the printing business did indeed produce numerous benefits for mankind, including the creation of several new inventions (none of which he patented — improving the lives of others was enough reward), and his service in helping to found a new country.</p>\n<p>For Franklin the whole point of gaining wealth and developing virtue was not to live a life of luxury (although he did enjoy more creature comforts once he was able to) nor to become a moral prude, but to allow oneself to grow into the kind of man who had the character, wisdom, and time to become an involved and upright citizen, able to serve others and one’s country, which, Franklin also believed, was the best way to serve God.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Franklin, who wrote to his mother while he was still in his early forties, that after his death he’d rather have it said of him “<em>he lived useful</em>,” than <em>“he died rich</em>.”</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/personal-finance-lessons-from-benjamin-franklin/\">8 Personal Finance Lessons from Benjamin Franklin</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/bsN8wxgH7GI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:51:48 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/ben1.jpg","linkMd5":"dc49da0fe9001cec0c586f5af2bb5d68","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-45-100_01cc999bd39b4c09.webp","destWidth":539,"destHeight":678,"sourceBytes":48516,"destBytes":38566,"author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/ben1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-45-100_01cc999bd39b4c09.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/junto.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-21-46-542_cafac30572314be5.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/printer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-21-46-447_5aa28b6c25319da9.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/02/bf.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-21-46-296_085c852c855a7eea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/bsN8wxgH7GI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn64@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-46-250_402d73c54c5345a1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894486319},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:26","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:26","title":"Podcast #640: Weird and Wonderful Ways to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=119335","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe title=\"#640: Weird and Wonderful Ways to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/640-weird-and-wonderful-ways-to-get-comfortable-be/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>When people start on a self-development journey, they’ll sometimes create a bucket list — all the things, all the typically exciting and pleasurable things, they hope to do before they die. My guest started his own self-improvement journey very differently, by creating an anti-bucket list consisting of things he didn’t want to do, and embarking on a “year of adversity.”</p>\n<p>His name is <a href=\"https://www.benaldridge.com/overview-1\">Ben Aldridge</a> and he’s the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1786783428?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1786783428\"><em>How to Be Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable: 43 Weird &#38; Wonderful Ways to Build a Strong, Resilient Mindset</em></a>. Ben and I begin our conversation with how his struggle with debilitating panic attacks inspired him to study philosophical and psychological ideas on how to fight back against his anxiety, what he learned that can benefit anyone looking to be more resilient, and how he was particularly inspired by the Stoic idea of intentionally practicing adversity to prepare for adversity. We then talk about the project Ben set for himself of embarking on a year of mental, physical, and skill-based challenges designed to push himself outside his comfort zone, how he decided what kinds of challenges to do, and how doing hard things changed him. From there we get into the specific challenges Ben completed, from taking cold showers to learning Japanese, and what they taught him about self-discipline, facing your fears, and the human potential for growth. We end our conversation with the ways he’s continued to push himself after the year of challenges was through, even in the midst of the pandemic lockdown, including climbing Mt. Everest from inside his house.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>How Stoic philosophy helped Ben get a handle on his anxiety </li>\n<li>What’s an “anti-bucket list”?</li>\n<li>What Ben took from Buddhism for facing fear and dealing with anxiety </li>\n<li>What spurred the idea for Ben’s Year of Adversity and how he crafted the challenges</li>\n<li>Making discomfort a lifestyle </li>\n<li>Ben’s experience with cold showers and how it helped him manage discomfort </li>\n<li>Why Ben took on the challenge of learning Japanese</li>\n<li>Did Ben take anything from sleeping on the floor or a bivvy bag?</li>\n<li>Tips for improving your public speaking</li>\n<li>Climbing “Mt.

To ward off ‘squitos and other annoying bugs, folks typically reach for a store-bought can of repellent and spray themselves in a cloud of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That can certainly do the trick, but you can also avail yourself to more organic alternatives. Homemade insect repellents drawn from the environment have existed for thousands of years, and can be whipped up easily by the modern man as well. Here’s how to fight nature with nature. </span></p>\n<h3>A Few Benefits of Natural Bug Spray (And Does It Actually Work?)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few reasons you might consider concocting your own natural insect repellent:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Smells better. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEET-filled spray has a distinct chemically smell that may be a little nostalgic, but certainly isn’t pleasant. The natural oils used in the DIY variety smell far better. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Isn’t full of chemicals. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEET is the chemical in bug spray that you’ve most likely heard of, and there may be other harmful chemicals present as well, especially in aerosol form. In general, do you want chemicals lingering on your skin, and more than that, absorbing into your body (which some of these chemicals are shown to do)? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Feels better.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Commercial bug sprays always leave me feeling like I’ve been coated in a light film of chemical yuckiness which requires a shower at the end of the night. I hate it. The natural stuff feels much better on the skin; you don’t even notice it after a few minutes. To me, this is actually one of the primary benefits of the DIY route. </span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, all the advantages in the world are meaningless if something doesn’t work. So is natural DIY bug spray actually effective?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, this stuff really does keep bugs away. All the ingredients listed below have been proven to be effective in warding off mosquitoes and other biting bugs, especially lemon eucalyptus oil, which works 95% as well as DEET. DIY spray isn’t perfect, and requires re-spraying every 1-2 hours, but it’s certainly effective enough — along with those other benefits — to make it worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One final note: If you’re worried about disease-carrying insects, using DEET is in fact your best bet. If your primary concern is avoiding itchy and annoying bug bites, go all natural. </span></p>\n<h3>Gathering Your Ingredients + Starting Costs</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-118316 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"natural bug spray ingredients on a table. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/ingredients.jpg 1024w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/ingredients-768x576.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/ingredients-320x240.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/ingredients-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the fact that DIY bug spray is made with things like essential oils and apple cider vinegar, you might think you’re delving into the world of kookie tinctures and earthy granola types. Well, you are. It’s okay — accept it and move on. You can get the ingredients at most natural grocers and/or pharmacies, or Amazon. You might assume Amazon is cheaper, but my local Sprouts was comparable or even less expensive for most of this stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starter costs should be around $25, but you’re using small portions of everything, meaning you’ll likely get a handful of bug seasons from each item. For an 8 oz bottle of the final product, I’d estimate the total cost to be less than $5. </span></p>\n<p><b>Water. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many recipes call for distilled water, which has impurities and minerals removed. If you have it, use it, but it’s not strictly necessary. </span></p>\n<p><b>Essential Oils.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These scent-bomb oils are super concentrated extracts of various flowers, plants, and seeds. Essential oils are extremely potent and almost always paired with a carrier oil or liquid. While there are dozens of varieties available, there are some that are proven to have natural insect-repelling properties, including: </span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon Eucalyptus (definitely use this one, if nothing else) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geranium (for ticks) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosemary </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clove </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cedarwood (for ticks) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lavender </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citronella </span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll use 50-100 drops of a combo of essential oils for an 8 oz bottle. You can use any combination of the above and whatever you have on hand to create a scent that you like. Below, I list out exactly what I used, but don’t consider those to be strict recipes; I figured I’d use a few that have known insect-repelling properties and a couple others that just have a nice smell. You could use just 1-2 oils to make it cheaper or if it’s what you already have on hand. </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/diy-beard-oil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read my article on DIY beard oils</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more on essential oils and carriers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Witch Hazel. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This clear liquid is a distilled extract of the witch hazel plant. It’s not something I’d heard of before diving into the subject of DIY bug repellent, but it’s pretty common in facial products due to its skin-soothing and inflammation-easing properties. It’s also the most common carrier liquid for natural bug sprays because of its inoffensive scent and small amount of alcohol (which bugs don’t like). Other common carriers are apple cider vinegar and vodka. </span></p>\n<p><b>Vegetable Glycerin.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This additive is optional and provides a small amount of moisturizer to the bug spray so that it doesn’t just dry you out. It also helps bind the ingredients together — we are in fact mixing oil and water here. While it’s not perfect, the end product doesn’t separate as much when the glycerin is used. </span></p>\n<p><b>Spray Bottle.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While you could get away with using this homemade product as a rub-on, it’s far more convenient to put it into a spray bottle. They’re cheap, so there’s really no reason not to. </span></p>\n<h3>2 Recipes for DIY Natural Bug Spray</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-118317\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/pouring3-e1598372876536.jpg\" alt=\"essential oil being poured into spray bottle. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\"></img></p>\n<p><b>Witch Hazel Spray</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">½ cup water </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">½ cup witch hazel </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp vegetable glycerin </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 drops geranium oil </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 drops lemon eucalyptus oil </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 drops cedarwood oil </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 drops vanilla oil </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 drops rosemary oil </span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add all ingredients to the spray bottle and shake well to combine. It will separate some, so give it a good shake every time you use it. </span></p>\n<p><b>Apple Cider Vinegar Spray </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the apple cider vinegar is a strong-smelling base ingredient, you don’t need as much essential oil added in. You also have to be a little more careful with your combinations; not everything goes well with the potent scent of apple cider vinegar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason you’d use vinegar over witch hazel is simply a matter of convenience and/or preference. It’s a more common household item, for sure, but also may offend its wearer more than the witch hazel. </span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">½ cup water </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">½ cup apple cider vinegar </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp vegetable glycerin </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 drops lemon eucalyptus oil </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 drops cedarwood oil </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 drops rosemary oil </span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add all ingredients to the spray bottle and shake well to combine.

He was surrounded by berry bushes that were just starting to fill out, and he knew that encountering bears was a possibility, which is exactly why he carried bear spray.</p>\n<p>He saw the bear out of the corner of his eye just before the attack. Zimmerman was mauled before he had a chance to pull the spray out, but during a brief break from the violence, he managed to uncap his spray and deploy it, scaring the bear away. <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/08/03/bear-spray-quite-possibly-saved-his-life-71-year-old-man-survives-brown-bear-attack-in-kodiak/\">Officials say the bear spray saved his life. </a></p>\n<p>While bear attacks aren’t predictable (nor common), the outcome when victims use bear spray is. One study found that spray stopped “undesirable behaviors” in 92% of cases. And among people who carried bear spray, 98% were uninjured after having a close encounter with a bear.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is, bear spray works. But like all tools, it takes practice to use it effectively; you shouldn’t just buy a can, stick it in your pack, and never consider how to use it until a 700-pound grizzly is upon you. </p>\n<p>Bear spray is much like normal pepper spray, but it typically sprays much farther and for a longer period of time. Training to use bear spray is imperative if you’re headed into bear country. Luckily, many of the companies that manufacture bear spray also sell inert training cans, so you can test out their functionality before you hit the trail. One of the things they’ll tell you is to store your bear spray in a hyper-convenient location where you can access it quickly — like holstered on your belt; you don’t want it buried inside your pack when you need it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack-visual-guide/\">Also be sure to read up on our other bear encounter safety tips.</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Like this illustrated guide?

We then unpack the difference between fighting and arguing, and how it’s the latter that’s a lost art, especially in our digital age. From there we discuss each of Aristotle’s three tools of rhetoric — ethos, pathos, and logos — including a dive into how the way your audience sees your character is so important, and how you can even do an ethos analysis of your resume. We then delve into Cicero’s five canons of rhetoric, and Jay shares a smart technique for memorizing a presentation, and thus delivering it more persuasively. We end our conversation with a fun game you can play to sharpen your rhetorical skills. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What is rhetoric?</li>\n<li>The history of sophists and rhetorical studies </li>\n<li>Why did rhetoric stop being taught in school?
