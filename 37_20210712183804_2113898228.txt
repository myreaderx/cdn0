Now continue.</p> <p>Turns out this was added way back in 2017 in Windows 10 build 17093. In fact, Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI) has been around since the dawn of Windows 10 itself!</p> <p>I ran the Windows Security app on my system and noticed a few things. First, at the bottom it says \"Your device meets the requirements for standard hardware security\" but this <strong>can </strong>read \"...for <strong>enhanced </strong>hardware security.\"</p> <p>In order to be considered <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-protection-in-windows-security-afa11526-de57-b1c5-599f-3a4c6a61c5e2\">enhanced</a>, your <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-protection-in-windows-security-afa11526-de57-b1c5-599f-3a4c6a61c5e2\">system needs to support</a>:</p> <ul> <li>TPM 2.0  <li>Secure boot  <li>DEP - Data Execution Prevention  <li>UEFI MAT - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Memory Memory Attributes Table</li></ul> <p>Some of these technologies are quite old and have been in Windows for a while. It's the collection of all them together, working as a team, that enhances your systems security. <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs\">Virtualization-based Security</a> (VBS) isolates a secure region of memory from the rest of the OS.</p> <p>I started digging to understand what was interesting or unique about my system that was preventing me from turning these new features on. Additionally I wanted to make sure I was ready for Windows 11 whenever it arrives and adds more security features and requirements.</p> <p>Go to the Windows Security app and click Device Security.</p> <p><img title=\"Windows Security\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Windows Security\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/3e45947b63b8_B655/image111.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"754\"></p> <p>I clicked on Core Isolation to turn on VBS and noticed that the on/off switch was grayed out and I could scan for driver incompatibilities. I want to ensure that drivers I have loaded into the kernel are secure. Windows 10 has a feature where <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/driver-compatibility-with-device-guard\">drivers can use HVCI</a> but those drivers need to be written in certain ways to ensure they have a clear separation between data and code, and can't load data files as executable, or use dynamic code in the kernel. Again, NONE of this is new and goes back as far as 2015 or earlier.</p><figure><img title=\"Core Isolation\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Core Isolation\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/3e45947b63b8_B655/image_2118fa3f-b920-4ff2-81b7-31cf422c1639.png\" width=\"889\" height=\"482\"></figure>  <p>What do I have installed? Well, friends, a ton of crap, it turns out! LOL. All off these drivers are either super old or are using insecure coding techniques that are preventing my system from turning on the Core Isolation Memory Integrity feature.</p> <p><img title=\"Incompatible Drivers \" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Incompatible Drivers \" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/3e45947b63b8_B655/image_33c85aba-fcb1-44f5-aae8-81ba02bfd186.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"928\"></p> <p>I can start searching for each of these and I see a few interesting culprits. Remember, these are all either old or poorly written drivers that are loaded into the kernel on my desktop machine, chillin'. </p> <p>That Western Digital one? Notice that it evens says \"_prewin8.sys\" so I hope someone from WDC reads this blog and feels just a little bit bad about it. This is from an external USB hard drive. I certainly don't need whatever extra feature that driver lights up. My USB Hard drive is just fine without it.</p> <p>The STT*.sys and S3x*.sys drivers are all from various Arduino COM Port utilities and DFU-util firmware flashers. Remember those unsigned warnings you thought nothing of years ago?

width=\"400\" align=\"right\" height=\"364\">There's something happening in the E Ink space, somewhat quietly, but consistently. It's going to be interesting to see if it's a fad or if E Ink tablets are here to stay. I love my <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3cEz8So\">Amazon Kindle</a> and I love its E Ink display. I'd say 90% of my reading in the last 5 years has been on a Kindle with E Ink. They are bright in direct sunlight, and the <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3pQFJ1s\">newer ones</a> have color temperature settings. The starter <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3pQNHHP\">Kindle is about $90</a> and you'll often find sales.</p> <p>For mostly static content like books or magazines, E Ink is an amazing paper-like technology. We seem to be putting a huge amount of technology and work into creating displays to replace paper. First the look, and most recently the <em>feel </em>of writing on paper. These one page digital devices promise to act as Infinite Paper.</p> <p>E Ink is easier on the eyes than OLED and iPads and the like. How does it work? The simple explanation is that there's tiny capsules of negatively charged black pigment and positively charged white pigment. We can apply negative or positive charge and the black or the white pigments will jump to the top. It's kind of like an <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~Etch a Sketch\">Etch a Sketch</a>, except with electricity rather than a surface covered in aluminum powder. These displays are as close to paper as you can get, today, digitally.</p> <p> <center> <div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJWwlXS_cTM\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></center> <p>This week I did a <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJWwlXS_cTM\">LIVE Review of three really interesting \"E Ink\" tablets</a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJWwlXS_cTM\">on my YouTube</a>.</p> <ul> <li> <div align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2\">The reMarkable 2</a> - This is the second-gen reMarkable. It's a dedicated and distraction-free note taker. It has no browser, no apps to speak of, but an enthusiastic community of hackers and <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable\">3rd party projects</a>. This device is NOT an iPad and if your first thought is, \"but I have an iPad\" then this isn't for you. However, if you like Moleskine notebooks and have filled many a year and your shelves are filled with many years' worth, then take a good look. This 10.3 inch unlit screen is the best device for taking notes, reading PDFs, and...taking notes. It's incredibly well built, feels high quality, is light but substantial, it doesn't warp or feel cheap. If you pair it with a their Marker Plus that includes an eraser, the feeling is top notch. It has a great Desktop App that also has a Beta \"Live View\" feature where you can share your screen in Teams or Zoom and see what you're writing on your reMarkable. There's so much potential here if they'd open up the APIs and integrate into things like OneNote, Teams, etc. I'd love to see someone be able to connect two of these and write as a shared whiteboard!\n<br>-&#160; One small downer, I did drop a Marker and it landed <em>just right </em>and broke off not just the tip (no big deal, it comes with a dozen replacements) but also the tiny hole the tip goes into (not replaceable). So, treat the pens with reverence. </div> <li> <div align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/2Tmlrkd\">Onyx Boox Note Air</a> - This could pass for the reMarkable from a distance, but it's actually an Android 10 devices that can have Google Play added. Also 10.3\" and E Ink but adds a backlight, this hybrid device is a note taker and PDF viewer until you are suddenly installing Microsoft Office or Netflix. The surreal part is that what the device <em>thinks </em>its displaying doesn't always jive with what is being displayed. For example, it's a black and white device, so some shading and subtleties are lost...but they are there, in video memory. That means you can easily share this Android Device's screen to your TV or monitor and it's...Android! There is some ghosting which is a feature, not a bug, but the Onyx Boox Note Air has a surprisingly large array of basically \"ghosting display choices\" that allow you to select the right balance between ghosting and eventual consistency. It takes a moment to figure out but it's quite good when dialed in. Combine the Note Air with a Bluetooth Keyboard and you've got an E Ink Word Processor. If you have $500 and can't decide between a reMarkable and a Boox Note Air, it comes down to the fact that the Note Air is Android. You're getting more functionality, if slightly less software policy. As a note taker, the polish of the reMarkable 2 is the winner. But the Note Air is the best general purpose E Ink Tablet.</div> <ul> <li> <div align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.boox.com/nova3color\"><img title=\"Boox Nova3 Color\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 4px; display: inline\" alt=\"Boox Nova3 Color\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/de98c62542df_14044/novacolor_c3fb5a8c-0c42-4d1a-8da6-cdc8be816a25.png\" width=\"277\" align=\"right\" height=\"390\">Onyx Boox Nova3 Color</a> - This device is just 7.8\" but has a color Kaleido Plus E Ink screen.

It's not a rich deep marker type color, it's a muted older comic book type color...but it works. It adds something, and reading comics on it in Comixology is magical, albeit with some ghosting. This device is also Android so consider it a 2 inch smaller version of the Note Air. It's the \"color iPad Mini\" to the Note Air's \"black and white iPad Pro.\"\n<br></div></li></ul></li></ul> <p align=\"left\"><img title=\"reMarkable 2\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"reMarkable 2\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/de98c62542df_14044/Press-render-Hero-wide-transparent_fdebab4e-75cb-4539-b2eb-cb9385477290.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"586\"></p> <p align=\"left\">Later this month I'll take a look at <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.supernote.com/#/\">Supernote</a> which already has a enthusiastic community and promises to have a rich API for 3rd parties to explore and expand.</p> <p>E Ink and \"E Paper\" are becoming more prominent on sites like Kickstarter and IndieGogo.

Experiments in self-contained native executables in .NET","link":"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/post/7ea75eed-957d-4dc7-9db8-57bc4e9242c6","description":"<div><p>One of the best parts of the .NET ecosystem is the excitement around experimentation. Someone is always taking .NET to the next level, trying new things, pushing the envelope. </p> <p>Michal Strehovsky has an interesting experiment on his GitHub called \"<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/bflat\">bflat</a>.\" This is not a product, it's a playground.</p> <blockquote> <p>bflat is a concoction of Roslyn - the \"official\" C# compiler that produces .NET executables - and NativeAOT (née CoreRT) - the experimental ahead of time compiler for .NET based on CoreCLR's crossgen2. Thanks to this, you get access to the latest C# features using the high performance CoreCLR GC and native code generator (RyuJIT).  <p>bflat merges the two components together into a single ahead of time crosscompiler and runtime for C#.</p></blockquote> <p>I find this characterization funny:</p> <blockquote> <p>bflat is to dotnet as VS Code is to VS.</p></blockquote> <p>Michal is basically stripping .NET down to the bare minimum and combining the official compiler and and the experimental AOT (Ahead of Time) compiler to make single small EXEs that are totally self-contained. </p> <p>Michal says you can get involved if you like! </p> <blockquote> <p>If you think bflat is useful, you can leave me a tip in my <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://paypal.me/MichalStrehovsky\">tip jar</a> and include your GitHub user name in a note so that I can give you access to a private repo when I'm ready.</p></blockquote> <p>Hello World today is about 2 megs. He says it's because:</p> <blockquote> <p>By default, bflat produces executables that are between 2 MB and 3 MB in size, even for the simplest apps. There are multiple reasons for this:  <ul> <li>bflat includes stack trace data about all compiled methods so that it can print pretty exception stack traces  <li>even the simplest apps might end up calling into reflection (to e.g. get the name of the <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> class), globalization, etc.  <li>method bodies are aligned at 16-byte boundaries to optimize CPU cache line utilization  <li>(Doesn't apply to Windows) DWARF debug information is included in the executable</li></ul></blockquote> <p>So when I ran <code>bflat build</code>, here was my output.</p> <p><img title=\"2.8 meg hello world\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"2.8 meg hello world\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/56beca63b502_129FE/image_d7c11d7a-3f1a-4279-92bb-7b863790827d.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"159\"></p> <p>But when I run </p><pre>bflat.exe build --no-reflection --no-stacktrace-data --no-globalization --no-exception-messages .\\hello.cs</pre>\n<p>I end up with a 750kb file!</p>\n<p><img title=\"750kb Hello World\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"750kb Hello World\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/56beca63b502_129FE/image_ddcff8cb-8c0c-4edf-8b56-c1aac853fe64.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"160\"></p>\n<p>Sure, it's not C code because it'll never be C code. You get access to a LOT MORE with C#.</p>\n<p>This could be a useful system for creating tiny apps in C# for Linux or Windows command line administration. It also showcases how the open pieces of .NET can be plugged together differently to achieve interesting results. </p>\n<p>I'm sure there's lot of AOT limitations around Reflection, Attributes, and more, but this is still a very cool experiment, go check it out at <a title=\"https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/bflat\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/bflat\">https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/bflat</a>! \n<hr>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Pluralsight helps teams build better tech skills through expert-led, hands-on practice and clear development paths.
