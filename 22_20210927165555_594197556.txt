They were part of an SPD coalition that began in the later 1990s under chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The parties have &#34;different objectives&#34; but there is &#34;a lot of overlaps&#34; in specific policy areas, Scholz previously said, <a

minimum wage to €12 ($14) per hour, increasing renewable energies, and making Germany a hub for the development of electric vehicles, per Politico.</p><p>The Green party has promised to cut greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030, significantly more aggressive than existing targets of 55% by that date, per Deutsche Welle. </p><p>The two parties might disagree in some areas of foreign policy, especially when it comes to the country&#39;s approach to Russia and China.</p><p>The Greens are likely to be staunchly opposed to cooperation on the grounds of human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, <a

that the party had little in common with the other two parties, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-traffic-light-coalition-seen-most-likely-2021-09-27/\">per Reuters</a>. </p><p>The

They want Democrats to address it on their own, and the Democrats reject that because both parties racked up the federal debt.</p><p>If that sounds familiar, you already know a fair deal about the &#34;debt ceiling.&#34; If it doesn&#39;t, you don&#39;t know that every so often, Congress has to ask itself permission to pay America&#39;s bills, and roughly half of it usually doesn&#39;t want to. That&#39;s the &#34;ceiling&#34; that has to be raised.</p><p>In other words, each party is waiting for the other to blink first.</p><p>Experts say a federal default could cause upheaval that reverberates through the economy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephzeballos/status/1439969190413230087?s=20\">in the form</a> of job losses, abrupt cuts to Social Security payments, and American troops missing out on scheduled paychecks. </p><h2>Behind America&#39;s ever-growing debt pile</h2><p>The federal government relies on debt. It regularly spends more than it raises in taxes. To cover that cost, the Treasury Department borrows cash by auctioning bonds. That&#39;s why the government&#39;s debt pile exceeds $28 trillion.</p><p>The debt ceiling was introduced in 1917 to encourage the government to slow its borrowing. Reaching the limit forces one of two outcomes. Congress could raise the ceiling or temporarily suspend it and punt the problem into the future. Or the government could default on its debt.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, the government has raised it 57 times. It&#39;s not hard to understand why. Defaulting on government debt could drag the country into an economic recession. Spending on critical programs would freeze. The dollar&#39;s strength would likely plummet. And financial markets would slide into uncharted territory as investors brace for an unprecedented economic catastrophe.</p><p>There&#39;s an even greater risk. The dollar is the world&#39;s reserve currency, meaning other governments depend on it holding its worth. A default on US government debt would dramatically shake that confidence. The dollar&#39;s value could plummet as the world financial system prices in a dollar that isn&#39;t reliable - or seeks an alternative.</p><p>The US has avoided this for as long as the debt ceiling has existed, but as it has steadily climbed higher, it&#39;s served more as a political weapon than a true threshold. Democrats and Republicans have both sparred over raising the ceiling, and their latest spat is no different.</p><h2>The latest battle over borrowing</h2><p>McConnell has repeatedly said Senate Republicans won&#39;t vote to lift the limit, adding on Monday that &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-vote-default-debt-ceiling-government-funding-shutdown-pelosi-schumer-2021-9\">Democrats do not need our help</a>.&#34; It&#39;s reminiscent of a 2011 showdown between House Republicans and the Obama administration that prompted tumult in financial markets and led to the first downgrade of the nation&#39;s credit rating.</p><p>Other Republican lawmakers have said that raising the ceiling would open the door for Democrats to pass their $3.5 trillion spending plan.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have said Republicans are more to blame for the debt issue. Raising the debt limit is also about dealing with past spending both parties racked up during the Trump administration, they said.</p><p>Under President Donald Trump, GOP lawmakers drove the deficit sharply higher with their 2017 tax cuts and early COVID-19 rescue package by nearly $8 trillion. Lifting the limit, Democrats say, lets the government pay the bills for those policies.</p><p>Pelosi and Schumer hope to pass legislation that will fund the government through December, but that&#39;s perhaps a choice they shouldn&#39;t have to make.</p><p>Eliminating the limit is the &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-debt-ceiling-box-dynamite-recession-jpmorgan-treasury-biden-mcconnell-2021-9\">obvious solution</a>&#34; to avoiding periodic debt scares, David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said in a recent note. There&#39;s no evidence that the ceiling slows the growth of government debt, the very task it was created for in the first place.

2019</a>, to replace layaway. Instead of having stores hold items from late August through mid-December while customers make payments until paid in full, shoppers can now take the item home immediately and pay it off with Affirm.</p><p>Unlike layaway, purchases made with Affirm may charge customers interest. Although Affirm does not charge any hidden or late fees for using its services, customers can have an APR rate on purchases of 10-30% depending on their credit and 0% for select promotional items on Walmart.com.</p><p>Not all Walmart customers may be eligible to use Affirm depending on their prequalification status.

Customers will purchase the item immediately, and pay for the items over a three to 24 month period. Customers can select their own payment plan and Affirm will match them with a lender who will provide them with a loan for the financed item.</p><p>Walmart shoppers can return any purchases made with Affirm for a refund, but the amount they paid in interest will not be refunded. Partial payments or late payments may impact a consumer&#39;s credit score or ability to receive new loans with the company, according to Affirm.</p><p>Some Walmart customers expressed concern on social media, worried about how families would be able to purchase gifts for the holiday season if they don&#39;t qualify for Affirm.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-THEE STEP MUVA  (@Stepmuvalex) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1441782692455010306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#34;Walmart took away layaway and replaced it with Affirm, which checks credit… right before Christmas,&#34;

Brown heads the Senate Banking Committee. </p><p>Wyden said the plan would ensure six months of benefits and coverage for part-time workers and improve the administration of aging state unemployment programs. The bill would compel state online filing systems to be available around the clock and be accessible for non-English speakers, among other fixes. It also intends to prevent states from cutting the length of unemployment benefits, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/states-cutting-jobless-benefits-hadnt-adequately-prepared-for-recession\">as many did</a> after the Great Recession.</p><p>&#34;Senator Wyden&#39;s bill offers Democrats a way to make a down payment on long overdue fixes to the unemployment system,&#34; Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow and jobless-policy expert at the left-leaning Century Foundation, said in a statement to Insider.</p><p>Bennet, Brown, and Wyden want the measure to form part of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/whats-in-democrats-35-trillion-infrastructure-economic-plan-2021-9\">the Democratic $3.5 trillion spending plan</a> that&#39;s moving through Congress. It is not clear whether the provisions will garner unanimous support from all 50 Senate Democrats needed to clear the party-line reconciliation process.</p><p>Wyden has long pushed to overhaul how states manage their unemployment programs after many melted down at the onset of the pandemic. Millions of out-of-work Americans <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/unemployment-filing-failures-new-survey-confirms-that-millions-of-jobless-were-unable-to-file-an-unemployment-insurance-claim/\">reported delays</a> in receiving checks, with many jamming phone lines or lining up at state offices in frantic efforts to secure government assistance.</p><p>Last year, Congress approved several measures to beef up unemployment checks, with $600 per week from March 2020 through July 2020. After a lapse, lawmakers authorized $300 weekly federal benefits from December 2020 until September 6, along with extending eligibility to gig workers and long-term unemployed people. </p><p>Those federal initiatives <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unemployment-benefits-system-broken-pandemic-congress-2021-9\">expired</a> on Labor Day, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pelhamprog/status/1441026454146453510?s=20\">cutting off at least 8.5 million people</a> from all jobless aid.</p><p>&#34;After abruptly ending pandemic extended benefits amidst the Delta surge, the least Congress can do is make sure jobless workers get at least 26 weeks of benefits regardless of where they live and lose their job,&#34;

The Port of Los Angeles did not follow suit, choosing instead to maintain its existing hours. </p><p>The traditional routine at the ports includes two shifts for longshore workers: 8 a. to 4 pm and 6 pm to 3 am. The ports are closed on Sundays. Overnight shifts and Saturdays are more expensive and rarely used, The Journal reported. </p><h2>Longer hours may not be enough.</h2><p>Gene Seroka, executive director of Port Los Angeles, said longer hours do little to address the backlog when truckers and warehouse operators have not similarly extended their hours. It&#39;s not optimal for truckers to pick up loads at night, especially when they&#39;d have to find alternative places to store the goods when the warehouses are not open at night.</p><p>What&#39;s more, many warehouses near the West Coast don&#39;t have space for the goods. About 98% of warehouses in Southern California&#39;s logistics-heavy Inland Empire region are fully occupied, while the entire Western U.S. has a 3.6% vacancy rate, Jason Tolliver, an executive at real-estate firm <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CWK\">Cushman &#38; Wakefield</a> told The Journal.</p><p>&#34;It has been nearly impossible to get everyone on the same page towards 24/7 operations,&#34; Seroka said.</p><h2>Shortages of workers and equipment exacerbate delays</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/restaurant-prices-labor-shortage-worker-wages-food-2021-6\">struggle to hire enough workers</a> has had a tremendous impact on the transportation industry nationwide, causing headaches at ports, warehouses, railways, and trucking. Many companies have fewer workers than before the pandemic but face significantly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/graphics-highlight-record-backlog-of-cargo-ships-in-california-2021-9\">more work</a> due to the boom in demand for goods since the pandemic started.</p><p>The shipping delays have made it more difficult for truckers to meet their deadlines and stay on schedule when it comes to picking up goods at ports. </p><p>The backlog has also caused a shortage of containers and the chassis needed to haul them. Containers wait for extended periods in ports, and it takes about twice as much time for operators to return the chassis, the Journal said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61420e042db0850019a98db9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Port workers\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Associated Press</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Some cargo companies have even taken to storing their goods in the containers due to the lack of space at warehouses - as shipping containers represent a cheaper option than renting storage space.

page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The island of Persin is a bird-watcher&#39;s paradise. Set on the Danube River, which divides Bulgaria and Romania, it&#39;s a nature park covered in wetlands and home to hundreds of rare bird species: the spoonbill, the pygmy cormorant, the corncrake, as well as herons, eagles, storks, and pelicans. </p><p>Amid the natural beauty, it&#39;s jarring to consider that this was the location of a concentration camp where thousands of Bulgarian political prisoners were brutalized and killed from 1949 to 1953 - and in some cases for years after that. Though it&#39;s officially known as Belene after the quiet Bulgarian village that sits 750 feet away on the mainland, old-timers here call it by another name: the Island of Death.</p><p>My stepgrandfather, Georgi Tutunjiev, was sent here at age 24 and spent four years and three months interred at Belene after someone (he suspected his ex-wife) told the authorities of his plan to escape the country. In his notebooks - he had planned to write a memoir about Belene but never did before he died in 2011 at 87 - he remembered the place as &#34;brutal facilities for re-education,&#34; where he&#39;d endured &#34;indescribable physical and psychological abuse.&#34; He finally managed to escape Bulgaria in 1966 and settle with my grandma in California. </p><p>In 1989, my parents and I left Bulgaria and joined my grandparents in California, thanks to the family-reunification policy. While many survivors of trauma shut down, my grandfather never <em>stopped</em> talking about the gulag. He seemed to have an unending loop of stories about Belene. For my immediate family, it could be exhausting, and we were alarmed to discover his extensive gun collection, which my grandmother gamely dismissed as a coping mechanism. But guests who came to the house were often riveted by his dark tales, which he mixed with his sense of humor. &#34;Jeko! <em>The Communistie</em> shot you!&#34; he&#39;d shout at his terrier mix, and the dog would sprawl on his back, playing dead.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614b7386de0e7b00194bd3a3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A green island is seen off the banks of a small town.\" height=\"1118\" width=\"1988\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An aerial view of Persin island. The gulag was known as Belene, after the nearby town.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tsvetomir Nikolaev</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I&#39;ve come to the town of Belene on a brutally hot day in August for a tour of the Island of Death. I meet Nedyalka Toncheva, who works for the Belene Island Foundation, a nonprofit that organizes tours of the island, close to the bank of the Danube.</p><p>We cross a rickety water bridge on foot and then jump aboard a Jeep driven by a 24-year-old Belene native named Peter. Toncheva, who is 35, is passionate and knowledgeable about the island&#39;s flora and fauna. Every few minutes, she tells Peter to stop the car to point out a roosting stork or a water eagle. She talks about her plans to make Persin a tourist destination comparable to Borovets, a ski resort with luxury hotels in the Rila mountains; or Koprivchitsa, a living museum honoring the Bulgarian rebels who mounted an uprising in 1876 against the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>In the three decades since the fall of communism, Bulgaria has effectively buried the history of its many gulags, which operated mostly in the 1950s during the early, and most violent, days of Communist rule in the country<strong>.</strong> In Belene itself, many lower-level guards came from the village and a former mayor was also the gulag&#39;s first superintendent. It&#39;s not surprising that the village doesn&#39;t advertise its history.</p><p>After 1989, survivors who had been forced to sign documents promising to never talk about the camps started speaking out. For a brief time, they became the subjects of documentaries and newspaper profiles. But soon, the consensus was that it was better to move on. An interior minister tasked with investigating the camps instead secretly ordered a purge of thousands of pages of documents - 40% of the government record. </p><p>While Bulgaria&#39;s defeat of the Ottomans is central to the national identity, and much is made of the fact that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-bulgaria-saved-its-jews-from-nazi-concentration-camps/2013/05/08/e866bdda-8cb1-11e2-9838-d62f083ba93f_story.html\">Bulgaria saved its Jews</a> during the Holocaust, the memory of the Communist era is more fraught. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614ce14c4c42bc00190fa6b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A headshot of a man in a suit and tie.\" height=\"726\" width=\"592\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Georgi Tutunjiev, the author&#39;s grandfather, in around 1977.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tana Ganeva</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Peculiar for a tour, most of our stops lead us to what&#39;s <em>not</em> left of the camp. The shacks where prisoners slept have been razed - there&#39;s no trace of them.</p><p>At the entrance, in what is now an open field, an inscription says, &#34;To be human is to have dignity.&#34; From inside the camp - what would have been visible to the internees - the engraving says, &#34;If the enemy doesn&#39;t surrender, he is destroyed.&#34; But no one I&#39;ve talked to knows whether it&#39;s the original or has been recreated. </p><p>There are a few abandoned, falling-apart buildings, but those were built in 1959, six years after the camp&#39;s official (but not real) closing, when it was converted into a prison, in part to kill rumors that it had operated as a secret gulag. Todor Zhivkov, the Communist premier who took power in 1954 and stayed on until 1989, reopened it in the 1980s to detain Muslims who refused to take on Slavic names in place of their own - a disastrous bid to assimilate <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-muslims/cracks-show-in-bulgarias-muslim-ethnic-model-idUSTRE55001C20090601\">them</a>. </p><p>I ask Toncheva whether there&#39;s a list of everyone who was held in the camp. I&#39;m thinking of my grandfather and wondering whether there&#39;s any documentation. She tells me everyone who comes here for the camp asks the same question.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s no way to know, no list,&#34; Toncheva says, apologetic. &#34;There&#39;s almost no proof the camp even existed.&#34;</p><h2><strong>&#39;Perfectly calculated by Satan himself&#39;</strong></h2><p>The first contingent of 300 men arrived at the Belene camp in the summer of 1949, five years after the 1944 Communist coup. My grandfather, then 24, arrived that first winter. A camp for women was founded on an adjacent island soon after.</p><p>It was modeled after Josef Stalin&#39;s gulags in Siberia. Most of the prisoners had been dragged from their homes by the military police and sent here without trial. (Estimates vary, but 20,000 to 40,000 people were thought to be murdered by the Bulgarian Communist Party.) Even Stalin eventually warned <a href=\"http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/1524/1/U120848.pdf\">them</a> to scale down the killing of prominent oppositional figures or risk creating martyrs.</p><p>The first wave of prisoners had to hack through the unpopulated island and build small shacks that were so crowded the prisoners didn&#39;t have room to lie down. In his history of the camp, Borislav Skotchev wrote that the island was dotted with towers manned by guards with machine guns. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614e3b01b414c100186263ab?format=jpeg\" alt=\"An older man holds a bouquet of flowers.\" height=\"2662\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A survivor of Belene during a commemoration ceremony in 2015.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The men held here included the former leader of the Social Democrats, Orthodox priests (many in their 70s), and the mayor of Bulgaria&#39;s capital, Sofia. Tsveti Ivanov, the editor of the newspaper Svoboden Narod, or Free People, was sent to Belene after serving 10 months in prison. He was beaten so brutally that he got tetanus from his wounds and died in the compound. </p><p>Much of what we know about the place comes from survivors&#39; memoirs. They were fed a thin soup, sometimes with a handful of beans thrown in. Their bread ration - moldy or stale when it made its way to them - was small, and could be withheld by the guards as punishment. Sometimes they got tea. My grandfather told me that, in the winter, both the soup and the tea were given to them already frozen.</p><p>When Toncheva takes us on a brief walk to go look at storks, the ground gives off wet heat, and brambles and thorns claw at us, as if the island is alive and doesn&#39;t want us there. I think of the people who had to work days and nights, in sweltering summers, devoured by mosquitoes. It&#39;s unbelievable that anyone survived.</p><p>An internal CIA document described the grim situation of starving prisoners. &#34;A frequent sight is that of a prisoner eating raw green leaves and roots,&#34; it said. &#34;To be caught doing this, however, would result in 10 days in detention in a dungeon for such an offense.&#34; The lucky ones got packages from family, though those were often taken by guards. Many had little choice but to choke down the rotting carcasses of wild cats, killed and skinned for their fur by the villagers, or pick through horse dung for undigested barley. According to a CIA information report from March 13, 1952, during one brutal winter 30 prisoners died of cold or starvation.</p><p>&#34;It was an Inferno circle, perfectly calculated by Satan himself,&#34; Liliana Pirinchiva, one of the female survivors of Belene, wrote in her memoir. &#34;We were reduced to skeletons.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614b7479de0e7b00194bd42a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A black-and-white photo of a group of people posing together.\" height=\"1245\" width=\"1780\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A group of Bulgarian anarchists.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tsvetana Dzhermanova</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Then there were the guards, who brought an especially sadistic approach to their work. Some would chase packs of prisoners on horseback, letting their rifles off &#34;as if we were a flock of sheep,&#34; wrote Stefan Botchev, a survivor. When he got a severe case of scabies, the mites burrowing into his skin, he was locked up in a shed alone because the guards didn&#39;t want him to infect the cows. He recalled seeing a beating so severe that a prisoner&#39;s spine was broken, turning him into a &#34;reptile crawling on the ground.&#34;</p><p>Kouni Genchev Kounev, the chairman of the Bulgarian Youth Agrarian Union who also survived Belene, recalled one especially brutal punishment, in which the guards would pull back a prisoner&#39;s head and strike him in the trachea. They called it the &#34;sword stroke.&#34;</p><p>Years later, Krum Horozov, a survivor, would draw water colors of the camp from memory - it&#39;s virtually the only visual documentation that exists. In 2011, six years before his death, Horozov wrote: &#34;And when we die, which will be soon, who will remember what happened on that island in the 1950s, and will they know that people were sent there without a trial and sentence?&#34;</p><p>Lilia Topouzova, a historian in Toronto who writes about the history and the memory of the camps, recalls meeting Horozov at an academic conference; he was trying to give away copies of his drawings of Belene to university students, but they avoided him as if he were a pesky street vendor.</p><h2><strong>The Cricket</strong></h2><p>At 93, Tsvetana Dzhermanova is the last known survivor of the women&#39;s camp, which was known as Shturets, or Cricket. We&#39;re sitting outside her home in the mountain village of Leskovets, and she&#39;s talking so fast I wonder how she manages to breathe.</p><p>She smiles and laughs a lot, and she reminds me of my grandfather, who also spoke with the speed of a motorboat, frantic to tell his story.</p><p>&#34;I promised to outlive the Communistie<em>,</em> and here I am!&#34; she boasts. (My grandfather also took an understandable delight at outliving the Communistie. &#34;I survived the Communistie, but I won&#39;t survive old age,&#34; he once told me, when I was 25 and had no idea about either.)  </p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614b73a9c2c9630018f5d4c1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A crumpled, black and white portrait of a woman.\" height=\"1080\" width=\"824\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tsvetana Dzhermanova.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tsvetana Dzhermanova</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Dzhermanova was an anarchist in the 1950s, and still is today. &#34;That&#39;s my personal ideology,&#34; she says. &#34;I&#39;m not sure humans are evolved enough to make either anarchism or socialism work the way they should, but for me, anarchism is it. Because I value freedom, family, friendship, and love.&#34;</p><p>When she first heard about anarchism as a teenager, she asked her mother what it meant. &#34;Anarchists are the people <em>all</em> regimes persecute,&#34; her mother had replied. That sold her. Dzhermanova joined a village group. She had no designs on power (detesting it) and mostly spent her time reading anarchist literature and working on a community vegetable garden. She estimates that 800 anarchists from the town were swept up in a night and sent to the gulags.</p><p>&#34;We sang songs while we worked,&#34; Dzhermanova tells me. &#34;That helped.&#34; </p><p>Last spring the sprightly nonagenarian made the three-hour trip to Belene to speak with a group of students about the camps. &#34;They had no idea about this. They were really surprised,&#34; she says. &#34;No one had ever talked to them about it, and they don&#39;t learn about it in school.&#34;</p><h2><strong>&#39;Out of Fashion&#39;</strong></h2><p>Toncheva and our driver, Peter, walk through a falling-down building that was constructed in 1959, in part to hide evidence of the camp. It&#39;s covered in bird shit. Plant life is taking over its rotted remnants, and old decayed furniture has been abandoned here and there. We talk about how nobody talks about the camp.</p><p>Peter tells us that despite having spent almost his entire life roughly 750 feet from Persin, in Belene village, he learned about the camp only two weeks earlier, when Toncheva hired him as a driver for her tours.</p><p>&#34;To think they only gave them bread and water, and made them work so hard,&#34; he says, shaking his head in disbelief.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614e4296b414c10018626724?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A staircase is seen, with chipping paint.\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A crumbling building built on the site of Belene.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Stoyan Nenov/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>As far as Toncheva knows, no one from her family was held here, but she remembers asking her grandmother about the island when she was a teenager and again after reading the memoirs of survivors. &#34;Shhh. Don&#39;t talk so much about this,&#34; her grandmother would say. &#34;You don&#39;t want to bring trouble.&#34;</p><p>There are rumors of a mass grave near Persin. Mikhail Mikailev, the head of the Belene Island Foundation, wants to find it. But money for the equipment required to find and dig up the remains eludes this two-person staff.</p><p>Unlike Peter and Toncheva, my parents, who were born in the mid-1950s and grew up in Bulgaria, tell me that in the 1970s and 1980s, all their friends in Sofia knew about Belene. &#34;We all heard the stories,&#34; my mother says.</p><p>But for the authorities, maintaining official denial was worth murder.</p><p>In 1969, the celebrated Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov defected to the West, where he wrote about the regime&#39;s abuses. In one essay, Markov described traveling on a boat down the Danube and approaching Belene. &#34;I remembered how, feet dangling over the edge of the boat, a youth with a guitar once sang a strange song: Danube, white river, how quiet you flow / Danube, black river, what anguish you know.&#34;</p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614b7452c2c9630018f5d545?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A canoe is seen on calm waters at the banks of a lush stretch of land.\" height=\"1096\" width=\"1654\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A view of Persin island.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tsvetomir Nikolaev</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>On a rainy afternoon in London, a man <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/world/europe/bulgaria-prosecutor-closes-case-on-assassinated-defector.html\">jabbed the tip of his umbrella</a> into Markov&#39;s leg. Later, Markov noticed what looked like a small bug bite but didn&#39;t think much of it. A few days later he was dead, most likely poisoned by the Bulgarian secret service.</p><p>Before my visit to Belene, I met Topouzova, the historian, over Zoom to talk about the erasure of the camps in Bulgaria&#39;s consciousness. While former generals wrote best-sellers, the owner of a prominent bookstore dismissed any interest in survivors&#39; memoirs - they were &#34;out of fashion,&#34; he had told her.</p><p>It was gaslighting in its purest form. And it showed how we&#39;re all so prone to the &#34;just world&#34; fallacy, a phenomenon where if something is too horribly unjust, the human brain just kind of moves on. It&#39;s not all that hard to bury inconvenient truths.</p><p>&#34;It turned out that aging men and women with fragmented memories of bygone violence did not make for the faces of change,&#34; Topouzova wrote in a recent paper titled &#34;On Silence and History&#34; for the American Historical Association. &#34;The interned were rendered nonexistent - their experiences and memories fated to vanish along with the files.&#34; </p><h2><strong>A pile of stones</strong></h2><p>Nations define themselves by their monuments. The memorial in downtown Manhattan demands that we never forget the victims of 9/11. In the past few years, American activists have torn Confederate statues from their perches, signaling a break with the passive acceptance of the history of slavery. </p><p>Yet grappling with unpleasant history isn&#39;t easy. It was only in 2018 when a <a href=\"https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/memorial\">museum honoring the Black victims of lynching</a> opened in Alabama. The 1619 Project, which posits that the history of the United States is rooted in slavery, has spurred a massive backlash. School districts have <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/martin-luther-king-jr-rosa-parks-books-among-those-banned-penn-school-district-1630953\">banned</a> children&#39;s books about Rosa Parks. Vaunted democracies are as likely to try to bury inconvenient truths as former communist states.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614e44542fb46b0019be19f9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Three men face a wall of photos.\" height=\"2152\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>At an exhibition in Sofia in 2009, Belene survivors look at images of the gulag&#39;s victims.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Stoyan Nenov/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In Bulgaria, there are monuments everywhere. From the smallest village to Sofia, the heroes of Bulgaria&#39;s uprising against the Ottoman Empire are eternalized in stone. In Plovdiv, a giant sculpture overlooks Bulgaria&#39;s second-largest city that honors &#34;Alyosha,&#34; an everyman Soviet soldier who helped &#34;liberate&#34; Bulgaria in the 1940s - even though many Bulgarians see that period as Soviet imperialism, much like the Ottoman Empire&#39;s 500 years of occupation.</p><p>The victims of Belene and the other camps have no such honor. The Belene foundation does the best it can. They helped organize an art exhibit, where Korozov&#39;s pencil drawings were tacked onto the walls of the decaying structures that had been erected to mask evidence of the gulag.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614b7f90c2c9630018f5d96a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A man stands a row of photos in front of a monument\" height=\"2220\" width=\"3828\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A man places photos of famous victims of Soviet policy in front of the Monument to the Soviet Army in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2014.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hristo Vladev/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>There is one modest monument on the island. It&#39;s an abstract stone structure, and you&#39;d have no idea what it was if you didn&#39;t already know the history. The original idea was to build a monument that listed the names of all the known internees, something like the Vietnam wall on the Mall in Washington. But the survivors and their families who pooled their resources to build it ran out of money, and no one, including the Bulgarian government, stepped in to help. (The survivors also hoped to open a museum and to recreate the shacks where they were held, but that hasn&#39;t happened either.)</p><h2><strong>My grandfather&#39;s escape </strong></h2><p>Dzhermanova, the 93-year-old anarchist - and eternal optimist, apparently - has hope that younger people will dig up the buried history.</p><p>As for my grandfather, his ex-wife (or whoever it was who betrayed him to the authorities) was right that he wanted to escape Bulgaria.</p><p>After his release from Belene in 1953, that resolve was so much stronger. &#34;After 4 years and three months in the Island of Death, I became determined to go to my real home: America,&#34; he explained in his notebooks.</p><h2><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614ce0bc4c42bc00190fa67f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A younger woman sits at a table with two older people.\" height=\"736\" width=\"1094\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author with her grandfather and grandmother, Tsvetana Tutunjieva.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tana Ganeva</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></h2><p>As he detailed it, it would take four harrowing attempts. Soon after his release from Belene, he managed to make it into Yugoslavia during a &#34;sabor&#34; - a temporary loosening of borders so family and friends in the two countries could see each other. But he got caught and was thrown into a Yugoslavian jail.</p><p>From there, he organized an inmate breakout after bribing the guard dog, Jeko, with his dinner. But he and the other prisoners were caught in the woods, and the Yugoslavian authorities gave them up to the Bulgarian authorities in exchange for 10 cows. &#34;They weren&#39;t even very good cows - scrawny,&#34; he wrote.</p><p>Several years later, he tried to cross Bulgaria&#39;s mountainous border into Greece, but he was caught once again.</p><p>Finally, he made it into Austria and then Germany by clinging to the underside of a freight train. And then on to California, where he gave his new dog a familiar name: Jeko.</p><p><em>Tana Ganeva writes about policing, prisons and criminal justice.

country&#39;s entertainment industry, Chinese authorities announced a ban on violent, vulgar, and bloody children&#39;s TV shows on Friday and sparked an uproar among social media users when a popular anime show was censored from streaming services. </p><p>The regulations apply to network shows and those hosted on streaming networks. After the ban was announced, the popular Japanese anime series &#34;Ultraman Tiga&#34; was censored from Chinese streaming services, much to the anger of Chinese fans. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/27/media/china-cartoon-ban-ultraman-tiga-intl-hnk/index.html\">Though many posts about the show&#39;s ban have now been deleted</a>, the hashtag about the show&#39;s removal was viewed 84 million times, with people complaining about losing a staple of their childhood, according to CNN. The show aired from 1996 to 1997, and includes five spin-off movies. </p><p>&#34;The <a href=\"http://www.nrta.gov.cn/art/2021/9/24/art_113_58016.html\">content of broadcasts should be healthy and progressive and should promote truth, good, and beauty</a> in cartoons,&#34; a statement from the National Radio and Television Administration said. The regulatory body also said that children were the primary audience for cartoons and that streaming services should set up children&#39;s channels with child-appropriate content with shows that promote &#34;healthy development&#34; among young people. </p><p>The Chinese government has implemented a far-reaching crackdown on the entertainment industry, including <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-cuts-video-game-time-for-kids-3-hours-weekly-2021-8\">prohibiting children from playing video games for more than three hours</a> a week, discouraging broadcasters from casting &#34;effeminate men&#34; on TV shows, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/k-pop-fan-accounts-china-weibo-suspended-irrational-star-chasing-2021-9\">suspending K-pop fan accounts on social media</a>. </p><p>The government also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/k-pop-fan-accounts-china-weibo-suspended-irrational-star-chasing-2021-9\">erased an enormously popular actress from Chinese social media</a> and deleted her movies from streaming services without explaining why.</p><p>The heightened incursions into the entertainment industry are mostly focused on promoting a specific idea of morality within film and TV.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time that a Chinese authority has tried to discourage the viewing of certain children&#39;s TV shows due to violence. In April, the Jiangsu Consumer Council <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3129212/barbie-dreamhouse-adventures-peppa-pig-and-my\">announced that 21 children&#39;s cartoons, including &#34;Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures&#34; and &#34;My Little Pony,&#34; weren&#39;t appropriate for kids</a>. </p><p>The state-run newspaper the Global Times hinted that half of the cartoons referenced in the investigation had &#34;violent criminal elements to varying degrees,&#34; including beatings, arson, and intimidation.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read

From June to August, Moderna's vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was 99% in the 30-49 year old age group and 91% among 50-64 year olds. Pfizer's vaccine during that same time period was roughly 82% effective among 30-49 year olds, and 84% effective among 50-64 year olds.</p><p>But in younger adults, ages 18-29, the two vaccines performed almost identically, with vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization of 82% for Moderna and 85% for Pfizer.</p><p>It's tough to know exactly how the arrival of the Delta variant in the spring may be impacting&#160; how well vaccines work.</p>\n\tWhichever way you slice the data, all the vaccines are still pretty stellar at their primary job - keeping people alive and out of the hospital.

href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-miners-eye-nuclear-power-as-environmental-criticism-mounts-11632654002\">Wall Street Journal</a> report.</p><p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has fast become a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/miami-crypto-bitcoin-biggest-hub-expatriate-experts-florida-2021-6\">beloved figure in crypto circles</a>, told the Journal that he has been pitching bitcoin mining firms on his city&#39;s nuclear facilities and crypto friendliness. </p><p>A Miami-based nuclear plant owned by Florida Power &#38; Light has been in talks with bitcoin miners over how to get ahold of cheap land near the facility to host mining rigs, Suarez told the Journal. He said worries about bitcoin&#39;s eco-unfriendliness &#34;come from the fact that a lot of the mining was being done in coal-producing countries.&#34;</p><p>In June, Suarez made a similar pitch to Chinese firms <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-bitcoin-crypto-crackdown-visuals-sichuan-mining-pool-2021-06\">displaced by Beijing&#39;s mining ban</a>.</p><p>&#34;The fact that we have nuclear power means that it&#39;s very inexpensive power,&#34; he told CNBC at the time. &#34;We understand how important this is … miners want to get to a certain kilowatt price per hour.&#34;</p><p>While bitcoin mining is a highly energy-intensive activity, using nuclear power generates nearly zero carbon emissions or air pollution - presenting a seemingly tidy fix to a growing concern.</p><p>Outside of Miami, too, miners are eyeing other opportunities to link with nuclear energy sources. </p><p>Nuclear startup Oklo Inc. for example, has signed a 20-year deal to supply energy to Compass Mining through its mini reactor. Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told the Journal that he had received requests from other interested bitcoin miners, though federal approval is still forthcoming.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/miami-bitcoin-mining-nuclear-crypto-francis-suarez-carbon-pollution-energy-2021-09'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KD4538zQDpc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:25:31 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60b85ce4bee0fc0019d5b053?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"1467012d21a9cb2d225e518615d41308","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn31@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-38-680_f5c31ca741450f7e.webp","destWidth":4584,"destHeight":3438,"sourceBytes":368434,"destBytes":368434,"author":"ewu@insider.com (Ethan Wu)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6151cdf22fb46b0019be3352?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-36-677_35cf5d53c2376699.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-727_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn31@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-37-940_64b01c14cfc40567.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-32-868_b42f0e16d2b1cd12.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-450_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KD4538zQDpc:1o08ee66hII:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-763_407954188de8f8ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KD4538zQDpc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn48@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-34-705_ed293dcbe090378c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761728366},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:29","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:29","title":"Netflix's top 10 original TV show hits of all time, including 'Bridgerton' and 'Sex/Life'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/bridgerton-compared-to-other-netflix-top-original-shows-viewership-2021-1","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/601ad412ee136f00183aa10a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"bridgerton\" height=\"2405\" width=\"3600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;Bridgerton.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Liam Daniel/Netflix</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Netflix said that &#34;Sex/Life&#34;

Friedman said during a court hearing on Monday in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/reagan40thanniversary\">Hinckley Jr. shot Reagan, a police officer, a secret service agent, and Reagan&#39;s press secretary</a> in an attempt to win over child actress Jodie Foster in 1981. The court accepted Hinckley&#39;s insanity plea, leading the government to place Hinckley in a DC-based psychiatric facility, St. Elizabeth&#39;s Hospital.</p><p>&#34;He was ravaged by mental illness at the time,&#34; Hinckley&#39;s attorney, Barry William Levine, said in Monday&#39;s court hearing. &#34;It was that mental illness that was the basis of his acquittal.&#34;</p><p>Friedman said the court has granted Hinckley several additional freedoms in the past two decades, ultimately letting him live full-time with his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 2016.</p><p>Hinckley&#39;s lawyer and US Attorney Kacie McCoy Weston both agreed with the judge&#39;s decision for a full and unconditional release. Both parties said they wanted to wait until June 2022 to release Hinckley to see how he responds to the recent death of his mother, which will result in him being by himself for the first time in decades.</p><p>&#34;The ball is completely in Mr. Hinckley&#39;s hands,&#34; Weston said.</p><p>In addition to lobbying from his attorneys, the Department of Behavioral Health at St. Elizabeth&#39;s Hospital wrote letters in 2020 and 2021 recommending Hinckley&#39;s unconditional release.</p><p>Friedman called Hinckley one of the most studied patients in the history of the institution, noting that very few people have been subjected to as many interviews, risk assessments, and testing as Hinckley.</p><p>&#34;If he hadn&#39;t tried to kill the president he would have been granted unconditional release a long, long time ago,&#34; Friedman said.</p><p>The judge finished Monday&#39;s hearing to say that after adjudicating Hinckley&#39;s case for many years, it&#39;s time for a change.</p><p>Hinckley &#34;should be able to live out his life productively in Williamsburg interacting with people doing his art, his music, and all will be right with the world,&#34; Friedman said. The judge said he&#39;d issue his final order later in the week.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/john-hinckley-jr-unconditional-release-reagan-attempted-assassin-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/LPakwSGm-1c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:50:09 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6151d9972fb46b0019be3830?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"6abe42e783b5559ff0ec10e9e2045493","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn76@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-38-841_b4fef408cfcaf7d0.webp","destWidth":1914,"destHeight":1431,"sourceBytes":159798,"destBytes":159798,"author":"mhall@businessinsider.com (Madison Hall)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6151d99cb414c1001862865c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-33-417_1ed2c301919f0f3c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-727_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-33-714_32ae7dd8786622d4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-32-676_75a545b175b7c5dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-450_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LPakwSGm-1c:VXmaOa67cSg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-36-080_0d921f45d1f2e6e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/LPakwSGm-1c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-35-069_4e45656eed1352ec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761728344},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","title":"French president Emmanuel Macron hit in the head with an egg while visiting a food and hotel expo","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-french-president-macron-hit-in-head-with-an-egg-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6151d28f2fb46b0019be34fd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"French President Emmanuel Macron\" height=\"2000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>French President Emmanuel Macron talks with cooking students, Tuesday June 8, 2021 at the Hospitality school in Tain-l&#39;Hermitage, southeastern France.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Philippe Desmazes, Pool via AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Macron was hit in the head with an egg during a visit to a hotel, catering, and food trade fair on Monday. </li>\n<li>Macron&#39;s egg-throwing assailant appeared to be a 20-year-old man yelling &#34;vive la révolution.&#34;

debt-laden property developer on Wednesday, according to a statement posted on its website.</p><p>The People&#39;s Bank of China did not mention Evergrande in its announcement, which only consisted of one line about housing along and a commitment to make its monetary policy flexible, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrandes-electric-car-units-shares-tumble-23-after-warning-2021-09-27/\">Reuters</a> first reported Monday. The statement was made after the bank&#39;s third-quarter Monetary Policy Committee meeting.</p><p>Markets were rattled last week on fears that the fallout of a potential Evergrande default would reverberate across the globe. The beleaguered Chinese property developer missed a deadline to pay $83.5 million in interest on it dollar-denominated bond last week. Another <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-evergrande-debt-bonds-maturities-idUSL8N2QP1H5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$47.5 million coupon</a> is due this week on a second dollar bond. </p><p>As Evergrande teeters on the edge of insolvency, many investors have wondered if the Chinese government would step in to help prop it up. Some sources said China is letting Evergrande sweat to make its case that Chinese companies need to better manage their finances, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/business/china-evergrande-crisis.html?referringSource=articleShare\">New York Times</a> reported.</p><p>But on Monday, the PBOC said it commits to &#34;safeguard the legitimate rights of housing consumers.&#34; The Asian superpower, according to Teresa Kong, portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, has the financial tools to manage the situation if it takes a turn for the worse.</p><p>&#34;We believe Evergrande&#39;s financial problems are highly unlikely to create a risk to China&#39;s financial system,&#34; Kong said in a <a href=\"https://www.matthewsasia.com/insights/china/2021/evergrande-too-big-to-fail/\">note last week</a>. &#34;The company does have a large debt burden, but it is insignificant given the scale of China&#39;s financial system.&#34;</p><p>She pointed to two Chinese companies with similar debt burdens, Anbang and HNA, that were successfully restructured without spreading risk through the system.</p><p>&#34;As in the past, we expect the government to take an active role in managing the restructuring of Evergrande to mitigate the risks, by ensuring that its current liquidity problem does not become an insolvency problem and a bigger crisis of confidence in the Chinese financial system,&#34; she added.</p><p>Evergrande, with $309 billion in liabilities, is the world&#39;s most indebted company.

href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-crypto-bans-cryptocurrency-transactions-forbids-foreign-exchanges-service-citizens-2021-9\">declared all crypto-related transactions illegal</a>. </p><p>Friday&#39;s announcement also stops foreign crypto exchanges from providing services to local residents.</p><p>In response to the ban, Binance said it&#39;s no longer accepting registrations from Chinese mobile numbers. The exchange has been blocked in China since 2017, when the country ordered local crypto exchanges to cease operations, and local users have not been able to access its domain since then. </p><p>&#34;As such, Binance does not currently hold exchange operations in China,&#34; a Binance spokesperson told Insider. &#34;We can also confirm that Chinese mobile phone registrations are blocked and the Binance app is not available in China for downloading.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Binance takes its compliance obligations very seriously and is committed to following local regulator requirements wherever we operate,&#34; they added.</p><p>Chinese crypto exchange Huobi said on Sunday it would <a href=\"https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/54886961978434\">stop new user registrations</a> by mainland customers, and retire existing ones by the end of 2021. Huobi co-founder Du Jun <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-crypto-china/cryptocurrency-exchanges-rush-to-cut-ties-with-chinese-users-after-fresh-crackdown-idUSKBN2GN08A\">told Reuters</a> the exchange took corrective measures on the same day China clamped down on digital-asset transactions.</p><p>TokenPocket, a crypto wallet service provider that was widely used in China, <a href=\"https://www.theblockbeats.com/en/flash/49814\">said in a notice on Friday</a> it would &#34;actively embrace&#34; relevant regulatory provisions and end those services for mainland users that did not comply with the new laws.</p><p>China has been <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-crypto-crackdown-timeline-regulatory-bitcoin-ether-solana-dogecoin-bans-2021-9\">hostile towards cryptocurrencies</a> for a while now, so its latest announcement didn&#39;t shock many investors, or crypto businesses. That&#39;s evident from the recent <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-china-ban-cryptocurrency-transactions-crackdown-2021-9\">price action in the crypto market</a>, which didn&#39;t react as much in comparison to previous clampdowns. </p><p>Curtis Ting, managing director of Kraken&#39;s European operations, told Insider that China&#39;s ban won&#39;t have an impact on its business as most of its trading activity comes from clients based in the US, Europe, and other parts of the Asia Pacific.</p><p>Crypto exchanges might relocate to other more digital asset-friendly locations in the Asia Pacific or the Bahamas, Fundstrat strategist Armando Aguilar <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-crypto-ban-has-almost-achieved-a-meme-like-status-but-here-are-the-lingering-impacts-11632512981?mod=home-page\">told MarketWatch</a>. Coinbase doesn&#39;t have any operations in China, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fplaces\">according to its website</a>.</p><p>FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1441444101899972610\">announced Friday</a> the exchange had moved its headquarters <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-hong-kong-bahamas-relocates-headquarters-2021-9\">from Hong Kong to the Bahamas</a>, where it <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-establishes-substantial-presence-in-the-bahamas-and-appoints-ryan-salame-as-ceo-301380243.html\">established a subsidiary</a> only last week. </p><p>&#34;Countries that take such inflexible stances are taking significant, generational risks for their economies,&#34;

The defunct company behind Stock Detective and other financial-information websites saw its share price nosedive from a high of $28 to a fraction of a cent following the dot-com crash.</p><p>&#34;A very common chart back in the day,&#34; Burry said. &#34;Looks vaguely familiar.&#34;</p><p>Moreover, the hedge fund manager compared the bull market during the 15 years to 2000 to the run up in stocks over the past 15 years. He highlighted a 94% correlation between the Nasdaq 100&#39;s performance in each of those periods, and a 95% correlation for the S&#38;P 500 index.</p><p>The Scion chief also drew a parallel between the surge in people trading options on meme stocks such as AMC Entertainment, and the mass speculation that preceded the Wall Street Crash of 1929. He juxtaposed an article about the options mania with a quote by a statistician named Leroy Peavey in November 1929. Peavey blamed the market crash that year on a wave of leveraged speculation that pulled in &#34;elevator boys, typewriter girls, and even schoolchildren.&#34;</p><p>Burry is best known for predicting the collapse of the US housing bubble in the mid-2000s, and making a fortune by betting on a spike in subprime-mortgage defaults. His massive wager was chronicled in the book and the movie &#34;The Big Short.&#34;</p><p>The investor also bought a stake in GameStop and wrote several letters to the video-game retailer&#39;s board in 2019, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-investor-michael-burry-scion-gamestop-stock-price-frenzy-2021-2\">laying the groundwork</a> for the short squeeze on the stock this year and the broader meme-stock trend.

Rather than having state officials enforce the ban, the law invites ordinary citizens to do so. That means an individual can sue an abortion provider or anyone they believe who &#34;aids and abets&#34; someone getting the procedure beyond six weeks of pregnancy. Successful plaintiffs will be rewarded at least $10,000, in addition to legal fees.</p><p>The Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote on September 2 declined a request from abortion providers in Texas to block the law. The court&#39;s narrow majority argued that the decision was technical and the justices did not review the substance of the statute, which could still be legally challenged.</p><p>The nation&#39;s high court will consider a major abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization, starting December 1. The case concerns a Mississippi law that bans nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, presenting a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion until pre-viability, the point when a fetus can survive outside of the womb, which medical experts determine typically occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-host-grills-texas-governor-vow-to-eliminate-rape-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eGt82z-_tA8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:17:05 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6151dfa22fb46b0019be3aa8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d035a90389b5ca656ab382ccbd71e434","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn8@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-32-762_7eaa9ef94c3ff2ff.webp","destWidth":2058,"destHeight":1544,"sourceBytes":72168,"destBytes":72168,"author":"oseddiq@insider.com (Oma Seddiq)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6151dfab2fb46b0019be3aad?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn68@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-37-338_f46a80c9cfea4214.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-727_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn47@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-34-969_ab389f18dc847651.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn59@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-38-468_a5496490367e1bdd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-450_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eGt82z-_tA8:D5XO6xONbio:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn20@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-34-341_59c5f9abec8d3a9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eGt82z-_tA8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-36-108_6911ec056f4ce5ba.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761729122},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","title":"The 10 biggest streaming TV debuts of the past year were all on Netflix, according to Nielsen data","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-viewed-streaming-tv-show-debuts-of-year-nielsen-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fda2a6b6524f10019792583?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The Crown\" height=\"2648\" width=\"3972\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;The Crown.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Netflix</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Netflix dominated Nielsen&#39;s weekly streaming charts over the past year, a new analysis showed.</li>\n<li>&#34;The Crown&#34; had the most-viewed first week of any original streaming series, according to Nielsen.</li>\n<li>Nielsen&#39;s measurements - based on minutes watched - do give Netflix an edge, though.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/manifest-ruled-nielsens-streaming-charts-before-its-netflix-revival-2021-9\">new analysis</a> of Nielsen&#39;s weekly streaming charts over the past year shows that Netflix dominated.</p><p>Nielsen introduced weekly lists last year of the most-watched streaming titles, measured by the number of minutes watched per week. The <a href=\"https://www.evolutionmediacapital.com/research/1-year-nielsen-svod-top-10-lists\">analysis</a>, by Tavish Zausner-Mannes of the firm Evolution Media Capital, found the top 10 original streaming shows with the most-viewed weeks on Nielsen&#39;s lists from August 2, 2020 to August 8, 2021 - and they are all on Netflix.</p><p>The 10 shows with the most minutes watched in a given week included recent <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-ties-the-record-for-most-emmys-wins-with-44-2021-9\">Emmys champion</a> &#34;The Crown&#34; and &#34;Bridgerton,&#34; which is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bridgerton-compared-to-other-netflix-top-original-shows-viewership-2021-1\">Netflix&#39;s biggest worldwide series</a> of all time by its own calculations (<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-netflix-calculates-its-new-daily-top-10-lists-2020-2\">it counts a view</a> if an account watches at least two minutes of a show or movie). </p><p>The data accounted for each show&#39;s first full week on Netflix, which doesn&#39;t include premiere weekends, save for one: &#34;Cobra Kai&#34; had a big enough debut weekend that that week made the list with just three days of availability. </p><p>The data is limited in that Nielsen only measures US viewership and it includes just Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Prime Video. The way Nielsen measures viewership - total minutes watched - also gives Netflix shows an edge, as new seasons are released all at once while hits on other streaming services, such as Disney&#39;s &#34;The Mandalorian&#34; or Prime Video&#39;s &#34;The Boys,&#34; are released weekly.</p><p>Nielsen is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tv-tech-companies-that-could-replace-nielsen-2021-8\">also under fire this year</a> by the TV industry for the way it measures viewership, and NBCUniversal has taken steps <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nbcuniversal-is-taking-steps-to-replace-tv-measurement-firm-nielsen-2021-8\">to try and replace Nielsen</a> with other measurement companies.

kidnap or assassinate the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who was holed up in a London embassy, <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html\">a Yahoo News investigation found</a>.</p><p>The report, which Yahoo News said was based on interviews with more than 30 former US officials, said the CIA was enraged by WikiLeaks&#39; publication in 2017 of thousands of documents detailing the agency&#39;s hacking and covert surveillance techniques, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-vault-7-leak-woefully-lax-security-protocol-report-2020-6?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">known as the Vault 7 leak</a>.</p><p>The Yahoo News report said senior officials inquired about &#34;options&#34; for what to do about Assange, including the feasibility of assassinating or kidnapping him.</p><p>CIA Director Mike Pompeo - who later became secretary of state - was determined to take revenge on Assange after the leak, Yahoo News reported.</p><p>In 2017, Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-mike-pompeo-wikileaks-assange-2017-4\">designated WikiLeaks</a> a &#34;non-state hostile intelligence service,&#34; meaning it could be targeted with the same aggressive actions used against foreign states&#39; intelligence agencies.</p><p>A former senior counterintelligence official told Yahoo News that &#34;there seemed to be no boundaries&#34; during discussions with the Trump administration about Assange in 2017.</p><p>Pompeo and other senior officials &#34;were completely detached from reality because they were so embarrassed about Vault 7,&#34; a former national security official told the publication. &#34;They were seeing blood.&#34;</p><p>Yahoo News said it could not confirm whether the discussions were escalated to the Trump White House. The CIA and Pompeo did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>In 2017, Assange was living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He had been taking refuge there since 2012, after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/julian-assange-sweden-rape-investigation-dropped-2019-11\">Swedish prosecutors opened an investigation</a> into him following allegations of rape and molestation.</p><p>Assange had claimed that if he were extradited to Sweden for questioning, he would be sent to the US, where he said he would face persecution.

The report also described concerns that a kidnapping would derail US attempts to prosecute Assange.</p><p>UK authorities arrested Assange in April 2019 after Ecuador withdrew its asylum protections. He is being held in the Belmarsh prison in London, as a UK judge in January refused the US&#39;s request for his extradition.</p><p>&#34;As an American citizen, I find it absolutely outrageous that our government would be contemplating kidnapping or assassinating somebody without any judicial process simply because he had published truthful information,&#34; Barry Pollack, Assange&#39;s lawyer in the US, told Yahoo News.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-pitched-julian-assange-assassination-trump-officials-report-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/bforoZEAY6w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:07:27 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6151b23ab414c10018627d25?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a6a04b3e239f400a0584efd705657624","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn59@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-38-949_113d68369d3c7923.webp","destWidth":1852,"destHeight":1389,"sourceBytes":82782,"destBytes":82782,"author":"tporter@businessinsider.com (Tom Porter)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6151b21eb414c10018627d1f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-32-704_281070a5b1daaece.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-727_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn72@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-36-505_24c3982e39657e13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-38-216_33638a0cde65dfa8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-450_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bforoZEAY6w:S9hjTNZ39fw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-333_ed01d788e92c8fbd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/bforoZEAY6w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn92@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-36-555_4f24c99e3071707c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761728375},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","title":"5 red flags that someone won't be a good leader at work","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/red-flags-work-leadership-promotion-narcissist-traits-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e17796cb2e66a5f3c0a0423?format=jpeg\" alt=\"job interview\" height=\"4176\" width=\"5568\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Leaders should be approachable and not overbearing, or they&#39;ll risk limiting creativity and motivation.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Skynesher/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>If you want to keep good employees, you need to have strong managers. </li>\n<li>Not everyone is cut out for a leadership role, particularly people who show narcissistic tendencies. </li>\n<li>Leaders should be approachable, not overbearing, and eager to praise their direct reports&#39; success.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>As an executive coach, I do a lot of listening to managers worried about losing good employees. People-oriented managers understand what they need to do to <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/5-ways-to-lead-with-emotional-courage-get-best-out-of-people.html\">get the best out of people</a>. I&#39;m not concerned about them.</p><p>I <em>am</em> concerned about managers being promoted into <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/how-can-you-spot-really-good-leaders-they-do-any-of-these-5-things-exceptionally-well.html\">leadership roles</a> when they have no business being there. <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/5-leadership-lessons-to-help-business-owners-thrive.html?cid=search\">Leadership</a> is demonstrated through competence, not attitude, confidence, or charisma. It takes ability and skills. </p><p>That&#39;s why the single biggest decision any organization will make is whom they name manager. When you name the wrong person manager, nothing fixes that bad decision.</p><p>We&#39;ve all heard this tune play like a broken record: <em>People leave managers, not companies.</em></p><p>So what have I seen over the course of 20 years that proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that someone is not fit to lead?</p><h2>1. Managers who look after only themselves</h2><p>These managers aren&#39;t concerned with fulfilling the company mission or aligning team goals to organizational objectives. It&#39;s about their individual performance and getting that annual bonus. Managers with this attitude are playing for the name on the back of the jersey and are concerned only about their own accomplishments and how they look to their superiors.</p><h2>2. Narcissistic tendencies</h2><p>This manager often belittles a team member&#39;s work and might even ridicule staff at meetings. When he needs something from you, he may become threatening. At his most toxic, he will make you doubt yourself and your ultimate value to the company.</p><h2>3. Treating people like numbers</h2><p>In top-down power structures, employees are considered to be objects or expenses rather than assets; there is little concern for their happiness or well-being since the motive for hiring them was purely productivity and profit. In these pressure-cookers, there&#39;s little evidence of leaders displaying compassion and empathy in seeing employees as valued human beings. As a result, you&#39;ll encounter high levels of stress, turnover, absenteeism, and burnout.</p><h2>4. Too much control</h2><p>The work environment is overbearing and stifling because managers want control over all decisions. Such managers distrust the team, so tasks rarely get delegated to others. There&#39;s hardly room for group discussion or input because the management style is autocratic, which limits creativity and the team&#39;s desire to learn new things. </p><h2>5. Taking the spotlight from the team</h2><p>The team puts together a wonderful product and the client is happy with the results. And then it happens: The manager takes all the credit. No praise for the team, no celebration of everyone&#39;s success, no recognition of team members for their contributions. This type of manager will steal the light and thunder away from the team, which is a total employee-engagement killer.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Bankman-Fried said, rejecting the idea China&#39;s crypto ban played a part.</p><p>FTX had been considering the Bahamas for a while, as it is one of the first countries to roll out comprehensive regulation for cryptocurrencies, the company&#39;s founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psr8rPysuLs\">told Bloomberg</a> in a Friday interview.</p><p>The crypto exchange has <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-establishes-substantial-presence-in-the-bahamas-and-appoints-ryan-salame-as-ceo-301380243.html\">registered a subsidiary</a> in the Bahamas, which <a href=\"https://www.institutionalassetmanager.co.uk/2020/12/16/293708/bahamas-dare-legislation-opens-door-new-industry\">brought in a legal framework</a> for services for trading digital tokens in

href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1441444101899972610\">tweet</a>.</p><p>News of the move came shortly after China declared all <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-crypto-bans-cryptocurrency-transactions-forbids-foreign-exchanges-service-citizens-2021-9\">crypto-related transactions illegal</a> and banned foreign exchanges from providing services to mainland residents. Crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-crypto-ban-binance-huobi-cut-ties-mainland-users-reactions-2021-9\">scrambled to cut ties</a> with Chinese users after the ban.</p><p>But Bankman-Fried indicated FTX&#39;s decision to leave Hong Kong - seen as increasingly under the sway of Beijing - had nothing to do with that development.</p><p>&#34;This has been something which has been in the works for a while, and has been taking place for a while, and was not particularly in response to any very recent news,&#34; the 29-year-old crypto billionaire told Bloomberg.</p><p>China&#39;s edict caused somewhat of a slump in the crypto market Friday, but the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-china-ban-cryptocurrency-transactions-crackdown-2021-9\">price reaction was muted in comparison</a> with that following previous clampdowns.

But it&#39;s not been the major cryptocurrencies that have seen most of the action, or even some of the recent red-hot &#34;altcoins&#34;, but rather, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-uniswap-sushi-china-selloff-decentralized-exchange-tokens-ether-2021-9\">decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens</a>. </p><p>Decentralized exchanges don&#39;t rely on any intermediaries, as a standard centralized exchange would. There are no banks or brokers, or even <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearinghouse.asp\">clearing houses</a> involved, but rather, they offer a peer-to-peer platform where the parties involved use smart contracts to execute their trades. </p><p>These contracts are mini-programs that run on a blockchain that will automatically execute once a set of conditions are met. A number of decentralized exchanges are built on the ethereum network - the largest such blockchain that hosts smart contacts, decentralized finance applications and other protocols. </p><p>They are often cheaper to use than centralized exchanges, like Binance or Coinbase, and mean users are completely in charge of managing their wallets and private keys, which allow them access to their crypto tokens. </p><p>The three biggest decentralized exchanges by volume are Uniswap, SushiSwap and derivatives exchange DxDy. </p><p>&#34;Decentralized exchanges Uniswap and Sushiswap have seen a surge in usage, which is likely a result of China&#39;s ban on centralised exchanges. Since DEX&#39;s only require a crypto wallet and no KYC [know your customer], it is much easier to use and can be set up in a matter of minutes,&#34; Jonas Luethy, junior sales trader at digital asset manager Global Block, said in a newsletter. </p><p>There are basically three different ways a DEX will function.</p><p>The first is with what&#39;s known as an on-chain order book that lists all buy and sell orders sorted by price. In this case, every part of the transaction is written onto the blockchain. That includes not just purchases and sales, but even requests to buy or sell. So all the information is stored safely in one place, but this process can be costly and slower.</p><p>Off-chain order books only record the final settled transaction on the blockchain, without storing orders or any other information. It&#39;s faster, but a little less secure than on-chain.</p><p>Lastly, there are automated market makers (AMM) that use what are known as liquidity pools. The pool is essentially made up of a big enough reserve of tokens, or pairs of tokens. </p><p>A user will just place the tokens they wish to sell or buy in the pool and one smart contract will complete their transaction. This method makes it much easier to swap from one cryptocurrency to another than with an order book, for example.</p><p>Here are the top 3 DEX tokens to watch out for: </p><ol><li aria-level=\"1\">Uniswap is the biggest token, with a market capitalization of over $14 billion. The token surged by almost 40% at one point on Monday. It&#39;s up around 360% so far this year at around $23.40. </li><li aria-level=\"1\">Sushi is the second biggest token, with a market cap of over $1 billion. Its token, which has risen around 270% this year to $10.70, rallied by nearly 30% earlier on Monday.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">DYDX gained by as much as 31% Monday. The underlying exchange has seen a massive influx of new users plus, and for the first time, has registered higher trading volumes than Coinbase, according to GlobalBlock. The dydx token launched around a month ago and has already roughly doubled in value to around $20.00. </li></ol><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/china-crypto-ban-uniswap-sushiswap-dxdy-decentralized-exchanges-tokens-ether-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zbDL7j3ZaGc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:12:13 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6151e9cd2fb46b0019be3e7f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d05e9be2f20c7220f62555871e4ebaea","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn71@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-39-214_fe2ed2d9368ddcec.webp","destWidth":2193,"destHeight":1644,"sourceBytes":42082,"destBytes":42082,"author":"cshumba@insider.com (Camomile Shumba)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6151e9c02fb46b0019be3e79?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn39@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-33-794_4d94e9ccd38a2d59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-727_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-34-085_160ad16ede8804ec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn18@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-32-696_341c48926d149fcc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-450_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zbDL7j3ZaGc:0HTjpPRiCps:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-38-817_be70569d760a0972.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zbDL7j3ZaGc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-36-342_d7c31f59673d82c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761728344},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","title":"Why the US government could shut down this week and what will happen","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/will-government-shut-down-what-will-happen-debt-ceiling-congress-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/525781f369beddb3126c3097?format=jpeg\" alt=\"government shutdown\" height=\"2525\" width=\"3366\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The US government is funded through September 30, and lawmakers are at an impasse to vote on a solution.</li>\n<li>If they don&#39;t vote to keep it funded, the government could shut down, causing furloughs and economic chaos.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Senate Republicans <strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">say they</strong> plan to torpedo a measure that would<strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"> &#34;pause&#34; </strong>the debt ceiling<strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"> debate for two months</strong>.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>It&#39;s shaping up to be a wild week in the halls of Congress, as a new infrastructure package is on the line and a potential government shutdown looms.</p><p>Thursday, September 30, is the end of the fiscal year - and the last day for which the federal government has funding. That means that lawmakers need to step in and pass what&#39;s called a &#34;continuing resolution&#34; measure that would temporarily fund the government. If they can&#39;t pass that, the government risks a possible shutdown, which could cause government employee furloughs and a ripple effect throughout the entire economy.</p><p>The House has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-approves-bill-government-shutdown-default-gop-set-to-oppose-2021-9\">passed</a> the continuing resolution that would fund the government for two more months. Crucially, that resolution also contains a measure that would suspend the debt ceiling through December 2022 - delaying this decision until after the midterm election.</p><p>Indeed, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-approves-bill-government-shutdown-default-gop-set-to-oppose-2021-9\">made it clear</a> that the House bill with the debt ceiling suspension will not make it past the Senate. Instead, Republicans are arguing that the measure should pass through the party-line reconciliation Democrats are gearing up for. Though Republicans have not made any demands in exchange for an approval of the debt ceiling suspension, they&#39;ve instead made the suspension an issue of partisanship.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/20/white-house-debt-ceiling/\">Washington Post</a>, McConnell told Punchbowl News that &#34;Democratic leaders have every tool and procedure they need to handle the debt limit on a partisan basis, just like they are choosing to handle everything else.&#34; But Democrats <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-democrats-debt-ceiling-russian-roulette-with-the-economy-2021-9\">have said</a> that there&#39;s not enough time to address it in reconciliation.</p><p>&#34;The debt ceiling will be raised as it always should be, but it will be raised by the Democrats,&#34; McConnell said in a press conference on September 21. </p><p>During a government shutdown, many non-essential government services are paused, affecting everything from your mortgage approval to your visit to a national park. That&#39;s because some government employees are furloughed when agencies temporarily close; in 2019, amidst the most recent shutdown, Insider&#39;s Bob Bryan <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-federal-workers-get-zero-dollar-paycheck-furlough-backpay-2019-1\">reported</a> that 800,000 federal employees received paychecks for $0. </p><p>At the time, the workers not receiving paychecks owed over $400 million in rent and mortgage payments, according to <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/shutdown-mortgage-rent-22615/\">real-estate firm Zillow</a>. Some of those impacted workers turned to GoFundMe campaigns for help paying off their bills, Insider&#39;s Mariana Alfaro <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-gofundme-pages-2019-1\">reported</a>. </p><h2>30 years of government shutdowns</h2><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-raise-the-debt-ceiling-janet-yellen-default-2021-9\">warned</a> Congress earlier this month that the country&#39;s ability to pay its bills will likely run out sooner than planned. After Congress missed a July 30 deadline to raise or suspend the debt ceiling, the US Treasury employed &#34;extraordinary measures&#34; to allow the government to continue paying its bills, but Yellen said those measures will likely run out in October due to financial uncertainty caused by the pandemic.</p><p>As Insider&#39;s Ben Winck and Joseph Zeballos-Roig previously <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-debt-ceiling-explained-democrats-republicans-government-spending-borrowing-2021-9\">reported</a>, the debt ceiling was introduced in 1917 and has since been raised 57 times to prevent the government from defaulting. And while the US has always managed to avoid a default to prevent a lapse in critical benefits and an economic recession, raising the limit has become more of a bargaining chip than a true financial threshold. </p><p>The first debt ceiling-related government shutdown took place in 1995, when then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/22/republicans-usually-lose-shutdown-fights-so-why-are-they-going-there-again/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_politicspolitics\">demanded</a> President Bill Clinton implement the Republicans&#39; proposal for a balanced budget, and ultimately caused the government to shut down for 21 days. </p><p>And similar political battles continued in following years. For example, in 2013 under President Barack Obama, the GOP refused to raise the debt ceiling unless the Affordable Care Act was defunded, causing the government to shut down for 16 days. </p><p>Most recently, President Donald Trump oversaw the longest government shutdown - 35 days - when Democrats refused to vote for increased funding for Trump&#39;s border wall between the US and Mexico. Notably, during all of these shutdowns, the government still did not go into default on its debt.</p><p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi plans to address raising the debt ceiling, the infrastructure bill, and Democrats&#39; social spending bill this week, but it is unclear what path she will take if Democrats fail to garner enough votes to keep the government funded.</p><div

Republican states and regions largely due to stubborn vaccine refusal and hesitancy in red regions of the country. </p><p>A series <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html?smid=tw-share\">of new charts and graphics from The New York Times</a> demonstrate the increasingly stark partisan divides in vaccination and how they drive outbreaks in areas that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. </p><p>Nationwide, 75% of eligible Americans aged 12 and up have received at least one vaccine dose with 65% considered fully vaccinated, according to data<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\"> from the Centers for Disease Control. </a></p><p>But the data broken down at the state and county level show that Democratic areas account for far more of the country&#39;s vaccinations. </p><p>Nineteen out of the top 20 states and the District of Columbia with the highest vaccination rates among adults aged 18+ voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\">according to The Times&#39; data,</a> while 19 of the 2020 states with lowest vaccination rates among that age group voted for Trump. </p><p>According to mid-September data <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/\">from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, 52.8% of people in counties that voted for Biden are fully vaccinated compared to 39.9% in counties that voted for Trump, a nearly 13 percentage point gap. </p><p>The Times&#39; charts and visuals show a strong positive correlation between a state&#39;s 2020 vote share for Trump and COVID-19 cases and deaths, but a strong negative correlation between 2020 Trump share and vaccination rates. </p><p>While cases have begun to decline nationwide, states and regions that voted for Trump are continuing to get hit the hardest by the Delta variant, which ravaged states like Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, and other southern states over the summer. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html?name=styln-coronavirus&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Interactive&variant=1_Show&is_new=false=1_Show&#38;is_new=false\">states with the current worst per-capita rates of COVID-19</a> are Alaska, Wyoming, West Virginia, Montana, and Kentucky, and all states in the top 10 highest per-capita COVID-19 rates voted for Trump in 2020. </p><p>The disparities in vaccine rates have also led to a sharp divergence in death rates at the county level. According to data analyzed by healthcare expert Charles Gaba cited by The Times, COVID-19 has killed 47 out of every 100,000 people in counties Trump won by over 70% but only 10 out of 100,000 people in counties where Trump received about a third of the vote share. </p><p>With efforts at persuading the unvaccinated continuing to hit a wall, some localities, colleges and universities, and employers are now mandating vaccination or weekly testing as a condition of employment or entering indoor venues.</p><p>But vaccine requirements have been flashpoints in political tugs-of-war between Republican governors like Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Gov. Greg Abbott, who have moved to ban such mandates, and localities and private businesses who have sought to impose them. </p><p>The Biden administration is taking a more aggressive stane countering vaccine refusal, with Biden recently introduicing new mandates including a federal requirement for employers with 100 or more workers to establish a vaccination or weekly testing mandate for employees.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-vaccine-refusal-continues-to-wallop-impact-republican-states-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/O1SiXwUvImo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:18:21 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6130d86a9ef1e50018f961e5?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"3603010e055a9177a7886d648d4c922b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn76@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-39-226_1246a663e54d3348.webp","destWidth":3564,"destHeight":2673,"sourceBytes":282218,"destBytes":282218,"author":"gpanetta@businessinsider.com (Grace Panetta)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fb1d670729770012b9b073?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-37-144_7c2841f17d97ea3b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-37-727_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn43@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-33-549_d4bfcb936c94206a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn44@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-32-678_c9ad036155091495.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-35-450_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=O1SiXwUvImo:0NhzZH8AKZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn31@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-38-567_69491bdfb7a71812.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/O1SiXwUvImo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn27@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-35-831_d704419deb56b586.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761728355},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:28","title":"The best phones in 2021","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-phones","description":"<bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><strong>The best phones have never been more powerful or more attractive looking.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>We&#39;ve researched and tested dozens of smartphones to bring you the best ones you can buy.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Among today&#39;s phones, the iPhone 12 is our top pick for most people, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 is best for Android fans. </strong></li>\n</ul><p>You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the major flagship smartphones that have been released in 2020 and 2021 so far.

It has the best overall combination of price, design, screen quality, performance, features, battery life, longevity, and camera quality out of any smartphone. But it will likely be replaced by the iPhone 13 as the top phone soon. </strong></p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Premium design, excellent performance, fantastic camera quality, Apple's ecosystem</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Charger not included, still uses Lightning instead of USB-C for charging, 60Hz iPhone screen is not as smooth and fluid as Android rivals' 90Hz or 120Hz screens</p><p>On its own, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iPhone 12</a> isn't much more special than Android alternatives that also come with top specs and features. The reasons why the iPhone 12 series in general places above Android alternatives as the top overall smartphone is mostly due to the magnificent Apple ecosystem, including AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac computers that connect with each other seamlessly to offer useful features. More unique to Apple is the company's physical presence with its stores that gives users a clear place to go for support.</p><p>Another major reason for recommending the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iPhone 12</a> series over Android alternatives is the timely iOS operating system updates that Apple delivers, and iPhones are supported for longer than any Android rival.&#160;</p><p>For most people, we recommend the standard $800 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iPhone 12</a> for its value and core feature set rather than the Pro series that start at $1,000. Most importantly, both phones share the same A14 processor, so they have similar performance, if not identical, for running apps and iOS. The extra features you get in the iPhone 12 Pro series mostly focus on enhanced camera hardware and software, like an extra camera lens for zoom, a LiDar scanner for better portrait mode shots in low light, and the Pro RAW mode for finer editing capabilities. Those are great, but aren't necessary for the complete iPhone experience that the iPhone 12 delivers, especially for the Pro series' $200 premium.&#160;&#160;</p><p>And, for those who prefer smaller phones for one-handed usability, the $700 iPhone 12 Mini with a 5.4-inch screen is an ideal alternative.</p><p>Apple still sells the iPhone 12 for $100 less than its $800 launch price after the company announced the iPhone 13. It's still a great phone to buy today, but you may want to hold off on buying a new iPhone until reviews for the iPhone 13 come out.</p>\n\tThe best Android phone\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60006804a8de7700187d3d72?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S21 pink\" height=\"1318\" width=\"1760\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Samsung</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><strong>Samsung's <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545199829300418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21</a> proves to be the best Android phone you can buy so far in 2021. It has the best balance of design, performance, features, camera versatility and quality, and price than any other Android smartphone.</strong></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Premium design, latest specs and highest performance on Android, triple-lens camera system, reduced pricing compared to last year's generation</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Photos can have an overly processed look, doesn't support Samsung's full 45W charging, 25W charger not included</p><p>Indeed, inside the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545199829300418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21</a> is the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor that delivers fast performance. Combined with 8GB of memory (RAM), the Galaxy S21 can easily handle workloads from users who often use and switch between lots of different apps without reloading.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545199829300418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21</a> also has Samsung's signature best-in-class display with vibrant colors, dynamic contrast, and incredible brightness. It's a 120Hz refresh rate screen at 1080p resolution, which makes for an ultra-smooth and premium experience while navigating around Android and swiping around apps. At 6.1-inches, the screen and overall size of the Galaxy S21 is best suited for those who like mid-sized phones, as on-screen items are still reachable with your thumbs if you prefer smaller phones that can be used one-handed. If you like larger phones, the Galaxy S21 Plus and its 6.7-inch screen will suit nicely.&#160;</p><p>The triple-lens camera system on the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545199829300418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21</a> offers a 12-megapixel (MP) standard wide lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with 120-degrees field-of-view, and a 64MP 3x hybrid zoom lens that can go all the way up to 30x digital zoom. Camera quality is as expected from Samsung &#8212; that's to say you'll get beautiful photos if you don't mind the occasional over-processed look that can make them appear pre-enhanced. If you have experience with Samsung phones and you've liked the photos they produce, you won't have any issues here. However, if you prefer less processing on your photos, your best bet on Android is going to be Google's Pixel 5.&#160;</p><p>You get a big 4,000mAh battery in the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545199829300418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21</a> that will last a full day of varied usage. It can charge at speeds up to 25W, which is fast enough, but Samsung unfortunately has not included a 25W charger with the phone. That means your older charger from your older phone may not charge the Galaxy S21 at its full capable speeds, and you'll have to buy your own charger. It does not support Samsung's 45W charger, either.&#160;</p><p>Back to positive news, Samsung dropped the price tag down $200 compared to its previous generation of Galaxy S20 devices, making the Galaxy S21's $800 price tag much more reasonable in the premium Android phone category. That's still expensive, but <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-raises-the-bar-for-mobile-experience-innovation-committing-to-three-generations-of-android-os-upgrades\">Samsung announced</a> in August 2020 that it promises to update Android on some of its Galaxy phones for up to three generations of Android. That extends the relevance of the Galaxy S21, as well as the usable lifespan of the device should users want to stay up to date with the latest versions of Android.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best phone for photography\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/600067eba8de7700187d3d6e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra back\" height=\"1339\" width=\"1786\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Samsung</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><strong>Samsung's <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545235880730320\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> is the best phone for photography, and that's largely due to the sheer versatility that its quad-camera lens system has to offer.&#160;</strong></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Widest range of camera lenses, 108-megapixel sensor makes for ultra-detailed photos, best zooming in any phone, 4K and 8K video recording, \"pro\" mode and and RAW, useful video recording features</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Photos can appear overly processed at times</p><p>Indeed, the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545235880730320\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> has a 108MP standard wide lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 10MP 3x zoom lens, and a 10x zoom lens that can digitally zoom all the way up to 100x zoom.&#160;</p><p>To be sure, the iPhone 12 Pro Max takes great photos that are arguably better than the Galaxy S21 Ultra's, which can seem overly processed at times, but it can't compete against the Galaxy S21 Ultra's specs or versatility.</p><p>The 108MP standard lens on the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545235880730320\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> actually takes 12MP photos by default, but users can quickly switch on the 108MP mode that captures more detail. That extra detail becomes apparent when you zoom into a 108MP photo.&#160;</p><p>The Galaxy S21 Ultra also has superior zooming capabilities over any other phone we know about. By having two zoom lenses at different magnifications, the Galaxy S21 Ultra can take clear and detailed zoomed photos at a wider range of distance.</p><p>But, don't swoon over the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730545235880730320\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>'s 100x ability &#8212; zooming at such distances produces bad, blurry photos with little value.

It also comes with a good camera, as well as a large, power-efficient 6.6-inch 720p resolution screen.&#160;&#160;</p><p>But, to maximize power efficiency, you're not getting a lot of frills or premium features, and that's the way it goes if you value battery life. You're not getting super high-resolution displays with high refresh rates, no 5G connectivity speeds, no wireless charging, no NFC for mobile contactless payments, no telephoto or ultra-wide camera lenses, and not the fastest processor. But, you are getting a great, basic core smartphone experience that has arguably all you really need in a smartphone.&#160;</p><p>Included with the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1730546336088412381\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Moto G Power</a> is a 10W charger that's not especially fast, but the phone supports up to 15W charging speeds, if you happen to have a phone charger that outputs 15W or more.</p><p>While three days is the official claim, battery life will likely vary depending on what you do on the phone. If you play a lot of games, you'll surely experience less than three days. Same goes if you're a heavy user who keeps the screen on and runs apps all day.

That extra power from the Snapdragon 865+ causes more heat, which normally leads to processors automatically slowing themselves down to prevent overheating, but Asus thought of that, and this is a gaming phone, afterall.

That way, they're easier to handle for younger kids, and the blow from kids' phones getting lost or broken will be less impactful. While these are less expensive phones, they're no duds, either. Getting a phone that's too underpowered means it won't last very long in terms of usability, and phones aren't like clothes &#8212; they last longer than growing kids' clothing.&#160;&#160;</p><p>It used to be the case that iPhones were too expensive to realistically suggest for kids, but the $400 iPhone SE changed that. While it's certainly still expensive, it's the cheapest and smallest iPhone that comes with recent specs to ensure longevity. It's the best option for parents or guardians who use iPhones, as they will be familiar with the iOS operating system, ecosystem, and it's easier to get accustomed with the parental controls that are built into iOS.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://mysupport.apple.com/add-coverage/producttypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AppleCare+ for iPhone</a> extended warranty is also a good safety net to get for a kid's iPhone, seeing as you get two cheaper repairs up to twice a year and theft/loss coverage.</p><p>For Android families, your best bet is the $350 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CFSZLQ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=bipgf_020618_best-smartphones-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08CFSZLQ4&#38;linkId=651947bb21f697abb7abc796402ccbc2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Google Pixel 4a</a> for familiarity with the Android operating system, built-in parental controls, as well as for its relatively low price, good performance, and small size.

There are many other great options that we haven't included in our top four for various reasons. Here's what else we considered:</p><p><strong>OnePlus 9:</strong> The OnePlus 9 series are fine, powerful, and feature-rich phones, but they didn't quite make the cut. The cameras aren't quite up to snuff, which we could excuse if their price tags were lower.&#160;</p><p><strong>Google Pixel 5:</strong> We also considered Google's latest Pixel 5, and we recommend it for those looking for the best camera quality in any phone. With that said, the Pixel 5's good-but-mid-range Snapdragon 765G processor and performance doesn't pull its $700 weight, especially when other $700 phones come with higher specs.</p><p>But Pixel phones typically get new Android features before other phones, and that's continuing in 2021. Later this year, the Pixel will be getting first dibs on recently announced updates, including photography upgrades to help better capture skin color and curly hair, custom color palettes for apps based on your background photo, and a Cinematic Movement feature &#8211; which creates moving pictures across any of your photos.

He would bring packages he didn&#39;t want to deliver &#34;back to the station,&#34; he said.</p><p>In a comment on the video, Paterno said: &#34;There&#39;s actually a lot of us doing this but I&#39;m the only one posting.&#34; He didn&#39;t provide any evidence for this.</p><p>Some TikTok users said Paterno&#39;s actions could prevent people from getting access to medical deliveries.

Power revealed its <a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2021-north-america-airport-satisfaction-study\">2021 North America Airport Satisfaction Study</a> on Wednesday, naming Miami International Airport as the top mega airport in the US, earning 828 out of a possible 1,000 customer satisfaction points. The data analytics company looked at six factors in ranking each airport, including, from most to least important, terminal facilities; airport arrival/departure; baggage claim; security check; check-in/baggage check; and food, beverage, and retail.</p><p>Overall, mega airports, which J.D. Power defines as having more than 33 million passengers per year, received an average score of 798, up 18 points from 2020. This year saw a record-setting average score of 802 for all US airports, though the highest customer satisfaction occurred in the first half of the study (July 2020 to January 2021) when passenger traffic was still low and dropped in the second half (January 2021 to July 2021) as volume picked up. </p><p>&#34;Airport customer satisfaction reached all-time highs when passenger volumes were severely suppressed by the pandemic, but as leisure travel rebounded sharply throughout the spring and summer of 2021, we saw an expected downturn in satisfaction. Ultimately, the data conveys changing expectations among travelers. Early in the pandemic, passengers were satisfied with any shop or restaurant being open, but they now expect full service at the airport,&#34; explained Michael Taylor, travel intelligence lead at J.D. Power.</p><p>While passenger volumes have increased to 75% of pre-pandemic levels, according to J.D. Power, many travelers are arriving at airports with limited food, beverage, and retail options, which are key for a good airport experience. The company says <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-wages-sign-on-bonus-airport-restaurants-poaching-workers-2021-6\">labor shortages are to blame for the lack of vendors</a>.</p><p>Here&#39;s a closer look at J.D.

introduction. Meanwhile, Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 2-in-1 detachable laptops have offered a laptop that could double as a tablet while running Windows for years. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ipad-pro-review-m1-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPad Pro (M1)</a> is brand-new for 2021, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surface Pro 7</a> just got a major price cut, so it&#39;s important for anyone on the market to know how they stack up.</p><p>This is especially true now considering that the Surface Pro 8 has been announced, which has seen the previous Surface Pro 7 price drop to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as low as $549 already on Microsoft&#39;s online store</a>. This makes for an interesting comparison considering you could get a complete Surface Pro 7 package with a keyboard for much less than the latest iPad Pro.</p><h2>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 vs. Apple iPad Pro: Which is best?</h2><p>If you know you need the flexibility of the Windows operating system, there&#39;s no getting around that. Apple&#39;s iPadOS is just a little more locked down and may not support all the software you need. It also doesn&#39;t behave at all like the laptop&#39;s you might be used to, though iPadOS keeps getting better in that regard.</p><p>But, if your needs are more flexible, the Apple iPad Pro doesn&#39;t give the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> much room to shine.

Even the base model of the iPad Pro features enough performance to challenge even the most expensive Surface Pro 7 model. The iPad Pro display is also far better geared up for HDR content consumption. </p><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 220px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Surface Pro 7</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>iPad Pro (M1)</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Price</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">From $549</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">From $799</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Storage</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Memory</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">4GB, 8GB, 16GB</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">8GB, 16GB</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Processor</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">Intel Core i3-1005G1 up to Core i7-1065G7 (up to Core i7-1165G7 for Surface Pro 7+)</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">Apple M1</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Display</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">12.3-inch (2736 x 1824); 11&#34; (1,668 x 2,388, 600 nits)</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">12.9&#34; (2,048 x 2,732, 1600 nits)</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Estimated battery life</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">10.5 hours</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">10 hours</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Ports</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">USB-C, USB-A, 3.5mmm headphone, Surface Connect, microSDXC</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">USB 4/Thunderbolt, Apple Smart Connector</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Cameras</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">5MP front, 8MP rear</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">12MP front, 12MP rear wide, 10MP rear ultra-wide</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Weight</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">1.7 pounds</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">1.03 lbs (11-inch), 1.5 lbs (12.9-inch)</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 22px;\"><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\"><strong>Speakers</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">1.6W stereo</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 22px;\">Quad speakers</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Keyboard</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Not included</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Not included</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Authentication</strong></td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Windows Hello face sign-in</td><td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Face ID</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Performance </h2><p>Apple keeps it pretty simple by offering the same powerful M1 processor in all the 2021 iPad Pros.

The higher-end Surface Pro 7 models can keep better pace with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a>, but Apple has a class-leading chip on its hands with the M1, and the Surface Pro 7 models just won&#39;t keep up when really pushed. </p><p>That said, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> runs a full Windows operating system with all the versatility that allows, such as more direct file management, customizing your home screen, and downloading apps and files freely through a web browser or other sources.</p><p>Since iPadOS is more locked down, you may find fewer occasions to actually push the M1 chip to its limits. The extra performance in a higher-end Surface Pro 7 may help with future-proofing, but both machines will offer a zippy experience in most general workloads - excluding the Core i3 model.</p><h2>Battery life and features</h2><p>The Surface Pro 7 and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> are both boasting similar battery life. Each tout something in the 10-hour ballpark, which could see either take the lead in real-world use. What separates the two devices more is their features. This division comes down more to their operating systems than anything else, though.</p><p>Both the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> and iPad Pro function as standalone tablets, though we&#39;d argue the iPad Pro is better suited in that role. They each have displays that support active styluses with pressure sensitivity, tilt, and palm rejection. These make both devices suited for drafting, drawing, and note-taking.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614e2f8cb414c10018625e61?format=jpeg\" alt=\"surface pro 7 2019\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Surface Pro 7 is a better computer than it is a tablet, as the Windows OS and the apps it runs aren&#39;t especially well designed for touch input.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>Both devices support attachable keyboard covers and trackpads or mice for navigation. That said, iPadOS has only recently gained support for mice as a replacement for touch inputs, and the interactions may feel clunky for anyone more used to a conventional mouse or trackpad on Mac or PC. By contrast, despite Windows having supported touch input for years, the operating system still feels poorly designed for the navigation method.</p><p>Apple comes out ahead in terms of cameras, especially considering the inclusion of a second rear camera and even a LiDAR sensor on the 12.9-inch model. Both devices offer comparable face recognition unlock methods with their front cameras, though. </p><p>Microsoft turns it around in flexibility, though. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> offers more ports, including USB-A (standard USB), USB-C, a headphone jack, and even a microSD card port, to connect with various accessories. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro has a single USB-C port.</p><h2>Design and display</h2><p>The Surface Pro 7 is a bit dated next to the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a>, and that leaves a lot going in favor of Apple&#39;s tablet. </p><p>Apple can pack in a 12.9-inch display into a frame that&#39;s less than 3 square inches larger than the Surface Pro 7, which has a 12.3-inch display.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614e2fe82fb46b0019be1102?format=jpeg\" alt=\"a woman in a blue shirt stands at a table of iPad Pros\" height=\"3600\" width=\"4800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The iPad Pro benefits from incredible performance compared to lower tier Surface Pro 7 models.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mark Lennihan/Associated Press</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>Though both devices offer very sharp resolutions, Apple is also offering a better display. Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> screen can&#39;t get nearly as bright as either iPad Pro&#39;s, especially the iPad Pro 12.9&#39;s Mini LED display, which can hit up to 1,600 nits. HDR on the iPad Pro also benefits from these display upgrades, making Apple&#39;s device the better choice for consuming content.</p><p>You&#39;ll find premium metal frames on both devices, but Microsoft does benefit from its prioritization of laptop use cases. Where the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> is just a tablet you can pair with a keyboard case, the Surface Pro 7 is more like a laptop that just doesn&#39;t include a keyboard, and laptops are meant to be stood upright. So, Microsoft&#39;s inclusion of a quality kickstand on the Surface Pro 7 makes it easy to set up for hands-free viewing or to use with any Bluetooth keyboard under the sun without needing a separate stand to hold the tablet up - no such luck with the iPad Pro. </p><h2>Operating system and apps</h2><p>The differences between the operating systems and app ecosystems of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-announces-ipados-software-operating-system-for-ipad-wwdc-2019-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPadOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/windows-10-review-2015-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows 10</a> are extensive and can&#39;t be covered comprehensively here, but we&#39;ll provide an overview. Windows 10 on the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> is as flexible as ever. It provides access to a rich ecosystem of programs and apps, and you can get them from any source you prefer, whether that be the Microsoft App Store, directly from the program&#39;s creator, or through alternative digital marketplaces. These programs are generally fully-featured versions.</p><p>Even better is the fact that <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surface Pro 7 is eligible for the upcoming Windows 11 upgrade</a>. That will make this tablet just as current as Apple&#39;s as far as operating systems are concerned. Chances are high that we&#39;ll see updates to Surface Pro 7 on the Windows 11 path for at least a few years to come.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/614e3039b414c10018625ea0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Microsoft Surface Pro 7\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Surface Pro 7 doesn&#39;t come included with the keyboard cover, which is sold separately and adds to the cost.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>This puts the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> in a more serious pinch here. The operating system is still largely more restrictive, limiting what software you can install and where you can get it from. But, the iPad app ecosystem is also fairly extensive. If there&#39;s software you want that&#39;s not available, there will likely be a fairly capable alternative.</p><p>Sometimes the apps you&#39;ll find will not offer all the same features as the desktop versions, as has been the case with some of Adobe&#39;s popular creative apps, but that list is shrinking slowly. If you&#39;re coming from macOS or Windows, you&#39;ll just want to research the specific iPadOS version of apps you need to confirm they still support all the features you rely on.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>With the Surface Pro 8 finally here, Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> occupies a new budget space (albeit with far better performance than most budget computers) for at least the rest of 2021. It&#39;s also simply better positioned as a laptop than the iPad Pro is, using a laptop-first interface.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> received a serious refresh in 2021 with a great redesign, a massive upgrade to internals that will have most Ultrabooks shaking in their boots, and a display that can outshine the competition. In this match-up, the Surface Pro 7 gets a leg up on the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement with the flexibility of its Windows operating system paired with its now budget-friendly pricing.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"small\" data-pid=\"6086d988a3247900115896a3\" data-purchase-option=\"\">11-inch iPad Pro (2021)

If the monarch had plowed that money into an investment generating a modest after-tax return of 6% a year, the country&#39;s coffers would be overflowing with more than $1 quadrillion by 1963, or 3,000 times its national debt, the investor pointed out.</p><p>Meanwhile, the &#34;Mona Lisa&#34; was insured at a value of $100 million in 1962, or over $900 million in today&#39;s dollars.</p><p>&#34;I trust this will end all discussion in our household about any purchase of paintings qualifying as an investment,&#34; Buffett quipped. His comments <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DividendGrowth/status/1432890602874707971\">resurfaced this month</a> courtesy of Dividend Growth Investor, a Twitter user who tweets about investing.</p><p>The famed boss of Berkshire Hathaway might not view art as a worthwhile holding, but he considers his job to be something of an art form.</p><p>&#34;Investing is the art of laying out cash now to get a whole lot more cash later on,&#34; he said at Berkshire&#39;s annual shareholder meeting in 1998. He also described valuing businesses as an &#34;art&#34; during the next year&#39;s meeting.</p><p>Moreover, Buffett has compared building a business to crafting a painting. He deployed that analogy to persuade the cofounder of National Indemnity, Jack Ringwalt, to sell his insurance company to Berkshire in 1967, he recalled at the annual meeting in 2000.</p><p>The investor asked Ringwalt if he would be happy to have a trust officer dispose of his life&#39;s work the day after he died. He reassured the entrepreneur that Berkshire would respect and not resell his business, and also allow him to continue &#34;painting&#34; it.</p><p>&#34;We won&#39;t come in and tell you to use reds instead of yellows or anything like that,&#34; Buffett recalled telling Ringwalt. &#34;So even though it&#39;s a masterpiece now, you can keep adding to it.&#34;</p><p>The Berkshire chief took the metaphor even further, framing his conglomerate as a collector of fine art.</p><p>&#34;We like to think we&#39;re the Metropolitan Museum of businesses and that we can get really outstanding creations to reside in our museum,&#34; he said.</p><p>Buffett has also described Berkshire - which owns scores of subsidiaries including Geico and See&#39;s Candies as well as multibillion-dollar stakes in Apple, Coca-Cola, and other public companies - as his magnum opus.</p><p>&#34;I regard Berkshire Hathaway sort of like a painter regards a painting, the difference being the canvas is unlimited,&#34; Buffett <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-bob-woodward-microsoft-bill-gates-37-billion-deal-2020-10\">said</a> in 2016.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-great-investors-traits-richer-wiser-happier-william-green-2021-9?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">&#39;Richer, Wiser, Happier&#39; author William Green interviewed dozens of the world&#39;s best investors.

That&#39;s 7% below the S&#38;P 500&#39;s actual Q2 earnings results of $52.80 per share.</p><p>The drop in S&#38;P 500 earnings estimates is surprising due to seasonal trends and recent corporate behavior, DataTrek highlighted. In economic expansions since the 1990s, Q3 earnings results are either the same or slightly higher than Q2 results. </p><p>Meanwhile, US businesses are signaling continued strength in their earnings results based on aggressive hiring trends amid a tight labor market, DataTrek said. </p><p>&#34;Would companies be hiring and advertising open positions as aggressively as the US labor market data shows if they were expecting a 7% sequential drop in profitability? It seems unlikely,&#34; DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said.</p><p>And the US corporate bond market isn&#39;t signaling any stresses that would suggest a deterioration in earnings power, with low yields suggesting that cash flows should remain high and stable for years to come.</p><p>&#34;In +30 years of covering US equity markets, we can&#39;t think of a time when analysts have so seriously underestimated US corporate earnings power in any given year,&#34; Colas said. </p><p>But according to DataTrek, investors think Wall Street analysts have it wrong based on the quick recovery in recent stock market sell-offs, most recently being the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/evergrande-stock-market-selloff-what-to-know-debt-crisis-china-2021-9\">Evergrande sell-off</a> and ensuing recovery last week.</p><p>&#34;The market thinks, rightly in our opinion, that US corporate earnings have one more leg higher versus Wall Street expectations,&#34; Colas concluded. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

about the situation and announced a fresh review of the ethics rules surrounding stock trades.</p><p>&#34;We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission, and that&#39;s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials,&#34;
