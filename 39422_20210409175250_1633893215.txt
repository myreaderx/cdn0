A Mathematical Answer</a></span></strong><br /> Adam Grealish (Betterment)<br /> <strong>March 9, 2021</strong><br /> <em>It goes without saying that this is a hard question to answer. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">But we can borrow a page from modern quantitative finance to help us arrive at a potential answer.</span> For years, Wall Street “quants” have used a mathematical framework to manage their portfolios called the Black-Litterman model. Yes, the “Black” here is the same one from the famous Black-Scholes options pricing formula, Fischer Black. And “Litterman” is Robert Litterman, a longtime Goldman Sachs quant.</em><br /> <em>Without getting into too much detail, the model starts with a neutral, “equilibrium” portfolio and provides a mathematical formula for increasing your holdings based on your view of the world. What’s amazing is that it incorporates not just your estimate about how an investment might grow, but also your confidence in that estimate, and translates those inputs into a specific portfolio allocation.</em></p> \n<p><span id=\"more-15846\"></span></p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/820-bitcoin-magic-internet-money.html\">Bitcoin: Magic Internet Money</a></span></strong><br /> Alex Pickard (Research Affiliates)<br /> <strong>January 2021</strong><br /> <em>Regardless of the reason for BTC’s astronomical price movement, investors should resist the temptation to chase the price. Extreme fluctuations in price invalidate claims that BTC is a store of value. Neither is it a capital asset, merely an entry in a digital ledger. BTC does not generate cash flows, and its only real use is to sell to someone else. High transaction fees make it a poor currency and negate claims of fungibility. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">The price of BTC is nearly certainly a bubble and likely manipulated.

In short, Bitcoin offers a highly attractive opportunity for managers who are long term focused and willing to expand their investment universe. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">One of the key takeaways is that Bitcoin’s reputed volatility is very real and will necessarily require that portfolio managers and boards allocate in a way consistent with their risk tolerance.

According to the popular belief one of the key characteristics of bitcoin is its excessive volatility. This paper provides evidence that high volatility of bitcoin is largely a misconception. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">We show that bitcoin return fluctuations are lower than those of roughly 900 different stocks in the S&amp;P1500 and 190 stocks in the S&amp;P500. Moreover, we find that bitcoin is less volatile than commodities such as oil and silver, US Treasuries, AAA-rated corporate bonds, EU carbon credits, and some of the most popular technology and media stocks: Apple, Twitter, and Netflix.</span> Equally important, we find that during the March 2020 stock market crash triggered by COVID-19, bitcoin volatility was lower than most of the above-mentioned asset classes. Significant decline in bitcoin volatility over the last decade renders it more “investable” by conservative investors.</em></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3791745\">Bitcoin vs Inflation: Can Bitcoin Be a Macro Hedge?

Over a decade later, there is still no consensus across different market regulations on the classification, use cases, policies, and economic implications of bitcoin. However, there is an increasing demand for digital currency, as an alternative to fiat currency which would spur financial innovation and inclusion. This study reviews regulations on digital assets across countries. It further discusses some use cases for bitcoin to reduce financial risk and facilitate cross border transactions. The study also discusses challenges related to bitcoin such as: cryptocurrencies substitution, cross border financing, cyber risk and security, and benefits in terms of the effect of coronavirus on the speed of capital market innovation and hence bitcoin usage. The study concludes by examining the economic effect of bitcoin halving events on the U.S. capital market to better understand the influence of bitcoin on financial markets and key drivers of its intrinsic value. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">The empirical evidence from this study suggests that bitcoin halving events are associated with significant negative stock market reaction, signaling a trading tradeoff between cryptocurrencies and U.S. stock markets.</span></em></p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779360\">When to Buy and When to Sell Bitcoin?</a></span></strong><br /> Yosef Bonaparte (University of Colorado at Denver)<br /> <strong>February 4, 2021</strong><br /> <em>We employ several technical analyses models and account for investor’s sentiment to establish a benchmark on the optimal time to entry or to exit from the Bitcoin market. Unlike companies that they have quarterly earnings, Bitcoin is not a company with earning. Yet, we argue the Bitcoin “halving” is the closest to company’s earnings. Indeed, we show that one of the key determinant of Bitcoin price fluctuation is the Bitcoin “halving,” in terms of quantity and timing. We also examine how market distraction and liquidity influence Bitcoin price. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Thus, we suggest entry when stock market distraction and/or liquidity is high and we are approaching the halving; exit otherwise.

This research makes use of a Durbin-Watson test and a non-parametric runs test to test for weak-form efficiency, and two comprehensive event studies to test for semi-strong form and strong form efficiency. We conclude neither market can be considered efficient due to the presence of strong positive correlation, and inefficient reactions to our event studies. Despite this, each market became more efficient during the COVID-19 pandemic than before, due to the presence of weaker positive correlation during this timeframe, but inefficient, nonetheless. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Thus, the study finds that of the tested cryptocurrency markets, none can be consider wholly efficient.</span> This conclusion is consistent with the vast majority of existing literature.</em></p> \n<hr> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><i>Learn To Use R For Portfolio Analysis </i></span><br /> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1987583515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1987583515&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bookscs-20&amp;linkId=020f71fb53a3e09903f46845853c189b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quantitative Investment Portfolio Analytics In R:<br /> An Introduction To R For Modeling Portfolio Risk and Return</a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important;
