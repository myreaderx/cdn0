If you're like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?__hstc=20629287.baf2406400c73bbe46641b2b9cd8a38f.1563824949326.1584540014200.1584545281370.484&amp;__hssc=20629287.18.1584545281370&amp;__hsfp=3755920611\">almost half of marketers</a>, your answer probably includes ad placement and targeting.</p>  \n<p>As we know, targeted ads are used to find the most qualified leads by showing audiences content that's relevant to them.</p> \n<p>Targeted ads connect you with the leads that are going to be the most interested in what you offer.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>So, how can you be sure that you're generating the <em>most </em>qualified leads with your targeted ads? While there's no sure fire way to tell, there's an optimization strategy you may be missing: behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-targeting-blog?_ga=2.187036584.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Targeted advertising</a> allows you to use demographic information, including location or age, to surface ads to relevant audiences. Behavioral targeting uses web behavior as the determining factor, instead of demographics. This increases the impact ads have on audiences.</p> \n<p>Some of the criteria behavioral targeting looks at includes previously visited websites, search history, and past purchases.</p> \n<p>If a marketer spent 20 minutes browsing CRMs, Googling software prices, and reading customer management blogs, behavioral targeting would analyze those actions to show that person ads for a CRM product the next time they visited a site like Facebook.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is used to improve campaign effectiveness. The sales manager weighing their CRM options would likely be more interested in a product ad for one rather than an SEO strategist, making them a qualified lead for the software company.</p> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how behavioral targeting can boost sales. If I were in the market for a social media scheduler and browsed websites like <a href=\"https://www.loomly.com/\">Loomly</a> and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a> before turning to Google, the search engine's behavioral targeting features would show me ads for the sites I visited first.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png\" alt=\"a SERP that indicates previous web activity.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>My previous internet behavior told Google what type of sites I'd already visited, so the search engine pulled the top list of options that are related and relevant to my search. And, when I checked my Facebook account a little while later, I saw that my web behavior influenced my ads there, as well:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences-2.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"An ad being shown based on behavioral targeting.\">\n</div> \n<p>Pretty cool, right? And to run behavioral targeted ads, you wouldn't have to stray too far from your ad strategy. If your ad host offers targeted options, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/targeting.html\">Twitter</a> do, create audience segments based on demographics, like location and age. You can also choose psychographics, like interests and values.</p> \n<p>After that, the software will do the work, choosing browsers to show your content based on the preferences you set.</p> \n<p>So, now we know that behavioral targeting helps reach those leads who are intending to make purchases. But what about the potential customers who are in a different stage of their journey?</p> \n<p>Enter: predictive behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting uses website history to show users ads that relate to their interests. Predictive behavioral targeting is a form of analysis — it looks at those targeted ads as a whole, so advertisers can come to conclusions about audience interaction.</p> \n<p>For instance, this is a behavioral targeted ad I came across on Facebook. If I, and others with similar demographics, interact with the ad in the same way, WordStream's advertisers can infer that audiences like me respond well to similar content offer ads.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwordstream%2Fposts%2F10158788220547743&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=400&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>Predictive behavioral targeting helps improve the performance of ads for audience segments. It lets advertisers look critically at the similarities of customers and cater to them. This improves the effectiveness of behaviors being targeted.</p> \n<p>If you're still on the fence about using this strategy, don't worry. Let's look at the good and bad of behavioral targeting to help you make your decision.</p> \n<h2>Pros and Cons of Behavioral Targeting</h2> \n<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of ad types to choose from, and it's up to advertisers to choose ones that maximize the effectiveness of campaigns. Like with all types, behavioral targeting has its upsides and downsides. Let's look at a few.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting pros</h3> \n<h4>1. Nurture leads through the buyer's journey.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting helps you fill in the gaps you may have with your ad strategy. If you're seeing excellent <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">ROI</a> from brand awareness ads, but want to drive more conversions from content offer ads, behavioral targeting can help.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're using an ad to promote a new webinar you've hosted, turning on behavioral targeting will increase the ad's chance of reaching audiences who have been looking for webinars like yours.</p> \n<h4>2. Make more sales.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting makes retargeting a better experience for customers. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Retargeted ads</a> catch website visitors who have abandoned your site without making a purchase. Behavioral retargeting takes that up a notch by crawling more previous web visits.</p> \n<p>When you use behavioral retargeting, your ads will convey a more personalized message to audiences. They’ll remind those who closed your site to visit again with content that's already tailored to their interests.</p> \n<h4>3. Improve the overall customer experience.</h4> \n<p>When you analyze behavioral targeting results, you can begin to draw conclusions about how your audience engages with ads. For instance, if you find that millennial customers are looking for a certain product stack, you can start tailoring your ads in response.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting shows customers data-driven ads based on their web behavior. Based on the data you collect from the ads, like click-through rate and conversions, you can tweak the messaging or content of those ads to fit the browsing patterns of your audience.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting cons</h3> \n<h4>1. Behavioral targeting can get costly.</h4> \n<p>Running<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"> pay-per-click ads</a> isn't the most budget-friendly solution. Behavioral targeting falls under that umbrella, and it can get expensive. Make sure to check your advertising budget — and set budget caps — to make sure you have the financial bandwidth to produce ads for the entire campaign.</p> \n<h4>2. Ads can fail without proper audience knowledge.</h4> \n<p>If you don't know your audience, it's likely behavioral targeting won't give you positive results. Generally, the ads are shown based on audience segments you select. But, without proper knowledge of what customers respond to, there's room for lack of resonance from your target market.</p> \n<p>For instance, your buyer persona may be a 30-year-old marketer who's looking for a CRM to make the team she manages more organized. So, you decide to show that portion of your audience a brand awareness ad.</p> \n<p>But, if that ads messaging fails to capture the interest of the majority of your target audience, it won't be very effective. Behavioral targeting finds the right customers, but it's up to your ad to seal the deal. Make sure you're up-to-date with how your target market responds to ads to improve performance.</p> \n<h4>3. Behavioral targeting can lead to an advertising overload.</h4> \n<p>Be wary of producing too many. They can lead to an oversaturation of content and ultimately deter customers from wanting to engage with your ads. As a consumer, if I'm presented with numerous targeted ads from the same companies, I begin to mentally block out any advertising messages from that business.</p> \n<p>Use behavioral targeting sparingly. It'll save you money and catch customers at the right time. Be sure to modify your ad settings so you're not showing users targeted ads every five minutes, just which it's the most impactful.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is just one of the many <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot\">a</a><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">dvertising optimization strategies</a> that are great for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">generating leads</a>. It's also one of the most effective. If you're finding that your current ad strategies aren't producing the ROI you're looking for anymore, this tactic could be your answer.</p> \n<p>How do you plan to use behavioral targeting to revamp your ad strategy?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbehavioral-targeting&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png","linkMd5":"f97b818aca2bc9376620659d6e5d48f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/12/02-17-11-164_f003629dd2fd2f0c.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/12/02-17-11-164_f003629dd2fd2f0c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_1/2020/08/12/02-17-14-491_43ae2d15e1136c38.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbehavioral-targeting&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-17-14-241_b590d25d5967a41e.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:10","title":"Why A Digital PR Specialist Should Always Be Involved in Content Creation","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-pr-specialist-content-creation","description":"<p>If you've been on the creative side of content marketing, you know not every idea is a winner. Sometimes projects gather a few links and then vanish under a pile of other content.</p> \n<p>To compete, you have to ensure the content you're creating, from the idea to the actual execution, is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-generate-effective-content-ideas\">compelling</a> enough to earn the coverage and attention you hope it'll achieve.</p> \n<p>And there's one really excellent way to do this: involve a digital PR specialist from the get-go.</p> \n<p>I work in digital PR and have consulted on hundreds of content projects.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what I've learned about how content creators and digital PR professionals can successfully work together to create engaging, newsworthy content.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Recognize viral ideas.</h3> \n<p>Digital PR specialists are responsible for interacting and building relationships with the media, so they likely spend around 70% of their workday online.</p> \n<p>Typically, they're reading new studies, picking apart articles, and getting to know writers. It's only natural that after experiencing the nuances of the news cycle, PR specialists are able to recognize which ideas make it big.</p> \n<p>If that kind of market research already exists in the brains of the outreach specialists on your team, why not utilize it?</p> \n<p>Getting feedback from the birth of a project means the trajectory of the content will be aimed for top-tier coverage. From the idea stage, it may make sense to create a ranking system with your team.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can categorize each idea by newsworthiness, relevance, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas\">promotional viability</a> to get a better understanding of where your projects stand.</p> \n<p>From there, you can go back to the drawing board or work with your best concepts.</p> \n<p>Using your PR pros will help expand creative ideas from using only what the creative team thinks is interesting to using what publishers think is interesting. Who knows? A single tip from an outreach specialist could turn a mediocre campaign into a huge win for a client.</p> \n<p>For example, at <a href=\"https://www.frac.tl/\">Fractl</a>, one of our biggest recent wins in the career vertical involved pivoting an idea about millennial work/life balance to a survey packed with \"would you rather\" questions.</p> \n<p>This new formatting allowed the creative strategist to ask more hard-hitting questions and challenged millennials to give concrete information about how much they'd be willing to sacrifice in their personal lives in order to get ahead in business. Some of the notable takeaways included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>More than two in five millennials are willing to end a relationship if it meant getting a promotion at work.</li> \n <li>One in three would dump their S.O. for a raise.</li> \n <li>Millennials put their career before marriage: most are willing to postpone marriage for another seven years if it means they'd land a promotion.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Keep data human.</h3> \n<p>In a recent study from <a href=\"https://www.buzzstream.com/blog/creating-the-most-authoritative-content.html\">BuzzStream and Fractl</a>, consumers ranked data analysis and index as the most authoritative form of online content.</p> \n<p>Those who work in content production are exceptional at analyzing these numbers to reveal their hidden insights. However, it can be easy to get lost in the data while exploring every perspective and lose sight of the most compelling pieces.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can help bridge the gap between data and human interest. If there isn't a cohesive narrative weaved throughout your data, a digital PR specialist can pull from their experience in studying what kind of stories emotionally resonate, and can help identify the true story in the data.</p> \n<p>While analyzing data, touch base with your outreach team to develop a storyline. Be sure they identify the simplest ways to digest the information you're trying to get across. If it takes longer than 60 seconds to understand the information in a graph, you're going to lose your audience.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, content creators become attached to their data and believe every aspect is essential to the piece. While this may be true in some cases, oftentimes slimming down excess information can be beneficial to the narrative as a whole.</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid of feedback, and remember that outreach specialists spend <em>a lot</em> of time dissecting stories online. They're likely a trustworthy editor for your work.</p> \n<p>For example, when presenting repetitive information, it's important to provide interesting visuals to accompany data. When creating infographics about dangerous tools for a home improvement client, our team at Fractl decided to spice up statistics that would otherwise be mundane by placing the information within a tool shed.</p> \n<p>This project ended up being a winner within the home and garden vertical and I owe the promotional viability to the engaging way the information was presented.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&amp;name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png\" alt=\"Infographic helps humanize data.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If your data tells a story your audience wants to hear, graphs and images become as essential as the words on the page. Using industry knowledge from your outreach specialist's tool belt, you can elevate data-driven content to make it worthy of top-tier press.</p> \n<h3>3. Extract the juiciest takeaways.</h3> \n<p>You have a great idea, you research it, pull all the data, and it falls flat. Sometimes the stories you thought would be told through data don't come to fruition. But this doesn't mean your project is DOA, your outreach specialist may be able to revive it.</p> \n<p>Having an eye on the media means that outreach specialists may be able to extract something from a project that would have otherwise been overlooked. Digital PR pros can draw up some ideal headlines or takeaways to increase the project's chances of appealing to particular publishers and audiences.</p> \n<p>Whether it means tying the data to a trending story or pitching a vertical not initially intended to be a match for your content, there's usually always a way to distill data into a highly promotable headline.</p> \n<p>Chris Lewis, account manager and creative strategist at Fractl, said he incorporates feedback from media specialists into his projects.</p> \n<p>\"Outreach specialists are my secret weapon in creating compelling data-driven story content,\" he said. \"More than anything, they help me get out of my own way by always finding the promotable and most interesting parts of content and finding ways to highlight them.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Create better content.</h3> \n<p>Incorporating feedback from several team members throughout the life of a project can mean improved results from your content marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Consider hosting collaborative meetings every once in a while or implementing edits from your outreach specialists if an idea falls dry.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, using a digital PR specialist in your content creation will help you create promotable content because of the work with the media and interaction online.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-pr-specialist.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"7254e177cdc584fa16ca62f114c4c6b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-17-13-661_f795c443636f3a02.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-pr-specialist.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Delaney Kline","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/12/02-17-14-121_ba3466db66c4767b.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/12/02-17-12-914_cc7c73145b6ec61a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:10","title":"How to Conduct Research for an Infographic: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-research-infographics","description":"<p>They say a picture is worth 1,000 words.

Below is an example of my search for “blogging.” (Remember -- start with broad search terms.)</li> \n <li>Use the related search results to dig&nbsp;into the information your audience searches&nbsp;for so you can better tailor your infographic research.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blogging%20%20%20Google%20Search.png?width=254&amp;height=145&amp;name=blogging%20%20%20Google%20Search.png\" alt=\"blogging   Google Search.png\" width=\"254\" height=\"145\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends:</a></strong> This tool shows you how searches for a specific word or term have evolved over time. If searches for a certain term are increasing, that may be an angle to pursue in a piece of content. <br><br>Below is the search history of “blogging” over the past five years. From this result, it’s reasonable to assume that search volume for this term is on a slight decline, and that my research process could benefit from more specific search terms to really pinpoint my audience.</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blogging%20%20%20Explore%20%20%20Google%20Trends.png?width=669&amp;name=blogging%20%20%20Explore%20%20%20Google%20Trends.png\" alt=\"blogging   Explore   Google Trends.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"blogging   Explore   Google Trends.png\"> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\">Google Ads Keyword Planner:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool&nbsp;shows you the search volume of terms compared to similar terms. This is&nbsp;helpful to determine which words or set of several keywords, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr\">long-tail keywords</a>, are the most popular in search. These long-tail keywords will help determine the angle your content should address.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial-keywords-tool\">HubSpot SEO Marketing Software:</a></strong> If you're a HubSpot customer, this handy app has several of the above capabilities already built-in. You can use the tool to conduct general keyword research and narrow your focus when selecting a topic. For example, I once searched for “blogging” and found that “how to make money from blogging” has a high number of search terms, so I might consider that angle as the topic of my infographic.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Keep search terms broad to find lots of data.</h3> \n<p>Once you start to conduct&nbsp;research on the topic of your infographic, don’t limit your content by what angle you <em>think</em> the infographic should pursue. It’s smart to do general research on a topic so you gain a basic understanding, but be mindful that it can influence the information you’re searching for.</p> \n<p>For example, if you decided to focus your infographic on how to make money from blogging and only researched advertising as a means to achieve that goal, the data you pull won’t provide all of the information necessary to create a comprehensive infographic.</p> \n<p>Research a topic, not a particular story or angle, until you have more concrete data.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/\">Google Scholar:</a></strong>&nbsp;This resource serves as a great place to start your research. It’s a free search engine of scholarly literature on a variety of different topics and disciplines that will give you an idea of the type of data aggregated on the topics you research.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/\">JSTOR:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool provides a&nbsp;database of primary resources, such as journals, original research, and books. You may need to purchase login access ($19.50/month) or log in through the credentials of an academic institution you’re associated with.</li> \n <li><i><strong><a href=\"https://hbr.org/\">Harvard Business Review:</a></strong>&nbsp;HBR</i>&nbsp;is a scholarly magazine that publishes research, case studies, and statistics on a variety of different topics, including business, leadership, strategy, and economics.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Pull data from reputable, original, and validated sources.</h3> \n<p>When you find data during your research process, we recommend the following standards to decide&nbsp;whether or not to use it in your content:</p> \n<p><strong>Is it original?</strong></p> \n<p>Find the original data source for any statistics you encounter during your research process. Due to the plethora of different blogs and news outlets, many different websites can cite the same statistic without citing its original source. If you find a compelling data point that you want to use in your infographic, trace it to the original research source.</p> \n<p>If you can’t find the original source, the statistic is unsubstantiated and shouldn’t be used.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it reputable?</strong></p> \n<p>Another question to ask yourself <i>when</i> conducting research is <i>where</i> you’re conducting research. Any individual or organization can start a website and publish content, but that doesn’t mean all content on the internet can be taken as fact.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-marketing-2/how-to-do-research-for-an-infographic-video/\">Vertical Measures</a>&nbsp;recommends starting internet research on .gov, .edu, and .org sites, which are associated with governing bodies, educational institutions, and organizations with greater legitimacy than blogs or individuals.</p> \n<p><strong>Can it be validated?</strong></p> \n<p>Even if you find a statistic on a reputable source, you’re not done yet. <a href=\"https://raventools.com/blog/infographic-research/\">Raven Tools</a>&nbsp;recommends that researchers make sure to properly fact-check information they find by a) determining if it’s cited by any other organizations or b) checking the methodology of its original research. If the data point seems unreasonable, trust your instincts and dig deeper.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/\">Pew Research Center:</a></strong>&nbsp;\"From economic conditions, to political attitudes, to social media usage, the Pew Research Center website has a ton of free research that you can use to better understand your target market,\" noted HubSpot Content Strategy Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamioetting\">Jami Oetting</a>&nbsp;in her roundup of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">best market research tools</a>.&nbsp;Check out the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources?&amp;_ga=1.230592218.7546083.1477915232#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">full article</a> for even more related tools.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Research:</a></strong>&nbsp;Our very own research hub offers free market research data and <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/charts?_ga=1.150021622.170111609.1470925141\">presentation tools</a> to visualize your data.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Use recent data.</h3> \n<p>You've put time and resources into researching and designing a great infographic.</p> \n<p>Make sure you cite recent data so other sources will be interested in referencing&nbsp;your graphic once it's published.</p> \n<p>We recommend sticking with data that’s one to two years old so your graphic will be relevant for months to come.</p> \n<p>As a caveat, some original research data that would make a compelling case for your infographic may have set the standard for its industry more than two years ago.</p> \n<p>For example, I’ve referenced research on the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/PsychofCuriosity.pdf\">curiosity gap</a>&nbsp;that’s from 1994 in previous posts, as this original study coined the term that’s still used today.</p> \n<p>The trick is to find <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1308286\">more recent research</a>&nbsp;that re-tests and substantiates the original theory so it’s a legitimate data point, instead of simply dropping an older statistic into your infographic.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/advanced_search\"><strong>Google Advanced Search:</strong></a>&nbsp;This feature allows you to limit search results to a certain timeframe to search&nbsp;for only the most recent info available. If you have trouble, widen the time range slightly. To set this up, enter a search term, select ‘Search Tools’ in the menu bar at the top of the page, and narrow your results by choosing how recently you want the data to have been published.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google%20advanced%20search.png?width=640&amp;name=google%20advanced%20search.png\" alt=\"google advanced search results for blogging.png\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>With the feature above, you can filter your search engine results according to when articles were published and according to their domains (.gov, .edu, .org, .com), among other features.</p> \n<h3>6. Imagine how your data could be visualized.</h3> \n<p>Remember what Siege Media found?</p> \n<p>The most-shared infographics had an average of just under 400 words. This means that the graphics relied on data visualizations, charts, and illustrations to tell the data’s story.</p> \n<p>Research for a blog post is different than research for an infographic because visitors expect to read a blog, but they don’t necessarily anticipate close-reading a graphic.</p> \n<p>Think about data that can be turned into visuals while you research. Numbers, such as percentages, survey results, and change over time can be easily <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/data-visualization-choosing-chart-0?hs_preview=SwwNpWDi-4361706628#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">visualized</a>&nbsp;using graphs and charts.</p> \n<p>Are there categories within your data that you can visualize using icons or illustrations? Can you turn a multi-step process into a mini-graphic instead of writing it out?</p> \n<p>Analyze all of your research findings wearing the hat of an illustrator and ask yourself if there’s a balance between data that can be visualized and data that must be written out.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva:</a></strong> HubSpot Senior Content Strategist <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandazantalwiener\">Amanda Zantal-Wiener</a>&nbsp;wrote an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics#sm.000825bf4hgvedv10qu25jm8py60v\">article</a>&nbsp;about tools to make your own infographics, and Canva made the top of the list. Even if you won't design your infographic yourself, experiment with this design tool (and others on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics?&amp;_ga=1.235833927.7546083.1477915232#sm.00001jv8k2j9vzembr7434ir2v3u3\">the list</a>) to see how easily your data can, or cannot, be visualized.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>7. Use the data you've compiled to craft a story.</h3> \n<p>When you think you’re done with your research, try to lay out the story that your graphic will tell. You may even want to storyboard your infographic: Write out your data points, and lay them out according to the order they’ll be visualized in the infographic. Does the story make sense? If the story isn’t clear or obvious, then you’re not done researching.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the story you think your graphic should tell, but does your research data actually tell the story? <a href=\"http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-marketing-2/how-to-do-research-for-an-infographic-video/\">Vertical Measures</a>&nbsp;suggests that you let&nbsp;the research drive the topic and narrative of the infographic. If you’re stuck in what you think the data should be saying, you run the risk of citing your research in a way that manipulates the data.</p> \n<p>If a data point isn’t self-evident as a visualization, it’s probably not the right data point, or it doesn’t have the right context. Go back and gather more research if you can’t craft a story that makes sense with just the data -- If you have to fill in too much with text, it will make for a visually unappealing and potentially incorrect infographic.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trello-board-tips-for-teams#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">Trello</a>.</strong>&nbsp;This interactive planning and organizing tool lets you create cards that you can move around your board to organize in any way you want. You can storyboard using Trello by creating cards with different statistics on them and rearranging them to create a skeleton for your infographic.</li> \n <li><strong>Index Cards:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so this one requires you to get a little crafty, but it's actually my personal favorite method. Write out the key facts of your story and start laying them out on your desk to get an idea of your infographic’s flow.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. Choose a provocative fact to anchor your infographic.</h3> \n<p>Strong infographics are loaded with interesting data that’s beautifully illustrated. These infographics are shared when they prompt an emotional response.</p> \n<p>Content that shocks, disgusts, saddens, delights, or scares people performs well: Researchers Jacopo Staiano and Marco Guerini found that content that prompts feelings of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04723.pdf\">valence, arousal, and dominance</a>&nbsp;tends to go viral.</p> \n<p>Additionally, in an analysis of photos shared on Reddit,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.frac.tl/research/viral-emotions-study-2\">Fractl</a>&nbsp;found that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/shareable-content-emotions#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">positive emotions</a>&nbsp;were most likely to generate virality, but that content that provoked negative emotions with the right combination of arousal and dominance could be hits as well.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://raventools.com/blog/infographic-research/\">Raven Tools</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://killerinfographics.com/conducting-research-that-matters.html\">Killer Infographics</a>&nbsp;suggest finding a data point that gets to the heart of the topic you’re tackling to hook your reader and incite an emotion that will make them share your graphic. Then, use that hook as the infographic’s visual focal point, and build the rest of your story around it.</p> \n<p>Check out Siege Media’s meta <a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/most-popular-infographics\">infographic</a>&nbsp;about what makes infographics popular. They visualize and highlight the most surprising findings first to keep viewers scrolling, and then break down each finding with more research results.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/siegemedia.png?width=669&amp;name=siegemedia.png\" alt=\"siegemedia infographic example\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"siegemedia.png\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/infographics\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Image Source</span></a></p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google Search:</a>&nbsp;</strong>To avoid being&nbsp;repetitive, &nbsp;“[topic] + infographic” to see what else is out there. Ask yourself:&nbsp;<span>Has this angle already been covered, or would you provide a unique view on the topic?</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9. Get feedback from your peers.</h3> \n<p>This may seem obvious, but feedback is a critical step in determining when the research phase is over and when writing and designing your infographic can begin. Before presenting a design proposal to your manager or client, tap your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/peer-feedback-tips#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">peers</a>&nbsp;for their input. Ask questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you understand the story’s flow?</li> \n <li>Is the hook of the infographic interesting?</li> \n <li>Does this data need further explanation to make sense?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It’s often challenging to remove yourself from a project you’re immersed in to honestly edit it, so feedback during the research phase will identify any weaknesses that may need to be addressed with the help of further fact-finding.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive:</a></strong>&nbsp;Teams can provide feedback on documents and images by sharing them on Google Drive&nbsp;and leaving feedback comments.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740\">PDF Preview:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool lets you edit image files and share them with your team for feedback. They can add comments or delete items from the infographic and share their feedback with you by sending PDF or JPEG files back and forth.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Ready to Research?</h2> \n<p>In most cases, great&nbsp;data is the foundation of a successful infographic, so it’s worth investing time and efforts in finding the most relevant, current, and credible information out there.</p> \n<p>Key to the process is remaining open to letting the research inform the editorial strategy, instead of the other way around.

(Today, it’s infographics, but there’s a ton of other stuff you can create there, too.)</p> \n<p>Once you’ve let Canva know what you want to do, the site generates several templates you can use as a foundation for your infographic. Plus, it’s got a library of roughly 1,000,000 images that you can add to your project.</p> \n<p>From there, you can edit the text, background image, shapes and other aspects of the infographic to make it your own. And it’s so easy -- here’s a goofy one that I put together on how my dog spends his day:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png?width=669&amp;name=Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" alt=\"Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DACA4CZE14s/cbwuFIIiTFB1Zdcq_doPPw/view?utm_content=DACA4CZE14s&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton\">Image Source</a></em> </span></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://piktochart.com/\">Piktochart</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $24/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Piktochart2.png?width=669&amp;name=Piktochart2.png\" alt=\"Piktochart2.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Piktochart2.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>Similar to Canva, Piktochart can be used to design more than just infographics -- it can also build reports, presentations, and posters.</p> \n<p>But the templates available for infographics are numerous, and there’s an upgrade available. “Pro” memberships -- which run between $24 to $80, depending on the features you want -- allow access to even more templates, as well as removed watermarks and hi-res downloads.</p> \n<p>When it comes to creating the infographic itself, the features are fairly similar to Canva’s -- the background, text, and images can all be changed, or users can upload their own files for greater personalization.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://venngage.com/\">Venngage</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $19/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Vanngage.png?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Vanngage.png\" alt=\"Venngage infographic software steps\" width=\"600\" title=\"Venngage.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Like its predecessors above, Venngage has quite a few design features, including&nbsp;<span>an </span><a href=\"https://venngage.com\"><span>infographic maker</span></a><span> and&nbsp;</span>its great social media templates, which users can download to create their own personalized Instagram posts, blog headers, and more.</p> \n<p>For infographics, there's a decent range of templates, each categorized by type -- statistical, process, and timeline, to name a few.</p> \n<p>Some of the templates are limited to premium members, reflecting Venngage's four-tiered approach to pricing -- free, premium, education, and non-profit. Plus, there are templates available for those latter two categories. Here's one that helps non-profits visually communicate highlights from an annual report:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/bbc41da5-9284-44d3-a915-bec91ff75f26.png?noresize\" alt=\"Venngage Infographic\" width=\"669\" title=\"Venngage Infographic\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.easel.ly\">Easel.ly</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Starts at $4/month with special discounts for students and educators.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/easelly.png?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=easelly.png\" alt=\"easelly infographic templates\" width=\"600\" title=\"easelly.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Upon visiting Easel.ly's website, you're immediately presented with a plethora of infographic templates, most of which can be immediately clicked and customized without having to create an account. If you want to save and share your work, though, you will have to join -- for free.</p> \n<p>Unlike its predecessors listed here, Easel.ly seems to be a no-frills platform that's comprised of infographics. You can choose which category you'd like, but it's not quite as organized as some other sites -- the drop-down menu is a bit hidden to the left of the templates. Still, most of templates appear to be available for free (more become available with a Pro membership), and they're fairly easy to edit.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\">Freepik</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $7.50/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/freepik.png?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=freepik.png\" alt=\"freepik.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"freepik.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>As its name suggests, Freepik is a resource for, well, free pictures. Infographics are just one type, but after performing a search for them, there are plenty of options -- most of which are complimentary.</p> \n<p>The only drawback? Freepik doesn't quite allow the same level&nbsp;of customization that some others in this list do. You can download the images for free, but you’ll need a vector graphics editor in order to customize them -- Brittany Leaning and Megan Conley of HubSpot's content marketing team both suggest using <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html\">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://infogr.am\">Infogram</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> A limited number of options available for free, with paid packages available starting at $19/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infogram%20examples-1.png?width=600&amp;name=infogram%20examples-1.png\" alt=\"infogram examples\" width=\"600\" title=\"infogram examples-1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Like many of its visual peers, Infogram is a resource that helps users create both picturesque charts and infographics. It's definitely one of the more \"grown-up\" sites available for building these images, which might explain why very few of their tools a re free -- including restricting your work from public consumption.</p> \n<p>However, Infogram also has the option of enlisting professional help with infographic design. So if you're short on time and have a bit of room in your budget, this route might be the best one for you.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/\">Google Charts</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: Free</strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_charts.gif?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Google_charts.gif\" alt=\"Google_charts gif example\" width=\"600\" title=\"Google_charts.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Okay, maybe a chart isn’t exactly the same as an infographic. But, given the interesting selection templates made available by Google, we would be remiss to exclude it.</p> \n<p>There are a few items of value in Google charts. First, we love the selection of charts available. From animated bubble graphs -- like the one above -- to clever word trees, the features allow users to bring information to life. (I mean, admit it -- adding animation to data always makes it a little less boring.)</p> \n<p>Plus, these charts can be created to be interactive. One of our favorites, GeoCharts, allows data to be assigned to different regions of a map that appear when hovered over. Check it out:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_Geo_Charts.gif?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" alt=\"Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" width=\"600\" title=\"Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart\">Image Source</a></em> </span></p> \n<p>We'll admit that some features of Google Charts might be a bit more advanced than the other resources we’ve listed. But, if you’re ready to step up your visuals game, give it a try.</p> \n<h2>Start Creating Infographics</h2> \n<p>There's no shortage of resources when it comes to creating your own visuals -- charts, reports, and infographics. And, depending on your budget and needs, there's a veritable plethora of options available, all of which have their pros, with very few cons.</p> \n<p>Want to learn more about designing brilliant infographics? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographics-with-free-powerpoint-templates\">Check out these helpful tips</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fresources-for-creating-infographics&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/resources-for-designing-infographics.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"fba938449a6562b793d104947f750ea1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-17-12-789_d048dc2dbaa8bb3d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/resources-for-designing-infographics.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Amanda Zantal-Wiener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Canva-16.png?width=600&name=Canva-16.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/12/02-17-12-835_cfaa08a627856143.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png?width=669&name=Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/12/02-17-15-059_8516b0a93c76b0c1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Piktochart2.png?width=669&name=Piktochart2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-17-12-743_99f03e97d8ab3710.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Vanngage.png?noresize&width=600&name=Vanngage.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-17-13-285_773ab0960b65f583.webp","https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/bbc41da5-9284-44d3-a915-bec91ff75f26.png?noresize":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-17-13-128_eb42a7670a367740.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/easelly.png?noresize&width=600&name=easelly.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/12/02-17-12-946_1b94ce1f79060b1d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/freepik.png?noresize&width=669&name=freepik.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/12/02-17-13-298_7dfd1560c61ec582.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infogram%20examples-1.png?width=600&name=infogram%20examples-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-17-12-865_809907476669fb88.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_charts.gif?noresize&width=600&name=Google_charts.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-17-14-041_01640727dad5e3fa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_Geo_Charts.gif?noresize&width=600&name=Google_Geo_Charts.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/12/02-17-13-210_1a165a7d66171e7f.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fresources-for-creating-infographics&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/12/02-17-12-778_4f9c272a6eea9c51.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:09","title":"Writing for SEO: How to Write Blogs That Rank on Page 1 of Google","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo","description":"<p>If you've ever written a blog post before, you know how much time they can take.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>From topic selection, to gathering research, to writing the post and pressing \"Publish,\" the process often demands hours.</p> \n<p>That's why, if your post <em>doesn't</em> earn the traffic you expected, it can be a major letdown. All that work that goes into a post for less-than-stellar engagement is, no doubt, one of the most frustrating experiences.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there's a way to combat low traffic and bring eyes to your writing: search engine optimization. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\"><span>SEO</span></a> is a language that speaks specifically to search engines like Google to tell it your post deserves to be at the top of search engine results pages (SERPs).</p> \n<p>As marketers, we're always aiming to write content that'll rank highly on Google, and SEO is the bridge that'll help you get there.</p> \n<p>Of course, that begs the question: How do you write in SEO's language?</p> \n<p>For that, don't worry — we've got you covered. In this post, we're going to dive into 13 ways you can master writing for that high ranking your content deserves.</p> \n<p>Ready to get started?</p> \n<h3>1. Use headings to your benefit.</h3> \n<p>Headers tell Google what different sections of your blog article will be about. In this post, for example, the header, \"How To Write Blog Posts for SEO,\" tells the search engine what this section is about.</p> \n<p>Users who type search queries like, \"writing for SEO\" into Google will likely come across this post because of what the header tells Google. Ultimately, search engines are going to look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>headers and snippets before they look at body text</span></a>.</p> \n<p>Think of Google as a reader who is skimming your blog. They're going to focus on the main ideas — and that's what headers, like H2s and H3s, display. Use headers to accurately convey the main idea of your section, but make sure each header uses accurate, high-intent keywords. When you use the right keywords (using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/22842/4-helpful-tools-for-identifying-the-right-keywords.aspx?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>keyword research tools</span></a>) you have a much higher chance of helping your post rank on the first page.</p> \n<h3>2. Take advantage of featured snippets.</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707?p=featured_snippets&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=637322668994927457-279137339&amp;rd=1\"><span>Google</span></a>, \"Featured snippets come from web search listings. Google's automated systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet to highlight for a specific search request.\"</p> \n<p>Featured snippets on Google are the most direct answers to search queries. For instance, if I were to search, \"How do you write a blog post?\", Google might use a featured snippet to show the most sufficient answer:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE\" width=\"624\" height=\"436\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of a featured snippet on Google.\" /></span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-featured-snippet-box?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>To earn a featured snippet</span></a> on Google, you'll want to answer the questions readers might have when they come to your blog post. For instance, if the search term is \"how should I write a blog post?\", answer that question with a list, starting with \"How to Write A Blog Post\" as the header, accompanied by a list of items that are relevant and actionable.</p> \n<p>If you're wondering how to make list items actionable, a good rule of thumb is to write complete sentences and start each sentence with a verb, like \"Write\", \"Research\", \"Create\". Additionally, make sure each sentence answers the question or challenge. For definitions, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/winning-googles-featured-snippet?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>paragraph snippets</span></a>, make sure they're succinct, but give enough background to explain the word or phrase.</p> \n<h3>3. Write to answer questions for customers.</h3> \n<p>One of the reasons we write blog posts is to diversify the content on our website. Another reason is to boost the credibility of our business. But if \"to solve for your audience\" isn't in your list of reasons, you may be losing out on key SEO opportunities.</p> \n<p>Google answers countless questions a day. For instance, I must've Googled about five questions in the last hour alone. When you frame posts to answer the queries of your audience, Google will see that and push your post to a higher page.</p> \n<p>Earlier, we talked about the bells and whistles you can add to posts to boost rankings. But, additionally, you'll want to ensure the content you're beefing up is also working towards that goal.</p> \n<p>If you're stuck on trying to figure out what your audience is asking, you'll want to perform keyword research. Sites like <a href=\"http://ahrefs.com/\"><span>Ahrefs</span></a> and <a href=\"http://woorank.com/\"><span>Woorank</span></a> crawl search engines for popular search queries. To organize the process, create different topic clusters to write about, such as \"Instagram Marketing,\" \"LinkedIn Advertising\" — subjects you can dive into that provide value to your audience.</p> \n<p>Still stuck on keywords? Don't worry — this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>keyword research guide is perfect for beginners.</span></a></p> \n<h3>4. Use meta descriptions to your advantage.</h3> \n<p>Are you adding meta descriptions to your post? If your answer is \"No,\" then you're probably not giving your post the most exposure possible. Let's get into why they're important.</p> \n<p>By now, we've talked about a couple of the ways a blog post can communicate with Google: with headers, keywords, and snippets. However, that's not an exhaustive list.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>Meta descriptions</span></a> is another method Google leverages when ranking search results. Meta descriptions are the 1-3 sentence descriptions you'll find underneath the title of a result.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SthW36UwXSSgw6xA9MsSlcduXxbbMVKP3QpXTdUdc1KGMa4pqGAvSipqTkuL-TZICne4Dr-WXlVVEDagqYlDYavLLIPJEzesocOU6Gy9_qEHPbWEGmvwB6vIZJmd5zRmxy0YbxCg\" width=\"624\" height=\"227\" alt=\"Example of a meta description on Google.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></span></p> \n<p>Use meta descriptions to sum up what your post is about. Remember to keep it short, use keywords, and make sure it's engaging. After all, there are going to be loads of posts similar to yours, aiming to rank at #1. You're going to want yours to stand out above the rest.</p> \n<p>Most blogging software have meta description boxes built into the toolbar or post formatting options, so you won't have to look far to use the function. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/?_ga=2.216912790.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>HubSpot</span></a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\"><span>WordPress</span></a>, for example, point out where to add meta descriptions in the post editor.</p> \n<h3>5. Add alt text to images.</h3> \n<p>With any image you add to your post — whether it be the featured image or a body text one — you'll want to add alt text. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32567/a-marketer-s-guide-to-optimizing-images-for-google-search.aspx?_ga=2.216912790.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>Alt text describes what's happening</span></a> in the photo. Think of it as a closed caption for images.</p> \n<p>Alt text helps Google, as well as those who are visually impaired, understand why the photo is in your post. This improves your article's rank and accessibility, making it more shareable.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you include an infographic about audience segmentation, the alt text should read something like, \"A helpful infographic that explains audience segmentation.\" Notice how this sentence uses keywords to appeal to Google even further.</p> \n<p>Now let's say you're using a stock image as a featured photo, but it doesn't necessarily depict anything that relates to your post's content. For instance, let's say your topic is click-through rate, and this is your featured image:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2jNZPSwpDQmCpp93qSsfmJzrztmQR8rQSjoBxLZDUz6vQLjPKBNCkbd2_njQNqt5lVzCZPFEV70MJmreYxiRHjUSU8yFvmJI6ZIhHHe1Kt5gKjwFk6ZbBvVM1-rC_pfTdREJUSih\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"A marketing team discusses audience segmentation strategy.\" /></span></p> \n<p>This doesn't really have anything to do with audience segments, right? But what you can do to remedy the situation is to make a scenario. For instance, \"A marketing team discusses audience segmentation strategy.\"</p> \n<p>This alt text uses keywords to describe a situation that fits into the theme of the post. That way, your image doesn't bring down the ranking of your post, but works towards improving where it ranks. If Google sees alt text, it's another box checked for a high position on SERPs.</p> \n<h3>6. Don't limit keywords to the body of your post.</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, keywords should be used in nearly every part of your blog. We've talked a little about where keywords can be included in your post: snippets, photos, and headers, for example.</p> \n<p>Keywords are so powerful because they're the jumping off point for SERPs. Google will always take what browsers type into the search bar and search for web pages with those exact words. So it's important to make sure every element, from the post title, to the calls-to-action, relate to your keywords.</p> \n<p>That said, it's also important not to keyword stuff your post. The goal is to make your page fully optimized, not overbearing. Find natural fits for keyword additions, but don't force them so your content is illegible.</p> \n<p>For example, if your keywords are \"account based marketing,\" \"startups,\" and \"sales,\" your meta description <em>shouldn't</em> be something like:</p> \n<p>\"Sales for account based marketing startups.\"</p> \n<p>Instead, try focusing on one or two phrases to make the description more natural:</p> \n<p>\"Are you looking for killer strategies to boost your account-based marketing game? Find out our surefire secrets in this post.\"</p> \n<p>That way, you're still using keywords, but you're not oversaturating the post to the point where it's illegible. Remember, even though Google is a search engine, it still has to comprehend your post in order to recommend it to website browsers. Additionally, a reader's experience will determine how well your posts rank. If readers bounce from your webpage because it's confusing to them, that will signal to Google that your post isn't good enough to rank.</p> \n<h3>7. Identify highly-effective keywords when looking for post ideas.</h3> \n<p>Google handles <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">over 40,000 search queries</a> a second. Staggering, right? If you want to cut through search result clutter and outrank your competitors, you need to target the specific keywords and phrases your potential customers are searching. How else will they find your content and website?</p> \n<p>To identify those hot keywords, head on over to the social platforms your target audience frequents and see what’s trending. Pay close attention to the exact phrases they use and monitor popular industry terms and topics.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> can also give you a feel for what keywords are popular at any given time. If you see searches are steadily declining over time for a specific keyword, you know that’s probably not the right keyword to target for your marketing and vice versa for increasing trends.</p> \n<p>If you’re ever running low on keyword ideas, get inspiration from your competition. Use tools to see what keywords they’re currently ranking for — if these keywords are relevant to your business, consider using them too! <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMRush</a> lets you enter a competitor and see the keywords they’re ranking for, their position in search results, traffic received for that keyword and other key metrics.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that the most obvious keywords aren’t always the best keywords. Searchers tend to use very specific “long-tail” keywords, keyword phrases and questions when they’re looking for something.</p> \n<p>Long-tail keywords comprise up to <a href=\"https://www.hittail.com/blog/the-hidden-value-of-long-tail-seo\">70% of all search traffic</a> and can unlock the door to successful SEO. When <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/\">WPBeginner</a>, the largest WordPress resource site for WordPress beginners, adopted a long-tail SEO strategy, they increased their organic search traffic by <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-we-increased-our-organic-search-traffic-by-using-hittail/\">20% in just two months</a>!</p> \n<p>Because you face fierce competition for shorter, more general keywords, you often have a better chance of ranking in the top results for long-tail keywords. And, long-tail keywords allow you to zero in on higher quality website traffic that often knows what they’re looking for and may be farther along in the buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve done your research and built a list of what you think are the most valuable, relevant keywords, plug them into a keyword research tool like Google’s <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\">Keyword Planner</a>, <a href=\"https://moz.com/products/pro/keyword-explorer\">Moz’s Keyword Explorer</a>, <a href=\"https://keywordseverywhere.com/ubersuggest.html\">Ubersuggest</a>, <a href=\"http://keywordtool.io/\">Keyword Tool</a> and so on. Many keyword research tools give you the monthly volume for any given keyword. Test out different keyword tools — marketers are drawn to different ones for different reasons.</p> \n<p>Depending on your business or industry (or budget or bandwidth for SEO efforts), it may be important to rank for high competition, short tail keywords. Still, try to also optimize for a healthy dose of long-tail keywords that are high in search volume but low in competition. You may find it’s much easier to rank for these words.</p> \n<p>Remember that your focus keywords will evolve over time as trends shift, terminology changes or your product/service line changes. Be sure to conduct keyword research periodically to ensure you’re still focusing on the right keywords for your target audience and not missing out on vital ranking opportunities.</p> \n<h3>8. Naturally integrate those keywords throughout your posts.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve decided on a list of target keywords, it’s time to write a blog post focused on one of these keywords. Brainstorm blog topics with your team and decide on a topic that will entice and engage your target audience.</p> \n<p>Keep your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">buyer personas</a>, their motivations, challenges, interests, etc. in mind throughout the brainstorming process. Choose a topic that will <a href=\"http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/how-to-create-an-emotional-connection-with-prospects-to-turn-them-into-customers\">emotionally resonate</a> with your potential customers and their needs, desires or pains.</p> \n<p>As you write your blog, your keyword and natural variations should be regularly interspersed throughout the post. Your primary keyword should appear in these key places:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo#BlogPostTitle\">Title</a></li> \n <li>Headings and subheadings</li> \n <li>URL if possible</li> \n <li>Image alt text (search engines can’t read images)</li> \n <li>Meta description</li> \n <li>Throughout the content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Remember that you’re writing for humans, not search engines. Focus on engaging readers with a natural writing style that takes their needs and interests into account.</p> \n<h3>9. Link to influential websites.</h3> \n<p>As you build out your blog post, don’t be afraid to link to other articles or blogs.</p> \n<p>Linking to applicable and reputable websites not only offers blog readers additional reading material to expand their knowledge, but it also shows Google and other search engines that you’ve done your research. And the blogger or writer may even return the favor and link to your site.</p> \n<p>Nothing strengthens a blog post like hard-to-argue-with, research-backed statistics from influential websites. Compelling stats help you build a more convincing and concrete argument that will get your readers thinking (especially when they’re from trustworthy sites they know and love).</p> \n<h3>10. Aim for scannable, longer posts.</h3> \n<p>In an age of short attention spans (<a href=\"http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\">average of 8 seconds for humans</a>), you would think shorter blog posts are the way to go. But search engines actually prefer longer, in-depth blog posts.</p> \n<p>The longer your blog post, the greater its chance of appearing in the top search engine results. <a href=\"http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/\">SerpIQ found</a> that the 10th position pages have 400 fewer words than 1st position pages. Longer posts will rank more easily for your target keyword.</p> \n<p>Think about it: the more content on the page, the more clues search engines have to figure out what your blog is about. We recommend writing a minimum of <a href=\"https://yoast.com/blog-post-length/\">300 words per blog post</a>. This length gives search engines plenty of keywords and text to crawl and helps them understand what your blog is about.</p> \n<p>The downside to longer blogs is that they may scare off your readers. We live in a world of skimmers and scanners. In a heat map analysis, CoSchedule learned that <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/read-your-content/\">only 10-20% of their readers</a> were making it to the bottom of their posts. So, the million dollar question is, how can longer blog posts appeal to today’s online readers?</p> \n<p>You can write <a href=\"http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/scannable-content-your-key-to-writing-successful-blogs\">scannable</a>, readable blog posts that hook online readers by tightening up your sentences and paragraphs. Turn a long-winded sentence into two. Keep your paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max.</p> \n<p>Also, take full advantage of bulleted lists and subheadings that grab reader’s attention. By following these tactics, you’ll create blogs that are easier to read (especially on a mobile device!) and less intimidating to the scanner’s eye.</p> \n<h3>11. Internally link words or phrases to other posts on your site.</h3> \n<p>Linking to other pages or blog posts on your website helps search engines crawl your website and create a more accurate sitemap. It also helps your audience discover more of your content and get to know you as a trustworthy, credible source of information.</p> \n<p>Internal links to other valuable content keep users on your site longer, reducing bounce rate and increasing your potential for a conversion (and isn’t that what it’s all about?).</p> \n<p>When linking to any pages on your website, or even outside sources, use natural language for your anchor text. Avoid using spammy or generic text such as “top-rated cheap laptops” or “click here.”</p> \n<p>Instead, use descriptive keywords that give readers a sense of what they will find when they click on the hyperlink, such as a <a href=\"http://hubs.ly/H05xGXn0\">search engine optimization guide</a>.</p> \n<p>Never force feed links to your top webpages, featured products or discounted items. These types of links will only turn off readers and could lead to search engines penalizing your website.</p> \n<p>A word of caution: don’t overdo your internal linking or any linking. We know it’s tempting to link to all of your blogs and webpages, but only choose the ones that best enhance the point or insight you’re writing about in any particular blog. Always think about whether or not these links naturally tie in with the subject matter and if they will offer significant value to your readers.</p> \n<h3>12. Optimize pictures for the fastest possible page speed.</h3> \n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">rewards pages with faster page speed </a>and places those that lag lower on its rankings. So, it's important to make sure your page-load times are as quick as possible.</p> \n<p>One of the leading culprits of page lag is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">large photos</a>. If the photo you uploaded is too big, it will make the page take a longer time to load -- even if the image <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">doesn't seem huge on screen</a>. Luckily, you can keep your posts visually interesting without sacrificing crucial speed.</p> \n<p>Once you pick a photo, use a free compression software, like Squoosh.app to make it as small as it can go before it loses any quality. Any removal of excess photo data will speed up loading times so readers won't have to wait.</p> \n<p>If you suspect that your SEO issues are related to low page speeds, Google offers a free tool that can score your page and give you suggestions for speed improvement. Here's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">a guide on how to use it and boost your score</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Preform link building strategies.</h3> \n<p>Traffic from places other than Google is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software\">crucial to your search rankings</a>. Why? Think of search results like a competition where the winners get the most votes. Each webpage that links back to you is considered a \"vote\" for your website, which makes your content more trustworthy in the eyes of Google. In turn, this will make you rise farther up on search results.</p> \n<p>So, it's good to write posts that other websites or publications will want to hyperlink within their own posts. You can also write posts on other business' websites that link back to your website in some way.</p> \n<p>To make your website's blogpost more linkable, include valuable assets or information, such as your own data, original thoughts, infographics, definitions, or other facts that people might not find anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of how this mindset could help you. If you write a post titled \"How to Make a Video Tutorial,\" or \"13 Stats about Video Tutorials,\" bigger sites that are writing about something similar might hyperlink words like \"video tutorials\" or \"research from [Your Company Name]\" to your post so they can give their reader more context without repeating your work.</p> \n<p>Once you've written the post, you might want to start sending it to other publications or websites that might want to discuss it or link it to their other posts. This outreach lets other publications know of the post and might also help you grow link building alliances with them in the future.</p> \n<p>You can also consider doing promotion, such as interviews or guest posts that link to your website's blog post to further encourage link building.</p> \n<p>These strategies can be key to your SEO success, but they can be time consuming. To help you, consider trying out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">one of these softwares</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Title Blog Posts for SEO</h2> \n<p>Even with a great, SEO-friendly post body, a bad title could hurt you in search engines. To title your post with SEO in mind, draft a clear understandable title that both shows the reader what they're about to read and integrates the keywords you identified in the first step. As mentioned above, write something that pleases Google's ranking algorithms, but is also understandable and enticing to humans.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you're a beauty blogger and you see that people are searching \"how to wear matte lipstick,\" your post could be titled, \"How to Wear Matte Lipstick: A 5-Step Guide.\"</li> \n <li>On the other hand, if your blog covers artificial intelligence and you see that people are searching a new AI app, you could write a blog post called \"How to Use [Insert AI App Name],\" or \"We Tried the New [Insert App Name] App: Here's What Happened\"</li> \n <li>If you blog about farming or sustainability and find out that \"what to buy at farm stands\" is a regular search, you might write a listicle titled \"What to Buy at Farm Stands This Summer.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You know how to write content audiences will love. Now, it's time to write for what Google loves. SEO only heightens the chance of your post getting seen by the right audiences, expanding your reach.</p> \n<p>It can sound tricky at first, writing for two audiences, but just remember these takeaways: keywords, snippets, and descriptions. Learning a new language takes time, but luckily, your blogging software can likely remind you of these SEO tips. I can't wait to see your next blog post at the top of my search results.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fblogging-for-seo&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:34:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE","linkMd5":"09d376dc66fa9d912ba8e5b0b85f7658","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-17-11-343_2bdd57ccaa5e30ca.webp","author":"Courtney Feairheller","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-17-11-343_2bdd57ccaa5e30ca.webp","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SthW36UwXSSgw6xA9MsSlcduXxbbMVKP3QpXTdUdc1KGMa4pqGAvSipqTkuL-TZICne4Dr-WXlVVEDagqYlDYavLLIPJEzesocOU6Gy9_qEHPbWEGmvwB6vIZJmd5zRmxy0YbxCg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/12/02-17-12-722_8da8bdf5b15faf8b.webp","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2jNZPSwpDQmCpp93qSsfmJzrztmQR8rQSjoBxLZDUz6vQLjPKBNCkbd2_njQNqt5lVzCZPFEV70MJmreYxiRHjUSU8yFvmJI6ZIhHHe1Kt5gKjwFk6ZbBvVM1-rC_pfTdREJUSih":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/12/02-17-12-974_745136777536ec8a.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fblogging-for-seo&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-17-12-938_8f71651f20b60f93.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 10:17:10","title":"How to Make Digital Credentials Your Most Impactful Marketing Tool","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-credentials","description":"<p>Marketing can have an enormous, positive impact on both revenue and brand recognition. Which is why organizations spend so much time, energy, and resources trying to reach their target audience.</p> \n<p>And yet, from billboard ads and radio slots to the roughly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/\">300 billion</a> emails sent each day, it's hard to boost your brand amidst all the noise.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are innovative ways to cut through the crowded market and build brand awareness: and one of those opportunities is through <a href=\"https://resources.credly.com/what-is-a-dc-infographic\">digital credentials</a>.</p> \n<p>Digital credentials have emerged as an impactful marketing tool across a variety of industries including corporate training, associations, professional development and certifications, and higher education. If your organization issues digital credentials, there are several things you can do to make the most of their marketing power.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover four areas where incorporating digital badges can help your brand stand out.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Social</h3> \n<p>With over <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/01/30/digital-trends-2019-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/\">3.4 billion</a> active users, there's no denying social media is a modern marketing powerhouse. If your brand doesn't already have a social strategy in place, you're potentially losing out on the opportunity to engage with <em>millions</em> of customers.</p> \n<p>Incorporating digital credentials into your social media strategy can drive brand awareness, increase engagement with the individuals who earn your badges, and strengthen the reputation of your company online.</p> \n<p>To incorporate digital credentials, try using keywords and hashtags to search for individuals sharing your digital credentials online and interact with them — give them a \"Like\", a re-tweet, or congratulate them on their achievement. You'll build stronger connections and create new engagement opportunities with your badge earners.</p> \n<p>For instance, anyone who's earned a HubSpot certification could post it on their LinkedIn, like the example below:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 427px;\" width=\"427\">\n</div> \n<p>Connecting with these users over social media in a meaningful way provides an opportunity for every single one of them to become an evangelist for your brand.</p> \n<p>Another way to leverage digital credentials in this way is for employees to share their certifications socially. Think of this as employees promoting company news or recent awards. By sharing achievements on their social channels, your employees are promoting your brand among users you may not have had the chance to get in front of otherwise.</p> \n<h3>2. Email</h3> \n<p>We've already established there is an inordinate number of emails exchanged each day, which means the average person receives multiple emails every hour. Even so, email marketing is still one of the most important and effective ways for your business to connect with customers and build meaningful relationships.</p> \n<p>Since your team is sending emails to people outside your organization, putting digital credentials in employee email signatures drives brand awareness and validation from the moment an email is opened. When your employees' certifications are on display, they work alongside your company logo to reinforce your brand every time an email is sent, forwarded, or replied to.</p> \n<p>Likewise, encourage your external badge earners to add digital credentials to their professional email signatures, too. Credentials help them establish credibility from the moment they hit \"Send\", allows email recipients to instantly verify the digital badge, and helps them learn more about your products and organization in the process.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&amp;name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Article_Email Example\" width=\"381\" style=\"width: 381px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Online</h3> \n<p>As a marketer, driving quality traffic to your company's site is a core focus. It's the reason there's such importance placed on including backlinks to a website in emails, social media posts, and content.</p> \n<p>The beauty of digital credentials is they're meant to be seen and shared. Developing a dedicated landing page for your digital credentials where potential earners can see the badge associated with the skill is a great way to get visibility for your credentials and is a great place for new earners to start the trial or purchase process. The more people visiting the page, the more recognition you'll have for your initiative.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Online Landing Page\" width=\"1172\" style=\"width: 1172px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Events</h3> \n<p>Events are a critical marketing initiative because they offer the opportunity to build relationships with key customers and prospects. In an increasingly digital world, many marketers believe face-to-face interactions at events are crucial to generating pipeline.

This kicks off their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg?width=600&amp;name=buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg\" alt=\"buyer's journey showing progression through the awareness stage, consideration stage, and decision stage\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't have a complete understanding your audience, a disconnect is created between your business and your potential customers. For content marketers, this usually means you're putting out content that your readers don't really relate with, which can cause you to lose them.</p> \n<p>As is the case in all marketing disciplines, it’s <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">important to understand your audience</a>:&nbsp;how they think, the answers they seek, and the path they tend to take to find a solution. From that research, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">begin crafting a documented content strategy</a> that maps your content to the various stages of the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Developing the buyer’s journey for your business is the first step to creating content that resonates with your buyer and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33711/The-Steps-You-Need-to-Define-the-Stages-of-Your-Sales-Marketing-Funnel.aspx?&amp;_ga=2.183949606.1430126461.1594683485-303082430.1584047107#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">building out your marketing funnel</a> so that you can meet them at each stage of their journey.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Marketing Funnel?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>A marketing funnel — more commonly known as a sales funnel since its output is revenue — describes the different stages a customer goes through leading up to their purchase, from looking at your website for the first time and subscribing to your email list to reading your emails and talking to a sales associate.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-engage-delight.jpg?width=787&amp;name=attract-engage-delight.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of marketing funnel with marketing at the top, sales in the middle, and customers at the end. Also shows corresponds to the attract, engage, and delight strategy.\" width=\"787\" style=\"width: 787px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>How the funnel works is simple. The top of the funnel indicates they are further away from a purchasing decision while those who make it to the bottom of the funnel are closer to a purchasing decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Often, it’s a marketer’s job to <strong>attract</strong> your buyer persona in the early stages of their journey and hand off qualified prospects to the sales team to <strong>engage</strong> them. Once they become a customer, your service team <strong>delights</strong> them so that they buy from you again and again and tell all their friends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The funnel is a useful tool when used in the context of the buyer’s journey. However, keep in mind that the funnel has one issue: It puts customers as the output. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QC2SHjBiag\">INBOUND 18</a>, HubSpot officially <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-flywheel\">retires the funnel in favor of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif?width=450&amp;name=Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif\" alt=\"an animation of the funnel morphing into a flywheel, a circle with marketing, sales, and service surrounded by growth (or customers) at the center\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">The result puts customers at the center, which creates a more unified and less linear approach to all your marketing, sales, and service activities.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif?width=400&amp;name=Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif\" alt=\"flywheel with attract, engage, and delight, spinning and feeding into each other as it shows strangers becoming prospects, customers, and promoters\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>Marketing Funnel Stages</h3> \n<p>Even so, the funnel is still a good starting point before you begin moving to your flywheel strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All you have to do take the buyer’s journey and ask the question: “How do we attract and engage this person so they become a customer?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether you subscribe to the funnel or the flywheel methodology, earning business from your prospects comes down to three simple things:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Attracting strangers</li> \n <li>Engaging prospects</li> \n <li>Delighting customers</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you create create content that performs these functions, you'll consider the stage they're at in their journey and the best channels to put the content in front of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The internet has made it easier for marketers (and salespeople) to engage customers at the various stages of their journey&nbsp;using content marketing.&nbsp;That’s one of the main reasons that<strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\"> 60% of marketers</a> consider content as 'very important' or 'extremely important' to their overall strategy.</strong></p> \n<p>However, it can be challenging to create the right content, for the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Channels for Each Stage of the Funnel</h2> \n<p>Building a content strategy starts with identifying the channels in which you’ll reach your audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"marketing channels for each stage of your strategy: attract, engage, delight\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Attract Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=attract-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Attract Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you use your expertise to create content and conversations that start meaningful relationships with the right people.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Remember, a large majority of your prospects may even be in the awareness stage of their buyer’s journey when you begin to attract them. That means your goal is to solve for their pains/problems by creating content they can easily discover and consume.</img></p> \n<p>At this point, a buyer is trying to solve problems, get an answer, or meet a need. They’re looking for top-level educational content to help direct them to a solution, like blog posts, social content, and ebooks.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;value as a lead is low because there’s no guarantee that they’ll buy from you. But those who find your content helpful and interesting may journey on to the middle of the funnel.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your attract stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Blogging</li> \n <li>Search Engine Marketing</li> \n <li>Social Media Marketing</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Engage Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/engage-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=engage-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Engage Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you build lasting relationships with people by providing insights and solutions that align with their pain points and goals\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When someone moves into the middle of your funnel, it means you’ve captured their attention. They know they have a problem that has to be solved, and now they’re trying to discover the best solution. The need for a future purchase commitment creeps up as they’re evaluation their options.</p> \n<p>While the top of the funnel is designed to educate a prospect, this is the stage where you want to show why your solutions in particular are the best fit.</p> \n<p>(You also want to help people determine if they're <em>not&nbsp;</em>a good fit, which will be very important later for healthy customer retention. If you convince customers to buy who aren't a good fit for your business in the long run, you could be shooting yourself in the foot in the form of high churn rate later.)</p> \n<p>The middle of the funnel is typically a point of extended engagement where you’re nurturing a lead, building a relationship, and establishing trust between the audience and your brand.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your engage stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Social Media</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also need to engage prospects at the bottom of your funnel.</p> \n<p>The bottom of the funnel is where someone is making the actual purchase decision. They're ready to&nbsp;buy, but that&nbsp;still doesn’t guarantee that they’re going to buy from <em>you.</em> That’s the last choice they have to make: Where do they get the solution they’re seeking?</p> \n<p>In most cases, leads at the bottom of your funnel just need that final nudge and that compelling call-to-action to get them to make a purchase decision. The right offer and content at this stage can have a dramatic impact on lifting your conversions.</p> \n<p>You might also consider sales outreach to engage qualified prospects and continue to engage them through personalization and contextual marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Delight Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/delight-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=delight-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Delight Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you provide an outstanding experience that adds real value, and empowers people to reach their goals and become promoters of your company.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Marketing shouldn’t stop once someone becomes a customer. Cultivating a relationship with your customer beyond the sale can lead to higher customer lifetime value as well as word-of-mouth referrals and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to go above and beyond their expectations and provide a customer experience that’s easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your delight stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Self-Service Channels Such as Knowledge Bases</li> \n <li>Live Chat and Chatbots for Service</li> \n <li>Loyalty Programs</li> \n</ul> \n<p>On the surface, this process seems really linear, but you can also target multiple stages of the buyer’s journey across channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, you may still be able to attract someone in the consideration stage or delight someone who isn’t a customer yet. Your knowledge base might convince someone in the consideration stage to buy since they perceive that you have great service, or someone in the awareness stage could engage your chatbot to find the content they need.</p> \n<p>One of the joys of content marketing is thinking outside the box.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Creating Content for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Once you have an idea of who your buyer persona is and what channels will work best for your business, you can begin creating content for your buyer at different stages and tailor that content per channel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so can help you <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template\">map your content to the relevant stages of the buyer’s journey</a> to make your funnel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Top of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"awareness\" stage, where people looking for answers, resources, education, research data, opinions, and insight.</li> \n <li><strong>Middle of the Funnel:&nbsp;</strong>The \"evaluation\" stage, where people are doing heavy research on whether or not your product or service is a good fit for them.</li> \n <li><strong>Bottom of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"purchase\" stage, where people are figuring out exactly what it would take to become a customer.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your funnel may look very different depending on factors like your industry, business model, product, pricing, and audience.&nbsp;Some B2C customers, for example, spend very little time in the middle of the funnel compared to B2B customers that require far more nurturing, engagement, and relationship development before a purchase is made. A $50 pair of sneakers, for instance, requires a lot less handholding when it comes to making purchase decisions than a $10,000 business software investment.</p> \n<h2>Content Ideas for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Because audiences can vary so widely based on industry and intent, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">persona research is of the utmost importance</a>. Only by understanding their unique process for awareness and evaluation will you be able to create a truly effective content marketing strategy, packed with custom content that best supports their journey toward making a purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg\" alt=\"content ideas for each stage of the buyer's journey: awareness, consideration, decision\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Blog Post&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A blog post is an ideal piece of content targeting the awareness stage. By targeting a pain, problem, or other topic your target audience wants to discover and then posting it to your website, you’re creating a brand asset that’s crawlable by Google and discoverable by search engine users. You can also promote your blog content across other channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg?width=600&amp;name=blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"blog post example from ahrefs's blog that reads 'how long should blog posts be?'\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/blog-post-length/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Ahrefs is a great example of a brand that does blog content right. They include original data and informational advice to create long-form articles that serve their audience.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Post</h3> \n<p>Social media is a channel that can be used to promote your other content, and you can also create content specifically for the channel. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\">Pew Research</a>, 72% of the public uses some form of social media, so it’s likely that your audience is native to this channel. Unlike blog posts, social media posts are likely shorter form, and <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics\">video consumption is also on the rise</a>.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6672147901583642624\" width=\"504\" height=\"653\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n<p>In the above example, HubSpot Agency Partner <a href=\"https://www.yokellocal.com/\">Yokel Local</a> shares attractive customer marketing tips on the LinkedIn platform. SlideShare formats are popular on LinkedIn, so the content is created to be snackable with short-form take-aways.</p> \n<h3>Whitepaper&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A whitepaper is an organization’s report or guide on a particular topic. Whitepapers are especially useful as downloadable offers when a reader wants to go more in-depth on a particular subject they’re reading about. For whitepapers, it’s important to provide information that can’t be found elsewhere so that your audience understands the value of the report and is compelled to get it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg?width=518&amp;name=whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"whitepaper example from hubspot that reads: &quot;not another state of marketing report&quot;\" width=\"518\" style=\"width: 518px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Every year, HubSpot publishes a survey on the state of marketing to provide helpful guidance based on thought leadership to marketers, sales professionals, and business owners. Inside, readers find statistics from a broad survey as well as industry experts’ opinions on what the data means and where the industry is going.</p> \n<h3>Checklist&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For tasks that are complicated and have a lot of moving parts, individuals may simply want a blueprint that spells out what they’re supposed to do to achieve their end goal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist-example-opendoor.jpg?width=600&amp;name=checklist-example-opendoor.jpg\" alt=\"checklist example from opendoor that reads &quot;the essential checklist for first-time home buyers&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/checklist-for-first-time-home-buyers\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Buying a home is a perfect example of this, and Opendoor meets their audience’s need by providing a handy checklist (in infographic form!) for the reader that spells out all the steps that need to be taken. The graphic is aesthetically pleasing and even allows room for a few tips along the way.</p> \n<h3>How-To Video&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, the best way to solve a pain or problem is to learn a new skill. Sure, a purchase of some kind may be required along the way, but the audience may need to become more informed about the problem and how to solve it. That’s where instructional video content comes in.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 534px; max-height: 300px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyOqoV90v58?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Whiteboard Fridays is a popular video series by <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a> where SEO principles are broken down to the audience in easy-to-understand language and visuals. Moz knows that SEO is a difficult subject and aims to make it accessible to their viewers.</p> \n<h3>Kit or Tool&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Informational content provided to a broader audience may not always be enough for your buyer persona to make a decision or take action of some kind. In some cases, they may require a little more utility or personalization. That’s why kits and tools are a great piece of content to create to help the reader along their path to purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg\" alt=\"tool example from nerdwallet that reads &quot;the 50/30/20 budget&quot; and is a budget calculator\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Nerdwallet creates content around several financial topics, budgeting being one of them. It can be difficult to create a budget, though, so they developed a calculator that allows the user to provide their own numbers in order to receive a customized recommendation.</p> \n<h3>Ebook or Tip Sheet&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Similar to whitepapers, ebooks and tip sheets are great options for downloadable content. In contrast, they tend to be shorter form and more actionable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg\" alt=\"tip sheet example from coschedule that reads &quot;180+ power words for writing emotional headlines&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>CoSchedule combines a few tactics by promoting their headline analyzer tool with a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">blog post about writing great headlines that drive traffic</a>. On that blog post, they include a great <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">tip sheet of powerful words</a> to include in headlines if you want to catch a reader’s attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Educational Webinar&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A webinar is a web seminar where information is typically provided through video. A webinar can be prerecorded or streamed live, and this opens up tons of possibilities to disseminate information to an audience who wants more visual and auditory content.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/webinar-example-semrush.jpg?width=600&amp;name=webinar-example-semrush.jpg\" alt=\"semrush's webinar page on their website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/webinars/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SEMrush makes webinars a key part of their content marketing strategy, often running a valuable topic multiple times to get more mileage out of the content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Product Comparison Guides</h3> \n<p>In the consideration stage, the buyer persona is still considering solutions to their pain or problem. For this reason, product comparisons are a great way to help them make a decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg?width=600&amp;name=comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg\" alt=\"comparison example from verywell fit that reads &quot;pros and cons of hiit training&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/is-hiit-training-or-steady-state-cardio-better-4126506\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Verywell Fit provides such a comparison to help their readers choose between high-intensity workouts vs. steady-state cardio, providing the pros and cons and use cases for each.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Case Study</h3> \n<p>A case study can be used in both the consideration stage and the decision stage simultaneously by convincing the reader that the solution works by establishing that the provider achieves results for their clients by administering the solution. A good case study will appeal to the emotions and logic of the persona by providing detailed information and quantitative data on the final solution.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg?width=600&amp;name=case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg\" alt=\"case study example from bluleadz that reads &quot;lead generation strategy lands 77 new clients for credit counseling agency&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/case-studies/credit-canada-new-content-offer\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot Partner Agency <a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/\">Blueleadz</a> does this by telling a story about their client and the problems they had while providing a detailed account of how they solved it.</p> \n<h3>Free Sample&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A free sample is another example of content or an offer that overlaps between buyer’s journey stages. Consider this: An individual wants to paint the inside of their home, but they don’t know what color.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they consider which color (the solution), they pick up paint chip cards from their hardware store. These cards are created by a provider based on their individual solution. When the individual falls in love with a color, they already know who the provider is that makes it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg\" alt=\"free sample example from 4colorprint that depicts a pack of sample business cards\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4colorprint.com/sample-request.php\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SILKCARDS taps into this buying behavior by offering samples of their unique printing methods on the content that they create. They know that their business is tactile, and digital content alone is not enough to close a deal. Once their prospective customer holds the sample in their hands, other business cards are put to shame.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Free Trial or Live Demo</h3> \n<p>What better way to know if you want to purchase a product than take it for a spin? Car dealerships have been using the “test drive” tactic for years because it works. If the product itself checks all the boxes the buyer has, all the sales team has to do is handle their objections and make the close.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg\" alt=\"free trial example from hellosign that reads &quot;unlimited signature requests with no hidden fees&quot; and has four pricing tiers, one that's free and two that offer free trials\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Hellosign does this well. Though they have a free option with limitations, they know that the key to getting clients into their larger tiers is by offering a free trial upfront. Their pricing page sets the prospect’s expectations and points them to the free trial.</p> \n<h3>Consultation Offer&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A consultation is another example of providing just a little bit of service in exchange for the opportunity to close the sale. The best consultation offers reduce the anxiety of entering into a sales conversation by promising something concrete they can walk away with (a strategy or actionable advice) in exchange for their time.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg?width=600&amp;name=consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg\" alt=\"consultation offer from blkbld &amp; co that reads 'for our initial consultation, we will discuss what you are looking to do, your budget, my marketing plans you can execute &amp; lastly the next steps&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blkbld.lpages.co/free-consultation/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Blk Bld &amp; Co.’s consultation offer is a great example because it reduces the friction of scheduling a consultation. By removing friction, this organization increases the chances of conversion.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Coupon</h3> \n<p>A coupon appeals to a fear of missing out (FOMO) mindset. By reducing the price by a certain amount, a coupon is handing a price objection while convincing the prospect that they’re leaving money on the table if they don’t use the coupon. This inertia enough to win the prospect’s business.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg?width=500&amp;name=coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg\" alt=\"coupon example from fragrant jewels in a &quot;spin-to-win&quot; style popup format\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.fragrantjewels.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Fragrant Jewels does this well by gamifying their coupons. By spinning the wheel, the website visitors have the chance to get a coupon before checking out the products. They’ll likely be evaluating the products that are a good deal with the coupon they won.</p> \n<p>In addition to decision stage content, you should also create content to delight your existing customers. This may include FAQ and knowledge base content to make the customer experience easier, coupons for the opportunity to upsell, and additional educative content that deepens their understanding of a topic.</p> \n<h2>Mapping Content Across All Stages of the Funnel and Buying Cycle</h2> \n<p>Every business has a unique sales funnel, sculpted and designed around their buyer’s unique journey.&nbsp;It’s a recipe that can’t necessarily be replicated from one business to another.&nbsp;When creating your own buyer's journey, there are a number of factors specific&nbsp;to your business to take into consideration.</p> \n<p>That said, the general approach remains the same: Understand your audience, develop your funnel around your industry and audience intent, and create a documented content marketing strategy that maps custom content specifically to each phase of their journey through the funnel.</p> \n<p>Do it well, and this process will have the greatest possible impact on your customer relationships, as well as the greatest possible lift in your overall conversions.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2016 and has
