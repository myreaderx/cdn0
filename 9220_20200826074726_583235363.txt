Version 2.27 of the app brings expanded support for Android 11&#8217;s smart home power menu controls, the addition of a dark theme, a unified camera feed, and teases the ability to unlock Google Nest smart locks. Here’s a summary of what’s new.</p>\n<p><strong>Unified Nest camera page</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most helpful new features in Google Home version 2.27 is a new unified page for all your camera feeds (via <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/08/25/google-home-nest-camera-page/\"><em>9to5Google</em></a>). Going forward, users can access a page that will show every camera feed on their network. The view is similar to what you’d get in the Nest app. Currently, it only seems to show feeds from Nest cameras.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/google-home-app-dark-theme-android-11-controls-unlock-nest-smart-locks/google-home-2-26-camera-1/'><img width=\"498\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-26-camera-1-498x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-26-camera-1-498x1024.jpg 498w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-26-camera-1-146x300.jpg 146w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-26-camera-1.jpg 584w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/google-home-app-dark-theme-android-11-controls-unlock-nest-smart-locks/google-home-2-27-camera-1/'><img width=\"485\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-27-camera-1-485x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-27-camera-1-485x1024.jpg 485w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-27-camera-1-142x300.jpg 142w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-2-27-camera-1.jpg 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /></a>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshots credit: Abner Li/<a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/08/25/google-home-nest-camera-page/\">9to5Google</a></em></p>\n<p>To access it, simply tap on the &#8220;Cameras&#8221; button right under the name of your home.</p>\n<p><strong>Unlock Nest smart locks</strong></p>\n<p>Google Home will also soon gain the ability to unlock Nest locks. Google actually teased this feature in a promo featuring Fred Armisen, who unlocks the Nest x Yale lock with his Android device. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/08/25/google-home-app-nest-yale-lock/\"><em>9to5Google</em></a> notes that the version 2.27 release notes <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-home/id680819774\">for the iOS app</a> mention the ability to unlock a Nest x Yale lock, though the feature is not yet live in the latest Android release. The feature will likely go live soon via a feature flag toggle in a server-side update, though.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AAMcFZwv-2k?start=38\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br />\n<strong>Dark theme</strong></p>\n<p>Additionally, Google has added a dark theme to Google Home which syncs with Android&#8217;s system-wide dark mode toggle, making the app a little easier on the eyes. Google has brought dark mode to its various apps over the past year, and it’s nice to see the same treatment brought to Google Home. <em>AndroidPolice </em>notes that the dark theme has been applied to basically every part of the app, including the settings, the media controller, and more.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/google-home-app-dark-theme-android-11-controls-unlock-nest-smart-locks/google-home-app-dark-mode-1/'><img width=\"485\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-1-485x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-1-485x1024.jpg 485w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-1-142x300.jpg 142w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-1.jpg 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/google-home-app-dark-theme-android-11-controls-unlock-nest-smart-locks/google-home-app-dark-mode-2/'><img width=\"485\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-2-485x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-2-485x1024.jpg 485w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-2-142x300.jpg 142w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/google-home-app-dark-mode-2.jpg 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /></a>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshots credit: Rita El Khoury/<a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/25/google-home-app-v2-27-finally-gets-a-dark-mode-apk-download/\">AndroidPolice</a></em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no toggle to change the theme in the app&#8217;s settings, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Expanded Android 11 Device Controls support</strong></p>\n<p>As spotted by <em>AndroidPolice</em>, the same Google Home 2.27 update also expands upon the types of devices you can <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-power-menu-device-controls-smart-home-dream/\">add to Android 11&#8217;s power menu</a>.

The display this year is actually larger than on the ZenFone 6; ASUS bumped the screen size up from 6.4-inches on the ZenFone 6 to 6.67-inches on the ZenFone 7 series. The chin is larger but thinner, though some components were shifted around to make that happen; for example, the notification LED is now at the bottom rather than in the top bezel.</p>\n<p>The back of the ASUS ZenFone 7 is made of glass but has a layer of Corning&#8217;s 3D Curved Gorilla Glass 3 for some protection; the front display is likewise protected by a layer of Corning&#8217;s Gorilla Glass 6. The mid-frame is made of &#8220;a single block of series 6000 Aluminum&#8221;, with the exception of the Flip Camera housing (which we&#8217;ll get to in a bit). At the bottom, you&#8217;ll find the USB Type-C port, 1 microphone, the notification LED, and one bottom-firing speaker. The other speaker is located at the top bezel, which also serves as the earpiece speaker during calls. Both speakers have 5 magnets and are amplified by NXP&#8217;s TFA9874 smart amplifier. While that means the ASUS ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro have dual speakers like the <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/rog-phone\">ROG Phone</a> 3, the latter has the distinction of featuring extensive audio tuning from Swedish audio firm Dirac.</p>\n<p>On the top, you&#8217;ll find another microphone but nothing else—the Flip Camera, with its triple camera array, takes up a lot of space! On the left side, you&#8217;ll find the triple card slot, which can fit up to 2 nanoSIM card slots + 1 microSD card. On the right, you&#8217;ll find the volume buttons and the power button which also houses the capacitive fingerprint scanner and acts as a programmable &#8220;Smart Key.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-327509 size-full\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Smart-Key.jpg\" alt=\"ASUS ZenFone 7 Smart Key\" width=\"448\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Smart-Key.jpg 448w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Smart-Key-300x247.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" /></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve noticed, we haven&#8217;t mentioned a 3.5mm audio jack. That&#8217;s because neither the ASUS ZenFone 7 nor the ZenFone 7 Pro have one, sadly. ASUS says they had to make this compromise to keep the same 5,000mAh battery from the ZenFone 6, to make room for the larger Flip Camera module, and to accommodate the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/5g-push-unintentionally-killed-flagship-killer-this-year/\">dedicated 5G modem and antenna</a> components which take up extra PCB space.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-327157\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-NanoEdge-Display.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"979\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-NanoEdge-Display.jpg 979w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-NanoEdge-Display-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-NanoEdge-Display-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" /></p>\n<p>One of the biggest improvements with the ASUS ZenFone 7 series is the fact that you now get a Samsung AMOLED display that refreshes up to 90Hz. The 60Hz LCD on the ZenFone 6 wasn&#8217;t bad per se, but consumers have grown to associate OLED and higher refresh rates with flagships, and the ZenFone 7 has both. There are other display improvements, of course, including ΔE&#60;1 color accuracy, higher brightnesses, HDR10 support for video streaming services like Netflix, and some of <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/pixelworks-iris-5-visual-processor-android-display-experience-oppo-find-x2/\">Pixelworks&#8217; Soft Iris features</a> like HDR tone mapping and DC dimming. The resolution remains at Full HD+, which is lower than some premium flagships but is typical for devices in this range.</p>\n<h2>Flip Camera</h2>\n<p>The Flip Camera module is one of the features that made the ASUS ZenFone 6 really stand out, and it&#8217;s been improved in several ways on the ASUS ZenFone 7. For starters, ASUS has improved how it processes the liquid metal used for the housing, which hopefully means the ZenFone 7 won&#8217;t see as many supply issues as the ZenFone 6. There&#8217;s a new stepper motor module that ASUS says brings faster, smoother, and more accurate movements. There&#8217;s also an angle sensor that can detect the angle of the Flip Camera, allowing the user to set up pre-defined angles that the camera should flip to.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-327461 size-full\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera.jpg\" alt=\"ASUS ZenFone 7 Flip Camera\" width=\"994\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera.jpg 994w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-300x127.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-768x325.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" /></p>\n<p>ASUS says the stepper motor in the ZenFone 7 has an I-shaped design internally, as compared to the U-shaped motor in the ZenFone 6. This design is more efficient, providing nearly 2.2X more torque while being about 40% smaller. (ASUS says the higher torque of the stepper motor should not adversely affect the battery life since most people don&#8217;t use the camera that often.) What&#8217;s more, the ZenFone 7 uses an 18-layer flexible printed circuit (FPC) cable with 110 signal outputs, allowing the Flip Camera module to endure &#8220;up to 200,000&#8221; flips. That&#8217;s twice the number of rated flips for the ZenFone 6, which had 32 signal cables and 17 power cables for a total of 49 signal outputs. And the Flip Camera housing can even hold 40% more weight (35kg) before it breaks from bending.</p>\n<p>Thanks to this Flip Camera, you not only get a clean looking front with minimal bezels and no notch or hole-punch but also a great selfie camera. Since the rear cameras flip around to become the front cameras, you get the same image sensors and camera modes from the front and back. Most smartphones have a strong rear camera setup but do not offer nearly the same quality from the front camera; or in the rare case of selfie-focused smartphones, it&#8217;s the other way around. With the Flip Camera setup, the ASUS ZenFone 7 offers the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7-pro-specs-features-pricing-availability/asus-zenfone-7-flip-camera-4/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-4-1024x535.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-4-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-4-768x401.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-4.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7-pro-specs-features-pricing-availability/asus-zenfone-7-flip-camera-1/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-1-1024x536.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-1-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-1-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7-pro-specs-features-pricing-availability/asus-zenfone-7-flip-camera-2/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-2-1024x536.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-2-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-2-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-2-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7-pro-specs-features-pricing-availability/asus-zenfone-7-flip-camera-3/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"468\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-3-1024x532.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-3-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-3-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-3-768x399.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: ASUS</p>\n<p>The Flip Camera this time houses a triple camera setup (and dual LED flash) which is comprised of a primary 64MP Sony IMX686 image sensor with an f/1.8 aperture lens and 2&#215;1 on-chip-lens (OCL) PDAF, a secondary 12MP Sony IMX363 image sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, 113° field-of-view wide-angle lens, and dual PDAF, and a tertiary 8MP image sensor with an f/2.4 aperture, 3X optical zoom lens. Images from the primary camera are pixel-binned down to 16MP resolution and are stabilized with OIS on the ZenFone 7 Pro. The telephoto camera is also housed in an OIS module, though that&#8217;s only the case on the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro model.  The ultra wide-angle camera can also do macro photography down to 4cm distances with auto focus, and it&#8217;s also responsible for the HyperSteady feature, which combines the wider FoV of the ultra wide-angle camera and EIS to give a larger cropping canvas to compensate for camera shake.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-327159 size-large\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Cameras-1024x450.jpg\" alt=\"ASUS ZenFone 7 cameras\" width=\"900\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Cameras-1024x450.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Cameras-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Cameras-768x337.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Cameras.jpg 1145w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>Under-the-hood, ASUS has made several tweaks to improve the camera quality with the ZenFone 7, including improving the color and contrast reproduction, adding an independent focus and exposure adjustment feature, enabling the seamless transition between the 3 cameras when zooming, enabling real-time distortion correction for faces, and using the high gain mode of the IMX686 sensor to boost the brightness by up to 12dB in low-light. For even better low-light photos, ASUS has updated its Night Mode to be dynamic, meaning the camera app can present longer exposure options depending on the amount of detected light and movement.</p>\n<p>For video, the ZenFone 7 supports up to 8K @ 30fps with EIS, slow-motion at up to 4K @ 120fps, and HyperSteady at up to 1080p @ 60fps. Interestingly, that makes the ASUS ZenFone 7 perhaps the only smartphone to support 8K video recording from the front. ASUS has included 3 microphones for improved audio recording, and these microphones are used for the Wind Filter feature, mic focus (ie. audio zoom) feature, and acoustic focus (ie. directional audio) feature. There&#8217;s also a new Pro Video mode for manual control of focus, white balance, ISO, etc. during video recording, though it doesn&#8217;t support external mics for audio recording yet. There is a new Free Zoom feature in the Pro Video mode, though, which lets you tap anywhere in the viewfinder to quickly zoom into that particular spot. While recording, you can also seamlessly transition between lenses.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_327587\" style=\"width: 1140px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-327587\" class=\"wp-image-327587\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Quick-Angle-Shooting.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1130\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Quick-Angle-Shooting.jpg 1200w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Quick-Angle-Shooting-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Quick-Angle-Shooting-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Quick-Angle-Shooting-768x405.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1130px) 100vw, 1130px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-327587\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: ASUS</p></div>\n<p>Lastly, ASUS has also improved or added some unique camera features made possible by the Flip Camera system.

Auto panorama gets optimized shutter speed adjustments and now works with the ultra wide-angle camera. One feature that hasn&#8217;t been added yet is automatic panning with timelapse mode, which ASUS says is possible to do but needs further optimizations in the camera algorithm.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_327463\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-327463\" class=\"wp-image-327463\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Video-Recording-Table.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"818\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Video-Recording-Table.jpg 1119w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Video-Recording-Table-300x258.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Video-Recording-Table-1024x882.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Video-Recording-Table-768x662.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-327463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A chart summarizing which video features are supported by the 3 cameras on the ASUS ZenFone 7. Source: ASUS</p></div>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>On the inside, the ZenFone 7 series remains a flagship. You get the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-processor-specifications-features/\">Qualcomm Snapdragon 865</a> SoC on the non-Pro variant and the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-plus-launch/\">Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus</a> on the Pro variant (much like the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-smartphone-snapdragon-865-plus-144hz-display-6000mah-battery-launch/\">ROG Phone 3</a>). For those unfamiliar, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 is fabricated on TSMC&#8217;s 7nm process, features an octa-core CPU in a 1+3+4 configuration comprised of 1 ARM Cortex-A77 &#8220;Prime&#8221; core @ 2.84GHz, 3 ARM Cortex-A77 &#8220;Performance&#8221; cores @ 2.4GHz, and 4 ARM Cortex-A55 &#8220;Efficiency&#8221; cores @ 1.8GHz, and the Adreno 650 GPU. The Snapdragon 865 &#8220;Plus&#8221; features an overclocked Prime core @ 3.1GHz and a 10% speed-binned GPU. Regardless, both the ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro are paired with LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, with the 7 having 6GB or 8GB RAM with 128GB of storage while the 7 Pro has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The storage is still expandable by up to 2TB with a microSD card.</p>\n<p>On top of packing a newer chipset, ASUS has also made several software optimizations to improve the UI fluidity and responsiveness of the ZenFone 7. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boot time reduced to 13.32 seconds.</li>\n<li>Image preview (how fast an image can be previewed after taking a photo) reduced to 0.13 seconds.</li>\n<li>Unlock speed reduced to 0.28 seconds.</li>\n<li>Response time of answering a phone call reduced to 0.48 seconds.</li>\n<li>General memory management tweaks to improve how many apps can stay cached in the background.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For hardcore benchmarks or games, the performance can be further boosted in the software by toggling the high-performance mode, which raises the thermal limit from 37 to 46°C peak skin temperature and keeps the CPU frequencies at their ceiling.</p>\n<p>Because the ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro have Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon 865 SoC, they also have Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon X55 multi-mode 5G/4G/3G/2G modem. The ZenFone 7 series supports sub-6GHz 5G networks but do not have mmWave antennas. 5G data can only be used from one SIM card at a time. The Qualcomm FastConnect chip provides support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1, while the main chipset also provides <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/dual-frequency-gnss-important-location-feature-your-phone-probably-missing/\">dual-frequency GNSS support</a> as well as support for <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-865-support-indias-navic-future-update/\">India&#8217;s NavIC satellite network</a>.</p>\n<h2>Battery &#38; Charging</h2>\n<p>Powering the ASUS ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro is a large 5,000 mAh battery that can be charged at up to 30W using ASUS&#8217;s HyperCharge technology, at up to 27W using a Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0-compatible charger, or at up to 18W via USB Power Delivery. With the 30W HyperCharge adapter that comes in-the-box, the ZenFone 7 can be charged 60% in less than 35 minutes. That might not be as fast as some of the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/iqoo-5-iqoo-5-pro-120w-flashcharge-launched-in-china/\">crazier wired charging implementations</a> on the market, but it&#8217;s also much safer for the battery longevity. To placate users who want to maximize the life of their device, ASUS has also added several optional battery care features, including a slow charging toggle, a charging scheduler with a smart alarm, a charging limit, and a customizable battery mode.</p>\n<p>The only thing that&#8217;s really missing is wireless charging support.</p>\n<h2>ZenUI 7</h2>\n<p>ASUS&#8217;s ZenUI software has been bumped up a version to ZenUI 7. It&#8217;s still based on Google&#8217;s Android 10 release, though an update to Android 11 is planned in the future. With ZenUI 7, ASUS has added several new features, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New features</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A new toggle to shift the Quick Settings layout to be more one-handed friendly.</li>\n<li>Themes. In addition to the system-wide dark theme (which can now be scheduled based on the sun cycle or a custom schedule), you can also pick from 4 font styles, 8 theme colors, 4 icon shapes, and 4 power menu styles.</li>\n<li>New Hibernate apps feature to detect and halt certain apps running in the background.

This might not sound like much to you—after all, basically every Android smartphone comes pre-installed with YouTube and can play videos just fine, right? YouTube can stream certain videos in formats that aren&#8217;t supported on all smartphones, though, so many users may not be aware of how well their phone supports all the options on YouTube. Features like HDR video, 4K video decoding, 360° video, high frame rate playback, good DRM performance, and VP9 codec decoding are among the required features that YouTube Signature Devices must support. That list of devices <a href=\"https://devicereport.youtube.com/phones/oneplus_nord\">now includes</a> the new OnePlus Nord.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-327447\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/OnePlus-Nord-YouTube-Signature-Device.jpg\" alt=\"OnePlus Nord YouTube Signature Device\" width=\"790\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/OnePlus-Nord-YouTube-Signature-Device.jpg 790w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/OnePlus-Nord-YouTube-Signature-Device-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/OnePlus-Nord-YouTube-Signature-Device-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" /></p>\n<p>Getting a device added to the YouTube Signature Devices list isn&#8217;t a new feat for OnePlus. The <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-8-lg-v60-motorola-edge-youtube-signature-devices/\">OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro also meet</a> the requirements, as do several of OnePlus&#8217;s older smartphones, including the OnePlus 7T, the OnePlus 7, the OnePlus 7 Pro, and the OnePlus 6T. The OnePlus Nord is the brand&#8217;s first mid-range device in years, though, so it&#8217;s nice to see that the company hasn&#8217;t cut corners when it comes to display certifications.</p>\n<p>If you own a OnePlus Nord or are planning on buying one, you can be sure that your device will be capable of best-in-class multimedia consumption on YouTube and other video streaming platforms. Speaking of other platforms, Netflix also runs its own certification program before allowing devices to stream HD and/or HDR videos. Although Netflix currently doesn&#8217;t list the Nord on its list of devices that support HD and/or HDR video, the app&#8217;s Playback Specifications show that the Nord is capable of playing Full HD as well as HDR10 videos. Hopefully, Netflix will add the device to the list soon to reduce any confusion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord\">OnePlus Nord Forums</a> ||| </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-review/\">OnePlus Nord Review</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-certifies-oneplus-nord-youtube-signature-device/\">Google certifies the OnePlus Nord as a YouTube Signature Device</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\">xda-developers</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 03:30:13 +0000","feedId":9220,"bgimg":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/OnePlus-Nord-YouTube-Signature-Device.jpg","linkMd5":"a8d8524bd576baefeae2c080362f7b18","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/07-46-54-536_7077a6bd4a5527e5.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":356,"sourceBytes":36128,"destBytes":36128,"author":"Arol Wright","enclosureUrl":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/07/OnePlus-Nord-Blue-Marble-7_1.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/OnePlus-Nord-YouTube-Signature-Device.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/07-46-54-536_7077a6bd4a5527e5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598428014238},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 15:46:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 15:46:54","title":"Microsoft Word on the web adds a speech transcription feature for Microsoft 365 subscribers","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=327411","description":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Microsoft Word on the web is getting a new feature that will make it much easier for students and reporters to record notes, lectures, or interviews. The company on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/08/25/microsoft-365-transcription-voice-commands-word/\">announced</a> that the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word\">Microsoft Word web app</a> is adding a transcription feature. Called Transcribe in Word, the feature will allow users to record conversations directly in Word for the web and have the service automatically transcribe the audio.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft, your recording and its transcript will appear alongside the Word document. When a conversation is transcribed, Word will separate each speaker and format the document into sections, with timestamps to let you return to that part of the audio. This will make it easy to playback, edit, or insert the transcript into a Word document. The feature also supports transcribing previously recorded audio or video files in .mp3, .wav, .m4a, or .mp4 formats, so you can easily upload an interview or lecture you previously recorded.</p>\n<p>Users will get access to five hours per month of uploaded recordings, which are capped at 200MB per recording. If you record and transcribe directly through Word, though, there are no restrictions. As of this writing, English (specifically, the EN-US locale) is the only language that is supported for transcription, but more languages will be supported down the road.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gif-transcription-with-audio-upload.gif\" width=\"900\" height=\"622\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-365-family-safety-microsoft-teams-consumers/\">Microsoft 365 subscribers</a> can start using Transcribe in Word beginning today.

Unlike other dual-screen devices in the market today, the LG wing features a swiveling 6.8-inch main display that can be rotated to reveal a second 4-inch display hidden underneath. While LG is yet to reveal any information about the device, a video showcasing the LG Wing in action has now surfaced online.</p>\n<p>The folks over at <em>Android Authority</em> have managed to procure exclusive footage of the LG Wing in action, which gives us our first look at the crazy dual-screen smartphone. As you can see in the attached video, the LG Wing can be used in the portrait orientation with the second display open on the side to show additional information. In this instance, the main display on the device is being used to display navigation info, while the second display shows the music player and an incoming call.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"LG Wing navigation and music playback - Android Authority\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIq2H3KkxQk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Accepting the call replaces the music player UI with the phone UI on the second display, without interfering with the navigation UI on the first display. This is one of the many ways the second display on the LG Wing can come in handy. The leaked image that we saw previously shows another use case, in which the second display is being used in the portrait orientation and it displays the keyboard, while the first display is in the horizontal orientation. Thanks to this unique approach, the LG Wing doesn&#8217;t feature a notch or a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304387\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/05/LG-Wing-Dual-screen.jpg\" alt=\"LG Wing\" width=\"644\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/05/LG-Wing-Dual-screen.jpg 644w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/05/LG-Wing-Dual-screen-300x250.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px\" /></p>\n<p>While the video doesn&#8217;t show the swiveling mechanism in action, we suspect that it may work like the mechanism on the <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_v9000-1469.php\">LG V9000</a>. The video also doesn&#8217;t reveal any information about the device&#8217;s hardware, but previous leaks suggest that it will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 700 series processor with 5G capabilities. The device is also expected to feature a triple camera setup on the back, with a 64MP primary sensor. LG is scheduled to announce the smartphone in the coming months and it will have a price tag close to 1 million Won (~$842).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-wing-features-1150327/\">Android Authority</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/first-look-lg-crazy-dual-display-wing-smartphone/\">Here&#8217;s our first look at LG&#8217;s crazy dual display &#8220;Wing&#8221; smartphone</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\">xda-developers</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:29:04 +0000","feedId":9220,"bgimg":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/05/LG-Wing-Dual-screen.jpg","linkMd5":"5c021cba26e8cddd6cea1dd56af1ca7a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/26/07-46-54-396_3a7b20853b3c1dfc.webp","destWidth":644,"destHeight":536,"sourceBytes":31270,"destBytes":17392,"author":"Pranob Mehrotra","enclosureUrl":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/LG-Wing-leaked-video-featured.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/05/LG-Wing-Dual-screen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/26/07-46-54-396_3a7b20853b3c1dfc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598428014236},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 15:46:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 15:46:54","title":"ASUS says the ZenFone 7 is less likely to face shortages than the ZenFone 6","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=327165","description":"<p class=\"dropcap\">ASUS has <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7-pro-series-motorized-flip-camera-90hz-oled-display-qualcomm-snapdragon-865-launch/\">just launched the ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro</a>, two phones that continue the motorized flip camera legacy for another year. While the pricing on the devices has increased compared to their predecessor, there are a fair few improvements onboard that justify the rise. But one of the biggest improvements with the devices doesn&#8217;t actually have to do with the devices themselves, but rather, their supply. With the ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro, ASUS is promising greater availability compared to last year&#8217;s model.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/asus-zenfone6/\">ASUS ZenFone 6</a> faced several shortages across the world after it was launched. Complaints on its availability were found everywhere you looked, and many consumers were disappointed that the phone was unavailable in their region, forcing them to turn to other flagships to fulfill their needs. During a briefing, ASUS told media that the reason for these shortages was because of the difficulty in processing the &#8220;liquid metal&#8221; used for the flip camera housing. The &#8220;liquid metal&#8221; here refers to metal alloys with an amorphous structure, and apparently processing this material for the production of the flip camera housing was the main problem that caused ASUS to fall behind in making new ZenFone 6 devices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7\">ASUS ZenFone 7 Forums</a></strong> ||| <strong><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-7-pro\">ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro Forums</a></strong></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how <a href=\"https://zentalk.asus.com/en/discussion/8386/asus-zenfone-6-flips-not-only-the-camera-but-the-entire-world-of-mobile-photography\">ASUS described</a> the liquid metal used in the ZenFone 6 last year:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>The most important material used in the Flip Camera is liquid metal (amorphous metal alloy). In order to minimize the size of the camera module, the design team was worried about the impact on durability. The thickness of many parts of the camera module is only 0.4 mm, which is about the thickness of five sheets of photocopy paper. At this thickness, whatever material is used — plastic, aluminum or stainless steel — it can be broken by the poke of a fingernail. The ASUS development team researched a solution, and the answer was liquid metal.</h4>\n<h4>“Liquid metal is not actually liquid: everyone hears the words liquid metal and probably thinks of the Terminator, imaging it&#8217;s like mercury”, says Pete Lin, “What is liquid metal? Its scientific name is amorphous metal alloy. It&#8217;s a type of alloy that&#8217;s solid at normal temperatures, but has the atomic structure of a liquid.”</h4>\n<h4>The physical state is equivalent to glass, so another name for it is metallic glass. Its characteristics are strength and flexibility. It&#8217;s four times tougher than stainless steel. When we found this material, we were like “Wow!” It seemed to the team that they now had a chance to create the device. But the downside is that it is very difficult to process, and needs to be as finely polished as a Swiss watch.</h4>\n<h4>The reason why liquid metal is rare is that unwanted holes are easily formed in it during the manufacturing process. If there are holes, this expensive material needs to be discarded, and there are very few willing suppliers, except for the interior parts of some premium products. ASUS broke through many technical limitations, and adapted an evacuated die-casting process, which totally eliminates the chance of holes. So the entire Flip Camera module, including the axes, can be made of liquid metal.</h4>\n<h4>After the liquid metal is die-cast, it must be cut, but because it&#8217;s very hard, the initial CNC milling tool and scissors are easily deformed and damaged. Instead we chose a water jet cutter, which is cheaper. However, the water jet cutter can&#8217;t do very fine work. When cutting it, the corners and edges remain, and the back still has to be trimmed by CNC. The assembly of the upper and lower frame of the camera module requires high precision, so ASUS had to do a rare thing in the industry: engrave laser serial numbers inside the upper and lower parts of the module, for precise assembly. In this way, each part can only be matched with a part showing an identical serial number. When it&#8217;s time to join and polish the parts, they will be perfectly matched. But the downside is that when one part is broken, a whole set of modules is trashed.</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-327603 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-5.jpg 396w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/ASUS-ZenFone-7-Flip-Camera-5-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" /></p>\n<p>ASUS mentions that they have learned from this episode and are consequently better prepared this year. The company expects that the supply of the ASUS ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro will hopefully be better. Even right at launch, there is a greater quantity of ZenFone 7 devices available in the launch regions compared to the ZenFone 6. So people who want to get their hands on the phone should now face fewer difficulties and see more open sales. That, of course, still depends on how high the demand is in each region.</p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"
