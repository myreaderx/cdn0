He scooped them out with his net and placed them in a bucket. He couldn&#8217;t wait to look at them more closely.</p>\n<p>He knew the ways of the sea, though he was not a fisherman. His grandfather had built wharves, but he was not a dockworker&#8230; </p>\n<p>He was a scientist.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But Ernest Everett Just was not like other scientists. Half a century after another researcher with a similar name and a similar scientific passion (the German marine biologist Ernst Haeckel) <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/26/ernst-haeckel-medusae/\">coined the word <em>ecology</em></a> and half a century before another marine biologist with similar outsider status (Rachel Carson) made it a household word, Ernest Everett Just &#8220;saw the whole, where others saw only parts.&#8221; Like Carson, he wrote poetry &#8212; that supreme art of interrelation; like every true visionary, he was above all a noticer &#8212; &#8220;he noticed details others failed to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vast-Wonder-World-Biologist-Everett/dp/1512483753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=680%2C415&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73536\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?w=2560&#38;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=320%2C195&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=600%2C366&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=240%2C146&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C468&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C937&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1249&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust1-scaled.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The story follows him from his childhood in South Carolina &#8212;

He traveled to Woods Hole each summer to deepen his research and train young scientists. In an era when most biologists treated marine creatures as inanimate samples for study, he tenderly removed sea urchins and sand dollars from their habitat to transport them to the lab and encouraged his students to study them right there in the tide pool.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vast-Wonder-World-Biologist-Everett/dp/1512483753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=680%2C508&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"508\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73532\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?w=2101&#38;ssl=1 2101w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=320%2C239&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=240%2C179&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=768%2C574&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=1536%2C1149&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?resize=2048%2C1531&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust6.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Day after obsessive day, night after late night, he peered at sea animals through the microscope, squinting at the edges of a radical idea, until it blazed with the empirical clarity of a discovery: Studying a sand dollar during fertilization, he observed how the egg cell was directing its own development &#8212; anathema to the accepted view that the sperm cell was responsible for the changes that coalesce into new life. </p>\n<p>Despite the scientific esteem the discovery brought him, Just felt increasingly stifled by the swell of racism in his nation&#8217;s bosom, which kept him from obtaining a teaching position at a major university worthy of his talent and credentials.

And yet we have a habit of confusing our knowledge &#8212; which is always limited and incomplete: a model of the cathedral of reality, built from primary-colored blocks of fact &#8212; with the actuality of things; we have a habit of mistaking the model for the thing itself, mistaking our partial awareness for a totality of understanding. Thoreau recognized this when he contemplated our blinding preconceptions and lamented that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/02/07/thoreau-knowing-seeing/\">&#8220;we hear and apprehend only what we already half know.”</a></p>\n<p>Generations after Thoreau and generations before neuroscience began illuminating <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/25/christof-koch-consciousness-qualia/\">the blind spots of consciousness</a>, <strong>Aldous Huxley</strong> (July, 26 1894&#8211;November 22, 1963) explored this eternal confusion of concepts in &#8220;Knowledge and Understanding&#8221; &#8212; one of the twenty-six uncommonly insightful essays collected in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Within-Selected-Writings-Enlightenment/dp/0062236814/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>The Divine Within: Selected Writings on Enlightenment</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/divine-within-selected-writings-on-enlightenment/oclc/813286712&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Within-Selected-Writings-Enlightenment/dp/0062236814/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/aldoushuxley_square.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aldous Huxley</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Huxley writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Knowledge is acquired when we succeed in fitting a new experience into the system of concepts based upon our old experiences. Understanding comes when we liberate ourselves from the old and so make possible a direct, unmediated contact with the new, the mystery, moment by moment, of our existence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because the units of knowledge are concepts, and concepts can be conveyed and transmitted in words and symbols, knowledge itself can be passed between persons. Understanding, on the other hand, is intimate and subjective, not a conceptual container but an aura of immediacy cast upon an experience &#8212; which means it cannot be transmitted and transacted like knowledge. Our forebears devised ways of transmitting knowledge from one generation to the next &#8212; in words and symbols, in stories and equations &#8212; which ensured the survival of our species by preserving and passing down the results of experience. But knowing the results of an experience is not the same as understanding the experience itself. Complicating the matter is the added subtlety that we may understand the words and symbols by which we tell each other about our experience, but still miss the immediacy of the reality those concepts are intended to convey. Huxley writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Understanding is not conceptual, and therefore cannot be passed on. It is an immediate experience, and immediate experience can only be talked about (very inadequately), never shared. Nobody can actually feel another’s pain or grief, another’s love or joy or hunger. And similarly nobody can experience another’s understanding of a given event or situation&#8230; We must always remember that knowledge of understanding is not the same thing as the understanding, which is the raw material of that knowledge. It is as different from understanding as the doctor’s prescription for penicillin is different from penicillin.</p>\n<p>Understanding is not inherited, nor can it be laboriously acquired. It is something which, when circumstances are favorable, comes to us, so to say, of its own accord. All of us are knowers, all the time; it is only occasionally and in spite of ourselves that we understand the mystery of given reality.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72916\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642772_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=680%2C801&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72916\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=320%2C377&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=600%2C707&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=240%2C283&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=768%2C905&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.

But in some sense, all experience is ultimately mystical, for experience can only be understood in its immediacy and not known as a concept. (Half a century after Huxley&#8217;s generation swung open the doors of perception beyond concept with their psychedelic inquiries into the mysteries and mechanics of consciousness &#8212; and swung shut the scientific establishment&#8217;s openness to serious clinical research into the field with their unprotocoled playhouse of recreational neurochemistry &#8212; science is finally documenting <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/07/11/how-to-change-your-mind-michael-pollan/\">the ineffable contact with raw reality</a> as the primary payoff, both clinical and existential, of psychoactive substances.)</p>\n<p>At the heart of Huxley&#8217;s essay is the observation that a great deal of human suffering stems from our tendency to mistake conceptual knowledge for understanding, &#8220;homemade concepts for given reality.&#8221; Such suffering can therefore be allayed by replacing the confusion with clarity &#8212; with a total awareness of reality, unfiltered by the &#8220;meaningless pseudoknowledge&#8221; that arises from our reflexive and all too human habits of &#8220;over-simplification, over-generalization, and over-abstraction.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Such total awareness, Huxley observes, can produce an initial wave of panic at the two elemental facts it reveals: that we are &#8220;profoundly ignorant&#8221; &#8212; that is, forever lacking complete knowledge of reality; and that we are &#8220;impotent to the point of helplessness&#8221; &#8212; that is, what we are (which we call personality) and what we do (which we call choice) are merely the life of the universe living itself through us.

But if I wholeheartedly accept them, the facts become a source of peace, a reason for serenity and cheerfulness.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>In my ignorance I am sure that I am eternally I. This conviction is rooted in emotionally charged memory. Only when, in the words of St. John of the Cross, the memory has been emptied, can I escape from the sense of my watertight separateness and so prepare myself for the understanding, moment by moment, of reality on all its levels. But the memory cannot be emptied by an act of will, or by systematic discipline or by concentration &#8212; even by concentration on the idea of emptiness. It can be emptied only by total awareness. Thus, if I am aware of my distractions &#8212; which are mostly emotionally charged memories or fantasies based upon such memories &#8212; the mental whirligig will automatically come to a stop and the memory will be emptied, at least for a moment or two. Again, if I become totally aware of my envy, my resentment, my uncharitableness, these feelings will be replaced, during the time of my awareness, by a more realistic reaction to the events taking place around me. My awareness, of course, must be uncontaminated by approval or condemnation. Value judgments are conditioned, verbalized reactions to primary reactions. Total awareness is a primary, choiceless, impartial response to the present situation as a whole.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64219\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/11/leaves-of-grass-margaret-cook/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass19.jpg?resize=680%2C874&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"874\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64219\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

In consonance with Carl Sagan&#8217;s admonition that common sense <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/05/carl-sagan-jonathan-cott-rolling-stone-interview/\">blinds us to the reality of the universe</a> and Vladimir Nabokov&#8217;s admonition that it <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/12/02/vladimir-nabokov-the-art-of-literature-and-commonsense/\">blunts our sense of wonder</a>, Huxley writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Common sense is not based on total awareness; it is a product of convention, or organized memories of other people’s words, of personal experiences limited by passion and value judgments, of hallowed notions and naked self-interest. Total awareness opens the way to understanding, and when any given situation is understood, the nature of all reality is made manifest, and the nonsensical utterances of the mystics are seen to be true, or at least as nearly true as it is possible for a verbal expression of the ineffable to be. One in all and all in One; samsara and nirvana are the same; multiplicity is unity, and unity is not so much one as not-two; all things are void, and yet all things are the Dharma &#8212; Body of the Buddha &#8212; and so on. So far as conceptual knowledge is concerned, such phrases are completely meaningless. It is only when there is understanding that they make sense. For when there is understanding, there is an experienced fusion of the End with the Means, of the Wisdom, which is the timeless realization of Suchness, with the Compassion which is Wisdom in action.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a sentiment the great Zen Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh would come to echo half a century later in his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/31/how-to-love-thich-nhat-hanh/\">life-broadening teaching that “understanding is love’s other name,”</a> Huxley concludes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of all the worn, smudged, dog-eared words in our vocabulary, “love” is surely the grubbiest, smelliest, slimiest. Bawled from a million pulpits, lasciviously crooned through hundreds of millions of loudspeakers, it has become an outrage to good taste and decent feeling, an obscenity which one hesitates to pronounce. And yet it has to be pronounced; for, after all, Love is the last word.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64219\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/11/leaves-of-grass-margaret-cook/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1543\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64219\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

Science was only just beginning to hone the tools with which to begin dissecting the elemental mystery of what makes us who we are: how much of our psychology and what we experience as our personhood &#8212; whether we call it self or soul or spirit &#8212; is a product of our physical constitution, of the particular biochemical processes coursing through our particular infrastructure of matter that we experience as our body. Neuroscience was then an infant science &#8212; it still is &#8212; and the helix of heredity had just been discovered, hinting at the promise of new clarity on the ancient puzzlement of nature versus nurture, new insight into how much of our psychology is a biological inheritance and how much an ongoing composition continually revised by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/06/simone-de-beauvoir-all-said-and-done-chance-choice/\">the confluence of chance and choice</a> we call experience. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73502\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?resize=680%2C908&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"908\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73502\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?resize=320%2C427&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?resize=600%2C801&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?resize=240%2C320&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?resize=768%2C1025&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sylviapalth_smithsonian.jpg?resize=1151%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1151w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sylvia Plath by Rollie McKenna (Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Several years earlier, the teenage Plath had begun contouring her consciousness and mapping its psychological promontories, its luminous surfaces and its dark edges, rhapsodizing about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/05/sylvia-plath-letters-home/\">the joy of living</a>, thinking deeply about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/27/sylvia-plath-journals-privilege-free-will/\">free will and what make us who we are</a>, and composing <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/03/sylvia-plath-letters-home-first-tragic-poem/\">her first tragic poem</a> in response to a minor domestic accident.

It is one thing to feel deeply the tragedy of that loss, to rue the help not available to them in their time of struggle; it is quite another to fault the faulty instrument itself. It is impossible for any one consciousness to truly know what living inside another is like in the first place &#8212; we make art and poems and songs to try to show each other what it is like to be alive in this body-mind. But it is especially unfathomable for a mind coursing with fairly ordinary biochemistry, housed in a brain with fairy ordinary neurophysiology, to grasp what it might be like to live with a mind inflamed by ceaselessly misfiring neurotransmitters or a mind housed in a brain with a large tumor pressing against the amygdala at every moment of every hour. To survive even a single day with such a mind is no small feat. To have not only survived thirty-one years, as Sylvia Plath did, but to have filled those years with works of staggering beauty, with poems that irradiate generations of lives &#8212; that is a rare triumph of the spirit. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_62205\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/17/sylvia-plath-one-life-smithsonian-visual-art/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian9.jpg?resize=680%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"512\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62205\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian9.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian9.jpg?resize=240%2C181&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian9.jpg?resize=320%2C241&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian9.jpg?resize=768%2C579&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian9.jpg?resize=600%2C452&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of Sylvia Plath&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/17/sylvia-plath-one-life-smithsonian-visual-art/\">little-known paintings</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Complement with May Sarton on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/17/may-sarton-journal-of-a-solitude-depression/\">the cure for despair</a> and Lorraine Hansberry &#8212; another visionary artist of Plath&#8217;s generation, who also lived and made in the darkest depths &#8212; on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/07/lorraine-hansberry-depression/\">the most reliable antidote to depression</a>, then hear Meryl Streep read Plath&#8217;s stunning <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/04/meryl-streep-morning-song-sylvia-plath/\">&#8220;Morning Song&#8221;</a> and savor a rare glimpse of the poet&#8217;s inner world through her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/17/sylvia-plath-one-life-smithsonian-visual-art/\">little-known paintings</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

Le Guin wrote in her superb meditation on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/\">the magic of human communication</a>. But words have limits, for they are the currency of concepts, yet so much of what we try to communicate to one another &#8212; so much of our emotional reality &#8212; lies in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/05/11/alxous-huxley-knowledge-understanding/\">the realm of immediate experience beyond concept</a>. Bach&#8217;s <em>Goldberg Variations</em> or a Rothko painting can color our consciousness with a feeling-tone that reaches beyond words to touch us, to transform us, to feed energy back and forth in ineffable ways. At its best, even poetry, though rendered in words, paints images that speak directly to our senses, sings in feeling-tones that harmonize our innermost experience. Poetry, after all, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/02/pythagoras-sappho-music/\">began with music</a>, and music remains the most powerful instrument we have devised for conveying raw emotional reality &#8212; something the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay readily and memorably acknowledged when she proclaimed that she would rather die than live without music and exclaimed, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/15/writers-on-music/\">&#8220;Even poetry, Sweet Patron Muse forgive me the words, is not what music is&#8221;</a>; the poetic neurologist Oliver Sacks found echoes of her sentiment in the science, observing music&#8217;s  <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/09/11/oliver-sacks-musicophilia/\">&#8220;unique power to express inner states or feelings [and] pierce the heart directly.&#8221;</a> </p>\n<p>Great picture-books achieve the same thing &#8212; which is why Maurice Sendak, perhaps the most poetic picture-book maker of all time, so ardently insisted on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/17/the-shape-of-music-maurice-sendak/\">musicality as the key to great storytelling</a>. Among the rarest triumphs of the genre is the wordless 2009 masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/House-Tolman-Marije-Ronald-Hardcover/dp/B00YW3VN7A/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"

the treehouse seems like it was built a long time, abandoned, the cracks in it gaping unrepaired. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/House-Tolman-Marije-Ronald-Hardcover/dp/B00YW3VN7A/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman8.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73469\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman8.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman8.jpg?resize=320%2C213&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman8.jpg?resize=240%2C160&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/House-Tolman-Marije-Ronald-Hardcover/dp/B00YW3VN7A/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman29.jpg?resize=680%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73492\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman29.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman29.jpg?resize=320%2C215&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman29.jpg?resize=600%2C403&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman29.jpg?resize=240%2C161&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thetreehouse_tolman29.jpg?resize=768%2C516&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the warm wordless silence of the story, I read a subtle admonition &#8212;
