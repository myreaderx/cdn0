While most were more than willing to help check the spread of COVID-19, many worried that remote instruction would fall short of their standard tuition rates, which remain among the highest in the country.</p><p>These concerns were especially prevalent among film production majors, who require access to expensive tools like cameras, lights, and microphones, as well as in-person instruction to learn their complicated crafts. These resources raise the university's<a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/tuition-and-other-costs/cost-of-attendance.html#tisch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> average cost of attendance</a> for undergraduates from $56,500 to $62,062 a year.</p><p>With equipment stashed away inside campus vaults and glitchy Zoom meetings complicating the already herculean task of teaching someone how to set up a <a href=\"https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/how-to-achieve-perfect-dolly-shot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dolly shot</a> when they are half a world away, it did not take long before reimbursement requests started flooding the email accounts of faculty administrators.</p><p>Initially, inquiries into possible refunds were met with a performance. Reminding students that the institution itself was bleeding, too, Tisch School of the Arts Dean Allyson Green shared a recording of herself dancing to \"Losing my Religion\" along with the message that \"great art will be made of this time, just as it has in times past.\"</p><p>Pandemic or not, film school has always had a tough time justifying its own existence. Aside from the fact that film school is as expensive as filmmaking itself, many famous directors — from Martin Scorsese to Quentin Tarantino — never went to film school and instead stand by the idea that creativity cannot be taught in a classroom.</p><p>Though passionate creatives find a way regardless of the hand they were dealt, these past two years have prompted students, schools, and employers to take a closer look at the potential of remote learning, and aspiring filmmakers found that YouTube offers many options for learning screenwriting, cinematography, and editing. All for free.</p><h2>A world-class education on YouTube</h2><p>If you want to receive an undergraduate degree from NYU's Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, which <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> ranked as the<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/top-25-american-film-schools-ranked-1134785/1-usc-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> second-best program</a> of its kind in America, you would need to complete coursework in three categories: production, writing, and history and criticism, the last of which roughly translates to cinema studies.</p><p>Let's start with cinema studies because these lecture-based courses easily lend themselves to online alternatives. Obviously, you will need to watch a lot of movies and TV if you want to become a filmmaker — not just contemporary hits but classics as well, preferably from all around the world rather than just the bowels of Hollywood.</p><p>When composing a watch list, students should look for authoritative sources. These include rankings from respected organizations like the<a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> British Film Institute</a>,<a href=\"https://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Writers Guild of America</a>, and the<a href=\"https://www.thegreatestfilms.com/List/Directors-Guild-of-America-DGA/The-80-Best-Directed-Films\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Directors Guild of America</a>, not to mention esteemed trade publications such as<a href=\"https://www.filmcomment.com/best-films-of-the-decade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Film Comment</em></a> and<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/cahiers-du-cinema-top-100\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Cahiers du Cinéma</em></a>.</p><p>While these listmakers are highly respected within the industry, they also form part of an outdated film establishment. For more culturally diverse selections, look no further than the YouTube channel<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtL1edhT8qqY-j2JIndMzg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Cinefix</a>, which uploads encyclopedic overviews of the most original, most beautiful, and most groundbreaking films.</p><p>If watching great movies constitutes the first part of cinema studies, figuring out what makes them so great must be the second. As far as independent content creators go, filmmakers Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou are without a doubt the most skilled and eloquent film instructors you will be able to find on the internet.</p><p>With over 28 videos ranging from the ways in which Hong Kong stuntman Jackie Chan choreographs action scenes to Buster Keaton's influence on visual comedy, their popular YouTube channel<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Every Frame a Painting</a> provides a crash course in editing, cinematography, sound design, and much, much more.</p><h2>A YouTube education curriculum</h2>\n        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"5626fc5edb84aff586da68ef9492f5f6\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d5752\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4ODEwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NDA1NDExMH0.0qZkEJz8jc-ntHHw-Q3kHBzgZW-rtLRctzxwYz2zzDY/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/J39X2xX_8CQ\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Jeremy Yap via Unsplash</small></p>\n        <p>Up next is writing, which is tougher to teach as every writer has their own near-religious notions of what a proper story should look like. If Charlie Kaufman's self-referential film <em>Adaptation</em> taught us anything, it is that screenwriters should not blindly follow the dictates of imposing Hollywood script gurus like Robert McKee.<br/></p><p>In truth, they would be better off listening to advice from the soft-spoken Michael Tucker, whose channel<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/LessonsfromtheScreenplay\" target=\"_blank\"> Lessons From the Screenplay</a> (LFTS) breaks down the framework behind <em>Adaptation</em>, <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>, <em>Get Out</em>, and other films better than stone-cold writing manuals like McKee's <em>Story</em> ever could.</p><p>There are actually quite a lot of narrative focused video essayists worth checking out, if only for their different tastes and perspectives. Aside from LFTS, you also have<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx0L2ZdYfiq-tsAXb8IXpQg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Just Write</a>,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/HelloFutureMe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Hello Future Me</a>,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NandovMovies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Nando v Movies</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/nerdwriter1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Nerdwriter1</a>, each of which analyzes noteworthy films of all kinds, from hidden gems to action blockbusters.</p><p>As helpful as these channels may be, however, the majority of them are owned and operated by people who have spent their careers critiquing movies rather than actually writing them. To that end, the most valuable channel of all may just be the least known one: an up-and-coming channel called<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3osNjJeuDdvyALIEP-nh0g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Behind the Curtain</a>.</p><p>The premise is simple: rather than relying on commentary from story analysts, this channel sifts the internet to piece together the profoundest tidbits of advice uttered by some of the industry's finest filmmakers, from Vince Giligan and Aaron Sorken to Christopher Nolan and the Safdie Brothers.</p><h2>Learning how to use equipment — also on YouTube</h2><p>While reviewing films and writing screenplays can easily be done alone at home, getting familiar with industry equipment cannot. For this reason, production and post-production are the most difficult subjects to teach online. Still, despite the many challenges involved, YouTubers have found ways to make it work. </p><p>Whether you are trying to do something as simple as changing a lightbulb or as complicated as building your own personal nuclear reactor, chances are someone somewhere has uploaded a YouTube video showing you exactly how to do it, and the core components of filmmaking are no exception to this unwritten rule.</p><p>Where<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc0D1yh3TGE8dJSLm9VmEdg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Aputure</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6xliqRXcbqk6vU_GxaITQQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Grip Tips</a> offer tutorials for individual lights and camera models,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHg96xQd03z-xXgMBRwYzw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Hurlbut Academy</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TheSlantedLens\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> The Slanted Lens</a> show viewers how to incorporate these tools into particular set layouts.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDBV1_28Q_NKF2SxnLO-3jg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Deity Microphones</a> is a great source for everything sound related, from best positions to hold a boom pole to how to mic a moving car.</p><p>Once you have learned to jump, it is time to fly. Channels like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7gBcKzHKc0oOR5-XiWdlFQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> wolfcrow</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmhVYUCCOm0D5bT12MOr5_w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Shutterstock</a> explain how some of the techniques analyzed by the aforementioned content creators can be implemented using combinations of equipment. Along the way,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/indymogul\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Indy Mogul</a> discusses tricks to keep your productions cheap as well as efficient.</p><p>Inside the editing room, footage shot on set is broken down and reassembled. Before aspiring filmmakers are able to play with their images, however, they will have to learn how to use a number of complicated software applications. While this may seem like an insurmountable task at first, it is nothing a simple step-by-step guide cannot fix.</p><p>The entertainment industry uses hundreds of applications, and whatever combination of them you end up using depends on the niche in which you establish yourself. That said, two of the most widely used for post-production jobs are Adobe Premiere (used to edit films) and After Effects (used to add, well, aftereffects). </p><p>As far as Premiere tutorials go, you cannot get more detailed than that of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Justthisgood\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Justin Odisho</a>, whose playlists consist of nearly 290 videos, taking young editors from basic concepts to advanced methods. YouTuber<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SonduckFilm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> SonduckFilm</a> does the same thing but for After Effects, across a whopping 440 separate installments no less.</p><h2>DIY Filmmaking</h2><p>Once you have watched each and every one of these YouTubers, you will inevitably come face to face with the question, \"What's next?\" As informative as the internet can be, it often enables us to procrastinate. When trying to learn something off YouTube, therefore, it is paramount that you do more than just binge watch videos.</p><p>Instead of falling down bottomless internet rabbit holes, aspiring filmmakers should go out into the real world and put the knowledge gained from all those content creators to the test. Around the country, film festivals offer opportunities for struggling artists to display their work and build their resume.</p><p>Aside from festivals, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, creative fellowships, and development labs offer funds and resources that give people the extra push they need to finish that script that they have been working on or secure funding for that production they have been meaning to organize.</p><p>The second question — whether it is worth putting yourself through film school — is a lot more difficult to answer, especially since the events of 2020 have breathed new life into the discussion. Will checking out any of these YouTubers turn you into the next George Lucas? Probably not, but a degree from CalArts cannot guarantee it either.</p><p>Ryan Koo, founder of<a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/u/ryan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> No Film School</a>, once said he built his free, online database not because he wanted to discourage anybody from attending film school, but because he wanted to provide crucial resources to people who did not have the time or money to attend film school.</p><p>In a similar vein, I do not argue that applying to film school months after the zenith of a global pandemic is a poor decision to make. Rather, I want to show aspiring filmmakers that they do not have to go through formal and expensive programs to pursue their passion.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/58ODdkRA6Ew\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4ODA5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzgyOTg1NH0.wIgmfvHsILCqeBWmc3cG3Mr_ODHylOU8PbDnqX9fJhg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C108%2C0%2C274&height=700","linkMd5":"5345321b556c200b513fa64d6b5c6141","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn39@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-21-291_9d889a5a256b1478.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":114492,"destBytes":114492,"author":"Tim Brinkhof","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4ODA5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzgyOTg1NH0.wIgmfvHsILCqeBWmc3cG3Mr_ODHylOU8PbDnqX9fJhg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C108%2C0%2C274&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn39@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-21-291_9d889a5a256b1478.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4ODEwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NDA1NDExMH0.0qZkEJz8jc-ntHHw-Q3kHBzgZW-rtLRctzxwYz2zzDY/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn11@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-281_d575282c7f808c20.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/58ODdkRA6Ew":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn25@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-41-997_321a64710684809e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588787},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"A gruesome death: the macabre science of dehydration","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/gruesome-death-macabre-science-dehydration","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzIxMTU4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1Njg3NDQ3Nn0.gC7MEHWnVRMpn17kushgVhOdg5UJhQaGYvANJckFSD8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul><li>When our bodies are deprived of water, they take water from other organs, ultimately leading to organ failure and brain shrinkage.</li><li>Dehydration is considered one of the most painful and protracted deaths a human can experience.</li><li>Every year, more athletes die from overhydration than dehydration.</li></ul><hr/><p>In 1994, the Italian athlete <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30046426.amp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mauro Prosperi</a> entered one of the most intense and grueling endurance races in the world: the Marathon des Sables. This six-day ultra-marathon takes place in the Sahara desert, and it pushes people to the limits of their mental and physical abilities. The temperatures of the race can reach up to 50 C° (122 F°), and the average runner drinks 13 liters (3.4 gallons) per day, most of which comes straight out as sweat. </p><p>But for Mauro, things were even worse than that. After a sandstorm, the former Olympian was caught alone for ten days in the desert without a support team or supplies to help him through. Over the course of his wandering, Mauro stayed alive by storing his earliest urine in bottles — since this had the highest water content — and drinking it later on. He killed and ate twenty bats and drank their blood in the hope of staying hydrated. Luckily, it worked just long enough. Eventually, he came across a goat herder, and his long recovery began. </p><p>But in such a short time, his body was wrecked by dehydration. His eyes were nearly ruined and his liver was seriously damaged. He could not eat anything other than soup or water for weeks, and it took him two years to fully recover. </p><h2>Walking bags of water</h2><p>It has long been known that hydration is essential to a properly functioning body. Our bodies are 50 to 70 percent water, which means an average man will contain up to 40 liters (10.6 gallons). This can differ on any given day, and it largely explains why our body weight also can fluctuate by about 2 kg (5 pounds) per day. </p><p>It is recommended that we each drink roughly 3 liters (0.8 gallon) of water a day to replace the stuff we lose through breathing, sweating, and urinating. While this seems like a lot, for most of us, that water comes from drinks like coffee or soda, and up to 20 percent of it can come from the food we eat. Yet, on some days, we just do not drink enough, and it shows.</p><p>When we are mildly dehydrated, our bodies start to creak. We get headaches because, without water, the brain will contract ever so slightly, causing it to pull away from the skull. We get constipated because our body draws needed water from the large intestine. We get tired and find it hard to focus because, without water, our blood literally thickens, meaning the body has to work harder to get nutrients and oxygen to the organs. </p><p>It is thought that even a 2 percent drop in hydration levels can noticeably impede performance in a variety of areas. Usually, this can be easily resolved, but what happens if you continue to dehydrate? And why is it thought to be one of the most painful and protracted deaths that we can experience?</p><h2>A gruesome death by dehydration</h2><p>Imagine for a moment that someone was to lock the doors where you are right now. Assuming you had no emergency bottles of water, it would take you roughly seven days to die from dehydration. If you were lost in the desert with no water at all, it would take a day and a half.</p><p>When the body is forced into extreme situations like heat, cold, or water deprivation, it makes a tactical decision to withdraw resources from the least essential parts first. With dehydration, this initially happens in the kidneys. Our kidneys will reabsorb water that would have been used in urine, so this is why your urine gets darker when you are dehydrated — the urea concentration increases. </p><p>When this is still not enough, the body will draw water from your cells and organs to retain the necessary blood pressure to keep you ticking. Your eyes will contract to expose the conjunctiva, your lips will shrivel away entirely, your teeth and gums will project outward like on a skeleton, your skin blackens and dries out, and your tongue becomes a tiny piece of beef jerky. If you are cut, you are too dry to even bleed.</p><p>Only after days of this slow tortue will you die. With less and less water, the blood in your body will thicken, and your blood pressure will drop drastically. This means that all of the oxygen and nutrients in your blood will take a lot longer to get to your organs, and so they become deprived. Your brain, heart, kidneys, and liver begin to fail. Ultimately, your brain will start to shrink from osmosis in an attempt to hydrate the body (the brain has a lot of water), which eventually will cause you to die.</p><h2>A finely tuned machine</h2><p>When blood volume changes — that is, decreases through dehydration or increases through overhydration — the careful balance of electrolytes is disrupted. These electrolytes (potassium and sodium, mainly) are responsible for muscle contraction and conducting nerve signals, so an imbalance is extremely serious and potentially lethal. </p><p>This is why rehydration needs to be treated as carefully as dehydration. In 2007, fitness instructor David Rogers died after finishing the London Marathon, not because he drank too little but because he drank far too much. His was far from the only such death. Today, it is thought that more athletes die from overhydration than dehydration. </p><p>The problem is that when we feel really thirsty, it can take a while for the body (specifically, the hypothalamus in the brain) to register that it has enough water. If someone drinks <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-50170837\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 liters (1.3 gallons) of wate</a>r in a short space of time, the body will whisk the fluid away to cells far too quickly. This causes sodium levels to become diluted (a state known as \"hyponatremia\"), which in turn causes organs like the lungs and brain to take on too much water and swell dangerously. This could cause you to faint or even die.</p><p>Hyponatremia highlights just how fragile our body's homeostatic balance really is. While the human body can endure a great many things — and it really is hugely adaptable most of the time — it is also in many ways incredibly fragile. Even a day without a glass of water can impede our performance. After a few more days, you will be dead. </p><p>So, the next time you notice your urine darkening, remember that this is the first step your body is taking to prevent serious organ damage.</p><p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

What's more, this protection does <em>not </em>seem to stem from the behavioral or lifestyle traits of couples but rather from a biological mechanism that directly inhibits tumor growth. </p><h2>The widowhood effect</h2><p>Published in the journal <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/64711\" target=\"_blank\"><em>eLife</em></a>, the study used mice to explore the \"widowhood effect,\" a well-documented phenomenon in which someone becomes more likely to die shortly after the death of their spouse. </p><p>The researchers extracted blood sera from two groups of mice. One group comprised monogamous mice that had bonded for one year; the other had their pair bonds disrupted after 12 months. The researchers then grew human lung cancer cells in sera from both groups. In the blood of mice with disrupted pair bonds, cancer cells grew larger, took on shapes linked to an increased risk of cancer, and showed gene activity that suggested an increased ability to spread. </p><p>The researchers conducted a second experiment within live mice. They extracted lung cancer cells from pair-bonded and pair-disrupted mice and implanted the cells into virgin mice with weakened immune systems. The cancer cells from pair-disrupted mice grew more effectively in the virgin rodents, suggesting that \"the protective effects of pair bonding persist even after removal from the original mouse.\"</p><h2>Love heals all wounds</h2><p>Overall, the results suggest that social activity — particularly pair bonding, e.g. positive and intimate relationships — can change the gene expression and growth of tumors. But how? It is not exactly clear, but the authors of an article published in <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914(21)00195-7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Trends in Molecular Medicine</em></a> proposed a three-step process:</p><ol><li>Social information is encoded in a neural signal.</li><li>The neural signal directly or indirectly induces the release of some sort of immune-related factor into the bloodstream. </li><li>The humoral factor binds to a receptor on cancer cells that induces changes in gene expression.</li></ol><p>If correct, this process could change how researchers think about the widowhood effect, which is often explained by lifestyle changes, hormone-induced changes to the heart, or disregarded as coincidence. The new model could establish a biological basis for the effect, one that illuminates avenues for novel cancer treatments in humans — if the same processes are observed in people. </p><p>The researchers wrote: </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"...cancers at widowhood represent a distinct pathological entity that may deserve targeted therapeutic strategies, which should take into consideration social interactions. Thus, preventive measures could be developed to mitigate such pro-oncogenic effects in individuals at bereavement.\"</p><p>It's hard to say what those treatments would look like. After all, even though research has linked pair-bonding to <a href=\"https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2017/02/relationships.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">numerous health benefits</a> — longer lifespan, lower blood pressure, improved mental health — doctors cannot prescribe love. Pharmacological treatments would probably need to do the job.</p><p>The researchers also noted that the results raise concerns over medical studies that utilize animal models: given that the health of mice may partly depend on the rodents' own relationships, it is possible that some studies failed to \"accurately capture the whole spectrum of the tumorigenic process and the associated host-derived factors.\"</p><div></div><ul></ul><div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/BQtxLK3Fwxw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE5MDc3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NjM5NTk2MX0.H5O3CFF63_l4FvgdPjJJ09ToE2seHO1VLxxF7wZLxWc/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C349%2C0%2C350&height=700","linkMd5":"b5cebaf8ff4a0ce77dae2d446a841a17","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-21-222_16726247dfc97622.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":107686,"destBytes":107686,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE5MDc3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NjM5NTk2MX0.H5O3CFF63_l4FvgdPjJJ09ToE2seHO1VLxxF7wZLxWc/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C349%2C0%2C350&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-21-222_16726247dfc97622.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/BQtxLK3Fwxw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn37@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-984_a0cbf894fc5ef57b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588781},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"The most terrifying pterosaur yet is discovered","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/thapunngaka-shawi","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3NDcyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY5MDc5NTE0OH0.cEmRyumJxmXNB8axcD5h7SJS2t-kCEFE87Dq8JPz3Y0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul><li>Australian scientists identify a fossil as a previously unknown pterosaur.</li><li><span></span>The pterosaur was large and savage.</li><li>Only a part of its jaw was found, but that was enough to draw several conclusions about it.</li></ul><hr/><p>Who hasn't wondered what it would be like to live in the era of the dinosaurs?

Over three months in mid-2020, Marcel Moran visited every last one of them.</p>\n<h2>Not just a weird hobby</h2>\n<p>It would have been one of the weirder ways to kill time during the first months of the pandemic, but Mr. Moran's reasons were more noteworthy than that. His was the first comprehensive survey of San Francisco's bus stop amenities — more precisely, the level of comfort and security that they provide.</p>\n<p>Previous studies show that the presence of seats, shelter, and even nearby trees make waiting for the bus seem shorter. Also, electronic screens showing estimated times of arrival (ETAs) reduce the frustration of waiting.</p>\n<p>This suggests that a well-furnished bus stop will reassure riders and can even attract more. On the other hand, a shoddy, neglected bus stop will do the opposite. Accordingly, a number of transit agencies aim to improve the quality of their bus stops. However, what's missing from their approach is a comprehensive study of bus-stop amenities to underpin such a strategy.</p>\n<p>Or it was, until now. Mr Moran, a Ph.D. candidate in city planning at Berkeley, has produced a \"census\" of bus stop amenities throughout San Francisco — the first standardized overview of its kind. For each of the stops, he wanted to know: Is it properly indicated? Does it offer seating and/or shelter? Is there an electronic message board with real-time traffic info — and does it work properly? And is the access from curb to bus unobstructed by parked cars? <br /></p>\n<h2>No seating, no shelter, no signage — no riders?</h2>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a120ecfbb1d7c47177b90e4d214526b4\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"9f8b4\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDk0OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMzM5NzgxM30.ciTqVA1W6iAd1pUVqUmT_GObyphL9TNOyo1vCMxsWPI/img.png?width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">Only 34 percent of bus stops in San Francisco offer seating (white), while 66 percent do not (red). </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jpt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Marcel Moran / Journal of Public Transportation – <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC 4.0</a></small></p>\n<p>In a number of ways, San Francisco is an ideal place to test the quality of public transport amenities.

There are, however, \"hotspots\" along the ridge that can reach 1,600 degrees Celsius, comparable to the hottest lava.</p><p>The team's results, appearing in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, </em>provide a temperature map of the Earth's interior around ocean ridges. With this map, scientists can better understand the melting processes that give rise to undersea volcanoes, and how these processes may drive the pace of plate tectonics over time.</p><p>\"Convection and plate tectonics have been important processes in shaping Earth history,\" says lead author Stephanie Brown Krein, a postdoc in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). \"Knowing the temperature along this whole chain is fundamental to understanding the planet as a heat engine, and how Earth might be different from other planets and able to sustain life.\"</p><p>Krein's co-authors include Zachary Molitor, an EAPS graduate student, and Timothy Grove, the R.R. Schrock Professor of Geology at MIT.</p><h2>A chemical history</h2><p>The Earth's interior temperature has played a critical role in shaping the planet's surface over hundreds of millions of years. But there's been no way to directly read this temperature tens to hundreds of kilometers below the surface. Scientists have applied indirect means to infer the temperature of the upper mantle — the layer of the Earth just below the crust. But estimates thus far are inconclusive, and scientists disagree about how widely temperatures vary beneath the surface.</p><p>For their new study, Krein and her colleagues developed a new algorithm, called ReversePetrogen, that is designed to trace a rock's chemical history back in time, to identify its original composition of elements and determine the temperature at which the rock initially melted below the surface.</p><p>The algorithm is based on years of experiments carried out in Grove's lab to reproduce and characterize the melting processes of the Earth's interior. Researchers in the lab have heated up rocks of various compositions, reaching various temperatures and pressures, to observe their chemical evolution. From these experiments, the team has been able to derive equations — and ultimately, the new algorithm — to predict the relationships between a rock's temperature, pressure, and chemical composition.</p><p>Krein and her colleagues applied their new algorithm to rocks collected along the Earth's ocean ridges — a system of undersea volcanoes spanning more than 70,000 kilometers in length. Ocean ridges are regions where tectonic plates are spread apart by the eruption of material from the Earth's mantle — a process that is driven by underlying temperatures.</p><p>\"You could effectively make a model of the temperature of the entire interior of the Earth, based partly on the temperature at these ridges,\" Krein says. \"The question is, what is the data really telling us about the temperature variation in the mantle along the whole chain?\"</p><h2>Mantle map</h2><p>The data the team analyzed include more than 13,500 samples collected along the length of the ocean ridge system over several decades, by multiple research cruises. Each sample in the dataset is of an erupted sea glass — lava that erupted in the ocean and was instantly chilled by the surrounding water into a pristine, preserved form.</p><p>Scientists previously identified the chemical compositions of each glass in the dataset. Krein and her colleagues ran each sample's chemical compositions through their algorithm to determine the temperature at which each glass originally melted in the mantle.</p><p>In this way, the team was able to generate a map of mantle temperatures along the entire length of the ocean ridge system. From this map, they observed that much of the mantle is relatively homogenous, with an average temperature of around 1,350 degrees Celsius. There are however, \"hotspots,\" or regions along the ridge, where temperatures in the mantle appear significantly hotter, at around 1,600 degrees Celsius.</p><p>\"People think of hotspots as regions in the mantle where it's hotter, and where material may be melting more, and potentially rising faster, and we don't exactly know why, or how much hotter they are, or what the role of composition is at hotspots,\" Krein says. \"Some of these hotspots are on the ridge, and now we may get a sense of what the hotspot variation is globally using this new technique. That tells us something fundamental about the temperature of the Earth now, and now we can think of how it's changed over time.\"</p><p>Krein adds: \"Understanding these dynamics will help us better determine how continents grew and evolved on Earth, and when subduction and plate tectonics started — which are critical for complex life.\"</p><p>This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.</p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT News</a>.

(2) Is there an arc to history?</li><li>Social physics, which is a branch of complex system theory, can help answer these questions.</li></ul><hr/><p>This moment in history certainly feels different. The assumptions built into the Cold War and post-Cold War political order that I grew up with are evaporating. Digital technologies are pushing us into entirely new and unknown social forms at speeds that make even the last century's change seem languid. And, most importantly, the planet's climate is changing rapidly in ways that are likely to push hard on our global project of civilization. Looking at all these movements of politics, culture, and even the planet itself, it is hard to know if there are greater forces at work or whether it is all just a random mess of chaos. </p><p>In other words, is there an arc to history, or is it just a random walk to no place in particular?</p><p>Now, I am just a simple country astrophysicist and not a historian, so my perspective on this question skews in two directions. First, I do think (and write) a lot on the history of science and technology. I am particularly interested in the way science and culture have been braided over the last five centuries to create this high-tech, energy-intensive version of human civilization. Second, a new and fascinating transdisciplinary field of social physics is emerging that combines history, statistical mechanics, and data science to look for deeper (and even predictive) patterns during human events.</p><p>So, beginning from these two perspectives, let's ask the question again in two different ways: (1) Does history have a grand narrative? (2) Is there an arc to history?</p><h2>Does history have a grand narrative?</h2><p>A grand narrative is a constellation of ideas and stories that attempts to make sense of a particular moment in history. The Enlightenment is an example of a grand narrative. Beginning in the mid 1700s, people across Europe began assembling a set of new ideas about a society based on reason and equality. They were rejecting the old feudal social and religious orders and seeking to replace them with something they imagined would be better. Science played an essential part in this conception of \"better.\" The already stunning progress of science served as a model that Enlightenment thinkers believed could be used to progress toward something more just, free, and equitable. In this way, the Enlightenment thinkers believed there was a grand narrative for their moment in history, and by fleshing it out in ideas, they provided a kind of mental blueprint for what followed. </p><blockquote> Looking at all these movements of politics, culture, and even the planet itself, it is hard to know if there are greater forces at work or whether it is all just a random mess of chaos.</blockquote><p>But was that blueprint really followed? Or is it just in 20/20 hindsight that we pull something out of the randomness of events and call it \"The Enlightenment\"? It is, after all, easy to see how random events can shape history. There is the old ditty about how \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">for the want of a shoe the horse was lost</a>.\" That random event leads all the way to the loss of a kingdom. It is hard to deny that randomness and chaos also play a part in the course of events.</p><h2>Is there an arc to history?</h2><p>So, let's ask the second version of our question: Is there an arc to history? </p><p>This is where <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53300-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">social physics</a> comes in. Social physics is really just a branch of complex system theory (which is a field you can expect a lot more posts on because it is currently blowing my mind). Complex systems embrace everything from cells to microbial colonies to ecosystems to financial systems to human societies. It is truly a transdisciplinary field that uses insights from all kinds of domains to build something entirely new. One of those insights is the recognition of how randomness can play a central role in pushing a system from one \"state\" to another. </p><p>Complex systems are, well… complex. There can be many variables or degrees of freedom that comprise them. For a social order, it may be the level of economic output, income inequality, literacy, life expectancy, and so forth. What is amazing about complex systems is that, in spite of this complexity, they can settle into stable configurations for long periods. You may have kings and lords and clergy and serfs for 1000 years or more. During that time, random events are always happening. Things like bad harvests occur, and they may lead to bread riots in the villages. But somehow those random events do not perturb the system's stability.</p><h2>Tipping points</h2><p>But then there are moments in the system's evolution when it begins nearing what are called \"critical points\" or \"tipping points.\" The background dynamic of the system is ripe for being blown up. It is only at a critical point that a random bread riot can suddenly escalate into a storming of the palace, which then leads to an overturn of the ruling council, which then possibly leads to an entirely new social arrangement.</p><p>For me at least, complex systems help us understand how the two forms of the question about grand narratives get put together. The arc of history is not smooth, and it is not determined beforehand. Randomness as a social system approaches critical points is all important. But grand narratives spun by writers, philosophers, artists, politicians, and scientists can create a background of ideas. As you near a tipping point, those ideas can get picked up and amplified to become the organizing principles for the new arrangement that emerges.</p><p>So, the big questions now become: (1) Are we near a tipping point? (2) What are the new ideas that stand ready to take us someplace new and better?</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/370GrPBz4Rs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4Nzg1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTk3MzEzNH0.KcfAd_Jgstkyht_GnvSP0qt0SrNSF9mCqLXy0guNoqs/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"5f3cc7ef19290c910f1683416bf84f57","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn36@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-11-935_5bd9b9c8299031b0.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":15972,"destBytes":15972,"author":"Adam Frank","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4Nzg1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTk3MzEzNH0.KcfAd_Jgstkyht_GnvSP0qt0SrNSF9mCqLXy0guNoqs/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn36@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-11-935_5bd9b9c8299031b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/370GrPBz4Rs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn5@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-987_75d4aafdc46daf4a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588781},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"Three powerful technologies we borrowed from nature","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/technology-borrowed-from-nature","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3MzQyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzY3NTE5Nn0.czPe1DJ3XqyTIVuKgYIL1jVvvRhWBzgt1BbnjLL3KVg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C312%2C0%2C312&height=700\"/><br/><br/><p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397/\" target=\"_blank\">Watson and Crick</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1933/schrodinger/biographical/\" target=\"_blank\">Schrödinger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/biographical/\" target=\"_blank\">Einstein</a> all made theoretical breakthroughs that have changed the world's understanding of science.\n</p><hr/><p>\n\tToday big, game-changing ideas are less common.

It is a genetic library consisting of short repeats of DNA gathered over time from hostile viruses, paired with a protein called Cas that can cut viral DNA as if with scissors. In the natural world, when bacteria are attacked by viruses whose DNA has been stored in the CRISPR archive, the CRISPR-Cas system hunts down, cuts and destroys the viral DNA.\n</p><p>\n\tScientists have repurposed these weapons for their own use, with groundbreaking effect.

However, before CRISPR-Cas, we researchers didn't have the tools to easily access and edit the genes in living organisms. Today, thanks to CRISPR-Cas, lab work that used to take months and years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars can be done in less than a week for just a few hundred dollars.<br/></p><p>\n\tThere are more than 10,000 genetic disorders caused by mutations that occur on only one gene, the <a href=\"http://hihg.med.miami.edu/thromboticstorm/genetics-overview/single-gene-disorders\">so-called single-gene disorders</a>. They affect millions of people. <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Sickle-Cell-Disease\" target=\"_blank\">Sickle cell anemia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cff.org/What-is-CF/Genetics/CF-Genetics-The-Basics/\" target=\"_blank\">cystic fibrosis</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2016.18.1/pnopoulos\" target=\"_blank\">Huntington's disease</a> are among the most well-known of these disorders. These are all obvious targets for CRISPR therapy because it is much simpler to fix or replace just one defective gene rather than needing to correct errors on multiple genes.\n</p><p>\n\tFor example, in preclinical studies, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454\" target=\"_blank\">researchers injected</a> an encapsuled CRISPR system into patients born with a rare genetic disease, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/656/familial-transthyretin-amyloidosis\" target=\"_blank\">transthyretin amyloidosis</a>, that causes fatal nerve and heart conditions. Preliminary results from the study demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01776-4\" target=\"_blank\">that CRISPR-Cas can be injected</a> directly into patients in such a way that it can find and edit the faulty genes associated with a disease. In the six patients included in this landmark work, the encapsuled CRISPR-Cas minimissiles reached their target genes and did their job, causing a significant drop in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/protein-misfolding-and-degenerative-diseases-14434929/\" target=\"_blank\">misfolded protein</a> associated with the disease.\n</p><h2>Jellyfish light up the microscopic world</h2><p>\n\tThe <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/cemills/Aequorea.html\" target=\"_blank\">crystal jellyfish, Aequorea victoria</a>, which drifts aimlessly in the northern Pacific, has no brain, no anus and no poisonous stingers. It is an unlikely candidate to ignite a revolution in biotechnology. Yet on the periphery of its umbrella, it has about 300 photo-organs that give off pinpricks of green light that have changed the way science is conducted.\n</p><p>\n\tThis bioluminescent light in the jellyfish stems from a luminescent protein called aequorin and a fluorescent molecule called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.072744\" target=\"_blank\">green fluorescent protein</a>, or GFP. In modern biotechnology GFP acts as a molecular lightbulb that can be fused to other proteins, allowing researchers to track them and to see when and where proteins are being made in the cells of living organisms. Fluorescent protein technology is used in thousands of labs every day and has resulted in the awarding of two Nobel Prizes, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2008/popular-information/\" target=\"_blank\">one in 2008</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2014/summary/\" target=\"_blank\">other in 2014</a>.

But if a lamp is turned on, the algae will swim toward the light. The single-celled <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/flagellate\" target=\"_blank\">flagellates</a> – so named for the whiplike appendages they use to move around – don't have eyes. Instead, they have a structure called an eyespot that distinguishes between light and darkness. The eyespot is studded with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1525538113\" target=\"_blank\">light-sensitive proteins called channelrhodopsins</a>.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1525\" target=\"_blank\">researchers discovered</a> that when they genetically inserted these channelrhodopsins into the nerve cells of any organism, illuminating the channelrhodopsins with blue light caused neurons to fire. This technique, known as optogenetics, involves inserting the algae gene that makes channelrhodopsin into neurons. When a pinpoint beam of blue light is shined on these neurons, the channelrhodopsins open up, calcium ions flood through the neurons and the neurons fire.\n</p><p>\n\tUsing this tool, scientists can stimulate groups of neurons selectively and repeatedly, thereby gaining a more precise understanding of which neurons to target to treat specific disorders and diseases. Optogenetics might hold the key to treating debilitating and deadly brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.</p>\n        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Image of a glowing human brain model.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3b27e10d238f634f8b8783fe1b33ee03\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d3c3b\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3MjYyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4NzM3OTQ0Nn0.IuH77TMEZMjajCI1gZYH1cX5EyFg1ISVUCZAwE-xuCk/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C377%2C0%2C378&height=700\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@natcon773?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Natasha Connell</a> on Unsplash</small></p>\n        <p>But optogenetics isn't only useful for understanding the brain.

There were also signs of two adjacent landslides in the same time period, which occurred as the two smaller scarps failed.

(No pun intended.) Our brains, and particularly our emotions, respond to music in a uniquely direct manner that's not yet understood. A pair of new studies from researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.sfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Society for Neuroscience</a> report what happens electrically in the brain when we imagine or listen to music.Together, the two studies describe how listening to musical melodies activates an intriguing prediction/recognition system. When there is a pause between notes, the brain makes a prediction about the next note to come. Co-author Giovanni Di Liberto, speaking to <em>Inverse</em>, says the study is about more than just music — it provides a new look at how imagination may work.</p><h2>Why EEG?</h2><p>To eavesdrop on the brain's response to music, both studies utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of participants as they listened to Bach melodies. Although fMRI scans are often used in neuroscience, the authors of the study say they were interested in electrical activity — the EEG's turf — and not blood-oxygen levels, which is what fMRIs capture. EEGs capture data much more quickly than fMRIs, and in music, timing is everything.<br/></p><h2>Study 1: Imagining music</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9abc33a7f3b866557e7895daac8e78af\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"2e2f1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2OTM5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MzQ1NzYyNH0.-tkbjk_s-CPrykMLusIWlewukgqLecmt6jIZ0itt4uY/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@glitchlab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Glitch Lab App</a>/Unsplash</small></p><p>\"Musical imagery is the voluntary internal hearing of music in the mind without the need for physical action or external stimulation,\" write the study authors.<br/></p><p>While previous research has shown that imagining music electrically activates certain areas of the brain, it has been unclear to what extent this activity resembles the electrical behavior of the brain when listening to music. Specifically, it was unknown whether music imagery involves an expectation of what note <em>should</em> come next, as happens when one is listening to music. Another question is whether music imagery encompasses the music's acoustics (that is, the way it sounds).</p><p>To answer these questions, in the <a href=\"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2021/07/23/JNEUROSCI.0183-21.2021\" target=\"_blank\">first study</a>, the researchers used EEG to observe the brain activity of 21 professional musicians as they imagined Bach melodies.</p><p>Using regression analysis, the researchers found that \"imagined neural signals can be predicted accurately, similarly to the listening task, and were sufficiently robust to allow for accurate identification of the imagined musical piece from the EEG.\" Simply put, the scientists were able to identify the Bach songs the participants were imagining.</p><p>As it turns out, both imagining music and listening trigger similar frontal spatial activation. However, though the charges are similar, the EEG readings of the electrical polarity of the brain's neural responses flip — their polarity is positive for listening and negative for imagining. The researchers say this fits with listening's top-down prediction/recognition system observed in the second study.</p><p>Di Liberto explained to <em>Big Think</em> in an email, \"The positive vs. negative charge is what we measure with our technology and what allows us to disentangle sensory and prediction neural signals. The brain may not necessarily encode those as positive or negative,\" he notes, but the EEG signals may just be \"a byproduct of the brain subtracting (or inhibiting) the sensory response by the sensory prediction.\"</p><p>The researchers also observed \"overlapping but distinctive\" electrical responses to the acoustic properties of imagined versus heard music.</p><h2>Study 2: Listening's prediction and recognition routine</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"307994b1aa345414d29a93be6dce2e7c\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"50f2f\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2OTQwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTM2OTcxMX0.hwJ_3n86_Zv6xpQJYo3QY8IiJEVMpj-4Pawe7BzlE0E/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@armand_khoury\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Armand Khoury</a>/Unsplash</small></p><p>For the <a href=\"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2021/07/22/JNEUROSCI.0184-21.2021\" target=\"_blank\">second study</a>, the researchers conducted two experiments in which participants listened to or imagined Bach melodies. Twenty participants participated in the first experiment and 21 people in the second. Once more, after EEG signals were lined up with the music's melodic structure, the same patterns were observed during listening and imagining Bach's notes, albeit again with their electrical polarity flipped.<br/></p><p>During pauses in the music, EEG activity continued, leading the researchers to conclude that the participants' brains were busy imagining the next note to be heard. The same type of activity occurred in silent moments of the songs when there could have been a note but there wasn't. There is no sensory input during silence and imagined music, so this activity comes from the brain's predictions.</p><p>When the predicted note (negative polarity) and the heard note (positive polarity) line up sufficiently, prediction and recognition align, and they cancel each other out electrically. When they do not, the heard note wins the electrical battle. \"We find that imagined predictive responses are routinely co-opted during ongoing music listening,\" when predictions prove inaccurate, write the authors.</p><h2>Why bother?</h2><p>Di Liberto said, \"Your brain responds more strongly to unexpected or unpredictable events.\" He told Big Think that this is literally true on an electrical level: \"The EEG signal has larger magnitude/power when participants hear a less predictable sound.\"</p><p>One might speculate that such little surprises are what make some pieces of music more memorable to us. This would make sense, since astute musicians understand that it is often the little surprises that make a song grab a listener. \"Wrong\" notes, momentary dissonances, and even unexpected noises are all part of a savvy musician's toolbox.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/TdkTzNuopIM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 16:26:10 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2OTM3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NTg4OTkxMH0.5x0C-SfP6THG2KQIdEWcdc3IdVpuWfe0AbgAA0maQiY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"a9eb39c0d7652bfa3a862c8278b5ab06","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-23-041_1680e53fefe99aba.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":294592,"destBytes":294592,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2OTM3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NTg4OTkxMH0.5x0C-SfP6THG2KQIdEWcdc3IdVpuWfe0AbgAA0maQiY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-23-041_1680e53fefe99aba.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2OTM5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MzQ1NzYyNH0.-tkbjk_s-CPrykMLusIWlewukgqLecmt6jIZ0itt4uY/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-965_2e2f187c2026904f.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2OTQwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTM2OTcxMX0.hwJ_3n86_Zv6xpQJYo3QY8IiJEVMpj-4Pawe7BzlE0E/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn17@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-28-102_50f2f68b7cd032a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/TdkTzNuopIM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn42@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-992_51ebb564042e8a20.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588780},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"The power of utopian thinking: it's not just for naïve dreamers","link":"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/thomas-more-power-utopian-thinking","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE1ODI3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTM5MjIyOH0.RC2IbFyiCoAStzOuzM7144bM73xpLKaTw3GCHJ6Ch64/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C63%2C0%2C150&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul><li>Thomas More's <em>Utopia</em> presents an ideal society without money, property, violence, or inequality. It is science fiction, philosophy, and a political thought experiment rolled into one.</li><li>Many commentators today believe More's work is also a satire. His vision has dark and macabre undertones, and the idealism is so exaggerated as to be laughable.</li><li>Utopian thinking comes from many political directions, and this is a good thing — it is the impetus that pushes society forward.</li></ul><hr/><p>What would the perfect society look like to you? Try, if you can, to put aside how things are or what you think \"has to be\" the case, and just imagine your best possible world. What would the people be like? What jobs would people do? Who would get paid the most or live in the best houses? Would there even be money? Would there be any crime? Why not?</p><p>Sometimes a bit of utopian thinking is vitally important, and the very word (if not the idea) goes back to the 16th century intellectual, Thomas More.</p><h2>The land of milk and honey</h2><p>More's <em>Utopia</em> introduces a narrator who meets a traveller from the island of \"Utopia.\" This Utopian tells us about a perfect society, free from any inequality and violence. It is a place with no private property or unequal distribution of goods between the various segments of society. It is a place where jobs are divided fairly among the populace. It is a confederated city-state where violence is abhorred and is the worst of taboos and where \"all men zealously pursue the good of the public.\"</p><p>In Utopia, precious metals have lost their luster. This is done by deliberate negative association — the condemned are made to wear gold coronets or earrings as a shaming ritual. Toilets and tables are made of gold, making them so commonplace that no one would desire them to the point of harming another to attain them. Iron is much the more valued metal because it has a practical and useful role to play. Why would anyone want gaudy stones or overly malleable metals? Wealth is, instead, measured in \"cheerfulness, peace of mind, and freedom from anxiety.\"</p><p>Yet, there is a sinister aspect to this egalitarianism. If someone tries to leave the country, they are first imprisoned. If they try it again, they are turned into slaves. All the streets are identical, and after ten years, everyone has to swap houses by lot. All doors are open, and anyone can come and go as they please. Nothing is yours and nothing is mine.</p><h2>There's No-Place like Utopia</h2><p>Ask two scholars <em>why</em> More wrote Utopia, and you will get two different answers.</p><p>By one interpretation, it is subversive and revolutionary. In a post-Marx world, it is impossible to read <em>Utopia</em> without seeing the parallels to communism. Marx himself did occasionally make reference to More in a historical context but not to the ideas in Utopia. Engels and Marx regarded their work as a kind of socioeconomic science and would hate to have been labelled as \"utopian.\" They viewed such \"utopian socialists\" as selling only \"castles in the air\" that could never help the proletariat. </p><p>While More's <em>Utopia</em> would not be revolutionary in a Marxist sense, it would have been hugely contentious in its day. At the time More was writing — in a world of absolute monarchs, feudal peasants, and religious extremism — the ideas of egalitarianism and religious freedom were dangerously controversial.</p><p>In another interpretation, some see <em>Utopia</em> as being mocking and satirical. It could be that Utopia is <em>so</em> extreme at times as to become an absurdity or a parody. The Utopian world is portrayed as overbearing and invasive, and, in some respects, at odds with human nature. It could be that More was really saying, \"Look at these crazy ideas — they're nonsense!\" </p><p>This interpretation looks more likely when we realize that Utopia literally means \"no-place,\" the traveller's name (Hythloday) means \"nonsense,\" and the capital (Amaurot) means \"City of No Inhabitants.\"</p><h2>Utopian thinking: not just for dreamers</h2><p>But even this interpretation does not quite fit. Utopia is a provocation. It is an open question to us, the reader, about how society <em>should</em> be ordered. It inverts everything we assume and asks how things could be different. (And <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/library-of-babel\" target=\"_self\">everything really could be different</a>.) It is a thought experiment that throws much at the wall, and we are left to see what sticks.</p><p>Today, we live with the idea of utopianism, and we all have our own versions of Utopia. Is it one of science fiction, with humans living in distant galaxies? Is it one of nanotech and advanced AI? Is it one of a return to nature and respect for the environment? Is it communistic or anarchic? Is it the nostalgic golden age of the conservative or the quixotic idealism of a college sophomore? There are as many Utopias as there are people, but <em>what </em>makes someone's Utopia is not the point.</p><p>Utopianism is the bold and brave voice that challenges the status quo. The act of questioning brings about change. Utopianism is what dares to imagine a world that could be better. It is the forward path, lined with cynics and pessimists who ridicule the dreamers.</p><p>Perhaps the best way to view Utopia, and utopian thinking generally, is like a rainbow. The closer we move to it, the further it moves away. Although we will never reach it, its existence impels us to move forward.</p><p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

The journey had been long and hard, ten years in total, with many false starts and wrong turns. From then on, gravity, the universe, the nature of space and time, and their relation to matter and energy would never be the same.</p><h2>Newtonian gravity</h2><p>Until then, the prevalent theory of gravity was devised by Isaac Newton in 1687, just 192 years before Einstein's birth. The theory, incredibly powerful, described gravity in a somewhat mysterious way, positing that any two massive bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. This action-at-a-distance bothered Newton, who did not venture an explanation of the fact that his force was an instantaneous interaction across space. How could the sun attract Earth and you attract your computer without touching? How could this interaction be instantaneous? Still, the theory worked, and that is what mattered.</p><h2>Special and general relativity</h2><p>Until it didn't. By the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, anomalies in the orbit of Mercury could not be explained applying Newton's force. Einstein was convinced that nothing could be instantaneous in the universe. The limited speed was that of light, and correcting for this changed everything. In 1905, he showed that for two observers moving at constant speeds with respect to each other, they would measure distances and times differently. A moving stick was shorter, a moving clock ticked slower. This was his special theory of relativity, special for being confined to motion at constant speeds. The next step, he quickly realized, was to generalize this theory to objects that could accelerate, like pretty much everything. And here came the surprise.</p><p>In what Einstein deemed \"the happiest thought of my life,\" he realized that a freely falling body would not feel its own weight. (That is why you feel \"lighter\" when going down a fast elevator. The downward acceleration changes the net pull from Earth's gravity. If the elevator falls, you just float, albeit with a tragic outcome.) From this vision, Einstein concluded that gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable. The pushing and pulling of accelerated motion could, in principle, be mimicked by placing masses in front of or behind you.</p><p>Now, imagine a cannonball shot from the top of a hill. It will trace a parabolic curve until it hits its target down below. That is gravity accelerating the cannonball downward. Following his vision, Einstein turned things upside-down.</p><p>What if, instead of thinking of the cannonball describing a curved path in an inert flat space, we imagined space itself being curved? The larger the mass concentration, the more it would bend space, corresponding to a larger acceleration due to gravity. Mercury, being the planet closest to the sun, would have its orbit distorted by the curved space around it. When Einstein applied his theory to Mercury, he discovered that the <a href=\"https://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/gr/PrecessionperihelionMercury.htm\" target=\"_blank\">planet's orbital anomaly</a> could be described beautifully.</p><h2>Einstein becomes a star</h2>\n        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d4f36a9e5c5909eb54ef1bc996ab6fb5\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"69b70\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3MjY3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTU2MDQzNn0.nowOMd2C8OKGwxDdwxBAIA8syyM51HoluV1jd6jdox0/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: sakkmesterke / Adobe Stock</small></p>\n        <p>So, Einstein's theory served as a correction to Newton's for objects with large enough masses. Although every massive body distorts space around its vicinity (including you), the effect is tiny. But stars, large agglomerates of mass, and most dramatically, black holes, can bend space in very noticeable ways.<br/></p><p>The most immediate consequence of a bent space is that light, always searching for the shortest path between two points, will follow the spatial curvature: a ray of light will curve along a bent space. So, Einstein predicted that mass would bend space that would bend light itself. Amazing.</p><p>This bending of light was confirmed in 1919 during a solar eclipse, catapulting Einstein to international stardom overnight. Just as a lens, a piece of curved glass, bends light so that people can see better, space will also act as a lens, distorting the paths of light from distant stars and other sources of light visible and invisible to the human eye.</p><p>This effect, known as gravitational lensing, is well-known and already documented in many spectacular images, from the bending of light from distant stars as they pass by the sun to Einstein's prediction of spectacular bright arcs surrounding galaxies. Light beams from a distant source are bent mid-course by a massive object or objects. <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/84/2188/506\" target=\"_blank\">Einstein predicted</a> such <a href=\"https://www.nrao.edu/pr/2000/vla20/background/ering/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">arcs or rings</a> in 1936. This is how, for example, it is possible to estimate how much dark matter there is in a galaxy cluster. Since dark matter only interacts with normal matter (stuff made of atoms like we are) through gravity, it will bend space around it. The amount of bending can then be used to estimate how much invisible dark matter is hiding in the galaxy or galaxy cluster.</p><h2>Einstein continues to amaze us</h2><p>A few weeks back, a <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/black-hole-x-ray\" target=\"_self\">new spectacular effect due to the bending of light</a> was observed by a group led by Dan Wilkins from Stanford University. Not only visible light can be bent by gravity; any kind of electromagnetic radiation will follow the curved path of space around a mass. Of course, nothing could be more dramatic than what happens around a giant black hole; light gets severely bent to the point that we can even see what is behind the black hole itself. Imagine that, seeing what is <em>behind</em> a body.</p><p>In the recent discovery, the swirling matter being sucked into the black hole superheats, separating electrons from atoms. This spinning disk of hot plasma generates powerful magnetic fields that arc around the black hole and split in places. The light seen is in the form of X-rays, appearing as fainter echoes of the more dramatic action in front of the hole.</p><p>Once again, Einstein's happiest thought generated something spectacular and fully in agreement with the predictions from his theory. Although he was not a fan of black holes — or of any object or phenomenon that hinted at the breakdown of the laws of nature, as happens inside a black hole — he certainly would celebrate one more goal scored by his remarkable theory. After 106 years, general relativity continues to amaze us every day.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/Okm865tVqNM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3MjY3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDYyOTg5M30.DKO0ufXgXcVJUiOg7xzFnQM_Wb2Q5P7a9DkAYA18i1w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"ed813ef6e6dbf4ccc717a5269be90bbe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-21-236_b99af85775746e6a.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":74474,"destBytes":74474,"author":"Marcelo Gleiser","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3MjY3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDYyOTg5M30.DKO0ufXgXcVJUiOg7xzFnQM_Wb2Q5P7a9DkAYA18i1w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-21-236_b99af85775746e6a.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3MjY3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTU2MDQzNn0.nowOMd2C8OKGwxDdwxBAIA8syyM51HoluV1jd6jdox0/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn1@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-28-111_69b70c14a328ba12.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/Okm865tVqNM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn53@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-989_fe9b42d1275ea5f6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588787},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"How to trick your brain into saving money","link":"https://bigthink.com/singleton/saving-money","description":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.rebelmouse.com/res/scraper/embed/?jwplayer_video_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fplayers%2F6PeUBsPE-FvQKszTI.js\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br/><ul><li>Thanks to evolution, humans are not great at thinking and planning long term. \"The human brain just has certain tendencies,\" says neuroscientist Alex Korb. \"We're always going to pay more attention to things that are immediate right now.\" Luckily, there are ways to counteract our natural habits.</li><li>Retirement can feel abstract—especially for young people who are just starting in their careers—which makes preparing for it less of a priority.

It's only a vision at this point, but technology companies like Facebook are aiming to make it the setting for many online activities, including work, play, studying and shopping.\n</p><p>\n\tMetaverse is a portmanteau of meta, meaning transcendent, and verse, from universe. Sci-fi novelist Neal Stephenson coined the term in his 1992 novel “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172832/snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson/\" target=\"_blank\">Snow Crash</a>\" to describe the virtual world in which the protagonist, Hiro Protagonist, socializes, shops and vanquishes real-world enemies through his avatar. The concept predates “Snow Crash\" and was popularized as “cyberspace\" in William Gibson's groundbreaking 1984 novel “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538861/neuromancer-by-william-gibson/\" target=\"_blank\">Neuromancer</a>.\"\n</p><p>\n\tThere are three key aspects of the metaverse: presence, interoperability and standardization.\n</p><p>\n\tPresence is the feeling of actually being in a virtual space, with virtual others. <a href=\"https://ispr.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Decades of research</a> has shown that this sense of embodiment improves the quality of online interactions. This sense of presence is achieved through virtual reality technologies such as head-mounted displays.\n</p><p>\n\tInteroperability means being able to seamlessly travel between virtual spaces with the same virtual assets, such as avatars and digital items. <a href=\"https://readyplayer.me/\" target=\"_blank\">ReadyPlayerMe</a> allows people to create an avatar that they can use in hundreds of different virtual worlds, including in Zoom meetings through apps like <a href=\"https://www.animaze.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Animaze</a>.

As with all mass-media technologies – from the printing press to texting – common technological standards are essential for widespread adoption. International organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/metaverse-interop/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Metaverse Interoperability Group</a> define these standards.\n</p><h2>Why the metaverse matters</h2><p>\n\tIf the metaverse does become the successor to the internet, who builds it, and how, is extremely important to the future of the economy and society as a whole.

The 1990s newly introduced trends like beach volleyball and mountain biking, while the 2000s did the same with trampolining, triathlon and BMX.

In 1988, table tennis debuted in Seoul. It being a popular sport in many Asian countries, South Korea has since bagged 18 medals in the competition, including combined gold and silver medals in the men's singles during the inaugural event. The same pattern is apparent for the additions of Judo in 1964 in Tokyo, handball in 1936 in Berlin or boxing in 1904 in St. Louis. All events led to at least one inaugural gold medal.<br/></p><p>More than 30 new additions have stuck since the Olympics of the modern age started in 1896 in Athens. That year, the Olympic staples athletics and gymnastics were on the schedule, while competitions in current Olympic sports fencing, cycling, shooting, swimming, tennis, weightlifting and wrestling also took place. Seven more current-era sports were added four years later in Paris, including rowing and equestrian sports.</p><p><span></span>Several other disciplines did not establish themselves. The most famous discontinued sport might be tug-of-war, which was featured from 1896 until 1920, but it's by no means the only curious one. Lacrosse was played in 1904 and 1908, while athletes competed in polo on and off between 1896 and 1936. The 1908 Olympics in London even included a competition in water motorsports. Other than rugby and golf, which were featured several times in the early 1900s before reappearing in 2016, tennis took the longest hiatus between 1928 and 1984 (13 games), followed by archery from 1924 to 1968 (10 games). The only sports that have featured in all Olympic Summer Games since 1896 are gymnastics, athletics, cycling, fencing and swimming. Rowing and water polo have been continuously featured since their inaugurations in 1900.</p><p>Reprinted with permission of the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum</a>.

Typically the tenth brightest star in the night sky, it is well known for its red color and prominent place in the constellation Orion. Its name, which like many other stars comes to us from Arabic, translates to \"the arm of the giant\" or \"the armpit of the great one,\" which is an excellent description of where it is located in that constellation. </p><p>As a semiregular variable star, it can undergo shifts in its brightness of varying intensity for irregular lengths of time. Scientists were not entirely surprised by an extended dimming of the star between November 2019 and March 2020. However, the magnitude of that dimming, a 35 percent drop, was remarkable — so much so that more than a few people began to speculate that the star was about to explode (or \"go supernova\" in astronomical parlance).</p><p>Astronomers all over the world turned their telescopes toward Betelgeuse in the hope of figuring out what was going on. A few recently published papers provide some explanations.</p><h2>A tale of two studies</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aR5nfB1Dagg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>One recent<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25018-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>paper</u></a>, published in <em>Nature Communications </em>by a team composed mostly of Chinese scientists, argues that the dimming was caused by a large, dark, cooler spot on the star.</p><p>To determine if the star was cooler during its dimming, the team devised a method for measuring titanium oxide and cyanide molecules in the<a href=\"https://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/Stars.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>star's spectra</u></a> — an analysis of the intensity of various wavelengths of light given off by a star that can reveal things like temperature, chemical composition, and mass. Titanium oxide and cyanide are more common in cooler stars, as they tend to disintegrate in hotter ones.</p><p>Their data suggested that Betelgeuse cooled by 170 Kelvin, from 3646 K (6103 F°) to 3476 K (5797 F°) during the dimming period. They suggest that such a dramatic cooling could be caused by a dark spot on the star, a well known phenomenon often caused by large convective cells on the stellar surface.</p><p>Because it is unlikely that the entire star cooled that much, the researchers further suggest that the dark spot itself was fairly large and as much as 340 K cooler than the rest of the star. Some other researchers concur with this <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab9ca6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>proposal</u></a>, but this is not the only potential explanation.</p><p>Another<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03546-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>study</u></a>, published in <em>Nature</em> and conducted by an international team of researchers, suggests that a combination of dust and cooling was at play. They propose that this dust patch was caused, in part, by a cool patch similar to the one discussed in the aforementioned study.</p><p>Observations from shortly before the dimming period began suggest that some mass, perhaps in the form of a gas cloud, was lost from Betelgeuse. The formation of a cool spot could allow the dust in the cloud to condense and clump together, obscuring the star. The star would regain its brightness after the cool spot dissolved and the dust blew away. </p><p>The authors further conclude that the models for cooling and dust do not conflict and that a combination of the two best fits the observations. While differing on a few details, including the overall importance of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/science/betelgeuse-montarges-star-supernova.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>dust</u></a>, the two studies largely agree on how much Betelgeuse cooled and how that cooling impacted our ability to see it. </p><h2>Betelgeuse! Betelgeuse! Betelgeuse!</h2><p>The star, while having long since returned to a more typical brightness, continues to fluctuate in brightness, though nothing on the scale of the previous \"Great Dimming\" event. </p><p>Despite speculation that the star was about to explode, it is not expected to do so for another 100,000 years. However, when it does, it is going to die in spectacular fashion — likely shining brighter than Venus for a short time before collapsing on itself and turning into a neutron star or black hole.</p><p>If you're going to pick a lucky star, maybe don't pick that one. </p><p><br/></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ky4DWUmxEco\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 17:09:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3NDYzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NjQzMTk2OX0.M_XdxqhJcoPm6ffg8Yg8xBNqgBR2HeNbQ2JagAC7QV0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=71%2C0%2C71%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"e77f3be16a5604875bdb00cd114f3bef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn38@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-23-400_4919ce6135fcef04.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":9526,"destBytes":9526,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE3NDYzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NjQzMTk2OX0.M_XdxqhJcoPm6ffg8Yg8xBNqgBR2HeNbQ2JagAC7QV0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=71%2C0%2C71%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn38@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-23-400_4919ce6135fcef04.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ky4DWUmxEco":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn29@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-983_0caec9b4d525e4be.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588780},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"Solved: A 50-year mystery about Jupiter","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/jupiter-heat-aurora","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2NjU4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY5MDM2MjEwNX0.AfMaWF-URzEpKaq49Ygo3PYOeBq1tr6elH6kP_ymmTA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=299%2C0%2C299%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul><li>The source of most of Jupiter's heat has baffled scientists for decades.</li><li>A new study suggests that Jovian auroras provide the energy that heats the upper atmosphere.</li><li>The findings confirm a mechanism long suspected but never proven to be at work. </li></ul><hr/><p>Much like the Earth, Jupiter has had a sort of \"energy crisis\" for the last few decades relating to global temperatures. Compared to how warm the planet should be given how far it is from the sun, Jupiter has a remarkable amount of heat. The cause of this disconnect has troubled scientists for decades, though several possible ideas for the cause have been proposed.</p>\n<p>This month, a solution has finally been found. In a study published in<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03706-w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u><em>Nature</em></u></a>, a team of researchers using data from the Keck II telescope and several satellites has determined that the <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/jupiter-aurora\" target=\"_self\"><u>incredibly powerful Jovian aurora</u></a> is heating the upper atmosphere to extremely high temperatures.</p>\n<h2>Some like it hot</h2><p>According to<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/juno-jupiter-auroral-heating\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>NASA</u></a>, we should expect Jupiter's upper atmosphere to be at a temperature of about -73 C° (-100 F°) given how little sunlight it receives. However, observation after observation points to a blazing average temperature closer to 426 C° (800 F°). </p><p>Existing heat maps of Jupiter's atmospheric temperature were sparse in detail, necessitating more precise information to solve the puzzle of where the heat was coming from. By combining observational data from the Keck II telescope and information on Jupiter's magnetic field from the Hisaki and Juno satellites, the team was able to observe bursts of energy moving from the polar aurora down toward the equatorial regions of Jupiter on two occasions.</p><p>By chance, the nights the instruments observed Jupiter coincided with a considerable solar wind that reached the planet, improving the data. Heat from the electrically charged particles could be tracked with ease as that heat moved outward from the poles in pulses. The data show the heat is widely distributed, centered around the poles, and gradually declining at lower latitudes. </p><h2>Confirming what was long suspected</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEU3ppMIziI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>The strength of Jupiter's electromagnetic field — 20,000 times stronger than Earth's — has been known for some time. The frequency and intensity of its<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/jupiter-aurora\" target=\"_self\"> <u>aurora</u></a>, some of which is fueled by eruptions from the moon Io, has also been established. However, while this was proposed as a possible mechanism for the observed temperatures, traditional models of gas giants presume that Coriolis forces (the effect caused by planetary rotation that causes weather patterns to veer off rather than move in a straight line) would be able to keep auroral energy confined to the poles.</p><p>The study's lead author Dr. James O'Donoghue explained how long this process <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2021-08-space-scientists-reveal-secret-jupiter.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>took</u></a>:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"We first began trying to create a global heat map of Jupiter's uppermost atmosphere at the University of Leicester.

Once you go in, barring the existence of a wormhole to somewhere else, you are not coming back out. (For a scientific but fictional narrative of what it would be like to fall into a black hole, read this <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/13-8/what-happens-falling-black-hole\" target=\"_self\"><u>essay</u></a> by Marcelo Gleiser.)</p>\n<p>But now, a new<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03667-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>study</u></a> investigating the wild effects these objects have on magnetic fields and superheated gases has revealed the seemingly impossible: light from behind a black hole.</p><h2>How to see a black hole</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzhtNQAkItU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>As you might expect from their primary claim to fame, it is difficult to directly observe black holes. The light that would typically be reflected off an object, allowing us to see it, simply falls into the hole.</p><p>However, Einstein told us that gravity works less like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking things toward large bodies and more like a heavy object placed on a rubber sheet. Gravity is the dip in the sheet near the object. Things moving past this dip, be it caused by a star or black hole, can pass by it without necessarily falling into it, though their paths will be altered.</p><p>Similarly, light — which consists of both visible and invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum — emitted by distant objects can be warped or bent slightly by large objects. This makes the object that emitted the light appear to be in a different place to an observer. This phenomenon, known as \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>gravitational lensing</u></a>,\" was used to validate elements of relativity a century ago: light from distant stars was bent when passing by the sun, just as Einstein predicted. </p><p>When astronomers examine black holes, they tend to take advantage of this warping. For instance, they look for distant light that is bent or focused by the black hole or to X-rays emitted from near the black hole (but far enough away not to fall in) to ascertain information about the black hole, such as its location.</p><p>This new study began in much the same way. A team of researchers was examining the coronas that form around black holes as material falls into them. This superheated material turns to plasma (ionized gas) as it falls in, though some of it is tossed about by the black hole's spin and magnetic field. This turmoil continuously produces huge amounts of vibrant X-ray light around the hole, which can be observed to learn more about it. </p><p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KSgh0HNJOnOVv41YfM_r0CPBRYQtilv_OpteOQ3XoAJMBRObqxX17coQe_bebMIgJuBEVRiMgMGDiImcyUzBKlPXQ5BFsC_1TCAD7XPhR6Y1ZSDWYzqwtLk_7LdvNiAunLOHoEXk\"/></p><p><em>ESA</em><br/></p><p>While observing the expected X-Rays, the researchers noticed something odd; smaller, strangely \"colored\" X-ray flashes. The flashes were in line with predictions that X-rays would be bent and reflected behind the black hole before becoming visible again as \"echoes\" of light. </p><p>As Stanford University astrophysicist<a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/wilkinsd\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Dan Wilkins</u></a> and study co-author explains, this was both a surprise and in line with <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/28/first-detection-light-behind-black-hole/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>theory</u></a>:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"Any light that goes into that black hole doesn't come out, so we shouldn't be able to see anything that's behind the black hole. The reason we can see that is because that black hole is warping space, bending light and twisting magnetic fields around itself.\"</p><p>While relativity tells us that we should be able to see X-rays from behind a black hole because of its powerful gravity, this has never actually been seen before now. Study co-author<a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/roger-blandford\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Roger Blandford</u></a> of Stanford explained in a<a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/28/first-detection-light-behind-black-hole/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>press release</u></a> why finding it now is so exciting for those who have long worked on the problem:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"Fifty years ago, when astrophysicists starting [sic] speculating about how the magnetic field might behave close to a black hole, they had no idea that one day we might have the techniques to observe this directly and see Einstein's general theory of relativity in action.\"</p><p>The initial investigations into the coronas of black holes will continue, likely using more powerful X-ray telescopes as they become available.

For example, despite being deemed \"Frankenfoods,\" genetically modified crops are typically changed in simple ways that make them hardier and easier to grow. We are still a long way from approaching the work of Dr. Frankenstein.</p><p>However, we are getting closer all the time. And exactly what we should do in the event that we create an organism with moral standing remains the subject of some debate.</p><p>Because of this, Dr. Julian Koplin of the University of Melbourne Law School and Dr. John Massie of The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne wrote a <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/47/8/567\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>paper</u></a> discussing a lesser known ethical lesson of <em>Frankenstein</em> and how it might be applied to some of our more cutting-edge experiments — <em>before</em> we find ourselves asking what to do with artificially created sentient life.</p><h2>The other moral in Frankenstein</h2><p>The moral of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> that most people are familiar with is, \"Don't play God,\" or some variation of that theme. Most film and television versions of the story follow this route, perhaps most notably in the famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqF28KiD-Hc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>1931 film</u></a> adaptation starring Boris Karloff as the monster.</p><blockquote>This take on the ethical lesson of Frankenstein may be more useful than the broad warning against hubris, as modern science is getting ever closer to creating things with sentience.</blockquote><p>However, Shelly's work covers many themes. One of them is that the real moral failure of Victor Frankenstein was not in creating his creature but in failing to meet or even consider the moral obligations he had to it. Thus, your pedantic friend who notes, \"Frankenstein is the name of the doctor, not the monster,\" is both annoying and correct. Frankenstein never bothered to name his creature after bringing it into the world.</p><p>That's not the only thing Frankenstein failed to give the creature. The authors explain:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"...the 'monster' had at least some degree of moral status — which is to say, he was the kind of being to which we have moral obligations. Frankenstein refused to recognize <em>any</em> duties towards his creation, including even the modest duties we currently extend towards nonhuman research animals; Frankenstein denied his creature a name, shelter, healthcare, citizenship, or relationships with other creatures of its kind. In so doing, Frankenstein wronged his creation.\"</p><p>The Creature, as the monster is sometimes known in the novel, differs greatly from how most films depict him — uncoordinated, stupid, and brutish. He learns to speak several languages, references classic literature, and reveals that he is a vegetarian for ethical reasons. Before he spends his time devising a complex revenge plot against his creator, his primary desire is for companionship. He is also quite sensitive. Even if he is not entitled to the same moral standing as other humans, it seems intuitive that he has some moral standing that is never recognized. </p><p>This take on the ethical lesson of Frankenstein may be more useful than the broad warning against hubris, as modern science is getting ever closer to creating things with sentience. </p><h2>Brain experiments are getting creepy and weird</h2><p>One area of experimentation is the creation of <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.579659/full\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>human brain organoids</u></a> that provide simplified, living 3D models of the brain. These organoids are grown with stem cells over the course of several months and are very similar to certain parts of the cortex. Scientists are doing this in their effort to better understand the brain and its associated diseases. </p><p>While it is unlikely that we have created anything complex enough to achieve consciousness, many researchers maintain that it is theoretically possible for an organoid to become conscious. Some experiments have already produced tissues that are light <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659341/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>sensitive</u></a>, suggesting at least a limited capacity for awareness.</p><p>In a turn toward a more literal reading of Shelley, a team of Yale scientists reanimated <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/zombie-pigs-brainex?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2\" target=\"_self\"><u>pig brains</u></a> and kept some of them alive for 36 hours. While these revived brains neither were attached to pig bodies nor exhibited the electrical signals associated with consciousness, the study does raise the possibility that such a thing could be done. Other experiments seem to be based more on <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau </em>by H.G. Wells, including <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/6/3/480/5420749\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one</u></a> in which monkeys were modified to carry a human gene for brain development. These monkeys had better short-term memory and reaction times than non-modified monkeys.</p><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ezS5vQ1j_E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>The authors do not propose that we stop any particular research but instead consider the problem of moral standing. We should decide now what duties and moral obligations we owe to a sentient creature before the problem is literally looking us in the face.</p><p>While it is true that animal research is tightly regulated, nobody seems to have planned for reanimated pigs or monkeys with human-like intelligence. Though ethics reviews of experiments likely would catch the most egregious experiments before they venture into the realm of Gothic horror, they might miss a few things if we do not engage in some bioethical reflection now.</p><p>The authors suggest that we take two points from Frankenstein to guide us in drawing up new ethical standards: First, we should consider anything we create as existing on a moral plane no matter what the current regulations state. Exactly where a particular creature might fall on the moral spectrum is another question. (For instance, a reanimated pig brain does not have the same moral standing as a human being.) </p><p>Second, they remind us that we must try to avoid holding prejudice toward any moral beings that look or act differently than we do. In the novel, Dr. Frankenstein recoils in horror almost instinctively at what he created with monstrous results (no pun intended). We must be willing to consider atypical beings as potentially worthy of moral standing no matter how strange they may be.</p><p>Finally, they advise that every manipulated organism be treated with respect. This might be the most easily applied — had Victor Frankenstien respected the graves he looted to create his monster, none of the misfortune that followed would have befallen him.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/npW-IJNQzbA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Aug 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDQ3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NjcxNzA5Nn0.Db4NBbbUNQznPOqbJm_JJIQYUkOT2w4lq4Cegpau-m8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C180%2C0%2C532&height=700","linkMd5":"ba0b815e4eeb01f511fc936bcb21a4ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-10-085_5161bfa59ca5c9e4.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":192262,"destBytes":192262,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDQ3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NjcxNzA5Nn0.Db4NBbbUNQznPOqbJm_JJIQYUkOT2w4lq4Cegpau-m8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C180%2C0%2C532&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-10-085_5161bfa59ca5c9e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/npW-IJNQzbA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-28-413_7b54ec1431b0a0b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588787},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"How can we fix America's police?","link":"https://bigthink.com/institute-for-humane-studies/how-reform-america-police","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDUxOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTgzMzg4NX0.AtXZIzoIXU9XVA-6AespAbk5dNzTFwKZQ2nM4c29VnA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=39%2C0%2C39%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ol><li>Replace consolidated police forces with community policing.</li><li>Encourage discretionary non-enforcement of laws.</li><li>Remove bad financial incentives like civil asset forfeiture.</li></ol><hr/><p>After the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, some<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Americans argued</a> the country would be better off without police.

What would a more humane version of policing look like — and what is stopping us from getting it?</p><p>Here are three police reform ideas from scholars who have studied American policing:</p><h2>1. Replace consolidated police forces with community policing</h2><p>In an<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoFkor92dbg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) video</a> on community policing, economists Jayme Lemke and Liya Palagashvili trace the history of today's citywide police forces back to Prohibition. Politicians believed consolidating small neighborhood police departments into citywide forces with unified standards would make cities better equipped to enforce federal prohibition laws.</p><p>But consolidation came with a price, Lemke and Palagashvili say. Previously, under smaller neighborhood departments, police officers were seen as long-term partners with the community with the mutual goal of making the neighborhood safer. This is known as community policing, and it incentivizes officers to act in the best interest of the people in their community, which does not always mean arresting offenders. </p><p>\"You have a kid out after curfew,\" Lemke, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, says. \"Does he get hauled home to mom, or does he get hauled to jail?\"</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WoFkor92dbg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div><p>But consolidated forces have a one-size-fits-all approach to neighborhood safety: enforce laws through citations and arrests. Police success quickly became measured by numbers: the number of people stopped and arrested. \"The culture is, you're not working unless you are writing summonses or arresting people,\" NYPD Officer Adyl Polanco<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/04/04/395061810/despite-laws-and-lawsuits-quota-based-policing-lingers\" target=\"_blank\"> told</a> NPR.<br/></p><p>In the 1970s, Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom pushed back on the consolidation of police forces and other public departments. Her theory of polycentric governance suggested that communities would be better off with multiple decision-making bodies interacting rather than decision-making power being centralized in larger consolidated bodies. She studied police departments — even riding in the back of police cars — and found that communities with smaller neighborhood police departments had a better relationship with police because that is when coproduction — a shared responsibility for achieving safety — takes place.</p><p>\"Many of the officers in very big departments do not see themselves as responsible to citizens,\" Ostrom<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/abs/riding-in-cars-with-boys-elinor-ostroms-adventures-with-the-police/CC1F61D43D67455F26629AC2C431FCEC\" target=\"_blank\"> said</a>. \"They are on duty for specific hours and with an entirely different mentality.\" Ostrom argued that community police forces are more likely to employ officers who are willing to try outside-the-box solutions to solve a neighborhood's unique problems — problems that are rarely fixed through tickets and arrests.</p><h2>2. Encourage discretionary non-enforcement of laws</h2><p>Jake Monaghan, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of New Orleans, spoke about bad policing incentives at a recent IHS symposium, \"<a href=\"https://theihs.org/academic-events/research-workshops-and-symposia/academic-research-seminars/unnecessary-evils-laws-judging-and-policing-in-an-overcriminalized-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unnecessary Evils: Laws, Judging, and Policing in an Overcriminalized World</a>.\" He is currently working on a book about what good policing looks like.</p><p>\"I argue first that one important way to overcome failures in the criminal justice system is to engage in discretionary non-enforcement of certain laws,\" Monaghan writes in his<a href=\"http://jakemonaghan.com/book\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> book abstract</a>. </p><p>Recognizing that discretion is an inevitable element of policing means abandoning any misconception that police should behave like the military. \"Soldiers are typically allowed very little discretion in the course of their work,\" Monaghan<a href=\"http://stockholmcentre.org/police-discretion-and-the-military-analogy/?fbclid=IwAR1SCcW1QwC5FAYaDS8-OGbf66gXfUamme2ikVExQw57DEEdCN3HfG366j4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> writes</a>. \"Policing, especially in the patrol division, is characterized by significant amounts of discretion.\" We should view police officers not as soldiers but \"as genuine professionals who should be exercising discretion by drawing on a body of specialized knowledge.\"</p><p>We can encourage the exercise of legitimate, well-reasoned discretion by specializing the patrol division, Monaghan argues, so that officers responding to calls have the necessary training to decide when <em>not</em> enforcing a law is in the best interest of the community.</p><h2>3. Remove bad financial incentives like civil asset forfeiture</h2><p>Civil asset forfeiture currently allows police departments in most jurisdictions to seize assets from criminal suspects before they are convicted or even arrested. If police claim an asset was involved in a crime, they can confiscate it — then use it to help fund police activities.</p><p>\"Police departments and municipal governments around the country rely on seized assets, whether cash directly or property that can be sold for cash, to help pay for operations and programs that they otherwise could not afford,\" Chris Surprenant, professor of ethics at University of New Orleans, and Jason Brennan, professor of ethics at Georgetown University, write in their book <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Injustice-for-All-How-Financial-Incentives-Corrupted-and-Can-Fix-the-US/Surprenant-Brennan/p/book/9781138338821\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Injustice For All: How Financial Incentives Corrupted and Can Fix the Criminal Justice System</em></a>.</p><p>While a police officer cannot lawfully take cash from a suspected drug dealer and deposit into his own bank account, he can use civil asset forfeiture to accomplish essentially the same thing: the more money a police officer seizes, the more money there will be in the police department budget to pay for raises and nicer amenities, Surprenant and Brennan explain.</p><p>Not only does this incentivize police departments to seize more assets from people, but it also incentivizes them to allow some criminal activities to take place so that they can then seize the profits.</p><p>\"For example,\" Surprenant and Brennan explain, \"when disrupting drug trade activities, any illegal drugs seized by law enforcement agents must be destroyed, but they can retain seized cash believed to be connected to drug activity and use it to fund their own operations. That cash can be kept but drugs must be destroyed has led many police departments to establish checkpoints and otherwise run operations to target individuals after sales have been made, rather than preventing those sales from being made in the first place.\"</p><p>States should reform asset forfeiture laws to prevent police departments from enriching themselves through policing, Surprenant and Brennan say. That will help realign police incentives with the long-term safety and well-being of the community.</p><h2>What success looks like</h2><p>As different states and municipalities experiment with police reforms like the three ideas listed above, how can we measure success? What does good policing look like?</p><p><em>The Atlantic</em>'s Conor Friedersdorf<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/the-9-principles-of-good-policing/378810/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> points</a> to the \"Nine Principles of Policing,\" drafted in 1829 by the London Metropolitan Police Department, as \"the foundations of a civilized law-enforcement agency.\" The fourth principle is: \"To recognize always that the extent to which the cooperation of the public can be secured diminishes proportionately the necessity of the use of physical force and compulsion for achieving police objectives.\"</p><p>This, ultimately, is what we want from good policing: to secure our cooperation as much as possible through peaceful partnership. Successfully doing that means respecting the dignity and diversity of communities, treating individuals humanely, and having no overarching goal other than the peace and safety of the neighborhood. </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/BHKGymbpcSY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Aug 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDUxOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTgzMzg4NX0.AtXZIzoIXU9XVA-6AespAbk5dNzTFwKZQ2nM4c29VnA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=39%2C0%2C39%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"d48094f75cda0642e8ee67292ce65a67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn57@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-25-029_e3b549e6973074ae.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":81926,"destBytes":81926,"author":"Nicole Yeatman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDUxOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTgzMzg4NX0.AtXZIzoIXU9XVA-6AespAbk5dNzTFwKZQ2nM4c29VnA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=39%2C0%2C39%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn57@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-25-029_e3b549e6973074ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/BHKGymbpcSY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-28-145_a35012fba9f0c9d8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588787},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"Brain hacks for saving money","link":"https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/how-to-save-money","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2ODcyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MTQ0MTY3MX0.AnZbNbuNfy03L9X5-ucOoAkK6MwkrEIjrl11FTt4W1o/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C521&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul> <li>A new episode of \"Your Brain on Money\" explores how our brains evolved systems that make it difficult for us to sacrifice for the future.</li><li>One major reason that it's difficult to save is that we tend to view our future selves as strangers with whom we can't easily connect.</li><li>Saving becomes easier when we learn to connect with our future selves and are mindful of our habits and reward systems.</li></ul><hr/><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"bd4b1b318870b3bc37441847a8a0ccbe\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfzDSSiLtBQ?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">How to trick your brain into saving money</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NfzDSSiLtBQ\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n        </small>\n        </p><p>You find $100 on the sidewalk. How would you spend it? Out of all the options — order pizza, buy new shoes, take your significant other out to dinner — socking it away into your retirement account is probably the least exciting. Saving can feel like you're throwing money away or giving it to an invisible stranger.<br/></p><p><span></span>There's also a decent chance you don't yet have a retirement account. A <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/asset-wealth-management/library/retirement-in-america.html\" target=\"_blank\">survey published in March 2021</a> found that a quarter of U.S. adults have no retirement savings, while many people who are saving aren't saving enough. Of course, that's not necessarily a moral failing. About one in ten U.S. families is living in poverty, and the pandemic brought one of the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/u-s-suffers-sharpest-rise-in-poverty-rate-in-more-than-50-years\" target=\"_blank\">sharpest ever rises in the national poverty rate</a>.</p><p><span></span>But even people who can afford to save for the future often don't. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158583/\" target=\"_blank\">2011 study</a> involving salaried employees at seven major companies found that roughly 40 percent of workers failed to invest enough in their 401(k) plans so that their employers would match the contributions, meaning they were foregoing free money.</p><p>It is not necessarily wrong to not save a lot of money for the future. But consider the statistics: The median retirement savings account for Americans aged 55 to 64 is <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/asset-wealth-management/library/retirement-in-america.html\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> to contain about $120,000. If a retiree withdraws money over the next 15 years, that amounts to less than $1,000 per month. That's under the poverty line.</p><p>What about Social Security? Reserves are <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/social-security/what-will-social-security-be-in-2035/\" target=\"_blank\">projected to run out by 2035</a>, at which point beneficiaries will start receiving far less than originally expected. The problems associated with depleted Social Security likely will be compounded by the fact that Americans are generally living longer with each generation.</p><p>So, why don't people save more for their retirement? It's partly because people often don't feel like they are saving for <em>their </em>retirement at all. </p><h2>The disconnect between our present and future selves</h2><p>In 50 seconds from now, will you be the same person? What about in 50 days? 50 years? </p><p>As we project our minds into the future, our conception of ourselves becomes more abstract. Sure, most of us would agree that, in a driver's license sense, we will still be the \"same person\" decades from today. But neurological research suggests that is not actually how our brains process this thought experiment.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/528facb6e4b0a18b7e9cde91/t/5314c1c3e4b05444a30d2b45/1393869251983/How+is+our+self+related+to+midline+regions+and+the+default-mode+network.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">large set of brain imaging studies</a> has shown that thinking about ourselves activates a region of the brain called the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RpQgBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA22&dq=cortical+midline+self&ots=il_ihlUghk&sig=4d68_gag74AYNa5JgEKQVis4lHM#v=onepage&q=cortical%20midline%20self&f=false\" target=\"_blank\">medial prefrontal cortex</a> (MPFC). But when we think about other people, the MPFC quiets down and does so even more when we think about others with whom we have little in common. </p><p>Studies have observed that the MPFC also quiets when we think about our future selves. In other words, we see our future selves as strangers with whom it is difficult to emotionally connect. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3764505/\" target=\"_blank\">2011 report</a> on how conceptions of the future self transform intertemporal choice noted:</p><p rel=\"margin-left: 20px;\" style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"These findings have important implications for intertemporal choice. If people tend to consider the future self as a stranger — that is, if that distant future self feels on an emotional level like another person — then they may rationally have no more reason to save their money for their future selves than to give that money to a stranger.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d81ae1d2fd73d0852427a9e5752a80ef\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"8d1ff\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2ODczMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4OTQ3ODgwNH0.qMfIVZKT0-lz_ZsMal_Kf3-VXoMLX7hVRh1qQQ3vGiE/img.png?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Future self-continuity scale that has been used to assess similarity between current and future selves.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3764505/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hershfield</a>, PudMed Central, 2013</small></p><p>The inability to connect with our future selves can contribute to a phenomenon called temporal discounting, in which we care less about future outcomes than immediate ones. A <a href=\"https://uccs.edu/Documents/ktomlin/Pronin,%20Olivola,%20Kennedy;%202008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2008 study</a> explored temporal discounting by asking students to drink a cup of a disgusting liquid for the good of science. Some students signed up to drink it that day, others to do so months later.<br/></p><p>The group that agreed to drink the liquid that day chose to drink an average of a couple tablespoons. But the months-later group signed themselves up to down a half cup. Just like procrastinating work or racking up a credit card bill, it is psychologically and emotionally easier to dump today's problems on our future selves.</p><h2>The brain in conflict: reward, habit, thinking</h2><p>Like the self, the brain isn't a single entity with a singular goal but rather a collection of interacting systems that often conflict with each other. Three broad systems are particularly relevant in terms of planning for the future: reward, habit, and thinking. </p><p>These systems evolved over time to serve useful functions. For example, our reward system nudges us to focus on things we need, like food and social connections. Our habits help us perform behaviors — some productive, some not so much — on autopilot, rather than having to deliberate each one. And thinking helps us solve complex problems and plan for the future.</p><p>Alex Korb, a neuroscientist, author, and adjunct assistant professor at UCLA, told Big Think that it's useful to conceptualize these different brain regions as being like different types of friends:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Your prefrontal cortex, the thinking part of the brain, is saying, 'Hey let's do it this way because that's going to get us to where we're trying to go.' And then the habit part of the brain says, 'Well, no, let's do it this way because that's the way we've always done it, and that's more comfortable.' And the reward center of the brain says, 'Oh look, there's a cookie!'\" </p><p>When it comes to saving for retirement, it's not a fair fight among these three systems. Our habit and reward systems have the upper hand because they pull us away from long-term planning and toward immediate gratification. After all, it's relatively easy to keep doing things the way we have always done them, and it is hard to resist immediate rewards. </p><p>Interrupting these systems takes willpower. But willpower alone often isn't enough to do the trick. Some psychologists think that is because we have a limited amount of willpower that can run out after we become too stressed. This idea, called <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/have-we-been-thinking-about-willpower-the-wrong-way-for-30-years\" target=\"_blank\">ego depletion</a>, makes sense in terms of saving for retirement, an activity that's not only financially stressful but also makes us contemplate existential issues like mortality, aging, and purpose. </p><p>The depletion of willpower can affect how we perceive rewards. Psychologists Janet Metcalfe and Walter Mischel — Mischel conducted the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford marshmallow experiment</a> on delaying gratification — proposed that we view rewards with two systems: hot and cool. The American Psychological Association <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/personality/willpower\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a>:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The cool system is cognitive in nature. It's essentially a thinking system, incorporating knowledge about sensations, feelings, actions and goals — reminding yourself, for instance, why you shouldn't eat the marshmallow. While the cool system is reflective, the hot system is impulsive and emotional. The hot system is responsible for quick, reflexive responses to certain triggers — such as popping the marshmallow into your mouth without thinking of the long-term implications. If this framework were a cartoon, the cool system would be the angel on your shoulder, and the hot system the devil.\"</p><p>When we choose immediate gratification through the hot system, we not only miss out on long-term rewards but also reinforce our bad habits. So, how can we use the cool system to disrupt our habits and plan for the future?</p><h2>How to trick your brain into saving for retirement</h2><p>Odds are that socking away money into a retirement account is never going to feel as exciting as splurging on a night out. But there are ways to make it easier. </p><p>One is to try to emotionally and psychologically connect with your future self. For example, there are applications where you can upload a photo of yourself and see computer-generated images of what you might look like decades down the road. The exercise seems to help people view their relationships with their future selves as less abstract. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004CFA9WI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2011 experiment</a> explored this concept by having two groups of participants view themselves in virtual reality. One group saw a virtual representation of their current selves, while another was shown an age-progressed virtual version of themselves. Afterward, both groups were asked to allocate hypothetical money toward various things, including a retirement account. The group that came face to face with their older selves saved more money.</p><p>You do not need virtual reality to start saving. One of the easiest ways is to choose an amount of money to save every month — a reasonable amount that won't cause too much stress — and then set up automatic deposits into a retirement account. The set-it-and-forget-it strategy utilizes the cool system while removing the \"hot system\" temptations we face when choosing how to spend a lump sum of money.</p><p>Ultimately, it's not really important how you save, but that you start saving at all. That is partly because compound interest yields higher returns if you start saving early. But it is also because consistently saving money can retrain your brain into thinking saving is important; after all, if you keep procrastinating saving, your brain will learn that it must not be worthwhile.</p><p>\"One of the keys to being sustainably happy is really just understanding yourself better so that you can make choices that are best for you and your circumstances and understanding your brain can be a big part of that,\" Korb told Big Think. \"Saving one dollar a day is infinitely better than saving zero dollars per day. So just take one little step in the next direction.\"</p><div></div><ul></ul><div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/BvcdMrZo_6A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2ODcyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MTQ0MTY3MX0.AnZbNbuNfy03L9X5-ucOoAkK6MwkrEIjrl11FTt4W1o/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C521&height=700","linkMd5":"5820f47a0ac071432855949ac1cbd8f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn13@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-09-132_1ef047361f43d58f.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":36450,"destBytes":36450,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2ODcyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MTQ0MTY3MX0.AnZbNbuNfy03L9X5-ucOoAkK6MwkrEIjrl11FTt4W1o/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C521&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn13@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-09-132_1ef047361f43d58f.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE2ODczMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4OTQ3ODgwNH0.qMfIVZKT0-lz_ZsMal_Kf3-VXoMLX7hVRh1qQQ3vGiE/img.png?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn83@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-28-272_8d1ff3a97ce61ce8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/BvcdMrZo_6A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn40@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-983_1ed8a14ad99d6d4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588787},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"How to reduce gun violence without taking people’s guns","link":"https://bigthink.com/Northwell-Health/how-to-reduce-gun-violence","description":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.rebelmouse.com/res/scraper/embed/?jwplayer_video_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fplayers%2Fe5qH6gFy-FvQKszTI.js\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br/><ul><li>Approximately 41,000 people are killed each year due to gun violence. That's more lives lost to guns than to car accidents. So why do we devote more attention (and money) to car safety than we do gun safety?<br/>As Northwell Health CEO Michael Dowling points out, the deaths are not the whole story.

Medical staff are trained to assess health risk factors.

One way is for courts to seek insight from a hypothetical character: the \"reasonable person.\" Since the 19th century, the reasonable person has served as a standard for how an ordinary adult can be expected to act in situations disputed in civil and criminal courts, ranging from cases involving negligence and crime to free speech and intellectual property. <em>Black's Law Dictionary</em> defines the term as \"an ordinary person who exercises care while avoiding extremes of boldness and carefulness.\" </p><p>It is a murky definition whose application is subjective. In trademark law, determining whether a logo is too similar to another often comes down to Justice Potter Stewart's iconic expression, \"I know it when I see it.\" And more broadly, the reasonable person standard has been criticized as being vulnerable to judges' and jurors' explicit and implicit biases. </p><p>A new paper published on the preprint server <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3876774\" target=\"_blank\">SSRN</a> proposes that brain imaging technologies can bring more objectivity to the reasonable person standard, starting with trademark law. </p><h2>The neuroscience of trademarks</h2><p>Trademark law is uniquely suited for neuroimaging because it centers on questions over visual similarity. That is partly because the brain constructs mental representations of visual information in a relatively clearly defined way; for example, showing people an image of the Nike logo several times almost surely will generate more consistent brain activity than having them repeatedly imagine, say, a hypothetical crime. </p><p>The researchers noted:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"...there is broad consensus on the construct validity and neuroanatomical substrates of different visual processes. Substantial evidence from both lesion and neuroimaging studies indicates that regions within the fusiform and inferotemporal cortices [brain regions associated with face and object recognition] engage in holistic, as opposed to parts-based, representation of objects.\"</p><p>The researchers aimed to construct a reliable index of visual similarity — a scale that uses neural responses to rank how closely a set of products resembles the product in question, called the \"reference product.\" Under fMRI, the participants viewed a rapid presentation of product images: the reference product, four fake products, and four real products with varying degrees of visual similarity.</p><p>To reliably measure visual similarity, the researchers used a technique called fMRI repetition suppression, which exploits the fact that our neural response to a stimulus declines upon repeated exposure.</p><p>\"Critically for our current purposes, substantial evidence indicates that the relative suppression between two distinct stimuli can be used to assess the degree of overlap in neural representations of these stimuli,\" the researchers wrote. \"Thus, by repeatedly presenting the likeness of different products, we can construct an index of visual similarity using neural responses from object sensitive regions of the visual system identified a priori.\"</p><p>To ensure that other factors did not confound the results, the study was designed such that the participants did not know the goal of the study as they underwent fMRI. After the fMRI scan, the participants were asked to rate the visual similarity of the nine products to the reference products. The fMRI results strongly correlated with the subjective ratings. </p><p>The second part of the study was conducted to measure bias within subjective surveys of visual similarity. The researchers asked 870 people to complete an online survey in which they rated the visual similarity of the ten products used in the first experiment. The respondents were shown one of three surveys. One used wording that favored a hypothetical plaintiff, referring to trademark infringing products as \"copycats.\" Another was worded in favor of the defendant. The third was designed neutrally.</p><p>The fMRI data correlated strongly with the responses from the neutral survey, \"suggesting that the neural similarity index is indeed capable of distinguishing between surveys containing different amounts of bias,\" the researchers wrote. </p><h2>Removing bias from the reasonable person standard</h2><p>Still, the study had some limitations in terms of its applicability to the legal system. For one, the approach cannot objectively show that one product is \"too similar\" to another; it can only offer degrees of similarity. Another is generalizability. The researchers noted that they do not claim or anticipate that this method will have useful applications outside of intellectual property law.</p><p>Neuroimaging methods are unlikely to replace other forms of evidence used in courts, namely surveys. More likely, they will provide supplementary evidence. But the approach could be developed into a tool that can detect bias and boost confidence in surveys, a form of legal evidence that's unique for its ability to gauge public opinion on a large scale.</p><p>\"Although of course still highly imperfect and incomplete, even the small step we take here constitutes a productive and meaningful advance, given the ubiquity of, and acknowledged flaws in, the reasonable person test,\" the researchers concluded.</p><div></div><ul></ul><div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/hH8xFLuzTbs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzIxMzM3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4MDMyMzE5OX0.UCNy3EygeClRktKSDSUvCXiIcjPpvRTjTaMuXMOzzMs/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"467f713511462a18140a6266f0b44098","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn54@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-23-259_ddacb67572e3a38d.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":109068,"destBytes":109068,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzIxMzM3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4MDMyMzE5OX0.UCNy3EygeClRktKSDSUvCXiIcjPpvRTjTaMuXMOzzMs/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn54@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-23-259_ddacb67572e3a38d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/hH8xFLuzTbs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-28-347_ec4746fca6b7017a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999588787},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:08","title":"Robots may be more like animals than humans","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/robots-more-like-animals-humans","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0NDc1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDA1NDM0M30.f7WIsxXC0X7EDi-pPQ7_4d9hI4QIqpevG7SVDYkbncY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C182%2C0%2C201&height=700\"/><br/><br/><p><em>This <a href=\"https://www.freethink.com/technology/kate-darling\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> was originally published on our sister site, Freethink.</em></p><p>We're nearly a quarter into the 21st century, and by now, the Terminator-style portrayal of robots taking over the world has become a tired cliche.

Here is our conversation, edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p><strong>Why have robots traditionally been designed to look like humans? What is the thinking behind that?</strong></p><p>We've always been fascinated with recreating ourselves. We had automata back in ancient times that were recreations of human bodies that could move around. Even the earliest artificial intelligence researchers started out with a goal of recreating human intelligence.</p><p>With robots and AI, in particular, they are machines that can sense and think and make autonomous decisions and learn. So we tend to automatically compare them to ourselves as well because of our inherent tendency to compare everything to ourselves. And traditionally, a lot of robots have been human-shaped — even though that's not necessarily the most practical form.</p><p><strong>What are the problems with this human-like design?</strong></p><p>So there's this subconscious comparison of robots to humans that has been enhanced by the design. I think it doesn't make sense. First of all, AI is not like human intelligence — robots don't have the same skills as people. So oftentimes when we expect a robot to behave like a human, it's a very disappointing experience. That's not to say that robots and AI aren't smart, just that they have a very different type of intelligence and skill than people do.</p><blockquote>Our question shouldn't be, 'at what point can we recreate human ability and human skill in a robot?' The question is, 'why would we want to do that in the first place when we can create something different?'<br/><cite><br/>KATE DARLING</cite><br/></blockquote><p>Also, this comparison really limits us. The early AI researchers were trying to recreate a human brain and human intelligence, but that's not where we've ended up. And so our question shouldn't be, \"at what point can we recreate human ability and human skill in a robot?\" The question is, \"why would we want to do that in the first place when we can create something different?\" Robots and AI don't think or behave like us, but they are very useful and very smart.</p><p><strong>Instead, you suggest using animals as a way to think about robots. What are the parallels here?</strong></p><p>There are so many fun parallels. For thousands of years, we've used animals as a supplement to human ability. Not because they do what we do, but because their skill sets are so different from ours.</p><p>We used oxen to plow our fields, we've used horses to let us travel around in new ways. In some ways, a horse-drawn carriage is the original semi-autonomous vehicle. We've used pigeons to carry mail or deliver medicine in ways similar to how we're using drones today. We used them to take aerial photographs. So they were the original hobby photography drone. We've used dolphins in the Navy to detect mines underwater or locate lost underwater equipment, which is a similar function to how we're starting to use underwater robots today.</p><p><strong>But animals have feelings, and robots don't. How does this affect the way we do, or should, treat robots?<br/></strong><br/>Right. So this is something that has always really fascinated me about human-robot interaction. What it actually says about how we treat other entities. Because in many cases we have not treated animals very well in partnering with them. And in fact, in Western society, we're often quite hypocritical about how we think about how we want to treat other beings and how we actually treat them.</p><p>So a lot of us think that we care about whether other beings feel or whether they have intelligence or whether they can suffer, but if you look at the history of animal rights in Western society, it quickly becomes apparent that we have only protected the animals that are cute or that we care about culturally, or that we have some emotional relationship to.</p><p>What's so interesting about human-robot interaction research is it's showing that we treat robots in very similar ways, where we treat some of them that we have no emotional connection to as tools and products, and then others we treat as companions or develop emotional attachments to.</p><p>So it's entirely possible that if we don't stop and think about this, that we may default to caring more about a robot that feels nothing than we might about a slimy slug in our backyard. It's actually a unique moment in time where we could stop and think and maybe nudge our behavior in a way that's more consistent with what we feel our values are.</p><p><strong>It's interesting you say that because I was thinking the opposite — that we might treat animals kindly, but we sometimes treat robots (especially social ones) with detachment. And there can be harmful effects of this. For instance, if we talk \"down\" to an Amazon Alexa, it has implications for the way we might treat women in our lives.</strong></p><p>So I do think there actually is possibly an argument for treating technology with some kindness, as ridiculous as that sounds. Even though the technology can't feel and we're not anywhere close to having sentient robots or robot consciousness.</p><blockquote>We're seeing robots being designed in a very lifelike way, certain robots, and robots that can respond to being kicked, for example, with a simulation of pain. And one question is, even though the robot can't feel, should we let people kick them?<br/><cite><br/>KATE DARLING</cite><br/></blockquote><p>But there's questions around our own behavior. So if you get used to barking commands at Alexa, or your kid gets used to barking commands at Alexa, you could get used to barking commands at women or women named Alexa or other people. Parents have raised enough concern about this that a lot of these home voice assistant companies have released features to turn on a magic word feature so that it makes Alexa only respond if you say \"please\" and \"thank you,\" for example.</p><p>But then you get into all sorts of questions with different designs of robots. Increasingly we're seeing robots being designed in a very lifelike way, certain robots, and robots that can respond to being kicked, for example, with a simulation of pain. And one question is, even though the robot can't feel, should we let people kick them?</p><p>And what if we had a real-life Westworld theme park, where people could go and do anything they want to life-like robots? Is that a healthy outlet for violent behavior or (does it) train people's cruelty muscles? I don't have an answer to the question, but it is a question that is going to be raised very soon.</p><p><strong>Right. So on the flip side, maybe we could go in the other direction and make them seem less lifelike at all and more like just a neutral object that we don't associate with any kind of life?</strong></p><p>We can try. What we're also seeing in the research is that it's really hard to turn off this tendency that we have to treat robots like living things. Even something as simple as the Roomba vacuum cleaner — just because it's moving around on its own, people will name the Roomba. People will feel bad for the Roomba when it gets stuck. So it's a very difficult human tendency to counteract.</p><p>And in fact, a lot of animal researchers and nature researchers have moved away from the idea that we have to get rid of how we project ourselves onto animals and have said, \"Okay, this is something that is there, we just need to be very aware of it, and we can nudge our behavior in certain directions, but we're not going to get rid of the tendency entirely.\"</p><p>And maybe that's a good thing because it means that we can relate to animals in certain ways that might be actually beneficial for humans. So having therapy dogs or having pets as companionship can actually be a very positive thing for people.</p><p>Or military robots, where soldiers are becoming emotionally attached to the bomb disposal units that they work with. Which, at first blush, you would say, \"Okay, that's terrible. We don't want soldiers to be risking their lives or behaving in an inefficient way on a battlefield because they've developed an emotional connection to a robot.\"</p><p>But at the same time, if you look at the history of the role that animals have played in war, yes, soldiers sometimes made bad decisions based on wanting to save their dog or their horse on the battlefield. But the animals brought so much emotional comfort to soldiers in very stressful situations that it's not clear to me that it's necessarily a bad thing, even if we could prevent it.</p><p><strong>Many people fear that robots are going to threaten us in some way, or replace us. How does shifting it to a view of an animal change the way that we look at that issue?</strong></p><p>Particularly in Western society, we have this idea that there's this constant threat of robots rising up against us or coming to replace us. And in part that comes from this comparison of robots to humans — and it's very limiting. It influences a lot of our conversations from what intelligence is, to our conversations about robots and jobs and robots replacing people one-to-one.</p><p>Using the animal analogy helps us step away from this fear of being replaced. And the animals obviously have not done that. Animals have disrupted society. They have created completely different workplaces for people. They have revolutionized farming and transportation and all sorts of things that technology is also going to disrupt — but it's not the same type of fear that we've had with animals, about animals rising up against us.</p><p>Fear with robots is also quite misplaced, given that we're not anywhere close to having artificial superintelligence or any type of science-fictional scenario that gets a lot of attention in the press — it's actually the wrong question to be worried about.</p><p><strong>What's been the driving force behind your research? The question you are most interested in?</strong></p><p>The thing that blows my mind is our tendency to treat robots like they're alive, even if we know perfectly well that they're just machines. Just a few weeks ago I got this baby harp seal robot called a PARO. It's a medical device that's used with dementia patients in a nursing home. And it looks like a very cute baby seal. It doesn't do very much, it just kind of responds to touch. Makes these little movements and little sounds. I was showing it off to the group of roboticists that I work with. They create social robots — they specifically design robots that give off cues like this.</p><p>They were all like, \"Oh, it's so cute. Oh, look, it's doing XYZ!\" So even the people who build the programs are not immune.

After my visit to Landstuhl, I asked former <em>Washington Post </em>Pulitzer Prize-winning military reporter Walter Pincus what we should make of spending $1 billion to replace this world-class medical facility.</p><p>Without missing a beat Pincus said, \"It implies we're going to keep fighting.\"</p><h2>More military bases mean more war</h2><p>Beyond the new hospital in Germany, there are many signs that despite the Afghanistan withdrawal, the U.S. military is going to keep fighting. Above all, dozens of U.S. military bases will remain in nearly every country in the Greater Middle East. These bases have played key roles in launching U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and at least 19 other countries since 2001. An examination of two decades of war and the longer history of U.S. wars since independence suggests that unless U.S. leaders shut down more of this military infrastructure, the country will continue to fight \"endless wars\" far beyond Afghanistan, resulting in more amputees and other wounded and dead arriving in Germany.</p><p>Since World War II, the United States has maintained thousands of bases in foreign lands — a larger collection of foreign bases than any country, people, or empire in world history. Today the military controls around 750 military bases in some 80 countries and colonies outside the 50 states and Washington, DC. The rest of the world's militaries combined likely control <a href=\"http://overseasbases.net/fact-sheet.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fewer than 250</a> foreign bases; China has just five, plus bases in Tibet.</p><div class=\"rm-shortcode amazon-assets-widget\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3feb637c51021f17156a56031fadc307\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0520300874?tag=bigthink00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img class=\"amazon-assets-widget__image widget__image\" data-runner-src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LCNC1WiML._SL500_.jpg\" type=\"lazy-image\"/>\n        <div class=\"amazon-assets-widget__description\">\n            <div class=\"amazon-assets-widget__title\" style=\"display: block;\">The United States of War: A Global History of America's Endless Conflicts, from Columbus to the Islamic State (Volume 48) (California Series in Public Anthropology)</div>\n            <div class=\"amazon-assets-widget__by-amazon\"><!-- <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0520300874?tag=bigthink00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">by now at amazone</a> --></div>\n            <div class=\"amazon-assets-widget__list-price\"><span class=\"grey\">List Price: </span><span class=\"list-price\">$21.49</span></div>\n            <div class=\"amazon-assets-widget__new-price\"><span class=\"grey\">New From: </span><span class=\"new-price\">$15.99</span> <span class=\"grey\">in Stock</span></div>\n            <div class=\"amazon-assets-widget__used-price\"><span class=\"grey\">Used From: </span><span class=\"used-price\">$15.98</span> <span class=\"grey\">in Stock</span></div>\n        </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<p>An unprecedented collection of U.S. bases began to dot the Middle East shortly after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. These bases as well as installations in Germany and other parts of Europe and as far away as Thailand and Japan have enabled permanent war since 2001, and a longer series of wars and invasions since the 1980s. In Qatar and Bahrain, the Air Force and Navy have built large regional headquarters. In Kuwait, the Army has had a major presence since the 1991 Gulf War, totaling around eleven base sites now. There are 13 base sites in Turkey, six in Oman, three in the United Arab Emirates, two in both Jordan and Djibouti, as well as a presence in Egypt. The military maintains acknowledged and secretive installations in both Saudi Arabia and Israel, numbering eleven and eight respectively. In Iraq, the military still operates from around six installations. Four more are in Syria. In Afghanistan, after the official withdrawal, 650 troops will remain between the U.S. embassy and Kabul International Airport; U.S. special forces, military contractors, and the CIA almost certainly will continue to operate in the country.<br/></p><p>Other U.S. bases are nearby in Greece (eight sites), Somalia (five), Cyprus, Tunisia, Georgia, Kosovo, and on the Indian Ocean island Diego Garcia. The Navy has at least one aircraft carrier — a floating base — on an effectively permanent basis in the Persian/Arabian Gulf. Despite this massive infrastructure, the Biden administration recently has explored creating <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/afghanistans-neighbors-wary-as-us-seeks-nearby-staging-area/\" target=\"_blank\">new military facilities</a> in Central Asian countries to enable continued attacks on the Taliban and other militants in Afghanistan.</p><p>Military and other government leaders have long portrayed U.S. bases in the Middle East and other parts of the globe as defensive in nature, as deterrents, as forces of stability and peace. One need only look at the role U.S. bases abroad have played in <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520300873/the-united-states-of-war\" target=\"_blank\">launching</a> the last 20 years of offensive wars to question such claims. The history of U.S. wars since 1776 likewise reveals that when bases are occupying foreign lands, they are not likely to be defensive in nature. Bases abroad are generally offensive in nature. They are designed to threaten, to deploy military force, and to wage offensive wars. <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1906.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> funded by the U.S. Army indicates that since the 1950s, a U.S. military presence abroad has been correlated with U.S. forces initiating military conflicts. In other words, there appears to be a relationship between establishing bases outside the United States and the incidence of wars.</p><h2>Military force: the main tool of U.S. foreign policy</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"4f17e339f58b2054a66261e7a10eeaad\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"c4e87\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE4ODM0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTM4NDU5N30.gg7A5J2aonBcbla16SR_ol2qENUZtaK1Z_mVVx2dZWY/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"> <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/sbhubyl7lWI\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: DON JACKSON-WYATT via Unsplash</small></p><p>U.S. history shows that bases beyond U.S. borders have made war and the deployment of military force too easy and too tempting for politicians, government officials, and other elites with the power to shape government decisions. Bases abroad have provided what is by design an easily deployable form of offensive military power. With this offensive power readily available, elites often have been tempted to advocate for its use to advance their own economic and political interests and the interests of fellow business leaders, politicians, and entrepreneurs.<br/></p><p>As anthropologist <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1543883/\" target=\"_blank\">Catherine Lutz</a> and others have said, bases and troops abroad long have been the main tool in the U.S. foreign policy toolbox. They have been the hammers that have left little room for diplomacy and other foreign policy tools. And when hammers dominate one's toolbox, Lutz says, everything starts looking like a nail. The hammers become all too tempting, especially when mostly male policymakers perceive them, consciously or unconsciously, as visible demonstrations of their masculinity and strength.</p><p>Notably, the historical record shows that U.S. wars often have led U.S. leaders to establish new bases abroad. The establishment of more bases abroad, in turn, has often led to more wars, which has often led to more bases, in a repeating pattern over time. Put another way, bases frequently beget wars, which can beget more bases, which can beget more wars, and so on.</p><p>By this, I do not just mean that the construction of bases abroad has enabled more war. I mean that the construction of bases abroad actually has made aggressive, offensive war <em>more likely.</em> Since the revolution that won independence from Britain, the construction and maintenance of extraterritorial bases has increased the likelihood that these bases would be used to wage wars of aggression. Riffing off the famous line from the baseball movie <em>Field of Dreams,</em> one might say, \"If we build them, wars will come.\" Except the reference is to bases rather than baseball: if we build bases abroad, wars likely will come. To be clear, bases abroad are not the sole cause of U.S. wars. Bases beyond U.S. borders are, however, a particularly<em> </em>important cause, along with forces related to imperialism, capitalism, racism, patriarchy, nationalism, and religious chauvinism.</p><p>Still, the \"if\" in \"If we build them, wars will come\" is an important reminder of the choices involved in both the history and the future of the United States' relationship to war. There was nothing inevitable about past U.S. wars. At times, U.S. leaders have avoided wars, often because of pressure from social movements and other protest. Today, there are choices to be made about the country's future.</p><h2>Does war even achieve our geopolitical objectives?</h2><p>The past 20 years of war have resulted in the deaths of <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2019/direct-war-death-toll-2001-801000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15,000</a> U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands wounded. Two decades of fighting have meant <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/470128-reckoning-with-the-costs-of-war-its-time-to-take-responsibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 to 4 million or more</a> dead, on all sides, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, and Syria, alone. Tens of millions have been injured. At least <a href=\"http://www.costsofwar.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">38 million</a> have been displaced. For U.S. taxpayers, the costs of the war on terror will exceed <a href=\"http://www.costsofwar.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$7 trillion</a>. Imagine what these trillions could have done to protect against pandemics, to provide universal healthcare, to end homelessness and hunger, to rebuild public schools, and to erase college debt. Meanwhile, the war on terror has been a failure on its own terms: responding to al Qaeda's attacks with war has created more organizations, such as the Islamic State, willing to use terror as a political tool.</p><p>Despite the catastrophe of the last 20 years of war, many government officials and other elites appear content to perpetuate the status quo. Many are undeterred by the pattern of moving from one catastrophic war to the next: from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Iraq to Libya to Syria to Yemen to…</p><p>With U.S. troops currently or recently engaged in combat in <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2021/USCounterterrorismOperations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">13 or more</a> countries, interventionist military and civilian officials are already planning for the next major war. A growing number of politicians, pundits, and think-tank analysts are talking openly about the inevitability of a future war with China. Such talk runs the risk of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy and should terrify us all: a war between two nuclear armed powers and the two wealthiest nations on earth could dwarf the horrific death and destruction of the last two decades.</p><h2>Why is the U.S. military everywhere?</h2><p>While a new $1 billion military hospital rises in Germany, we should ask where else we could have built that hospital and how else we could have spent $1 billion. We should ask why there are any U.S. bases in Germany today, 30 years after the end of the Cold War and more than 75 years after the end of World War II. We should ask why U.S. troops are not withdrawing from the entire Middle East rather than Afghanistan alone.</p><p>Beyond asking questions, U.S. citizens and leaders can demand the country give up on offensive foreign bases and our long pattern of war.

After the apparent death of some monks, their bodies remain in a meditating position without decaying for an extraordinary length of time, often as long as two or three weeks. A fascinating account of the phenomenon was written by Daniel Burke for the publication <a href=\"https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/thukdam-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Tricycle</a>.</p><p>\n\tTibetan Buddhists, who view death as a process rather than an event, might assert that the spirit has not yet finished with the physical body. For them, <em>thukdam</em> begins with a \"clear light\" meditation that allows the mind to gradually unspool, eventually dissipating into a state of universal consciousness no longer attached to the body. Only at that time is the body free to die.\n</p><p>\n\tWhether you believe this or not, it is a fascinating phenomenon: the fact remains that their bodies don't decompose like other bodies. (There have been a handful of <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/58170/5-bodies-refused-rot\" target=\"_blank\">other unexplained instances</a> of delayed decomposition elsewhere in the world.)\n</p><p>\n\tThe scientific inquiry into just what is going on with thukdam has attracted the attention and support of the Dalai Lama, the highest monk in Tibetan Buddhism. He has reportedly been looking for scientists to solve the riddle for about 20 years. He is a supporter of science,<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3icfHUg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> writing</a>, \"Buddhism and science are not conflicting perspectives on the world, but rather differing approaches to the same end: seeking the truth.\"\n</p><p>\n\tThe most serious study of the phenomenon so far is being undertaken by The Thukdam Project of the<a href=\"https://centerhealthyminds.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Wisconsin-Madison's Center for Healthy Minds</a>. Neuroscientist Richard Davidson is one of the founders of the center and has published hundreds of articles about<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/videos/jon-kabat-zinn-on-mindfulness\" target=\"_self\"> mindfulness</a>.\n</p><p>\n\tDavidson first encountered thukdam after his Tibetan monk friend Geshe Lhundub Sopa died, officially on August 28, 2014. Davidson last saw him five days later: \"There was absolutely no change. It was really quite remarkable.\"\n</p><h2>The science so far</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"7f87b952ddbaf72a65ecf7fd38c6bbec\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"5b930\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzE0MDc4NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTU4MTUyNX0.BkN3apnldHCTqVdHnbXqUkYJ9C-4QdLE5awrN2sVHfU/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n\t<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit:<a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/207149505/michel?load_type=author&prev_url=detail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> GrafiStart</a> / Adobe Stock</small>\n</p><p>The Thukdam Project published its first annual report this winter. It discussed a<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7876463/\" target=\"_blank\"> recent study</a> in which electroencephalograms failed to detect any brain activity in 13 monks who had practiced thukdam and had been dead for at least 26 hours. Davidson was senior author of the study.<br/></p><p>\n\tWhile some might be inclined to say, well, that's that, Davidson sees the research as just a first step on a longer road. Philosopher<a href=\"https://tricycle.org/podcast/why-im-not-a-buddhist/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Evan Thompson</a>, who is not involved in The Thukdam Project, tells<a href=\"https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/thukdam-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Tricycle</a>, \"If the thinking was that thukdam is something we can measure in the brain, this study suggests that's not the right place to look.\"\n</p><p>\n\tIn any event, the question remains: why are these apparently deceased monks so slow to begin decomposition? While environmental factors can slow or speed up the process a bit, usually decomposition begins about<a href=\"https://www.aftermath.com/content/human-decomposition/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> four minutes</a> after death and becomes quite obvious over the course of the next day or so.\n</p><p>\n\tAs the Dalai Lama said:\n</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n\t\"What science finds to be nonexistent we should all accept as nonexistent, but what science merely does not find is a completely different matter. An example is consciousness itself. Although sentient beings, including humans, have experienced consciousness for centuries, we still do not know what consciousness actually is: its complete nature and how it functions.\"\n</p><h2>Consciousness</h2><p>\n\tAs thukdam researchers continue to seek a signal of post-mortem consciousness of some sort, it's fair to ask what — and where — consciousness is in the first place. It is a question with which<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/consciousness\" target=\"_self\"> Big Think</a> readers are familiar. We write about new theories all the time: consciousness happens on a<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/quantum-consciousness\" target=\"_self\"> quantum level</a>; consciousness<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/the-universe-may-be-conscious-prominent-scientists-state\" target=\"_self\"> is everywhere</a>.\n</p><p>\n\tSo far, though, says Tibetan medical doctor Tawni Tidwell, also a Thukdam Project member, searches beyond the brain for signs of consciousness have gone nowhere. She is encouraged, however, that a number of Tibetan monks have come to the U.S. for medical knowledge that they can take home. When they arrive back in Tibet, she<a href=\"https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/thukdam-project/\" target=\"_blank\"> says</a>, \"It's not the Westerners who are doing the measuring and poking and prodding. It's the monastics who trained at Emory.\"\n</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/UQZY4Da0YO8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"
