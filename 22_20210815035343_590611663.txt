That means more days where conditions are warm, dry, and windy enough to trigger and sustain wildfires.</p><p>The amount of fuel available to burn in those places - dry vegetation - is also likely to increase as rising temperatures cause the air to absorb more moisture and bring about more droughts.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Thomas Pesquet  (@Thom_astro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1425063723887173658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 10, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The IPCC report, released Monday, is the first part of the group&#39;s sixth assessment, which recruits hundreds of experts to analyze years of scientific research on climate change. Those experts determined that global temperatures will almost certainly rise <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-ipcc-report-temperature-rise-20-years-15-degrees-2021-8\">at least 1.5 degrees Celsius</a> above the preindustrial average by 2040.</p><p>That may sound small, but it brings about huge changes across the planet, including further melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. This contributes to sea-level rise, and water expands as it heats up, so it is virtually certain that oceans will continue rising through the end of this century. In the best case scenario, the IPCC authors said, oceans will rise by nearly a foot over the next 80 years.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/still-time-to-address-climate-change-ipcc-scientists-report-2021-8\">there is still time to prevent 2 degrees Celsius of warming</a> and the even more catastrophic changes that would bring, the report said.</p><p>&#34;Over many years, scientists around the world have been sounding this alarm bell,&#34; McArthur said. &#34;This is a warning for the entire global community.

Mask recommendations <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-fully-vaccinated-new-guidelines-wear-masks-indoors-delta-2021-7\">are back</a>.

But while Delta is a very real threat right now, it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;ll experience the same economy that we did a year ago.</p><p>Scary media headlines <a href=\"https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2021/08/04/yes-delta-is-serious-business-but-the-media-need-to-cover-it-with-context-and-nuance\">lacking crucial context</a> are behind much of the understandable angst, but the emerging science shows the vaccines <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7\">largely protect against hospitalization</a>. Not enough Americans are vaccinated to prevent Delta&#39;s spread, but enough people <em>are</em> vaccinated to keep the economy open and maintain a sense of normalcy.</p><p>That&#39;s because the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-economy-mutating-4-ways-jpmorgan-economic-outlook-delta-variant-2021-8\">economy has also mutated</a> alongside the virus, learning how to adapt to a pandemic world. Once Americans understood how the virus spreads, many professions improvised methods to limit physical contact and keep the economy running while preventing another lockdown.</p><p>Given the recent surge in the Delta variant, cities are imposing their own rules, and if you&#39;re not vaccinated, you&#39;ll have limited participation. For example, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-expcted-require-proof-of-vaccination-indoor-dining-gyms-performances-2021-8\">New York City</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-mandates-proof-of-full-vaccination-for-some-indoor-activities-2021-8\">San Francisco</a> will require proof of a vaccine for indoor activities like dining and using the gym. More and more employers are requiring it of their workers as well and, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/you-have-to-be-vaccinated-for-more-more-job-openings-2021-8\">Insider&#39;s Juliana Kaplan reported</a>, it&#39;s even increasingly required in job postings.</p><p>The health risks for the vaccinated aren&#39;t near what they were in 2020, meaning they can still live their lives with a degree of normalcy. What&#39;s emerged is a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-vaccine-mandate-bill-de-blasio-delta-variant-2021-8\">two-track economy</a> marked by a patchwork of highly vaccinated areas and poorly vaccinated regions<em>. </em>This lack of cohesiveness isn&#39;t ideal, but improved from the unvaccinated economy that shut down last year.</p><p>We may still be living in a pandemic, but it&#39;s looking like the economy won&#39;t repeat 2020. </p><h2><strong>Vaccines allow us to live our lives during the pandemic</strong></h2><p>In 2020, Covid was a pandemic for everyone. Now, it&#39;s become &#34;a pandemic of the unvaccinated,&#34; CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-says-covid-19-hospitalizations-are-mostly-unvaccinated-2021-7\">said during a press briefing last month</a>.</p><p>The unvaccinated are most at risk of disease from Covid and are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-unvaccinated-could-lead-to-variant-worse-than-delta-2021-8\">largely driving the Delta surge</a>. While the highly contagious variant has increased the odds of &#34;breakthrough&#34; infections among the vaccinated, these cases affect only <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/\">0.01% to 0.29%</a> of fully vaccinated people in all states reporting data to the CDC through July. </p><p>A full vaccination with an mRNA vaccine is about <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891?query=recirc_mostViewed_railB_article\">88% effective</a> at preventing symptomatic disease caused by Delta, according to an August study published by the New England Journal of Medicine. That means the vaccinated also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7\">remain well protected</a> from serious disease leading to hospitalization and death, likely to have mild or no symptoms. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608811063f0560001881c390?format=jpeg\" alt=\"covid vaccine\" height=\"1356\" width=\"1807\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Even with the Delta surge, vaccines make a big difference in how our economy can operate.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/medical-assistant-floater-charlene-batas-administers-a-one-news-photo/1309200757?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Mario Tama/Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But whereas the vaccinated were unlikely to transmit the Alpha variant to others, Delta is a different story: It&#39;s transmissible among the vaccinated, making it more contagious, per <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-fully-vaccinated-new-guidelines-wear-masks-indoors-delta-2021-7\">the CDC</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1?%253fcollection=\">a recent study</a> found that even though Delta viral loads are about the same for both the unvaccinated and vaccinated, they fall more quickly for the latter. And because the chances of a breakthrough infection are relatively rare, vaccinated people are overall less likely to transmit the virus to others.</p><p>However, the problem is that <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total\">only half of Americans</a> are fully vaccinated (vaccines haven&#39;t yet been approved for kids), and they thus need to bear the burden of protecting the unvaccinated half. </p><p>While a portion of the vaccinated very worried about Delta may personally quarantine again, it&#39;s likely most of America will keep keeping on: the vaccinated who are trying to maintain the summer&#39;s taste of normalcy, albeit with more caution, and those among the unvaccinated who are opposed to restrictions and always acted like everything was normal in the first place will continue to stimulate the economy.</p><h2>Even with the Delta surge, we won&#39;t go into full lockdown again</h2><p>The hybrid economy of the vaxxed and unvaxxed also means it&#39;s unlikely America will go under lockdown again. <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/biden-says-its-unlikely-delta-variant-will-cause-us-lockdown-wont-rule-it-out-1602181\">President Joe Biden said back in June</a> that he didn&#39;t foresee a lockdown under Delta since so many Americans are vaccinated.</p><p>&#34;The existing vaccines are very effective so no, it&#39;s not a lockdown, but some areas will be very hurt,&#34; he said.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/fauci-doesnt-forsee-another-round-lockdowns-says-things-are-going-get-worse-1615042\">echoed a similar sentiment earlier this month</a>, saying that enough people are vaccinated that a lockdown isn&#39;t necessary, although the US would still see a rise in cases because just as many people aren&#39;t vaccinated. &#34;I think we have enough of the percentage of people in the country - not enough to crush the outbreak - but I believe enough to not allow us to get into the situation we were in last winter,&#34; he said.</p><p>It helps, too, that the economy is also better prepared for the latest wave of infections than it was a year ago. It&#39;s become so adaptable that experts widely expect the economic fallout from the Delta variant to be a fraction of early 2020&#39;s historic recession, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-mutating-4-ways-jpmorgan-economic-outlook-delta-variant-2021-8\">Insider&#39;s Ben Winck reported</a>.</p><p>The way the economy is &#34;mutating&#34; has left it less vulnerable and more productive, David Kelly, JPMorgan Funds&#39; chief global strategist, said in a note on Monday. He cited four key shifts that have boosted productivity and would protect the US from another pandemic related recession: the QR menu at restaurants, the continued rise of e-commerce, the video-conferencing boom, and the shift from to cash to cards.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60efa246a8d8c00019b03482?format=jpeg\" alt=\"restaurant dining out\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The economy and its people have  adapted to pandemic life.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The economic forecast from the beginning of the third quarter also looks promising. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/global-economic-recovery-q3-nowcast/?sref=BLKWHazc\">Bloomberg Economics</a> predicts GDP will expand by 1.8% in the third quarter from the past three months. It also anticipates inflation peaking before falling to a more moderate pace during the same time frame. </p><p>Then there&#39;s the fact that the US <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/july-jobs-report-cuts-months-off-economic-recovery-payrolls-outlook-2021-8\">added nearly 1 million jobs</a> in July. And US jobless claims slid to 375,000 last week, suggesting little Delta impact. Spending is also going strong - Target and Walmart are <a href=\"https://www.placer.ai/blog/walmart-and-targets-big-summer/\">headed toward a strong back-to-school season</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.placer.ai/blog/malls-rise-once-again/\">malls have made a comeback</a>.</p><p>Now, if the pandemic has taught us anything, it&#39;s that life is uncertain. Things could change for better or for worse overnight. There are still signs of a threatened economy: BofA predicts a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-covid-economy-consumer-behavior-lockdown-bank-of-america-2021-7\">pullback in spending</a>, and already noted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/1425809525261623304\">decline in spending on airfare</a> over the past week. Some events, like <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-04/new-york-auto-show-cancelled-on-delta-variant-spread-concerns?sref=BLKWHazc\">the New York International Auto Show</a>, have been cancelled. And other countries that have already been experiencing a Delta surge, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-brings-back-covid-19-restrictions-despite-vaccine-success-2021-8\">like Israel</a>, have implemented additional rounds of restrictions.</p><p>But Richard Curtin, chief economist for the University of Michigan&#39;s Surveys of Consumers, said Friday that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/university-michigan-sentiment-delta-fear-lockdown-cases-rising-july-report-2021-8\">Delta may not harm the economy</a> as much as people think. Should economic recovery continue and vaccination rates improve, he said, it&#39;s possible Americans could &#34;shift toward outright optimism.&#34;</p><p>We&#39;ve <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-covid-changes-remote-work-housing-entertainment-fashion-flexible-economy-2021-7\">learned how to be flexible</a>, and so has the US economy. It&#39;s enough to keep us from repeating 2020 all over again as we wait for more people to get vaccinated.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

bike and workout company, claiming it improperly charged a sales tax to its customers.</p><p>Peloton, which costs $39 a month for an &#34;All-Access&#34; membership and $12.99 a month for a &#34;Digitial&#34; membership, unlawfully charged users an additional sales tax between 6.3% and 8.9% in New York, Virginia, and Massachusetts, according to court documents obtained by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/SkillernetalvPelotonInteractiveIncDocketNo121cv06808SDNYAug122021?1628944553\">Bloomberg Law</a>. </p><p>Because all Peloton memberships are digital, plaintiffs Brannon Skillern and Ryan Corken believe that Peloton memberships should not have sales tax and should be tax-exempt as &#34;digital goods,&#34; according to the lawsuit.</p><p>While Peloton no longer charges its customers a sales tax in the three states, Skillern and Corken are seeking unspecified compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages, and reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs.</p><p>Peloton declined to respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment, stating that the company does not comment on active litigation.</p><p>After <a

photos for child sexual abuse material has been &#34;widely misunderstood.&#34;</p><p>&#34;We wish that this had come out a little more clearly for everyone, because we feel very positive and strongly about what we&#39;re doing, and we can see that it&#39;s been widely misunderstood,&#34; Federighi said in a video interview with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Fvideo%2Fseries%2Fjoanna-stern-personal-technology%2Fapples-software-chief-explains-misunderstood-iphone-child-protection-features-exclusive%2F573D76B3-5ACF-4C87-ACE1-E99CECEFA82C\">The Wall Street Journal</a>&#39;s Joanna Stern published on Friday. </p><p>Apple earlier this month announced a feature that would create digital hashes of images as they&#39;re uploaded from iPhones to iCloud accounts. Those hashes would be compared to databases of known child sexual abuse material held by anti-abuse organizations, Apple said.</p><p>&#34;Before an image is stored in iCloud Photos, an on-device matching process is performed for that image against the known CSAM hashes,&#34; the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2F\">summary</a> said.</p><p>Critics of the plan said it was a misstep for a company that&#39;s long made privacy a selling point. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) last Thursday called the hashing-and-matching update a privacy <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-scan-open-letter-child-abuse-plan-5k-signatures-2021-8\">&#34;backdoor,&#34;</a> which could be expanded or exploited. Some Apple employees <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-employees-worry-scan-iphones-child-sex-abuse-images-exploited-2021-8?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">were worried</a> the feature could be exploited by governments, Reuters reported. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6117adbdc040ad0018ce5737?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple SVP Craig Federighi raises his hand as he speaks on stage in front of a black background\" height=\"3648\" width=\"5472\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Federighi on stage in 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jeff Chiu/AP Photo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;I think in no way is this a backdoor,&#34; Federighi said in the Journal interview. &#34;I don&#39;t understand - I really don&#39;t understand that characterization.&#34; </p><p>The CSAM feature was one of two photo-scanning updates the company announced. The other would scan children&#39;s incoming iMessage photos for nudity, alerting parents when children under 12 years old viewed pornographic content. </p><p>&#34;I do believe the sound-bite that got out early was, &#39;Oh my god, Apple is scanning my phone for images.&#39; This is not what is happening,&#34; Federighi told the Journal via video. &#34;This is about images stored in the cloud.&#34; </p><p>Eva Galperin, EFF&#39;s director of cybersecurity, said via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evacide/status/1426235328549965827\">Twitter</a> that the rollout had not been misunderstood by privacy experts. </p><p>&#34;I&#39;d like to take this moment to make it clear to poor Craig that no, I don&#39;t misunderstand Apple&#39;s plans to check photos in iCloud against NCMEC&#39;s database of CSAM,&#34; Galperin said.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s well-meaning but it&#39;s also creating a mechanism that Apple will be forced to use for other things,&#34; she added.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-craig-federighi-photo-scanning-child-abuse-images-2021-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/tvfRIhTjhm8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 14:22:55 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6117adc8c040ad0018ce573b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4b39a00c36e850c0b22f9b0eb097008c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn78@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-33-475_dad7a093e7b7da92.webp","destWidth":3999,"destHeight":2999,"sourceBytes":88760,"destBytes":88760,"author":"kshalvey@insider.com (Kevin Shalvey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/611799703dd01000199db86e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-644_adcc1a01b29e1a3d.webp","https://i.insider.com/6117adbdc040ad0018ce5737?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-486_5776bf3561b49aee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn36@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-461_0f8055a0e506fd3b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-397_a128dfcfe604dc8c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tvfRIhTjhm8:XgFKRzIBsB4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn62@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-31-269_cf572d6f63783c11.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/tvfRIhTjhm8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn26@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-32-697_dc69f2524b999c13.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590224},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"Tears of an Afghan girl facing a grim future under Taliban rule goes viral as UN Secretary-General warns of women's rights being 'ripped away' from them","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-tearful-afghan-girl-facing-grim-future-under-taliban-rule-2021-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6117c899c040ad0018ce57d1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"An Afghan girl cries in a viral video\" height=\"1000\" width=\"1333\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Afghan women and girls fear for their future as large parts of their country falls under Taliban rule.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlinejadMasih/status/1426195246694780930\" target=\"_blank\">Masih Alinejad</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>An emotional video of a tearful Afghan girl has gone viral on Twitter.</li>\n<li>The girl faces an uncertain, and likely grim, future as the Taliban gains control of large parts of Afghanistan.</li>\n<li>UN Secretary-General has warned that the &#34;hard-won rights&#34;

Florida, meanwhile, recorded 40 pediatric hospitalizations per day over the same period. The national average was just five daily pediatric hospitalizations per state during that time.</p><p>Several Florida and Texas counties are pushing back on their state&#39;s anti-mask policies, though. In Texas, officials in Dallas and Bexar counties recently won court orders challenging Abbott&#39;s school mask ban. And some Florida counties, including Palm Beach, continue to require face coverings inside school buildings and on school transportation, contrary to DeSantis&#39; rule.</p><p>As of Wednesday afternoon, however, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/over-400-florida-students-quarantine-covid-2021-8\">nearly 500 students in Palm Beach were quarantined</a> after being exposed to COVID-19 just two days into the school year. Up to 6,400 Palm Beach students didn&#39;t wear masks during the first few days of class, despite the mandate, the <a href=\"https://cbs12.com/news/local/hundreds-of-palm-beach-county-students-quarantined-in-2-days-superintendent-says\">local CBS12 station reported</a>.</p><p>Some Texas schools have found it similarly difficult to enforce mask requirements.</p><p>&#34;You can&#39;t ask people to wear a mask.

Jenkins assigned a number from 0 to 100 to a food as a measurement of how quickly the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-nutrition-expert-suggests-a-high-fat-high-carb-breakfast-2019-8\">body breaks down carbohydrates.</a></p><p>Consumers have since been told that too much high-glycemic foods - like processed foods, candy, and sodas - <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-lifestyle-diet-save-money-personal-finances-insurance-planning-2021-8\">can make them fat,</a> leading them to swap the white bread for brown and Frosted Flakes for oatmeal. These foods have been dubbed &#34;fast carbs&#34; or &#34;simple carbs&#34; for how quickly they raise blood sugar levels, which can promote fat storage and increase the risk of diabetes and obesity.</p><p>After analyzing data on nearly 2 million adults from 43 cohort studies, scientists <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/advances/advance-article/doi/10.1093/advances/nmab093/6342518?searchresult=1\">concluded</a> that there were no consistent differences in body-mass index, or BMI, between adults who consumed more fast carbs and those who had lower GI diets.</p><p>70% of the 27 cohort studies that compared the differences between low-GI and high-GI diets for weight loss either showed that they had similar BMIs, or that BMI was actually lower in the groups with the highest GI, according to the study.</p><p>&#34;Contrary to popular belief, those who consume a diet of high-GI foods are no more likely to be obese or gain weight than those who consume a diet of low-GI foods. Furthermore, they are no less likely to lose weight,&#34; Glenn Gaesser, one of the study&#39;s co-authors and professor of exercise science at Arizona State University, said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/neanderthals-human-ancestors-low-carb-paleo-diet-study-2021-5\">Other qualities of carbs</a>, like nutrient density, dietary fiber, and amount of added sugar, are more important than its glycemic index, the researchers contended.</p><p>&#34;The key takeaway is that carbohydrates, regardless of type, can be part of a healthy diet and have a place on a healthy plate,&#34; co-author Julie Miller Jones, a professor at St. Catherine University, said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/study-fast-carbs-weight-gain-health-glycemic-index-nutrition-bmi-2021-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/HOacdlvNs0A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 19:06:12 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/601adb4dee136f00183aa144?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5573998bcb76ad11ce5098ac6a9d30d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-10-389_120a19fafa2f8bd3.webp","destWidth":1885,"destHeight":1414,"sourceBytes":55930,"destBytes":55930,"author":"insider@insider.com (Yoonji Han)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/601adb4dee136f00183aa144?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-10-389_120a19fafa2f8bd3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn40@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-30-142_73873fe07208b20c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn31@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-30-789_b15f97d557a7e492.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HOacdlvNs0A:rWkiowSpMmE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-30-075_12b8e6c83f6c18bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/HOacdlvNs0A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn60@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-28-837_f8b4444145327482.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590239},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"Google infringed on five patents, a judge says, marking a legal win for Sonos","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-infringed-on-five-sonos-patents-according-to-trade-judge-2021-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6117f02b3dd01000199dbb9a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google Home on a table next to a Google phone\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Products like Google Home and Pixel smartphones could be banned from import if the preliminary ruling is upheld.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Eric Risberg/Associated Press</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><strong>Google infringed on five patents owned by Sonos, according to a preliminary ruling by a trade judge.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Sonos first sued the Big Tech giant in January 2020.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If the ruling is upheld, some of Google&#39;s products could be banned from import.</strong></li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Sonos scored a win in a patent battle with Google on Friday, when a US trade judge said that Google infringed on five of Sonos&#39;

She said parents have been \"hysterical\" trying to decide if it's safe for their kids to be in school.</p>\n<p>\"You have panicked parents, people who feel, 'what are my choices: either sending my child into a potentially threatening, dangerous environment where they could get very sick or bring home sickness, or not send them to school?'\" she said.</p>\n<p>In July the school wasn't considering a mask mandate, Vaughn said, but in the past few weeks the more transmissible Delta variant, which is causing a huge <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/schools-reopening-covid-cases-rising-quarantine-2021-8\">spike in infections among children</a>, changed everything.</p>\n<p>She said the pressure from parents to mandate masks made it obvious it would be the right thing to do, \"but before we really had a chance to pivot, the governor came down pretty hard and early with his threats.\"</p>\n<p>Some parents in the district oppose masks, resulting in heated school board meetings where members are called \"Nazis\" and \"fascists\" and accused of child abuse for recommending masks, Vaughn said.</p>\n<p>But she added the board receives twice as many emails from pro-mask parents who are afraid to come to the meetings and be in tight indoor spaces with anti-maskers who are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/father-threatened-by-anti-maskers-at-school-board-meeting-still-scared\">sometimes aggressive</a>.</p>\n<p>Vaughn said DeSantis is not only ignoring the concerns of parents and healthcare providers in her community but also making it impossible for officials like her to govern at the local level.</p>\n<p>\"We should have the ability to make decisions for the people who elected us,\" she said, adding that his ban represents an overreach of state government, preventing local communities from making the best decisions for themselves. She said it's the same thing DeSantis lashes out at the federal government for doing to states.</p>\n<p>DeSantis has fought especially hard for Florida to make its own decisions during the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/04/08/florida-desantis-cdc-cruise-lawsuit/\">suing the Biden administration and the CDC</a> over cruise ship restrictions.</p>\n<p>Insider has reached out to DeSantis's office for comment.</p>\n<p>Vaughn said the disconnect between what the state is doing and what her local community wants is unbearable, prompting some parents to ask: \"How is this even happening?\"</p>\n<p>She shares their desperation: \"I don't know how we got to a place where it's okay to gamble with our children's health and safety,\" Vaughn said.</p>\n<p>Parents in her district have begged the board to fight against the state, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-school-officials-battle-governor-ron-desantis-over-mask-mandates-2021-8\">as other districts have done</a>, but the superintendent has said the district <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WFLAJustin/status/1423725626104627203?s=20\">cannot risk losing even a cent of state funding</a>. For now, the district is trying its best to mitigate COVID-19 transmission without defying the governor.</p>\n<p>However, if the first week back was any indication, it's going to be an uphill battle: After just four days, nearly <a href=\"https://www.smore.com/h5pc6\">4,500 students were under isolation or quarantine orders</a> after a positive test or exposure, and nearly 500 people - students and teachers - reported they had <a href=\"https://www.hillsboroughschools.org/coviddashboard\">tested positive for COVID-19</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

Taken together, it seems virus fears and the return of some mask-wearing rules led Americans to pull back on reopening.<h2>Unemployment filings are flatlining</h2><p>While just a fraction of the highs seen earlier in the crisis, weekly filings for unemployment benefits have hovered around 370,000 after sliding through most of the year. The latest reading <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/weekly-jobless-claims-375000-labor-market-recovery-unemployment-benefits-hiring-2021-8\">came in at 375,000</a>, matching forecasts but still above the pandemic-era low.</p><p>To be sure, continuing claims, which track Americans receiving benefits, staged a more promising recovery through the end of July. Yet both weekly and continuing claims are roughly double their pre-pandemic levels, and recent reports hint at a plodding recovery as Delta cases climb.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"Initial unemployment claims\" aria-label=\"Interactive area chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-fKAO5\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fKAO5/58/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"450\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){&#34;use strict&#34;;window.addEventListener(&#34;message&#34;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&#34;datawrapper-height&#34;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&#34;iframe&#34;);for(var a in e.data[&#34;datawrapper-height&#34;])for(var r=0;r&#60;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&#34;datawrapper-height&#34;][a]+&#34;px&#34;}}}))}();</script></div><h2>Americans are bracing for the worst</h2><p>Consumer sentiment <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/university-michigan-sentiment-delta-fear-lockdown-cases-rising-july-report-2021-8\">plummeted to 70.2</a> in early August from 81.2, according to the University of Michigan&#39;s Surveys of Consumers. That&#39;s the lowest reading since 2011 and the largest one-month drop since confidence evaporated at the start of the pandemic. The only steeper drops came when virus lockdowns began in April 2020 and at the worst period of the Great Recession in December 2008. </p><p>The souring of economic hopes was broad-based. Americans cited increased concerns around inflation, unemployment, and their personal finances. Losses were spread across age, income, educational, and geographical lines, according to the university. And measures of current and future conditions also tanked, suggesting people were prepared for the Delta variant to pose a lingering threat.</p><p>The sentiment metric can stage a quick recovery and even shift toward optimism if the country can get a handle on the virus&#39;s spread, Richard Curtin, chief economist at the Surveys of Consumers, said in the report. Still, with spending on the decline, Americans still leaning on unemployment, and recovery hopes worsening, it seems the country is getting ready for a steeper climb ahead.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economic-recovery-hit-peak-delta-variant-cases-economic-data-2021-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/d-UvWmkSG5s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 11:10:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6116c0b4c040ad0018ce4565?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e9d9727931e764545f583c3ebda2a91c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-851_dbdd12299cb33174.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":142022,"destBytes":142022,"author":"bwinck@businessinsider.com (Ben Winck,Andy Kiersz)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6116c0a73dd01000199da79a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn16@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-29-267_cd65d3c169f34566.webp","https://i.insider.com/6116c897c040ad0018ce4875?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-31-937_3b3b7e4c5499d86a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn46@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-31-713_4df3b4b59afb34bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-30-355_1779bd58416a3e9b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d-UvWmkSG5s:Ds2z6TR1LkU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn78@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-32-986_270c25b1eacc3c45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/d-UvWmkSG5s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-29-945_b6f457426b8a040f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590246},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"A fragment of a mysterious 8th continent is hiding under New Zealand - and it's twice as old as scientists thought","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/hidden-continent-zealandia-under-new-zealand-age-map-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ef25d52f34d05343f6fe848?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Zealandia_topography\" height=\"1617\" width=\"1391\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A map of New Zealandia, outlined in gray.\n<p class=\"copyright\">World Data Center for Geophysics &#38;

A team of geologists <a href=\"https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm\">declared it one</a> in 2017, but not all researchers are convinced. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s not like a mountain, country, or planet. There is no formal body to approve a continent,&#34;  Nick Mortimer, a geologist from New Zealand&#39;s GNS Science who led 2017 group, told Insider.</p><p>While the definition of a continent is contentious, Mortimer&#39;s group suggested that a continent should have clearly defined boundaries, occupy an area greater than 386,000 square miles (1 million square kilometers), be elevated above the surrounding ocean crust, and have a continental crust thicker than that oceanic crust.</p><p>Zealandia meets all those stipulations.</p><p>&#34;If you were to drain the oceans, Zealandia would stand out as a well-defined, high-standing plateau above the ocean floor,&#34; Mortimer said.</p><p>He considers it &#34;the thinnest, most submerged and smallest continent.&#34;</p><p>The problem, however, was that until recently, the oldest crust and rock ever sampled from Zealandia was just 500 million years old, whereas all the other continents contain crust that is 1 billion years old or more. <a href=\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/49/8/1009/598229/A-hidden-Rodinian-lithospheric-keel-beneath\">But a recent study</a> found that part of the submerged continent is twice as old as geologists previously thought, which could boost Mortimer&#39;s argument.</p><p>&#34;This new study ticks that final continental box,&#34; Rose Turnbull, a New Zealand geologist who co-authored the study, said <a href=\"https://www.gns.cri.nz/Home/News-and-Events/Media-Releases-and-News/Continent-of-Zealandia-older-than-previously-thought-study-finds-18-05-2021\">in a press release</a>. &#34;There is no longer any doubt that we live on top of a continent.&#34;</p><h2>How to date a continent</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60d5df13df1db80018f3a2e7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A view of Fiordland National Park\" height=\"2680\" width=\"4020\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A view of Fiordland National Park on New Zealand&#39;s South Island.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Aaron Choi/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Zealandia, a term geophysicist Bruce Luyendyk coined in 1995, is made up of New Zealand and a collection of submerged chunks of crust that broke off an ancient supercontinent called Gondwana <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=300018&org=NSF&from=newsrom=news\">about 85 million years ago</a>.</p><p>About 94% of it is underwater - Zealandia sunk under the waves about 30 million to 50 million years after it broke off Gondwana. So it&#39;s a challenging land mass to study. </p><p>The geologists behind the recent research looked at 169 chunks of Zealandia granite, which were found under New Zealand&#39;s South and Stewart Islands. Granite forms when magma crystallizes deep within the Earth&#39;s crust.</p><p>By extracting microscopic crystals from the granite, the team was able to determine both the age of the crystals themselves and of the crust in which they formed. The results showed that crust was once part of another supercontinent known as Rodinia, which formed between 1.3 billion and 900 million years ago.</p><p>In other words, Zealandia&#39;s geologic history starts far earlier than 500 million years ago.</p><h2>Mapping Zealandia in unprecedented detail</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ef25c982618b92d4620cc97?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Bathymetric\" height=\"865\" width=\"716\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A bathymetric map of New Zealandia, which shows the shape of the continent under the water.\n<p class=\"copyright\">GNS Science</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Part of <a href=\"https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/celebrating-marsden-research/photo-gallery/zircons-in-zealandia/\">Turnbull&#39;s mission</a> is to create a 4D map of Zealandia&#39;s western coast - to visualize what that boundary looks like in three dimensions and how it has changed over time. </p><p>Last year, Mortimer helped map the shape and depth of the ocean floor surrounding Zealandia - what&#39;s known as a bathymetric map.</p><p>The map, part of a global initiative to survey the planet&#39;s entire ocean floor by 2030, also revealed Zealandia&#39;s size and coastlines in unprecedented detail. In addition, Mortimer&#39;s team created a tectonic map showing the locations of the continental and oceanic crusts that make up the submerged land mass.</p><p>These new, detailed maps, paired with the discovery that parts of Zealandia are older than geologists realized, offer further evidence that it should be considered the eighth continent, according to Mortimer.</p><p>&#34;We hope that Zealandia will eventually make its way onto general world maps, be taught in schools, and become as familiar a name as Antarctica,&#34; he said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

While the median home price for active listings in the US stayed the same between June and July this year - $385,000 - the median listing price increased at a slower rate in July than in the month prior, according to Realtor.com.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-suburbs-america-affordable-home-prices-low-crime-good-schools-2021-8\" data-e2e-name=\"inline-read-more-link\">The 7 best suburbs worth moving to right now, where people earn more money and homes are cheaper</a></em></p><p>Overall, this means a rosier outlook for homebuyers, according to Sabrina Speianu, a senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com and the report&#39;s author. </p><p>&#34;For homebuyers, this means that there may be more affordable inventory available depending on their metro-area,&#34; she wrote. &#34;For home sellers, this means that while their home values are still growing, they may need to consider pricing more competitively than they have in the past.&#34; </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a58270e25d05001880c945?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Home for sale open house\" height=\"1660\" width=\"2213\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Xinhua/Wang Ying via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Less competition and dropping prices</h2><p>When people <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/realtors-working-nonstop-amid-surging-buyer-demand-2021-5\">began snapping up homes in 2020</a> due to a pandemic-induced desire for more space and low interest rates, it led to soaring prices and aggressive bidding wares that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/homebuyers-need-lots-of-cash-to-buy-realtors-say-2021-6\">boxed many buyers out of the market</a>.

dropping their prices, with the share of listings that had price drops in July rising to 4.7%, the highest percentage since 2019, according to Redfin. </p><p>Fewer people are also <a

3, that&#39;s a smaller spike than the 39% jump during the same period in 2020, Redfin reported, citing data from home tour technology company <a

data-stringify-type=\"bold\">.</strong></a></li>\n</ul><p>For how steep the run-up was, lumber&#39;s plunge has been even more disorienting.</p><p>Starting its ascent in late October 2020, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/lumber-price\">lumber</a> climbed to a peak of $1,711 over the course of seven months. But it took just 14 weeks to see all those gains erased.</p><p>The last 14 weeks have seen lumber swiftly give back its gains, with the latest prices - near $500 per thousand board foot - down 70% from its all-time high in May. Now, some analysts are calling a bottom while projecting flatter prices in the months ahead.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re going to see a stabilization,&#34; Mace McCain, CIO at Frost Investment Advisors, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/lumber-outlook-price-futures-bottom-upside-rangebound-homebuying-demand-15-2021-8\">told Insider previously</a>. &#34;We&#39;re out of the panic buying. We&#39;re out of the massive industry shortages. We&#39;re out of the extremes.&#34;</p><p>McCain said that the housing market has been behind much of the movement in lumber. As a homebuilding boom swept the US, construction firms scrambled to get their hands on lumber, sometimes buying more than was necessary for fear of running out.</p><p>But now, higher prices have cured high prices in other areas. Expensive houses have dissuaded house-buying, putting downward pressure on lumber. </p><p>On the production side, a recent survey of lumber brokers and manufacturers, who once hoarded the commodity, found that <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/lumber-market-trends-price-today-dealers-excess-inventory-supply-conditions-2021-08\">49% are now facing excess inventory</a> - another downward signal. No surveyed lumber producers reported &#34;very tight&#34; inventory in July. </p><p>Ed Egilinsky, managing director and head of alternative assets at Direxion, previously <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/lumber-price-outlook-futures-bottom-stabilize-housing-shortage-delta-variant-2021-8\">told Insider</a> that he expects $500 to be lumber&#39;s price floor and that it could even experience a rebound into the $600 region in the next 24 months. </p><p>To be sure, bouncing back to $1,700 is probably not on the cards, but Egilinsky said the combination of sawmill labor shortages, wildfires, and possible Delta variant shutdowns could crimp supply and give lumber a modest boost.</p><p>Other analysts are shooting a bit below $500. The commodities team at BMO Capital Markets looked at the share prices of three Canadian sawmill firms to derive a market-expected lumber price of $447 in 2022. Their result was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lumber-prices-are-falling-fast-turning-hoarders-into-sellers-11623749401\">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>Yet even if lumber prices normalize a touch above or below $500, that is still a ways away from the old, pre-pandemic normal. By contrast, the average weekly lumber price in 2019 was $372. Between 2011 and 2019 - after the financial crisis housing bust had largely passed - the average was just $337.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reopening-stock-picks-to-buy-covid-delta-variant-goldman-sachs-2021-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldman Sachs names 31 stocks to buy as the economy reopens despite the looming threat of the COVID-19 Delta variant</a></em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/lumber-price-today-now-commodity-sawmill-housing-market-homebuilding-delta-2021-08'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lguQurnMN2s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 12:44:51 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6116ca46c040ad0018ce4900?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f74cbe80e040b14f81fb649a90c00e78","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn1@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-33-485_7327ff88615c710c.webp","destWidth":1765,"destHeight":1324,"sourceBytes":231584,"destBytes":231584,"author":"ewu@insider.com (Ethan Wu)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6116ca4c3dd01000199dab63?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn1@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-32-173_487ad4c352386703.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn74@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-31-684_03536b8703f349a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn18@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-456_cb2fdfe91047cbb9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lguQurnMN2s:QXu_lfMPmK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-30-534_468db1c3ca40f723.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lguQurnMN2s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-29-323_580c241036c2821e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590229},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"Olivia Rodrigo's 'Driver's License' sits atop Spotify's Billions Club.

In fact, he had no plans to enter the cryptocurrency space until he discovered an altruistic movement that would change his life forever.</p><p>It all began when Bankman-Fried went to MIT - a decision decided by a flip of a coin, with Cal Tech as the other option - where he met his friends in a group house known as Epsilon Theta. </p><p>Bankman-Fried enjoyed his time at ET, pulling all-nighter game sessions that involved time pressure, something the then-freshman student enjoyed and excelled in, according to friends who spoke with <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a>. For games without the same constraint, such as chess, Bankman-Fried would insist on playing with a timer, they said.</p><p>&#34;Think of a fraternity but replace all the alcohol with the nerdiest stuff you can imagine,&#34; Adam Yedidia, who met Bankman-Fried at ET, told <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a>. </p><p>Bankman-Fried majored in physics in college, with a minor in math. But he generally found college life boring.</p><p>&#34;Nothing I learned in college ended up being useful ... other than, like, social development,&#34; Bankman-Fried told <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a>. &#34;On the academic side, though, it&#39;s all f***ing useless.&#34;</p><p>Things started to change when he was a sophomore. That year, Bankman-Fried stumbled upon &#34;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruism</a>,&#34; a movement founded by two Oxford philosophy professors, which aims to use &#34;evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible,&#34; according to its website.</p><p>This includes, for instance, choosing an organization to direct one&#39;s effort using empirical analysis and research.</p><p>New to the concept, Bankman-Fried had lunch with one of the founders, <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/people/will-macaskill/]\">Will MacAskill</a>, to learn more.</p><p>&#34;That was sort of the point at which I started to think in a more principled way about what I should do with my life,&#34; Bankman-Fried told <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a>. Until then, he was leaning towards becoming an academic, but had doubts about the size of the impact he could make as a professor.</p><p>He then considered &#34;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/earning-to-give\">earning to give</a>,&#34; according to <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a>. This approach encourages &#34;the pursuit of a lucrative career with the purpose of donating a significant portion of the earnings to cost-effective organizations,&#34; the movement&#39;s website said.</p><p>Come his junior year, Bankman-Fried was torn between working two options, <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a> reported: working for the Center for Effective Altruism itself or at finding a job at Wall Street to pursue the earning-to-give route.</p><p>The young Bankman-Fried said he felt a gentle nudge towards the latter, <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html\">Yahoo Finance</a> said.</p><p>That summer, he interned at Jane Street Capital, a quantitative firm on Wall Street.

In early 2020, <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/02/20/covid-19-garlic-coronavirus-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the price of garlic rose again</a>. These were among the early signs of COVID-19.</p><p>Often, we see the signs of a new outbreak before we see people getting sick. These early warnings can be invaluable if we learn to pay attention to and act on them. But they&#39;re not enough - we need to incorporate them as part of a larger system that synthesizes information from many different sources to enable us to spot new diseases faster and curb their spread sooner.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-resilient-global-food-system-after-covid-2021-3\">COVID-19 exposed many weaknesses in food supply chains. Here&#39;s how we can build a more resilient system for future generations.</a></em></p><p>We need, in short, an immune system for the planet - a network of tools that search for signs of new infections, directly detect and analyze new pathogens right when they appear, and identify, develop and, ideally, deploy effective therapies (and perhaps vaccines).</p><p>The &#34;immune system&#34; would continue to rely on existing tools, such as monitoring demand and prices for medicinal therapies as well as satellite images of traffic patterns, and step up <a href=\"https://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our efforts to monitor public sewers</a>, as <a href=\"https://undark.org/2021/04/21/covid-19-data-down-the-drain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pathogens often first appear in wastewater</a>. But it would also incorporate additional strategies that enable us to intervene much earlier in the life of a new pathogen. These tools would look for novel pathogens in the air, water, or soil, sequence their DNA or RNA, then use high-performance computers to analyze the molecules and search through an index of known therapies that might be able to neutralize the pathogen.</p><p>These early warning and detection tools could consist of biosensors that can detect pathogens embedded into organisms such as animals and plants living in tropical regions rich in biodiversity, where new infectious diseases often originate. Transmissions from these sensors would link to a supercomputing network that characterizes new pathogens. Not all detected microbes are harmful, so the system would have to develop computational models based on known pathogens to predict whether or not newly discovered microbes could cause problems for humans.</p><p>Once a harmful pathogen was discovered, the supercomputer could scan libraries of existing treatments that might fight it. Ideally, the system could one day automatically produce a customized mRNA vaccine that targets the pathogen, like some of the COVID-19 vaccines currently being deployed.</p><p>This future isn&#39;t as far away as you might think. This past year, supercomputers <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/covid-19-high-performance-computing-consortium-enters-new-phase-focused-on-helping-researchers-to-identify-potential-therapies-for-patients-301173253.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">played a key role in the fight against COVID-19</a>, illuminating many details about COVID-19 and how the virus behaves, including how long droplets can linger in the air, and pinpointed a gene ( <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110974/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">F8A2</a>) that may partly explain why some people may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 than others. Research teams using supercomputers have even identified two existing drugs that might fight COVID-19, after scanning a library of about 1,600, as well as compounds in medicinal plants that may have antiviral properties.</p><p>Once future supercomputer models identify potential treatments to quell a future outbreak, they can help identify the best way to respond - either via conventional means, such as oral medicines or vaccines, or more experimental approaches. To distribute treatments quickly and equitably, it may one day be more efficient to add them to rain or drinking water, along with chemicals to time-limit the therapy. This, too, isn&#39;t so far-fetched, at least within a five to 10-year time horizon: Several US states are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/23/us-stated-cloud-seeding-weather-modification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trying so-called cloud seeding</a> - in which they add small particles of silver iodide to clouds - to boost rainfall. Most Americans drink <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">water with added fluoride</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/faqs/faqs-fortification.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cereal grain products are often enriched with folate</a>. These automated solutions take humans out of the loop, and, in the case of COVID-19, could exponentially reduce the time it takes to mitigate a biothreat, thus saving lives, property, and national economies.</p><p>Of course, such a dramatic scaling up of monitoring and therapeutics could raise concerns about privacy and personal choice, so we&#39;ll need to take steps to ensure this planetary immune system doesn&#39;t create a surveillance state. One possibility is to start with a pilot, perhaps monitoring future outbreaks of COVID-19 in one community that buys into the idea. The project would be completely transparent, specifying standards for the ethical use of data, with perhaps a citizen group that oversees all decisions. If the pilot works and people feel comfortable, it could expand to other communities.</p><p>This future isn&#39;t as far away as you might think.</p><p>If this kind of global monitoring system works for disease outbreaks, it could be used to tackle other global health concerns, such as food shortages. Why not use artificial intelligence to develop indicators, warnings, and plans to spot vulnerabilities in global food production, such as wheat, and help make the system more resilient and sustainable?</p><p>What I&#39;m proposing is a massive undertaking, I know. But just imagine if something like this had been in place during COVID-19 - how much suffering and loss could have been avoided. COVID-19 isn&#39;t over yet, and <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2020/7-ways-fix-pandemic--and-stop-next-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we know the next pandemic is coming</a> - we just don&#39;t know when or from where. If we start small, working in one area and expanding from there, we can show that this planetary immune system can work, and keep us safe.</p><p><em>This article is part of </em><a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/report/reset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Reset: The Science of Crisis &#38; Recovery</em></a> <em>, an ongoing series exploring how the world is navigating the coronavirus pandemic, its consequences and the way forward.

A week in an Airbnb could easily blow our entire $2,000 monthly accommodation budget.</p><p>We quickly realized that on our incomes - I&#39;m a freelance travel writer and he&#39;s retired military - we&#39;d have to spend the majority of our journey camping (which, in your mid-30s isn&#39;t as enticing or romantic as it is in your 20s), or the trip would have to be much shorter than we intended.</p><h2>It wouldn&#39;t have been the trip we envisioned - truly experiencing what it would be like to live in each location - at all </h2><p>But then we found Trusted Housesitters. It&#39;s an online database of homeowners who are going on vacation and need trusted people to come stay at their homes and take care of their pets. The best part: The housesitters stay for free. </p><p>It seemed too good to be true. <em>There has to be a catch</em>, we kept repeating to each other. But as we dug more into it, it didn&#39;t seem like there was any fine print other than the overt principle: You apply for house-sits and if you get accepted, you&#39;re invited to stay for free in someone&#39;s home. </p><h2><strong>We made a profile and started applying</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61030feeea74d40019b9bf2e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Meagan Drillinger.\" height=\"288\" width=\"384\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Kai the dog.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Meagan Drillinger</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>In lots of ways, Trusted Housesitters is kind of like Airbnb:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">You create a profile.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">You input dates and location for when and where you&#39;d like to travel.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">You see what&#39;s available.

You want to get good reviews and keep your satisfaction rating high.</li></ul><p>But in many ways, Trusted Housesitters is not at all like Airbnb:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">You pay an annual fee of $119 to be a member, whether you&#39;re a homeowner or a potential house sitter (and an additional $29 to be both).</li><li aria-level=\"1\">You get more housesits if you upload your official documents and become verified.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">You&#39;re staying in someone&#39;s primary residence with all of their day-to-day belongings.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">You&#39;re responsible for their pets while you stay, and all that that entails.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Other than the annual fee, your stays are completely free.</li></ul><p>The week we started applying for housesits (from a Seattle Airbnb, where we were paying $1,000 for a week, mind you - half our monthly budget) we were able to line up two immediately. It took a matter of days. </p><h2><strong>It turns out, we were in high demand</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61030fcbea74d40019b9bf21?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Meagan Drillinger.\" height=\"384\" width=\"512\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Drillinger working at one of the pet sits with dog Genny.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Meagan Drillinger</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>As a freelance writer and an Army veteran, it was appealing to hosts that we had plenty of time to spend with their pets. We also advertised that we have our own car; some homes offer their car to sitters, but many ask that you bring your own. Posting pictures on our profile of us spending time with our friends&#39; pets was a wise move, too - it helped to show that animals feel comfortable around us.</p><p>Our first house sit was over Memorial Day Weekend in Buffalo, New York for an English Mastiff named Dolly. Buffalo may not have been our first choice on our &#34;where to live next&#34; road trip, but seeing as we didn&#39;t have any reviews yet, we were grateful to be given a blind opportunity. </p><h2>It ended up being the best introduction to Trusted Housesitters</h2><p>We were welcomed into a gorgeously renovated Victorian home in Buffalo by our hosts - a couple who were longtime users of Trusted Housesitters and thus didn&#39;t feel the need to hover. We were watching Dolly, who could have been intimidating upon first encounter, seeing as her head could tower over my shoulder blades. But her size was the only thing daunting about her. By day David would sprawl out on the couch with her, as she tried her best to convince him that she was a lapdog. By night, the three of us would squeeze into a king-sized bed. (Yes, squeeze - she was that big.)</p><p>By the end of the weekend, we had not only fallen in love with Dolly, but we had really had a feel for Buffalo. There was ample time to go out to dinners, see the sights, go to the gym. The experience offered what we were seeking from Airbnb - the opportunity to &#34;live like a local&#34; in a place, minus the outrageous taxes and fees that seemed to increase exponentially during the pandemic.</p><p>Our second sit took us to Raleigh, NC, where we cared for a small menagerie of animals, including two chihuahua mixes, two cats, two hamsters (one of which had gotten loose before we arrived), and a bunny. Again, our hosts were incredibly laidback. It seemed like a zoo to care for at first, but once we got into the swing of things, it was the dogs we spent the most time with - and happily so. In fact, saying goodbye to the dogs was the most difficult part of this entire experience.</p><h2><strong>A great choice for remote work</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6103104aaedf2100190f0a01?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Maxwell the dog enjoying a workday nap.

Luckily, I&#39;ve always been able to be nomadic and earn an income - I&#39;ve been a freelance writer for almost seven years. Working from home or in remote corners of places like Mexico or Southeast Asia has been my routine for quite some time. In fact, while we&#39;ve been on the road I&#39;ve picked up thousands of dollars in new travel assignments from publications focusing on US travel. (My partner has been pensioned from the Army for seven years, as well, which frees him up to travel as he wishes.) </p><h2><strong>Reality check: It&#39;s still a little strange</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6103106fea74d40019b9c026?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Meagan Drillinger\" height=\"288\" width=\"384\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Drillinger and Kenny.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Meagan Drillinger</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>When  my uncle heard we were pet-sitting around the country in exchange for free places to stay he said, &#34;That&#39;s the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.&#34; Truthfully, he has a point.</p><p>It&#39;s definitely strange to be in someone else&#39;s home, complete with their things, their bedroom, their family photos, and, sometimes, their mess. Even though an Airbnb rental is technically someone else&#39;s property, these days there&#39;s anonymity to Airbnb that makes it feel a whole lot more like a hotel. </p><p>It&#39;s also strange to take someone else&#39;s keys from them and wave goodbye to them in their own driveway, but the second they&#39;re gone, we find we relax and feel less like a guest in someone&#39;s home and more like we&#39;ve checked in for a week of local immersion. It&#39;s great for our main goal, which is to see what it&#39;s really like to live in a place. When you throw pets into the mix, the reality factor increases even more.</p><h2><strong>This gig is not for everyone</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61031169aedf2100190f0abb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Meagan Drillinger\" height=\"288\" width=\"384\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Kai checking in on Drillinger&#39;s remote work progress.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Meagan Drillinger</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>You have to be adventurous. You have to be able to go with the flow. And, at the bare minimum, you need to like animals. As much as this can feel like a vacation, you are still here, mostly, for the pets: massive poops, slimy drool, runaway hamsters, and all. </p><p>That said, everyone we&#39;ve met through Trusted Housesitters has been exactly &#34;our kind&#34; of people: world travelers themselves, with great stories to tell. It&#39;s a laid-back, trusting community, and one that is deeply respectful of each other. It&#39;s also one that is, truly, all over the world. </p><p>Currently we&#39;re in Arlington, Virginia on our third house-sit caring for two gorgeous Great Dane pups, and from here we&#39;ve got gigs lined up in Minnesota, Denver, and Petaluma in California. </p><p>In between house-sits we find time to do the road trip things that we want to do, like hiking the National Parks, visiting friends we haven&#39;t seen since pre-pandemic, and exploring the romantic two-lane highways that criss-cross the country. (During those times, we *gasp* splurge on Airbnbs and hotels.)</p><p>What started as a way to get us across the country this summer has changed us and our style of travel dramatically. Pending the state of the world, we plan to take this show on the road to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Australia soon.</p><p>While I don&#39;t <em>love</em> picking up poop or sleeping in someone else&#39;s master bedroom, it helps that the savings are kind of unbelievable. In July, for example, we will only need to spend money on five nights&#39; accommodation. The rest of our budget we stash in a savings account so that when we do eventually find our next home, we can buy something special. </p><p>Although, at this rate, I don&#39;t think either of us is in any hurry to land anywhere anytime soon.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/trusted-housesitters-free-pet-sitting-for-strangers-what-its-like-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/swKgNA9sDRs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 12:45:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/61030ed2ea74d40019b9beca?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9aeb3307cf7467bfc1dca2fda7d6b5e5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-26-480_1fd887ddb9005053.webp","destWidth":512,"destHeight":384,"sourceBytes":36922,"destBytes":36922,"author":"insider@insider.com (Meagan Drillinger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/61030ed2ea74d40019b9beca?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-26-480_1fd887ddb9005053.webp","https://i.insider.com/61030feeea74d40019b9bf2e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-32-274_b349d2443023ed96.webp","https://i.insider.com/61030fcbea74d40019b9bf21?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn53@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-31-159_a436b0bbd536c277.webp","https://i.insider.com/6103104aaedf2100190f0a01?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn18@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-31-408_84dc5beb776aa51f.webp","https://i.insider.com/6103106fea74d40019b9c026?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn19@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-30-575_f45b13e44a01b875.webp","https://i.insider.com/61031169aedf2100190f0abb?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-29-303_2488996347240ba5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn30@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-32-784_2fd0bd1ff617dbec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn30@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-31-607_1ecba57008431ef1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=swKgNA9sDRs:8FstCnFmJas:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn61@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-31-902_67a938b81649c1db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/swKgNA9sDRs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn45@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-33-451_1cddf7fdb497c191.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590239},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"Only in America is filing taxes such a complicated mess.

Filing taxes in the United States is so incredibly complex that many people feel compelled to hire highly-trained experts to complete and file their taxes on their behalf. In a country that encourages home ownership, actually owning a house makes filing taxes exponentially more difficult. Many Americans pay more in taxes than they have to because they don&#39;t realize they qualify for various credits and deductions.</p><p>If you&#39;re a freelancer or an independent contractor, you&#39;re encouraged to file with the Internal Revenue Service on a quarterly basis, keep a big bin of paper receipts to track your write-offs, and set aside a huge chunk of your earnings for payment at a later date. </p><h2><strong>Filing taxes doesn&#39;t have to be a complicated and demoralizing mess</strong></h2><p>In fact, in many countries, you don&#39;t have to do your taxes at all. As Jessica Huseman <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it\">noted in a ProPublica investigation in 2017</a>, in countries across Europe, the government sends each citizen an estimated tax filing, which itemizes their deductions, earnings, and charges. And before you complain about big government overreach in those European countries, understand that anyone can dispute their government&#39;s estimated filing and prepare their own returns if they like. </p><p>We could do this here in the US. Before you even begin filling out your tax returns every year, the IRS already has a good idea of what you should be paying. All your earnings and property are already tied to your personal information, and that information has been reported to the tax agency, so estimated filings would be a trivial amount of extra work for the IRS. Is tax law so dull that the IRS has to score cheap thrills by forcing us to do complicated math under the threat of imprisonment for tax fraud - even though they already know exactly how much we owe them?  </p><h2><strong>To find the real reason for all this unnecessary math, you have to follow the money</strong></h2><p>Huseman reports that &#34;Intuit - the makers of TurboTax - and H&#38;R Block have lobbied for years to derail any move toward such a system.&#34; Between them, those two companies spend millions of dollars every year to convince lawmakers to keep the tax system complicated and confusing, so consumers are forced to purchase their products every year. </p><p>In addition to lobbyists making hefty donations to their campaigns, some politicians also enjoy second-order benefits from the fight to keep your taxes complicated. Trickle-down politicians love to use American frustration on tax day as a mechanism to promote their anti-government crusade. When you absolutely loathe filing and paying your taxes, it makes you more likely to see the government as a too-complex system that always takes and fails to produce meaningful benefits.</p><p>Every few years, you&#39;ll see a Republican presidential candidate grab some attention for their attempts to &#34;simplify the tax code&#34; by promoting a so-called &#34;flat tax&#34; in which every adult American pays the same percentage of their income. (Two presidential hopefuls from Texas, Ted Cruz and Rick Perry, both ran on flat tax platforms in the last decade or so.)</p><p>On the surface, this sounds fair, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/26/the-flat-tax-falls-flat-for-good-reasons/\">until you realize</a> that middle-class families would pay a few hundred dollars more per year under the flat taxes that have been proposed in the past, and that millionaires would pay several hundred thousand dollars less. </p><h2><strong>Worse still, exceptionally wealthy people like billionaires don&#39;t make income in the same way that you or I do</strong></h2><p>Instead of weekly or bi-monthly paychecks, many of them borrow money against their unrealized wealth from stocks at very low interest rates, and none of that wealth would be addressed by a flat tax. So even as we strive to simplify the tax process, it&#39;s vital to remember that not all simplification is a good thing.</p><p>Until we finally convince our lawmakers to forego the lobbying arm of the tax preparation industry and create an easier tax filing process, &#34;Pitchfork Economics&#34; co-host David Goldstein has some advice for ordinary American taxpayers: &#34;For all of you folks out there who are not itemizing, who are still paying people to do your own taxes: Stop! There are a lot of free services out there that the vast majority of American taxpayers qualify for.&#34; </p><p>&#34;Go online, Google it. I&#39;ve never paid anybody to do my own taxes, and I do itemize because I&#39;m a homeowner,&#34; Goldstein said. Workarounds like that are the reality for American taxpayers until we push hard enough for reform that ensures a simple and stress-free tax filing process.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

Valdez had been leaving a grocery store last Saturday morning when a stranger shot him six times in the neck and shoulder. </p><p>Three of those shots left one of his shoulders broken, the body part on which he&#39;s waiting to get surgery.</p><p>&#34;Having broken bones and bullets in me for over a week now, it&#39;s a little frustrating,&#34; Valdez said.</p><p>Ben Taub&#39;s ICU is at 98% capacity, a spokesperson told Fox 26.

Harris Health and its medical partners are working diligently to provide the best possible care during these difficult times,&#34; Callaway continued.</p><p>Valdez&#39;s case comes as the Delta variant surges in Texas. More than 10,000 Texans <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-governor-to-deploy-2500-healthcare-workers-as-delta-surges-2021-8\">have been hospitalized</a> as of August 10, according to data from the <a href=\"https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83\">Texas Department of State Health Services</a>. Compared to the past week, that figure reflects an increase of nearly 3,000 patients. </p><p>Texas Gov.

The rise of the Delta variant, which partially lowers protection from vaccines, is adding to the urgency of the situation.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-moderna-labs-covid-19-and-future-mrna-research-2021-7\" data-analytics-position=\"14\">We got an exclusive look inside Moderna&#39;s labs, where the biotech upstart is planning what comes after its blockbuster coronavirus vaccine</a></em></p><p>The narrow exception here, where both sides agree, is that some Americans do need to be boosted now.

Moderna has presented data showing the antibodies produced by its shot are not nearly as abundant and powerful when exposed to circulating variants after about six months.</p><p>The companies have also presented lab data showing a third dose significantly increases the level of virus-killing antibodies in people. Those boosted antibodies are also active in fighting the Delta variant. That matters because there&#39;s more <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v1\">research suggesting</a> that neutralizing antibodies correlate strongly to protection against COVID-19. </p><p>The vaccine makers do have a clear financial incentive to pitch booster doses. Moderna, in particular, has seen its valuation explode from $7 billion to more than $160 billion through the pandemic, thanks to its COVID-19 vaccine work that is now bringing in billions in revenue.</p><h2>Reports of waning protection are spurring booster shots</h2><p>Still, information from the <a href=\"https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/90800/2/react1_r13_final_preprint_final.pdf\">UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-to-give-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-booster-shot-to-elderly-2021-7\">Israel</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v2.full.pdf\">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers does show that protection from the vaccines seems to be decreasing, adding to the case for boosters. </p><p>Perhaps most shockingly, Israeli health officials said they have seen <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-to-give-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-booster-shot-to-elderly-2021-7\">protection against severe illness tumble from 97% in April to 81% in July</a> among people who are 60 and over. While that data has yet to be published or posted on a preprint server, it is informing that country&#39;s public-health strategy.</p><p>Israel is in the middle of an aggressive booster campaign, <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israel-approves-booster-for-people-as-young-as-50-676625\">opening eligibility for extra doses</a> to everyone 50 years and older and healthcare workers, among others. France and Germany <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210805-france-germany-to-offer-vaccine-boosters-despite-who-call-to-prioritise-poorer-nations\">are also forming booster plans</a> that will start to give third shots in September.</p><p>So much of the pandemic has boiled down to problems of reacting rather than anticipating and preventing. Signs are emerging that protection is waning, and a booster shot holds the promise of patching up immunity. Why not try to maximize protection with the tools available?</p><h2>The case against: Boosters are unnecessary, selfish</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61167258c040ad0018ce2377?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dr. Paul A.

Offit speaks during a news conference in Philadelphia.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matt Rourke/AP Photos</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Dr. Paul Offit, a longtime vaccine developer who sits on the FDA&#39;s vaccine advisory committee, says it&#39;s not yet time for booster shots.</p><p>That&#39;s because the objective of these vaccines is not to prevent every infection. Instead, the aim is to prevent people from being hospitalized with COVID-19 or dying. They&#39;re still doing that extraordinarily well, Offit said.</p><p>When you take that perspective, some of the same studies driving concern look reassuring.</p><p>Take the Mayo Clinic study (and it&#39;s worth emphasizing that this is preliminary research).</p><p>While a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-dropped-when-delta-became-dominant-study-2021-8\">sharp drop in effectiveness for Pfizer&#39;s vaccine</a> in July has drawn attention, the same study found that its effectiveness at preventing the worst COVID-19 outcomes held up.</p><h2>The shots are still working</h2><p>Pfizer&#39;s shot was 75% effective at preventing hospitalizations, roughly in line with previous month. Moderna&#39;s vaccine was 81% effective by that measure.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb87c84e3c3fb4d3b24cc23?format=jpeg\" alt=\"a headshot of Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Maria Elena Bottazzi</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Overall, the Mayo results show the vaccines are working, said Maria Elena Bottazzi, a vaccine developer at Baylor College of Medicine.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s still not really, really clear by the data if it&#39;s advantageous to get a third boost now if you&#39;re a normal, healthy person with a normal immune response,&#34; Bottazzi said. &#34;We&#39;re still seeing great protection by the vaccines against the Delta variant.&#34;</p><p>Another good example is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm\">outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts</a>, which drew headlines because most of the people infected were also fully vaccinated. But a CDC analysis of a subset of those cases found that out of 346 fully vaccinated people who got infected, only four, or roughly 1%, were hospitalized and no one died.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s a vaccine that is still working,&#34; Offit said.</p><h2>Much of the world still needs doses</h2><p>If outbreaks increasingly send fully vaccinated people to the hospital, that&#39;s when you&#39;ll know we need boosters. That&#39;s not happening as of now, Offit said.</p><p>Finally, giving boosters overlooks the far more pressing issue of getting more people vaccinated, Offit and Bottazzi said.</p><p>The World Health Organization is<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-calls-moratorium-covid-19-vaccine-booster-doses-until-september-end-2021-08-04/\"> pleading with rich nations to hold off on boosters</a> until at least the end of September so other countries can get more of their populations immunized. </p><p>&#34;I would rather see more people get protected against severe disease and deaths and hospitalizations, even if we all have breakthrough infections because that&#39;s what&#39;s going to stop this virus from continuing to mutate,&#34; Bottazzi said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-covid-booster-shots-pfizer-moderna-experts-say-not-yet-2021-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/a-8D1jq2HRE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 12:08:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/611540ec6fe08d001997b74a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"371be02a5c6dffcbdcd861ac1e87232d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn85@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-33-469_dc82bff0db6f005a.webp","destWidth":5386,"destHeight":4040,"sourceBytes":316412,"destBytes":316412,"author":"adunn@businessinsider.com (Andrew Dunn)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/611540ec6fe08d001997b748?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn70@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-33-519_b4bf3c02498b39a7.webp","https://i.insider.com/6116727b3dd01000199d8770?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn16@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-29-740_50113272f733ce09.webp","https://i.insider.com/61167258c040ad0018ce2377?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn12@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-29-106_55793d6648b7a07c.webp","https://i.insider.com/5eb87c84e3c3fb4d3b24cc23?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-32-679_9870c49b6fa4ce71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-29-698_7cf80e21c7652590.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-29-509_d8849a0270ba2a75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=a-8D1jq2HRE:dyRY4A-gU8I:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn14@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-31-818_100f4455cf94631b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/a-8D1jq2HRE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-31-144_56e53ab2fca4392c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590234},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"Free Garbatella:  A photo tour through Rome's revolutionary 'garden city' known for its street art","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-photo-tour-through-garbatella-rome-best-place-street-art-2021-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61096201372268001a59671e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A mural is seen on a wall along a steep hilly road, with a baroque building in the background.\" height=\"4000\" width=\"6000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A mural depicting the resistance of a Kurdish fighter against ISIS, with Garbatella visible in the background.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Bruno Federico for Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Located in the outskirts of Rome, Garbatella is known both for its revolutionary, century-old housing experiment and as one of the best places to see Rome&#39;s street art. </li>\n<li>Photographer Bruno Federico visited Garbatella to capture its spirit of rebellion and creativity. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Garbatella is a working-class neighborhood in the outskirts of Rome.

href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-warned-against-speculating-day-traders-dont-care-2020-6\">warned people against speculating on options</a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-michael-burry-robinhood-ipo-day-traders-speculation-warnings-2021-7\">accused Robinhood</a> of encouraging users to gamble on them instead of investing for the long term. The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO predicted derivatives would lead to risky trading and reckless brokers nearly 40 years ago.</p><p>Buffett penned a letter to John Dingell, the late Democratic politician who served in the House of Representatives for nearly 60 years, in 1982. The investor&#39;s missive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10kdiver\">resurfaced this week</a> courtesy of 10-K Diver, a Twitter user who teaches finance and investing concepts on the platform.</p><p>The Berkshire chief wrote to Dingell to warn against introducing futures tied to the S&#38;P 500 index. Buffett noted that investors could short the contracts to hedge against short-term volatility, but he cautioned that virtually everyone buying them would be gambling on stocks rising in the near term - not betting on the long-term performance of the underlying companies.</p><p>&#34;The propensity to gamble is always increased by a large prize versus a small entry fee, no matter how poor the true odds may be,&#34; Buffett said. &#34;That&#39;s why Las Vegas casinos advertise big jackpots and why state lotteries headline big prizes.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The unintelligent are seduced&#34; by low prices and huge upside, he added, pointing to promoters of penny stocks and brokers who allow trading on minimal margin. Similarly, gamblers would use S&#38;P 500 futures to bet on the short-term direction of the index while avoiding margin requirements, he said.</p><p>Buffett also explained why introducing futures would lead to rampant speculation, and result in a net loss for investors.</p><p>&#34;Since the casino (the futures market and its supporting cast of brokers) gets paid a toll each time one of these transactions takes place, you can be sure that it will have a great interest in providing very large numbers of losers and winners,&#34; he said.</p><p>Moreover, transaction costs would make futures trading a &#34;negative sum game&#34; for investors, he said. In contrast, investing in stocks is a &#34;positive sum game&#34; as the underlying companies grow and generate more money for their shareholders, he continued.</p><p>Buffett predicted that at least 95% of the activity involving futures would be &#34;strictly gambling in nature.&#34; People would use small sums of money to bet big on short-term stock movements, and brokerages would encourage them to trade more and more to maximize their cut, he said.</p><p>Brokers would do better over time if they didn&#39;t let their customers fritter away their cash, but they&#39;re too short-sighted to care, Buffett continued. &#34;They often have been happiest when behavior was at its silliest,&#34; he noted.</p><p>The Berkshire chief also warned that futures would tarnish the stock market&#39;s image, as many people would get &#34;burned&#34; by them and blame their losses on stocks.</p><p>Finally, Buffett argued the country needed more people investing for the long term, not more gamblers egged on by brokers. Large volumes of future trading would be &#34;overwhelmingly detrimental to the security-buying public&#34; and markets as well, he added.</p><p>Buffett&#39;s warnings about futures nearly four decades ago could easily be written about options today, as a new generation of traders continue to buy them <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reddit-day-traders-wallstreetbets-gamestop-gme-rally-upending-stock-market-2021-1\">based on memes and social media</a>.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-stocks-futures-options-trading-derivatives-congress-letter-robinhood-2021-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XxDxdHXy7tc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 14:50:35 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/603cf79a87d37600190d0598?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8fa58b785ebac289aae97a0e43707d67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn37@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-33-682_e18a914701cd6ed0.webp","destWidth":2827,"destHeight":2120,"sourceBytes":247628,"destBytes":247628,"author":"tmohamed@businessinsider.com (Theron Mohamed)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/603cf7aa13b221001876acff?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-29-469_6c11f2fb765ef102.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-32-122_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn98@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-32-204_7b7771aeffb153c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn2@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-31-746_7c3479d5a51cf084.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-30-405_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XxDxdHXy7tc:sJJPM6SBoEU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn22@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-30-134_78540de6011add8e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XxDxdHXy7tc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn38@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-28-833_3327d75bfa59fb96.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999590227},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:10","title":"Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe says Trump is 'threatening members of law enforcement' in targeting officer who killed Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mccabe-trump-threatening-law-enforcement-ashli-babbitt-capitol-police-riot-2021-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a74a45b85cdd41f008b4c9f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew McCabe\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Andrew McCabe.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alex Wong/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe called out Trump for his comments about Ashli Babbitt.</li>\n<li>Trump has spoken out in support of the Jan. 6 rioter who was killed by Capitol Police.</li>\n<li>&#34;When he says &#39;we know who you are,&#39;

As The Jefferson Herald&#39;s Andrew McGinn <a href=\"http://beeherald.com/news/roasting-narrative\">first reported</a>, that&#39;s when the applications really started pouring in.  </p><p>&#34;I got like 50 in two weeks, and I think that&#39;s more I&#39;ve gotten than the entire nine years we&#39;ve been here,&#34; Osborne said. He said the coffee shop has &#34;proved otherwise&#34; the narrative that people <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-say-when-someone-says-people-dont-want-to-work-right-now-2021-7\">don&#39;t want to work right now</a>. </p><p>Osborne&#39;s story sticks out amidst a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-your-pie-pizza-staff-poached-wages-2021-8\">sea of reports</a> about traditionally low-wage service jobs <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-fast-food-jobs-restaurant-laynes-texas-2021-7\">desperately scrambling</a> for workers. Some are offering <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jersey-mikes-offering-hiring-bonus-labor-shortage-2021-6\">hiring bonuses</a>; others are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-mcdonalds-amazon-jbs-staff-workers-jobs-employment-wages-2021-6\">offering free iPhones</a>. While it&#39;s true that leisure and hospitality <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/employment-changes-by-industry-july-2021-retail-leisure-and-hospitality-2021-8\">leads the pack in hiring</a>, it&#39;s also seeing an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/record-number-workers-quitting-in-third-month-here-to-stay-2021-8\">elevated number</a> of workers quitting.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-fix-labor-shortage-raising-minimum-wage-heidi-shierholz-2021-6\">Some economists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-labor-worker-shortage-pay-15-hour-be-in-bind-2021-7\">the president</a> have argued that the solution to the labor shortage is hiking wages to at least $15 an hour. That&#39;s the number activists and politicians have coalesced around for years, and it&#39;s more than double the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 (which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-minimum-wage-raised-12-years-ago-wont-increase-soon-2021-7\">hasn&#39;t budged since 2009</a>). </p><p>Iowa is one of the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/state\">21 states</a> whose minimum wage is the same as the federal rate. Many states have raised wages on their own, but localities in Iowa are banned from raising their minimum wage above the state&#39;s level. </p><p>The current hot labor market has seemed to put <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-wages-salaries-leisure-hospitality-highest-growth-20-years-2021-7\">some pressure on wages</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/july-jobs-report-high-wage-growth-restaurants-hotels-workers-raise-2021-8\">marked growth</a> every month (even <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/despite-inflation-wages-are-still-higher-than-pre-pandemic-levels-2021-8\">outpacing inflation</a> since the start of the pandemic). As <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/restaurant-grocery-store-workers-now-earn-above-15-on-average-2021-8\">Insider previously reported</a>, average pay for restaurant and grocery workers just exceeded $15 an hour for the first time. While that means half of workers still earn less than that, Greene Bean is part of a trend toward higher pay.</p><p>&#34;Smart people realize that you invest in your business, so therefore you have to invest in your employees,&#34; Osborne said. &#34;And that&#39;s what&#39;s great for me: I can trust them to run my business for me. I don&#39;t have to be the one waking up and opening the door first thing in the morning.&#34;</p><p>One big concern about raising wages: Things will get more expensive. Massive chain Chipotle <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-hiking-prices-across-menu-to-offset-higher-wages-2021-6\">said</a> that was the case when they raised their wages. </p><p>That&#39;s happening at Greene Bean, too. At the same time as the wage hike, they updated their menu, and Osborne said prices got rounded up to the next quarter. </p><p>Osborne said they did it so &#34;we didn&#39;t have to deal with so much change.&#34; Their most expensive drink is about $6, but a regular old large cup of coffee will still run you $2.</p><p>And his higher wage is impacting more than his own employees.</p><p>&#34;&#39;I&#39;ve already seen interest in other businesses trying to figure out how to do it,&#34; Osborne said. &#34;If you&#39;re going to invest in your business to make more money, investing in people to do it for you is probably a better investment than buying a shiny new machine.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
