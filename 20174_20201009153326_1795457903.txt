Hashes for updates have always been cryptographically verified, but now you can opt to download the update directly from the UI and that too is verified.</p> \n<p> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"https://cerbero-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/v40/update.png\"><img src=\"https://cerbero-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/v40/update.png\" /></a> \n </center></p> \n<p><a name=\"pdb\"></a></p> \n<h2>Improved PDB support</h2> \n<p>More PDB strucutres are now explorable from the UI.</p> \n<p> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"https://cerbero-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/v40/pdbf.png\"><img src=\"https://cerbero-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/v40/pdbf.png\" /></a> \n </center></p> \n<p><a name=\"settings\"></a></p> \n<h2>Improved settings</h2> \n<p>Apart from the Ghidra plugin installer, there’s a new tab in the settings to create a portable distribution of Cerbero Suite 4.</p> \n<p> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"https://cerbero-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/v40/portable.png\"><img src=\"https://cerbero-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/v40/portable.png\" /></a> \n </center></p> \n<p><a name=\"sdk\"></a></p> \n<h2>Improved SDK</h2> \n<p>We have increased the amout of exposed SDK and added new APIs. Among the many things we have exposed is the Sleigh decompiler. Here’s a small code sample:</p> \n<p></p> \n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">from Pro.UI import *\nfrom Pro.Carbon import *\n\nv = proContext().getCurrentView()\nc = v.getCarbon()\nd = CarbonSleighDecompiler(c)\ns = d.decompileToString(0x004028C9)\nprint(s)</pre> \n<p></p> \n<p>A Carbon instance can be created entirely from Python of course.</p> \n<p><a name=\"sview\"></a></p> \n<h2>Improved single view mode</h2> \n<p>Single view mode is perhaps a barely known feature in Cerbero, but a rather useful one. If you press “Ctrl+Alt+S” while in a view, it will hide all other views. Pressing the shortcut again restores the previous state. </p> \n<p>In Cerbero Suite 4 we have introduced the concept of dependent views and have updated single view mode to include them.</p> \n<p>We can see an example of this by looking at a crash dump. When we are in the disassembly we would like to keep dependent views (like the call stack or the decompiler) visible when switching to single view mode.</p> \n<p>Normal state:</p> \n<p> \n <center> \n

</center></p> \n<p>Apart from the news listed here, we have added many refinements and fixed many bugs.</p> \n<p>We hope you enjoy this new release!</p> \n<p>Happy hacking!</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 12:16:50
