The 65-inch LG Signature OLED R is now available at seven consumer electronics store throughout South Korea and will cost 100 million won, or more than $87,000.</p>\n<p id=\"LEqnPU\">The Signature OLED R is built around a flexible OLED panel that LG describes with characteristic restraint as “the most innovative development in television technology in decades.” Because of its flexible nature, it can retract partially or fully into its base, adapting to different aspect ratios or hiding the panel completely when not in use.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7mdb9MfaFyZSQvLS8Xyl1n6428=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973818/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_02_normal_min.gif\">\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"x7W42y\">“LG’s exquisite creation liberates users from the limitations of the wall, enabling owners to curate their living environment without having to permanently set aside space for a large, black screen that is only useful when turned on,” the company says in a statement. Buyers will be able to choose between four colors for the wool speaker cover, and the aluminum base can be personalized with an engraving.</p>\n<p id=\"2Zdvwo\">Unsurprisingly for such an ambitious product, the Signature OLED R has faced a difficult path to market. LG Display first showed off a rollable TV prototype at CES 2018, and Bloomberg later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/17/18145866/lg-rollable-tv-ces-2019-commercial-sale\">reported</a> that the display would make its way into a shipping product the next year. LG did indeed bring a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171013/lg-rollable-tv-oled-4k-tv-features-photos-video-release-ces-2019\">commercial rollable TV to the next CES</a> with plans to release it in spring 2019, but it never actually went on sale. </p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 02:16:04 +0000","feedId":255,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVSDxfvRSkJergq78jFqWJUN_HU=/0x0:550x367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67658030/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_02_normal_min.0.gif","linkMd5":"3d818e6e8e8330b352305ae3c9c8c4b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-30-12-501_25bb11119c379a5b.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":873,"sourceBytes":35061658,"destBytes":3425704,"author":"Sam Byford","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVSDxfvRSkJergq78jFqWJUN_HU=/0x0:550x367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67658030/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_02_normal_min.0.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-30-12-501_25bb11119c379a5b.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7mdb9MfaFyZSQvLS8Xyl1n6428=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973818/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_02_normal_min.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-30-18-049_e985f99e5ee2bc9e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603160993929}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:29:53","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:29:53","feedId":255,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 02:29:53 +0000","fetchMs":94,"handleMs":9,"totalMs":25929,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"72e021969f56c10206ce79830911afb1","hostName":"us-020*","requestId":"9f5349c06dee474389e46e8d3205bdc2_255","contentType":"application/xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":6171186,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx1":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 17:44:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:41:20","id":255,"name":"The Verge -  All Posts","url":"http://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52801/VER_Logomark_32x32..png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn96@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-41-14-332_bd07a61c807fbdad.png","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":3425704,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":2745482,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603160993823,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":98,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":9,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":4506,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-039.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVSDxfvRSkJergq78jFqWJUN_HU=/0x0:550x367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67658030/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_02_normal_min.0.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1310,"destHeight":873,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-30-12-501_25bb11119c379a5b.webp","sourceBytes":35061658,"destBytes":3425704,"targetWebpQuality":4,"feedId":255,"totalSpendMs":21163,"convertSpendMs":17614,"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:29:54","host":"europe61*","referer":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea","linkMd5ListStr":"3d818e6e8e8330b352305ae3c9c8c4b0,3d818e6e8e8330b352305ae3c9c8c4b0","githubUser":"myreaderx21","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"33.4 MB","destSize":"3.3 MB","compressRate":"9.8%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7mdb9MfaFyZSQvLS8Xyl1n6428=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973818/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_02_normal_min.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":400,"destHeight":267,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-30-18-049_e985f99e5ee2bc9e.webp","sourceBytes":5031604,"destBytes":2745482,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":255,"totalSpendMs":4484,"convertSpendMs":2498,"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:30:15","host":"us-039*","referer":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea","linkMd5ListStr":"3d818e6e8e8330b352305ae3c9c8c4b0","githubUser":"myreaderx1","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"4.8 MB","destSize":"2.6 MB","compressRate":"54.6%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx1":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
