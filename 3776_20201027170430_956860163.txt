It became clear that Twitter’s image-cropping algorithm defaulted to preview white faces:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Geez&#8230;any guesses why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Twitter</a> defaulted to show only the right side of the picture on mobile? <a href=\"https://t.co/UYL7N3XG9k\">pic.twitter.com/UYL7N3XG9k</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Colin Madland (@colinmadland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colinmadland/status/1307115534383710208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 19, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>In response to this, <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/transparency-image-cropping.html\">Twitter publicly announced</a> that work needs to be done to reduce racial bias and improve how images are displayed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We saw your Tweets about the harm caused by how images are cropped on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Today we’re sharing how we test for bias in our systems, and how we plan to rely less on auto-cropping and give you more choice in how images appear in Tweets:<br />  <a href=\"https://t.co/tiSreeoGOA\">https://t.co/tiSreeoGOA</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1311789202779103247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Twitter acknowledged that the way the platform is programmed to automatically crop preview images could increase harm. It acknowledged it could reduce the visibility of the range of people who use Twitter. At the beginning of October, Twitter announced that it is working to limit its reliance on machine learning-based image cropping and give Twitter users more control over the Twitter image preview.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Twitter says: “We hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what they’ll look like in the Tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm.”</p>\n<p><strong>Updates were made to help users consider Tweets carefully before Retweeting</strong></p>\n<p>Starting globally on October 20, a new Twitter update was made to encourage users to add their own thoughts and opinions to Tweets.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"wp-image-256096\" src=\"https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-13.gif\" /></p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-changes.html\">Twitter for Business</a></em></p>\n<p>A new Twitter update now prompts users to quote the Tweet. That means when someone clicks to Retweet, they are <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-changes.html\">brought to the Quote Tweet composer and encouraged to type their own thoughts</a>. The goal with this update is to get more users to consider why they are amplifying a Tweet, and then add to that conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>There are changes to the “Liked By” and “Followed By” recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>It was announced this month that new Twitter updates will be made to prevent “liked by” and “followed by” recommendations from people you don’t already follow from showing up in your timeline.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-changes.html\">On its blog</a>, Twitter explains: “We are removing them because we don’t believe the “Like” button provides sufficient, thoughtful consideration prior to amplifying Tweets to people who don’t follow the author of the Tweet, or the relevant topic that the Tweet is about.”</p>\n<p>This Twitter update is intended to slow down how quickly users see Tweets from accounts they don’t follow and topics they don’t follow. This was also done to try and encourage thoughtful amplification of Tweets.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompts to encourage users to read more than just headlines came to iOS</strong></p>\n<p>Those who use the platform on iOS saw the launch of a new prompt this month. If a user tries to Retweet an article or story, but hasn’t opened the link to read it, they will see a pop-up question. Twitter will ask if they’d like to open the link before amplifying the content.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We’re seeing promising results from this prompt, so we’re expanding the test to iOS.</p>\n<p>Sharing an article with a Retweet or Quote Tweet?

Twitter says its updates around context are about giving users more information so they can make up their own minds.</p>\n<p>The update includes <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/adding-more-context-to-trends.html\">pinned Tweets to the trending section</a>. Twitter says that the pinned Tweets are representative of the trend. They are chosen by both Twitter’s curation team and by algorithms.</p>\n<p>The update also added brief descriptions to Tweets. The descriptions are “clearly sourced context around why something is trending,” according to <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/adding-more-context-to-trends.html\">a post on the Twitter Business blog</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, below is a description explaining why #GordDownie was trending in Canada in mid-October:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-256104 size-large\" src=\"https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-100-620x664.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-100-620x664.png 620w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-100-310x332.png 310w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-100-768x823.png 768w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-100.png 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p>Both of these updates are meant to clarify to users why people are talking about the trend and to add clarity to an ongoing conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Twitter commits to increasing inclusivity and accessibility</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter tested voice Tweets this summer. (Find more information on voice Tweets in the June 2020 section of this post.)</p>\n<p>But after testing, <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible.html\">Twitter says it</a>: “&#8230;made us realize how much work we still need to do as a company, and we made a commitment to make Twitter more inclusive for the disabled community – creating a dedicated team to focus on greater accessibility, tooling, and advocacy across all of our products.”</p>\n<p>As a result, Twitter has introduced two new teams. The Accessibility Center of Excellence and the Experience Accessibility Team will work to improve accessibility within Twitter’s corporate structure and the social media platform itself.</p>\n<p>It is also working on specific Twitter updates relating to inclusivity and accessibility. Currently, Twitter is working to add automated captions to audio and video. This update is estimated to be ready by early 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements were made to the authentication systems and other security protocols </strong></p>\n<p>Near the end of September, <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-continued-work-to-keep-twitter-secure.html\">Twitter said that it was continuing to work on improving security</a>. Its September announcement included updates related to more rigorous checks with Twitter team members, and continuous improvement of internal detection and monitoring tools to alert the company of suspicious activity.</p>\n<h3><strong>August Twitter updates 2020</strong></h3>\n<p>New Twitter updates this month are changing how conversations take place on the social media platform, updating the development experience, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Now, users can choose who’s able to reply to their Tweets</strong></p>\n<p>One of Twitter’s latest updates this August was a change to how conversations happen on the platform. Previously, anyone could reply to anyone’s Tweet. Now, users can select and change reply settings themselves.</p>\n<p>The Twitter update means a user can choose a setting that allows everyone to reply. They can choose to have only their followers able to reply. Or they can choose to have only people who are mentioned in the Tweet able to reply.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1748\" height=\"1176\" class=\"wp-image-256112\" src=\"https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-101.png\" srcset=\"https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-101.png 1748w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-101-310x209.png 310w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-101-620x417.png 620w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-101-768x517.png 768w, https://mk0hootsuiteblof6bud.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/word-image-101-1536x1033.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1748px) 100vw, 1748px\" /></p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-conversation-settings-coming-to-a-tweet-near-you.html\">according to Twitter</a>, these updates have helped some users feel safer, more protected from spam, and able to have more sensitive conversations.</p>\n<p><strong>There are new labels for specific Twitter accounts</strong></p>\n<p>As part of its effort to increase context for users, <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-labels-for-government-and-state-affiliated-media-accounts.html\">Twitter announced that new labels are added to two specific types of Twitter accounts</a>.</p>\n<p>Twitter users who are key government officials, including ambassadors, spokespeople and foreign ministers, will now have their account labelled. And Twitter users who are part of state-affiliated media entities will have their account labelled.</p>\n<p><strong>Twitter launched its Transparency Center</strong></p>\n<p>On August 19, Twitter announced that it rebuilt its biannual Twitter Transparency Report site into a new <a href=\"https://transparency.twitter.com/\">Transparency Center.</a></p>\n<p>This is an entirely new website that compiles all of Twitter’s disclosed data.
