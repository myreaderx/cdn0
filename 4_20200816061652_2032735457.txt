Users are able to switch video on or off at any time during a call, and the video calls support picture-in-picture mode, so users can continue scrolling through the app if that call gets boring. Video calls will have end-to-end-encryption, Telegram’s blog posts states, one of the app’s defining features for its audio calls and texting. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        \n      <cite>Telegram</cite>\n...</figure>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370420/telegram-video-calls-os-android\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 22:23:14 +0000","feedId":4,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwgFG-yUWiVE0_Htf4IgXiaKN7Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67209647/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0004.0.jpg","linkMd5":"314849f25d5a0dea74ad10f007f33a9e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn22@2020_5/2020/08/16/06-16-21-038_7adacd401e41366b.webp","author":"Kim Lyons","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwgFG-yUWiVE0_Htf4IgXiaKN7Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67209647/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0004.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn34@2020_6/2020/08/16/06-16-50-508_7adacd401e41366b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 14:16:20","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 14:16:20","title":"President Trump now has a profile on TikTok rival Triller","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370376/president-trump-tiktok-triller-ban-bytedance","description":"  \n    <img alt=\"President Trump Holds News Conference In The White House\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrW2Nmmkdu-_nWwWV2szyqG-Hus=/0x0:6057x4038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67209468/1266320710.jpg.0.jpg\" />\n\n  <small>Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images</small>\n\n  <p id=\"EstWpG\">President Donald Trump has joined Triller, a rival to the video sharing app TikTok that he wants ban in the US.
