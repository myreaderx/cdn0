You can prep them the day before. They’re great for serving a crowd, and they’re endlessly adaptable. This is my take on the popular Everything Bagel Breakfast Casserole. It’s a deep-dish merging of grated cheese, bagels, eggs, plant-based sausage along with the crunch and savoriness of everything bagel seasoning. The bagels that break through the top get beautifully crunchy and kissed with oven-toasted cheese.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Like many things in life, the details matter here and I’ve gone into some depth on the things to think about as you make your own brunch-time fave.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-1.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Everything Bagel Breakfast Casserole Close-up\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Make Ahead?</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Absolutely! The great thing about a breakfast casserole like this one is you can completely prep it the night before. Wake and bake it in the morning. Or, you can bake it right away, after combining all the ingredients in the baking dish. You end up with slightly different textures, depending on your timing, but both are great. An overnight casserole results in a more custard-like texture. <img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-2.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Just baked breakfast casserole surrounded by three plates\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Stale Bagels vs. Fresh Bagels</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">My attitude here is to use what you have. Bagels that are a bit stale work brilliantly. Freshly baked bagels work great too. There’s a bit of a calculus if you’re hyper-specific about the texture you like. Bagels that are on the fresh side combined with the egg mixture <em>the day prior</em> to baking will yield a breakfast casserole with a more custard-like texture. Think French toast. On the other hand, if you use stale bagels and toss everything together just before baking you’ll end up with a casserole that has more definition and a slightly drier overall texture to the bread chunks. I love them both, but am a bit partial to the version pictured here &#8211; tossed just before baking, made with 3 day-old bagels.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-3.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Ingredients to make an Everything Bagel Breakfast Casserole arranged on a marble counter\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">What Kind of Bagels Should I Use?</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’ve baked this casserole with a number of different bagels over the years. As far as supermarket-brand bagels go, the version I liked best was made with <em>Dave’s Bread Epic Everything Bagels</em>. I like to work whole grains in wherever I can, so that’s what I use here, but any good bagels will work.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-4.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Everything Bagel Breakfast Casserole in the oven baking\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Can I Substitute ____ Cheese in This Breakfast Casserole?</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The short answer here is yes. A wide range of cheeses can work in this sort of thing. Basically you’re dealing with one grated cheese that you work into the egg mixture, and another cheese that functions more as a topping or punctuation. So, on the grated front if you prefer a strong cheddar or Swiss cheese, by all means make the swap. A lot of people use cream cheese for the &#8220;punctuation&#8221; cheese in this style breakfast casserole, because the theme here is&#8230;bagel. But the best version I’ve made was when I took some Boursin garlic and herb cheese from my dad’s refrigerator and used that instead. It ended up being creamy, oozy, herby magic where it hit the golden bagels on top. Feta works great too.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Same goes for goat cheese. This is a long way of saying cream cheese is the standard here, but feel free to up your game by using something with a stronger flavor and personality.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-5.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Everything Bagel Breakfast Casserole close-up with one portion gone\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Breakfast Casserole Variations &#38; Ideas</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hash Brown Breakfast Casserole</span>: Sometimes I skip the plant-based sausage crumbles (processed plant-based meats aren’t typically my thing but they work well here), and throw in a few well-cooked hashed browns instead, Or you could do both. If you keep frozen hash browns, or frozen sweet potato hash browns on hand this is an easy add. Brown them up in a skillet and allow to cool (enough so they won’t cook the eggs instantly). When assembling the casserole I tend to add them to the baking pan and then pour the egg and bagel mixture on top of them. So you get some potato thickness and not just shredded potato bits.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Green It Up Version</span>: Add a few handfuls of well-chopped kale or spices to the egg mixture. Or, if you have something like saag paneer left over, add that! Finish with lots of chopped green onions and chives. The onions can go on either before or after baking.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Pretzel Version</span>: Whenever I make this I always think to myself that an old-fashioned soft pretzel version would be fun. You’d use a few of those big Bavarian-style soft pretzels in place of the bagels.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buttermilk &#38; Bagel Breakfast Casserole</span>: I mention this down below, but I’ll emphasize here as well. I actually love to make this casserole with some buttermilk if I have it on hand. It works beautifully, especially along with the mustard accent. Just swap out about 1/2 cup of the milk called for and replace with buttermilk.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Leftover Breakfast Casserole</span>:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can smash leftover pieces of this casserole into a medium-hot skillet with a bit of oil to reheat. Parts get nice and toasty cheesy, and it’s super good. Smash casserole.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-6.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Top down view of Breakfast Casserole with spoon in baking dish\" border=\"0\" /><br />One last thing I want to call out here is that this recipe was written for a standard 9&#215;13-inch baking pan, but don&#8217;t let that limit you. If you have a big enough skillet, that&#8217;ll work. What you see here is an enameled cast-iron pan I love. Use whatever big pan you like for this, just don&#8217;t fill let the eggs get higher than about 3/4 full. If you&#8217;re still a little nervous about over-flow just place a rimmed baking sheet below the casserole.. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/BREAKFAST-CASSEROLE-RECIPE-7.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Top down view of Breakfast Casserole on marble table with spoon in baking dish\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">More Breakfast Ideas</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I love a good breakfast, and if you’re in the same boat, take a browse through these <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/breakfast_brunch\">breakfast ideas</a>.

I mined my notebooks from the past few years to create a collection of favorite spice blends, seasonings, sprinkles and the like. A little magic for your food. The blends are bold, flavor-packed, and meant to be delicious and fun. They’re the ones I use regularly, the ones in my notebooks with lots of stars and hearts next to them.

You can highlight each ingredient individually or combine multiples into punctuating seasoning and spice blends. The components can be electric with flavor, vibrant in color, and often have deep and rich histories of culinary use. Today I’m highlighting one of my favorite custom spice blends (Mandarin Marjoram Salt), along with glimpses of some of the other recipes included in <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/membership-account/membership-checkout.html?level=1\">the collection</a>.<br /><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/SPICE-BLENDS-MANDARIN-SALT.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Spice Blends - Mandarin Marjoram Salt\" border=\"0\" /></span></p>\n<h2>Mandarin Marjoram Salt</h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">I’m going to include the recipe for this blend down at the bottom of the post. With citrus accents, fennel and sesame seeds, dried marjoram and lemon verbena this salt </span>is a multi-purpose ringer. It’s the perfect finishing touch on avocado toast, guacamole, or scrambled eggs. It’s also great on hummus, and as a bread crumb seasoning. My absolute favorite way to use it is as a generous sprinkle on top of a silky, simple pureed carrot soup with a finishing thread of good olive oil. The recipe is at the bottom of this post.<br /><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/SPICE-BLENDS-PINK-DUST.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Spice Blends - Pink Dragon Dust\" border=\"0\" /></span></p>\n<h2>Pink Dragon Dust</h2>\n<p>This dust comes to life when stirred into ingredients like honey, nut butters, or yogurt – all to taste. It’s also great sprinkled across the top of fruit salad.

I like to make up a few little dry spice pouches whenever we go camping or take our Airstream out. They make for easy one-pot, just-add-water style meals. Add whatever protein and vegetable you have on hand. This broth mad from this spice blend is warming and chile-forward, but also grounding from the mushrooms. A finishing splash of coconut (or cashew milk) brings everything together.

Y</i>ou can’t go wrong keeping a little container front and center in your kitchen. The zest (or leaves) of the uniquely fragrant makrut limes make this extra special, but any limes will work great. Work this combo generously into butter for a fantastic compound butter perfect on roasted sweet potatoes. Or, sprinkle it across your favorite grain bowls. I like it on soba as well.

The sesame seeds provide a substantial foundation, the coriander and lemon verbena bring bright citrus notes, and you get a kick from the peppercorns. It’s not shy sprinkled on salted yogurt, accenting brown rice, or tossed with roasted asparagus.

It’s a blend of seaweed, crisped kale, seeds, and a few wildcards. Nutrient-dense and delicious, you can use it as a healthful seasoning for salad, vegetables, stir-fries &#8211; whatever you like.

The only thing I reach for more often is sea salt. Nutritional yeast can add a cheesy savoriness to pasta, savory toasts, biscuits, crepes, and just about anything else you can imagine. I love it spiked with curry powder and cut with ground, toasted pepitas. This combo has been a finishing touch on the last pizza I baked, topping for a breakfast bowl of spicy congee, and a kiss of magic on a simple, green lunch salad.

Pappardelle is one of the pasta shapes I prepare most often. The easy-to-make wide ribbons sweep up sauces beautifully. Flecks of flavor, like zests and grated cheese, love to cling to the expansive surface area. A bowl of homemade pappardelle is a real treat. Let&#8217;s talk though the process of making the pasta, and then I&#8217;ll share a simple pairing with oven-crisped mushroom, Parmesan and a lemon accent that I like a lot. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-11.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Fresh Homemade Pappardelle Noodles\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>About this Pappardelle Recipe</h2>\n<p>When you enjoy pappardelle in a restaurant the ratio of eggs to flour is often much, much higher than what I make at home. With the former, the weight of egg yolks can equal the weight of the flour. That means, you might need nearly two <em>dozen</em> yolks for the amount of flour we&#8217;re going to use today. This version is going to use some eggs, but nothing extreme.</p>\n<p>For home-style pappardelle, I like to use 4 eggs for 400g of flour. It ends up being more egg-y than this basic <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/homemade-pasta/\">homemade pasta</a> recipe, but it works great, I always have the ingredients on hand, and it&#8217;s perfect for everyday cooking and eating. And there are eggs leftover for the rest of the week.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-1.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Homemade Pappardelle on a platter with sliced mushrooms and lemon\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Which Flour Should I Use?</h2>\n<p>The pappardelle you see pictured here was made with “00” flour. “00” is powder-fine and made with low gluten, soft wheat flour. If you don’t have “00” you can certainly use all-purpose flour. Or use equal parts “00” and unbleached all-purpose flour. Once you&#8217;re comfortable with this, you can even swap in a bit of whole-grain flour if you like &#8211; until you have a blend you love. A bit of rye flour is nice for winter pappardelle, or you could play around with chickpea flour, or even oat flour. I have it on my list to try a bit of mesquite flour at some point.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-2.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Flour and eggs ready to make pasta dough\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>How To Make Pappardelle Dough By Hand</h2>\n<p>This is covered in the recipe below, but I wanted to include some step-by-step information in case you find yourself in the weeds.</p>\n<p>Start by making a mound of the flour directly on the countertop. Make a deep crater in the top and add the eggs, olive oil, and salt.</p>\n<p>Use a fork to break up the eggs without breaking through the walls of your flour mound. You want to try to keep the eggs contained, but don’t worry if they break through &#8211; use a spatula or bench scraper to scoop them back in. Work more and more flour into the eggs a bit at a time. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of cold water across the mixture and keep mixing until you’ve got a dough coming together.</p>\n<p>If you’re exclusively using all-purpose flour, you might not need more water. Some of the other flours are a bit thirstier, you can drizzle a bit more at time as you go if you feel like your dough is too dry. It should look like the pictures, you want to avoid having a wet dough. With some of the other flours I typically end up using 4-5 tablespoons of water total.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that a spray bottle is my favorite way to add water to pasta dough without adding too much, but drizzling works too. Use your hands to bring the dough together into a bag and knead for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is silky smooth and elastic.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-3.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Pappardelle dough resting in a bag\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>How to Roll and Cut Fresh Pappardelle By Hand</h2>\n<p>To roll out pappardelle dough by hand, make sure your dough is at room temperature. Cut the dough into four equal pieces. Choose one piece to work with, and immediately wrap the rest so they don’t dry out. You&#8217;ll need a floured surface, and you&#8217;ll want to keep the pasta floured a bit as well, so it doesn&#8217;t stick to itself. If the dough is sticking rub with a bit more flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to your desired thickness. I tend to go thinner than I think I’ll want because the pasta swells a bit as it cooks. Once you’ve rolled the dough out flat, cut the dough into strips 1-inch wide and 12 inches long. Transfer the cut pasta to a floured baking sheet, rub with a bit of flour, and swirl into little nests with about 6 pieces of pasta in each nest. Repeat with the remaining dough. At this point you can cook the pasta immediately, dry it, refrigerate it, or freeze it.</p>\n<h2>How to Roll and Cut Fresh Pappardelle by Machine</h2>\n<p>If your dough was refrigerated, bring it to room temperature before rolling out. Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with flour and aside. When you’re ready to roll out the pasta, make sure your dough is at room temperature. Cut it into six equal wedges, and squish one of them flat-ish with your fingers. Re-wrap the remaining dough immediately so it doesn’t dry out. Feed your flattened wedge though the pasta machine on its widest setting. Run it though 2 or 3 times. You want to get it into a rectangular shape if possible. Fold the dough in thirds so you have a rectangle. Feed it though the pasta maker 2-3 more times on the widest setting. Continue to feed the pasta dough through the pasta maker, decreasing the width as you go. I run the pasta through a 2-3 times on each width, and dust with a bit of flour on both sides if I’m getting any stickiness. I typically roll pappardelle out to the 5 or 6 setting on my Atlas 150. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-4.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Pappardelle dough next to an Atlas Pasta machine\" border=\"0\" /><br />I love my Altas hand-cranked pasta machine, and I&#8217;ve used it forever. They&#8217;re relatively inexpensive, and a great investment if you think you might want to make homemade pasta more often. I&#8217;ve also had great success using the pasta attachment to the Kitchen-Aid. So, if you already have one of those, consider the attachment. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-5.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Pasta machine making sheets of pasta dough from which you cut pappardelle\" border=\"0\" /><br />Cut the sheets into strips roughly 12-inches long by 1-inch thick. You can get super precise, like the photo below, or just eyeball it, and take a more casual approach. Transfer the cut pasta to a floured baking sheet, dust/rub the pasta with a bit of flour, and swirl into little nests. I usually do 6 pappardelle per nest. At this point you can cook the pasta immediately, dry it, refrigerate it, or freeze it.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-6.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Cutting homemade pappardelle on marble countertop using ruler as a guide\" border=\"0\" /><br />The pappardelle are lightly dusted (photo below) and then shaped into nests that you can use immediately, or freeze to use at a later time. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-7.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Fresh Homemade Pappardelle Noodles drying a bit on a floured sheet pan\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>How To Freeze Pappardelle</h2>\n<p>Freezing is my preferred method of storing any pappardelle I’m not cooking immediately. Arrange freshly made, uncooked nests of pappardelle across a floured baking sheet. Freeze for a couple of hours, and then transfer to double layer plastic bags. You can freeze for up to a couple of months. And you can cook straight from the freezer. No need to thaw, just dump the pappardelle into boiling salted water, and increase the cooking time a bit.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-8.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Nest of Pappardelle pasta on a floured sheetpan\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Variations</h2>\n<p>You can see in some of my other pasta recipes how to tweak basic pappardelle pasta dough by adding different seasonings and spices. For example, I added black pepper and turmeric to this sunny-looking <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/cavatelli/\">cavatelli</a>. And beet juice to electrify this <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/beet-fettuccine/\">fettuccini</a>. You can also play around with the water component. In place of water you can use vegetable juices, purees, stocks or broths, anything of that sort is fair game.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/HOMEMADE-PAPPARDELLE-12.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Top-down view of Homemade Pappardelle on a platter with sliced mushrooms and lemon\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>More Ideas!</h2>\n<p>Making fresh pasta is one of my favorite things to do. It&#8217;s even better when you have others around to help, taking turns in shifts. I did a basic primer on making <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/homemade-pasta/\">homemade pasta</a> a while ago, if you love fettuccine noodles or anything along those lines, start there. You can also try making <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/gnocchi-recipe/\">gnocchi</a> (it&#8217;s perfect with this <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/pesto-recipe/\">pesto</a>), or a favorite <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/five-minute-tomato-sauce-recipe/\">simple tomato sauce</a>.

When living in San Francisco, I would make my way to the Ferry Building Farmers’ Market most Saturday mornings. One of the things I would pick up is a loaf of oatmeal bread from <a href=\"https://www.marlabakery.com/\">Marla Bakery</a>. I started baking my own oatmeal breads after moving to Southern California a few years back and I thought I’d share my favorite today. It’s a hearty, oat-flecked loaf with a buttermilk base studded generously with melty cubes of cheddar cheese and punctuated with thin slices of jalapeño pepper. Where the cheese touches the pan it turns to golden-crispy perfection. There’s an argument to be made that a thick slab of this bread makes the best toast in the world.<br><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-1.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Slices of Cheddar Jalapeño Oatmeal Bread with Butter\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">The Ingredients</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Let’s talk through the ingredients in this oatmeal bread.&#160;</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Old-fashioned Oats</span>: Skip the instant oats, you want a more substantial flake here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Active Dry Yeast</span>: I use this type of yeast for my non-sourdough bread recipes because, quite honestly, it’s the easiest yeast to find in most stores here in California.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buttermilk</span>: Mentioned down below, buttermilk is my go-to liquid for this bread if I have it on hand. I love the flavor of buttermilk. That said, milk and water work wonderfully as well, just use whatever you’ve got. One thing to note, if you heat buttermilk too aggressively, or too hot, it might break and curdle. It’s not the end of the world, and you can simply proceed with the recipe once you’ve cooled to the desired temperature, but if you heat gently, this can be avoided.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Extra Virgin Olive Oil</span>: Your olive oil doesn’t have to be special, it should just be good tasting. Whatever you use for sautéing. That said, for fun you might experiment with using a lemon olive oil, or basil or herbed oil for an alternative flavor profile and added dimension.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Honey</span>: This oatmeal bread uses a kiss of sweetness to round out the cheesy spiciness of the cheddar and pepper. My main advice here is that a good tasting runny honey is easiest to work with.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Unbleached All-purpose Flour</span>: You have a ratio of one cup of oats to 3 cups of flour here. The amount of oats really delivers a wonderful element of whole-grain heartiness and flavor. I’d recommend giving the recipe a go as written. At that point, if you want to add some whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose flour you absolutely should! I recommend swapping in 1/2 cup or 1 cup to start, make note of how you think it turns out, and adapt your next loaf from there.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Jalapeño peppers</span>: I like to actually taste the peppers here and find that using two chunky mediums is just about perfect. You can tweak to your comfort level of course. Go ahead and leave the seeds and veins in the peppers.<br><img style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-2.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Loaf of Cheddar Jalapeño Oatmeal Bread on Counter\" border=\"0\"></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">How to Make Oatmeal Bread</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Proof the yeast</span>. This is to be sure your yeast is working. If it isn’t your bread isn’t going to rise. If you have end up with an inactive packet of yeast, no big deal, simply start the proofing process over.<br><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-3.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Ingredients to make Cheddar Jalapeño Oatmeal Bread on Marble Counter\" border=\"0\"><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Make your bread dough</span>. This is the step where you combine your proofed yeast liquid with the remaining ingredients. I use one large mixing bowl from the start of the bread making process to the finish. One thing to keep in mind, this dough it is a little tricky to read because of all the chunks. Keep kneading&#160; until the space between cheese cubes is smooth-ish and elastic. Also, pro-tip &#8211; you can simply wipe your mixing bowl out in between steps and use it for the initial rise as well.<br><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-4.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Oatmeal Bread Ingredients Combined in Bowl\" border=\"0\"><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Let the bread dough rise</span>. This is the initial rise and the key here is making sure your bread is cozy. If my oven has been on, I place the bowl on top of it. Or find a sunny spot. My dad has a proofing oven, and that is a dream. You can approximate one by heating your oven on low for a few minutes, turning it off, and then placing your dough in there to rise.<br><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-5.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Cheddar Jalapeño Oatmeal Bread Dough Rising in a Covered Bowl\" border=\"0\"><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shaping the loaf and the second rise</span>. My main advice here is to continue to be nice to your bread dough. Gently handle. Gently press to deflate along the surface of the dough. Gently shape the dough, no ripping or pulling. Keep in mind you don’t want it pancake flat before shaping. I do a bit of a burrito roll to shape this dough &#8211; roll along the length tucking in the ends a bit. Place into the pan seam-side down.<br><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-8.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Oatmeal Bread Dough in Metal Loaf Pan\" border=\"0\"><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Top with oats and bake</span>. I like to top my breads with a little bit of whatever is inside (when appropriate). In this case the cheese cubes melt and ooze, crisp and color. They break through the surface on the top of the loaf, so I don’t feel compelled to add more. Green streaks of jalapeño are also visible, so we’re all good on that front. To add oats on top, brush the top of your oatmeal bread with a bit of well-beaten egg white, and then generously sprinkle with rolled oats before placing in the oven to bake.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/oatmeal-bread-recipe-6.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Cheddar Jalapeño Oatmeal Bread\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">How to Store</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oatmeal bread isn’t going to keep as long as, say, sourdough, but this cheddar version keeps nicely for 4-5 days. If you bake a version without the cheese it tends to get a bit dry after day 2. Toasting remedies this and extends the load another day or so beyond.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Store: Once your oatmeal bread has cooled completely, store it in an airtight container for up to 4-5 days. The cheddar jalapeño oatmeal bread stays incredibly moist, the less decadent versions a bit less so.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Oatmeal Bread Variations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Whole Grain Oatmeal Bread</span>: Boost the percentage of whole grain flour. This is already a relatively hearty bread because of the amount of oats in the dough. You can make it even more hearty and wholesome by swapping out some of the all-purpose flour for a whole grain flour &#8211; start with 1 cup. Or take baby steps and start with 1/2 cup.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Saffron Honey Oatmeal Bread</span>: You can take this loaf in an entirely different direction!

good part of the year I have rosemary floating about the kitchen. It&#8217;s typically crowded in a wide-mouth jar, standing stick-straight, quietly waiting to be called upon. Sometimes it sits on the windowsill here, other times it migrates to the island, or, on rare occasions, the dinner table. I tend to buy a bunch, then work my way through it little by little (you&#8217;ve likely seen it in the background of photos on previous posts). Said another way &#8211; rosemary is often in my line of sight, and I&#8217;m always looking for ways to use it. <a href=\"http://www.olgamassov.com/2009/12/rosemary-gin-fizz/\">This</a> cocktail caught my attention a couple weeks back, and I&#8217;ve been making my own citrus-spiked riff on it in the days since.<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin-sparkler-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Blood Orange Gin Sparkler\" border=\"0\" /><br />\nSo&#8230;my initial idea was that I&#8217;d do a winter citrus version using freshly-squeezed pink grapefruit juice, gin, and tonic water or sparkling water. I thought the evergreen notes in the gin would blend nicely with the tart pucker of grapefruit, and I&#8217;d take the edge off with a hint of rosemary syrup.</p>\n<p>Not meant to be.<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin_sparkler_2.jpg\" alt=\"Gin Sparkler\" width=\"620\" border=\"0\" /><br />\nI walked into a box of beautiful Moro blood oranges at the store, and here we are. The blood orange juice worked beautifully, it added a lovely burst of color, and generally lent itself agreeably to what ended up being a long, bright, winter-time quencher. One that goes down a bit too easily, in fact. As I mention down below, if blood oranges are hard for you to come by, this drink is great with navel oranges as well. I mean it when I say, I hope you like this one as much as I do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin_sparkler_3.jpg\" alt=\"Gin Sparkler\" width=\"620\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I kept thinking the gin / citrus combo would make for a striking DIY cocktail set-up at a holiday party, or New Year&#8217;s brunch /gathering. Particularly if you offered a selection of juice mixers. I&#8217;m imagining small glass pitchers of blood orange juice, pink grapefruit juice, orange juice, oro blanco grapefruit juice, and or sweet lime juice? It would be a beautiful spectrum. Let me know if you give it a go.</p>\n<p>Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/blood-orange-gin-sparkler/\">Blood Orange Gin Sparkler</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com\">101 Cookbooks</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.101cookbooks.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?a=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.101cookbooks.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?a=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.101cookbooks.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?a=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 17:15:00 +0000","feedId":59,"bgimg":"https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin-sparkler-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&auto=format","linkMd5":"87f22e8b82473a97b1319058876e53a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-387_82fb1ca32279a1a1.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":932,"sourceBytes":81116,"destBytes":81116,"author":"Heidi Swanson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin-sparkler-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-387_82fb1ca32279a1a1.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin_sparkler_2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-23-337_95ad6627468f3429.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/gin_sparkler_3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-23-181_d844299c79543679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn87@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-23-161_cc61479540a1792b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=TsjlDJpI2b8:7lRK79ppti8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn65@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-23-351_e61a4b264be8fc6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705067},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"Meal in a Jar: Italian Barley Soup","link":"https://www.101cookbooks.com/?p=10952","description":"\n<p class=\"p1\">Not all of of my “meal in a jar” recipes are soups, but a lot of them are. We’ll branch out at some point, I promise! In the meantime, this is the second recipe in a series that started recently when I posted a favorite <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup/\">tortellini soup in a jar</a>. You were incredibly receptive to that (<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2665.png\" alt=\"♥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />!!), so here we are with a second meal in a jar. It’s an herb-flecked, hearty, Italian Barley Soup. Italian-ish would probably be a more accurate description as I like to boost the jar contents with mung beans and quinoa from my pantry, and any vegetables tend to be added at the end rather than the start.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-1b.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Italian Barley Soup in a Bowl with Spoon\" border=\"0\" /><br />I love to keep these jars on hand for fast weeknight meals and take them out on road trips and camping as well. I keep the base recipes pretty strict and my general rule of thumb is to aim for “just add water.” Or, in this case (and the tortellini soup), just add water + a can of tomatoes is fair game. The idea is that if all you have is the content of the jar, water, and perhaps an pantry-friendly ingredient or two, you have all you need for a really good meal.<img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-2.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Dry ingredients for Italian Barley Soup in a Jar\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Italian Barley Soup Variations &#38; Ideas</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">swap in 1 cup of pearled farro for the barley. Or go halfsies!</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">add a well-drained can of chickpeas</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">put an egg on it, my preference here is poached</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">drizzle with chile oil</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">add some cubes of root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, or sweet potatoes along with the jar contents. This gives them enough time to cook alongside the grains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-3.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Italian Barley Soup in a Jar in a Wood Cabinet with other Ingredients\" border=\"0\" /><br />This soup fits nicely in a pint jar. I always get emails about the jar pictured on the left (below) here, it&#8217;s a Weck jar, and they come in a range of sizes and shapes. I also love to reuse all manner of jam and sauce jars in for storage in an effort to keep plastics to a minimum in my kitchen.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-4.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Side View of Italian Barley Soup ingredients in Jars\" border=\"0\" /><br />One other thing I&#8217;ll mention is don&#8217;t store these &#8220;forever&#8221;. I try to use mine in the coming month or so. The grains will be better (and not rancid), herbs and spices more fragrant, and all the rest.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-5.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Soup Pot along with Soup ingredients on Counter\" border=\"0\" /><br />You might not think the contents of this jar will deliver a big pot of soup, but it does! The grains really swell up and absorb the herby-tomato broth. You might even need to add an extra splash of water depending on how long you allow the soup to simmer &#8211; to thin things out to your liking. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-6.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"A Collection of Meals in Jars on Marble Counter\" border=\"0\" /><br />Here&#8217;s a collection of dump &#38; stir meals in jars ready to go (above photo). If you&#8217;re interested in any of the baking versions I do, let me know! I take those out with us too when camping &#8211; for pancake mixes, breads baked in our portable pizza oven, etc. Or I&#8217;m happy to stick with soups, curries, and the like for now.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-7.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Pot of Italian Barley Soup Photographed from Above\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">More Ideas!</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I mention this down below, in the recipe, you can add all sorts of fresh vegetables to this soup depending on what you have on hand. I typically add lots of chopped kale. We have a seemingly endless supply of it coming from our garden plot. It cooks way down, so if you’re going to use it go ahead and use more than you might think. Broccoli florets are another good booster vegetable to get some green going in your bowl. Chopped or shredded cabbage is also a super choice here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here’s the <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup/\">Meal in a Jar: Tortellini Soup</a>, and here’s where you can browse the complete archive of <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/soups\">soup recipes</a>.</p>\n<p>Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-italian-barley-soup/\">Meal in a Jar: Italian Barley Soup</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com\">101 Cookbooks</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.101cookbooks.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?a=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.101cookbooks.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?a=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.101cookbooks.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?a=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 17:46:37 +0000","feedId":59,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2665.png","linkMd5":"21c916f8502cacd995b2401e4bc81f4e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-374_974868e50c7fc344.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":468,"destBytes":972,"author":"Heidi Swanson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2665.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-374_974868e50c7fc344.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-1b.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn59@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-23-796_8b1f52b099a08835.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-2.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-23-105_3b793b1b2181445f.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-3.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn63@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-29-806_4b3b064b5579ba24.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-4.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn59@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-23-182_0e8b90ccfa57d114.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-5.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn80@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-23-165_1cedc4ace5456a67.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-6.jpg?w=620&auto=format":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-23-165_c0388ece9b8c6743.webp","https://images.101cookbooks.com/MEAL-IN-JAR-ITALIAN-BARLEY-SOUP-7.jpg?w=620&auto=format":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-24-194_b22c1d1ff4edc8e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/101Cookbooks?i=urn7OOsclic:CsdSOGvIdEA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn77@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-24-124_6168c65d6c57647b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705068},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"Meal In A Jar: Tortellini Soup","link":"https://www.101cookbooks.com/?p=10786","description":"\n<p>In nearly twenty years of sharing recipes on this site I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever posted a meal in a jar.

In contrast, I&#8217;m not talking about green salads in a jar, or burrito in a jar, or those sorts of meals. Just want to clarify. I like a meal in a jar that can be cooked in <em>one</em> pan and only requires water and perhaps one can of something (tomatoes, or coconut milk, etc.) to be great. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup-1.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Meal In A Jar Tortellini Soup in Weck Jars on Countertop\" border=\"0\" /><br />I make a range of these whenever we go camping or take our travel trailer out.

This was the perfect hearty bowl of soup to thaw us out.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup-2.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Meal In A Jar Tortellini Soup in a Big White Pot\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Meal In A Jar Tortellini Soup</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;ve tried this <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/curried-tomato-tortellini-soup/\">Curried Tomato Tortellini Soup</a>, you&#8217;ll immediately recognize the inspiration. This is basically the &#8220;meal in a jar&#8221; version of that soup. It&#8217;s a fortifying lentil and tomato-based stew dotted with plump, tender tortellini, and spiked with a range of spices. It&#8217;s so delicious, and simple, and this version you combine the jar ingredients with water and a can of crushed tomatoes. There&#8217;s literally no prep required for this version once you&#8217;ve built your jar. I talk about bonus ingredients down below, and they&#8217;re completely optional but instead of the spinach called for in the non-jar recipe, I like to add finely chopped kale or broccoli florets, or whatever I have on had to work in a green veg component in this version.</span><br /> <img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup-3.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"View From Crystal Cove Campground\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Meal in A Jar Instructions</h2>\n<p>This is just a reminder to be nice to your future self. Be sure to include all instructions on the side of your jar or container. You can use a sticker, washi tape, tag, or Sharpie marker. If you&#8217;re designing your own meal in a jar (I often rework favorite recipes) try to keep things as simple as possible. This means ingredients and instructions. Take a first stab and then tweak as you go until you have a great master recipe. For this soup, I know I can always track down a can of tomatoes (I keep a couple cans in the trailer), so aside from the jar contents all I need is that and water. The instructions fit on one line. It&#8217;s basically as simple as this: simmer contents of jar with 5 1/2 cups water and 14-oz can of tomatoes. <br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup-4.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Airstream Trailer from the Front Parked at the Beach\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Bonus Ingredients</h2>\n<p>With these meal in a jar situations I often look to the refrigerator or cooler box for an extra ingredient or two. They&#8217;re not necessary, but can be nice to have. Basically, think of it as bonus points for rounding out whatever goes in the pot with whatever fresh ingredient(s) like kale or broccoli you might have on hand. Half the time for me, it&#8217;s broccoli, or some chopped kale. Use what you&#8217;ve got, it&#8217;s hard to go wrong! Cabbage, asparagus, corn, etc. So many add-ins would work here.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup-6.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Meal in a Jar Tortellini Soup Recipe Handwritten in Journal\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Pro-tip! Good Herbs &#38; Spices</h2>\n<p>These types of meals in jars rely heavily on dry spices, herbs, and the like for flavor and seasoning. You want to use the best, freshest you&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s the difference between using a curry paste and a curry powder. Or, the difference between using something like sriracha sauce and dried chile peppers and garlic.  If you&#8217;re going to make a bunch of these jars for future meals go ahead and reboot your most used spices, spice blends and dried ingredients. Source from great sources, store them in a dark, cool place, and be sure they&#8217;re beautifully fragrant. I list my favorite suppliers in the back of all of my books.<br /><img src=\"https://images.101cookbooks.com/meal-in-a-jar-tortellini-soup-5.jpg?w=620&#38;auto=format\" alt=\"Meal In A Jar Tortellini Soup in Weck Jars on Countertop\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you like this sort of meal in a jar recipe, let me know.

And, there are an increasing number of reasons to enjoy them over their boozy counterpoints. For example, if you&#8217;re pregnant, if you&#8217;re attempting to improve your health overall, if you&#8217;re taking a break from alcohol, or if you&#8217;re just tired of waking up a bit groggy.</p>\n<h2>Winding Down with a Drink</h2>\n<p>That said, having something special to drink at the end of a day is a favorite ritual. A celebration of sorts, and a way for to transition from <em>to-do</em> list mode, into a more relaxed frame of mind. I&#8217;m hoping these will provide some booze-free inspiration. Play around with aqua frescas, shrubs, kombuchas, and fresh fruit syrups. All can be fun components in mocktail type drinks. I like to keep the components in nice jars and decanters, and serve in pretty glassware. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.quitokeeto.com/pages/rose-rhubarb-syrup\">Rose &#38; Rhubarb Soda</a> &#8211; <em>(QUITOKEETO)<br />\n</em></strong>Keep blushy pink rhubarb syrup on hand, and you&#8217;re just a splash away from a special soda.
