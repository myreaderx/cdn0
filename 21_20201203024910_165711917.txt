But while we&#8217;re excited to see Diana&#8217;s latest adventure, there are plenty of other TV shows and films arriving on the service this month to tide you over.

If for absolutely no other reason, it&#8217;s worth watching just to hear a put-upon Jeff Bridges drawl out Matt Damon&#8217;s character&#8217;s name, &#8220;LaBeef.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-647969 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shop-Around-the-Corner-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shop-Around-the-Corner.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shop-Around-the-Corner-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Shop Around the Corner</h2>\n<p>Ernst Lubitch&#8217;s delightful romantic comedy about a pair of gift shop employees who can&#8217;t stand each other in person but fall in love through writing anonymous letters served as the inspiration for <em>You&#8217;ve Got Mail</em> decades later. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are both charming in this iteration of the tale, and it&#8217;s especially worth watching around the holidays.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-647968 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blow-Up-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blow-Up.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blow-Up-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Blow-Up</h2>\n<p>Speaking of inspirations, if you&#8217;ve seen Brian De Palma&#8217;s <em>Blow Out</em> and Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s <em>The Conversation</em> (which you absolutely must on both accounts), this 1966 movie is the precursor to those thrillers. It&#8217;s a more lethargic in its plotting, but the hook is great: when a photographer develops his film, he realizes he&#8217;s captured something in an image that he never should have seen.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-421962 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hot-fuzz-image-e1497019725950-700x320.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hot-fuzz-image-e1497019725950.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hot-fuzz-image-e1497019725950-360x165.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Hot Fuzz</h2>\n<p>Edgar Wright&#8217;s loving send-up of classic 1980s action movies is one of those rare parodies that actually works as a standalone entry in the genre instead of  just being an ongoing string of jokes and gags. As a big fan of <em>Point Break</em>, I love all of this film&#8217;s nods to Kathryn Bigelow&#8217;s classic, but the murder mystery elements of <em>Hot Fuzz</em> push it out into its own unique territory.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-578498 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Shawshank-Redemption-IMDb-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Shawshank Redemption IMDb\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Shawshank-Redemption-IMDb.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Shawshank-Redemption-IMDb-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Shawshank Redemption</h2>\n<p>I somehow stumbled across this little-known gem the other day and it&#8217;s surprisingly great. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never heard anyone talk about it! It&#8217;s about this guy named Andy who goes to prison for killing his wife, but – get this – he claims he&#8217;s innocent. He befriends a &#8220;guy who can get things,&#8221; and&#8230;well, I don&#8217;t want to spoil it. But you should really check it out!

Today is your lucky day, my friends. Netflix has unveiled the trailer for the third season (!) of <em><strong>Fast and Furious: Spy Racers</strong></em>, a show that follows the adventures of Dominic Toretto&#8217;s younger cousin Tony and his renegade band of&#8230;well, spy racers. Check out the trailer below, but be warned: it&#8217;s bad enough to make the worst parts of the live-action franchise look like poetic cinema.<span id=\"more-647992\"></span></p>\n<h2>Fast &#38; Furious Spy Racers Season 3 Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ledClouNewg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Inspired by Universal’s blockbuster <em>Fast &#38; Furious</em> franchise, teenager Tony Toretto follows in the footsteps of his cousin Dom when he and his friends are recruited by a secret government agency to take down nefarious crime organizations across the globe.</p>\n<p>This season, when the menacing Cleve Kelso and his experimental storm satellites take down Ms. Nowhere and Gary during an operation in North Africa, Echo steps up as de facto leader, much to Tony&#8217;s chagrin, and the <span class=\"il\">Spy</span> <span class=\"il\">Racers</span> embark on a dangerous mission across the Sahara. Will they be able to save their crew or will Kelso and his league of villains be too powerful for the <span class=\"il\">Spy</span> <span class=\"il\">Racers</span> to survive in the harsh desert?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have not seen an episode of this show, so I&#8217;m as surprised as you are to discover that Crocodile Dundee has lost his accent, pivoted to supervillain status, and is trying to bring the entire world to its knees with storm satellites. Can&#8217;t say I saw that one coming. The rest of it – giant mech suits, laser-shooting robot arms, ramping off a sand dune into an electrical hurricane – seems <em>just a bit</em> outside even the live-action franchise&#8217;s tenuous grasp on reality, but I guess I can&#8217;t fault them too much if they&#8217;re just trying to keep kids entertained. But seriously, though: what&#8217;s up with the mouth movements? Did they just re-record new audio over existing footage throughout this entire trailer to set up the storyline for the season, and hope that kids would be too dumb to notice? Well played, I guess!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-648007 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fast-and-Furious-Spy-Racers-S3-poster-700x1053.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1053\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fast-and-Furious-Spy-Racers-S3-poster.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fast-and-Furious-Spy-Racers-S3-poster-332x500.jpg 332w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>All 13 brand new episodes of <em>Fast &#38; Furious: Spy Racers</em> season 3 arrive on Netflix on <strong>December 26</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>, just in time to lounge in a post-Christmas bliss and inject this insanity directly into your skulls.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fast-and-furious-spy-racers-season-3-trailer/\">&#8216;Fast &#038; Furious: Spy Racers&#8217; Season 3 Trailer: Yep, This Show is Still On (And They&#8217;re Racing in the Desert Now)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/LnLkdHIJCog\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 23:30:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fast-and-Furious-Spy-Racers-season-3-trailer-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"af77a5d8d8460c200ec121295517d62a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn31@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-31-861_8919048f200de032.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":47583,"destBytes":33546,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fast-and-Furious-Spy-Racers-season-3-trailer-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn31@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-31-861_8919048f200de032.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fast-and-Furious-Spy-Racers-S3-poster-700x1053.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-58-613_c032ae8d87db7e42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn83@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-297_3a33b8db422f89b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LnLkdHIJCog:tt10h7ceWAI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-57-484_111a7276c25eee0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/LnLkdHIJCog":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-57-484_c4f307153323db0a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711230},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"‘Wonder Woman 1984’ Tickets on Sale Now","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648124","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-648131\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"wonder woman 1984 tickets\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Wonder Woman 1984 </em></strong>is making history as a major movie that&#8217;s premiering both in theaters and on HBO Max on the same exact day, December 25.

Pictures Group.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fast forward to the 1980s as Wonder Woman’s next big screen adventure finds her facing two all-new foes: Max Lord and The Cheetah. With director Patty Jenkins back at the helm and Gal Gadot returning in the title role, “Wonder Woman 1984” is Warner Bros. Pictures’ follow up to the DC Super Hero’s first outing, 2017’s record-breaking “Wonder Woman,” which took in $822 million at the worldwide box office. The film also stars Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Kristen Wiig as The Cheetah, Pedro Pascal as Max Lord, Robin Wright as Antiope, and Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-tickets/\">&#8216;Wonder Woman 1984&#8217; Tickets on Sale Now</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/r-54X1I_5dc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:00:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"ff63bfe0f5ded8505dd46f7705d3e165","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-43-710_165398d1c32ea84e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":47191,"destBytes":31100,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonder-woman-1984-tickets-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-43-710_165398d1c32ea84e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn100@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-58-606_bd260c573b920550.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r-54X1I_5dc:ya3l_RLY0pM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn44@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-58-749_1256fbb0bf4eacab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/r-54X1I_5dc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn94@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-59-464_551e99af7754d56b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711229},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"Superhero Bits: Hailee Steinfeld Spotted on ‘Hawkeye’ Set, Alex Ross Teases Unseen Artwork & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648103","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-648167 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-bobafett-alexross-art-frontpage-700x353.jpg\" alt=\"Batman vs Boba Fett\" width=\"700\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-bobafett-alexross-art-frontpage-700x353.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-bobafett-alexross-art-frontpage-360x182.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-bobafett-alexross-art-frontpage-768x388.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-bobafett-alexross-art-frontpage.jpg 1062w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Want to see some <strong>Alex Ross</strong> artwork that hasn&#8217;t been released before?

Pictures, which has a plan to release the film on HBO in early <strong>2021</strong>. Read on for a refresher of the plot and all of the A-list talent who appear in this this movie.<br />\n<span id=\"more-648104\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong> (or as Key and Peele would <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQrYjOU6qMw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refer</a> to her, &#8220;Annie Hathaways&#8221;) and <strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor</strong> (<em>Doctor Strange</em>, <em>Triple 9</em>) are playing the leads in this new movie. (Sorry, Key and Peele don&#8217;t have a fun nickname for Ejiofor.) The story is set against the backdrop of COVID-19 and stars Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a sparring married couple who call a truce to attempt a high-risk, high-stakes jewelry heist at Harrod&#8217;s, the world’s most exclusive department store.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cast is downright fantastic: <strong>Ben Stiller</strong> (<em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>, <em>Tropic Thunder</em>), <strong>Lily James</strong> (<em>Rebecca</em>, <em>Baby Driver</em>), <strong>Stephen Merchant</strong> (<em>Hello Ladies</em>, <em>Logan</em>), <strong>Lucy Boynton</strong> (<em>Sing Street</em>, <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>), <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> (<em>The Office</em>, <em>Ocean&#8217;s Eight</em>), <strong>Ben Kingsley</strong> (<em>Sexy Beast</em>, <em>Iron Man 3</em>), and <strong>Dulé Hill</strong> (<em>Psych</em>). Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t know which roles the rest of these actors will be playing.</p>\n<p>Liman, who previously directed films like <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, <em>Go</em>, and <em>The Bourne Identity</em>, is behind the camera, returning to territory that sounds vaguely similar to what he did with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in <em>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</em>. <strong>Steven Knight</strong>, who wrote <em>Eastern Promises</em>, <em>Locke</em>, and the absolutely deranged Matthew McConaughey/Anne Hathaway noir film <em>Serenity</em>, wrote the script. AGC Studios is financing the movie, and it was produced by <strong>PJ van Sandwijk </strong>(<em>American Dharma</em>, <em>Citizen K</em>), <strong>Alison Winter</strong>, who has worked with Liman on several film and streaming productions over the past few years, and <strong>Michael Lesslie</strong>, who wrote the 2016 movie adaptation of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. Liman and Knight served as executive producers.</p>\n<p>Production started back in September and seems to have already wrapped. There&#8217;s no official release date in place yet, and no word if this might also get a theatrical release at the same time as it hits HBO Max.

The book not only features ample amounts of concept art that show off the developmental evolution of the characters, settings, weapons, aliens, and more from the first season of <em>The Mandalorian,</em> but it also digs into the inception of the series and behind-the-scenes details from each of the first eight episodes.<span id=\"more-648016\"></span></p>\n<p><em>The Art of The Mandalorian</em> is written by <span class=\"aCOpRe\"><strong>Phil Szostak</strong>, Lucasfilm&#8217;s <span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">creative art manager and the author of the art books for <em>The Force Awakens</em>, <em>The Last Jedi</em>, <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, and <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>. Just like those books, this is a fascinating and in-depth look at the art used to bring the series to life with plenty of insider perspectives and tidbits to pore over. However, fans might be disappointed to see that despite the fact that the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em> spans the length of two <em>Star Wars</em> movies, the book isn&#8217;t double the size of their companion books. </span></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-640688 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season1-conceptart-dindjarin-kid-rescued-700x327.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Concept Art\" width=\"700\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season1-conceptart-dindjarin-kid-rescued-700x327.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season1-conceptart-dindjarin-kid-rescued-360x168.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season1-conceptart-dindjarin-kid-rescued-768x359.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season1-conceptart-dindjarin-kid-rescued.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Even so, <em>The Art of the Mandalorian</em> covers plenty of ground in the creation of this increasingly ambitious <em>Star Wars</em> series. It begins by harking back to the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy and the creation of the mysterious Boba Fett, which obviously serves as inspiration for the show&#8217;s titular character, not just in his appearance, but also the manner with which the bounty hunter known as Din Djarin carries himself. Early on, a lot of the concept art simply reuses Boba Fett&#8217;s armor, including the big dent on his helmet, simply because it took executive producers <strong>Jon Favreau</strong> and <strong>Dave Filoni</strong> some time to figure out how to properly differentiate The Mandalorian from the character fans had come to love after his big screen debut in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>.</p>\n<p>Within the book, there are hundreds of pieces of <em>The Mandalorian</em> concept art. Some you&#8217;ll recognize as pieces that were featured in the end credits of each episode as they debuted on Disney+. But there are even more detailed and mesmerizing works you haven&#8217;t seen before, some given rich, full two-page spreads that you might even be compelled to run your fingers over in admiration. Many of these images come with added insight from the artists and information about what inspired their work, whether it was the <em>Lone Wolf and Cub</em> manga, the films of Akira Kurosawa, countless classic westerns, or the familiar <em>Star Wars</em> aesthetics created by legendary artist Ralph McQuarrie.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/the-art-of-the-mandalorian-book-review/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign1/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign1-360x240.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"The Art of the Mandalorian Book Review\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign1-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/the-art-of-the-mandalorian-book-review/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign2/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign2-360x240.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"The Art of the Mandalorian Book Review\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign2-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-razorcrest-altdesign2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n\n<p>In addition to these pieces, even more artwork is collected to highlight different versions of characters, vehicles, and settings. For example, there&#8217;s a little spread featuring alternate designs for Mando&#8217;s ship the Razor Crest. The book reveals the inspiration for the ship&#8217;s general vibe came from Favreau&#8217;s love of the A-10 Thunderbolt &#8220;Warthog,&#8221; a <span class=\"aCOpRe\">twin turbofan engine, straight wing jet aircraft, and each of the varying approaches to the ship borrowed elements of that real aircraft until they settled on the design seen in the show. There are dozens of anecdotes like this from the many artists who worked on the movie, complete with images that show the evolution of their concepts and designs, explaining the subtle variations between each and the motivation behind them.</span></p>\n<p>If you wondered what Carl Weathers&#8217; character Greef Karga would have looked like if he ended up being an alien Weequay as originally intended, there&#8217;s a glimpse at the design. If you want a better look at the various Mandalorians from the secret bounty hunter stronghold on Nevarro, a collection of illustrations reveal the variations in armor. This includes a variety of alternate looks for The Armorer, featuring some wild, unique helmet designs that are significantly different from what ended up on the series. The same can be said for unused designs for decommissioned Stormtroopers, some of which covered up the traditional white armor with more gear. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-648043 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-armorbreakdown-700x409.jpg\" alt=\"The Art of the Mandalorian Book Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-armorbreakdown-700x409.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-armorbreakdown-360x210.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-armorbreakdown-768x449.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/artofthemandalorian-armorbreakdown.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>While a lot of the images within the book are cinematic and artistic in nature, there are also pieces of art that get more technical and detailed, mostly for the benefit of the other departments on the production that have to create props and sets. For cosplayers who want an up close look at certain pieces of armor, weapons, and other props, this book will likely be a valuable tool in the creation of your next pop culture convention wardrobe (though maybe not as much as the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0744031265/?tag=film-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Mandalorian Ultimate Visual Guide</em></a> coming in July 2021).</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-619906 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-davefiloni-meetbabyyoda-drawing-700x390.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian - Dave Filoni Sketch\" width=\"700\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-davefiloni-meetbabyyoda-drawing-700x390.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-davefiloni-meetbabyyoda-drawing-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-davefiloni-meetbabyyoda-drawing-768x427.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-davefiloni-meetbabyyoda-drawing.jpg 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, some of my favorite pieces in the book are the more simple sketches created by Dave Filoni in order to illustrate (no pun intended) the ideas in his head. You&#8217;ll see a notebook sketch of Boba Fett&#8217;s helmet with the equivalent of a tagline that essentially acts as a basic pitch for the series, and there are many more throughout the book. Another series of sketches by Filoni show early ideas for The Child where he was given a little samurai-like ponytail just like the child from <em>Lone Wolf and Cub</em>, and if you want to see all the different designs the team went through before settling on the little guy we&#8217;ve seen in the series, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s one area where <em>The Art of The Mandalorian</em> might be lacking a little, it&#8217;s in the production details of the show itself. That&#8217;s not entirely unexpected since this book is called <em>The Art of The Mandalorian</em> and not <em>The Making of The Mandalorian</em>. Each episode is given a one-page breakdown pinpointing some details from the set, but these sections mostly retread what fans my have already learned from the documentary series <em>Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian</em> on Disney+. If you haven&#8217;t seen that series, it&#8217;s worth diving into before or after reading through this book.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-590167 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-episode3-conceptart4-700x336.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Concept Art - Episode 3\" width=\"700\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-episode3-conceptart4-700x336.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-episode3-conceptart4-360x173.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-episode3-conceptart4-768x369.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, because this book is being released a year after the series debuted, it includes much more spoilery details than most of the other <em>Star Wars</em> art books. But there&#8217;s still a spoilery element of the series that doesn&#8217;t get explored as much as I would have liked. The darksaber is only featured in three pieces of artwork, and they only appear after the book&#8217;s index and acknowledgements without next to no insight from the artists. There is one piece that provides the most detailed look at the live-action darksaber hilt that we&#8217;ve seen, but it would have been nice to see more artwork focused on the famed weapon, especially considering its importance in <em>Star Wars</em> lore.</p>\n<p>But beyond that, <em>Star Wars</em> fans looking for a great coffee table book that is chock full of astounding concept art from Lucasfilm will be more than satisfied with the contents of this book. And since this is just for the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, it&#8217;s exciting knowing that we&#8217;ll likely be getting a book like this for every single season that follows. And considering everything that&#8217;s happened in the second season so far, the next book is going to have even more amazing artwork.</p>\n<p><em>The Art of The Mandalorian (Season One)</em> is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/141974870X/?tag=film-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available for purchase right now</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-art-of-the-mandalorian-book-review/\">&#8216;The Art of The Mandalorian&#8217;

There&#8217;s no word on what character Plaza is playing, but here&#8217;s hoping Ritchie is smart enough to give her a big, substantial part and not just sideline her in some thankless role.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-648149\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop on Aubrey Plaza joining the cast of Guy Ritchie&#8217;s untitled action thriller (it used to be called <em>Five Eyes</em> but that&#8217;s apparently no longer the case). Plaza joins Jason Statham in the flick, and I <em>really</em> hope this means we&#8217;re going to see Aubrey Plaza kicking people&#8217;s asses. Don&#8217;t sideline her in some supporting role where she does nothing – let Aubrey Plaza fight, damn it!</p>\n<p>The movie &#8220;follows MI6 guns-and-steel agent (Statham) who is recruited by a global intelligence alliance to track down and stop the sale of a deadly new weapons technology that threatens to disrupt the world order. Reluctantly paired with CIA high-tech expert, Fortune sets off on a globe-trotting mission where he will have to use all of his charm, ingenuity, and stealth to track down and infiltrate billionaire arms broker.&#8221; Is Plaza playing the high-tech expert? Maybe! That&#8217;s fine – as long as she gets to punch some faces in. Give the people what they want: Aubrey Plaza straight-up punching people. We&#8217;ve earned this.</p>\n<p>Plaza is having a bit of a streak at the moment. She just appeared in the Hulu hit <em>Happiest Season</em>, and her psychological drama <em>Black Bear</em>, in which she gives an incredible, unhinged performance, opens this week. Like I said: more Aubrey Plaza is always a good thing. Ritchie is directing from a script by Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who also wrote Ritchie&#8217;s <em>The Gentlemen</em>. And that gives me a little bit of a pause. I like a lot of Ritchie&#8217;s early films, but <em>The Gentlemen</em> was a bit of a mess. But the idea of Ritchie reuniting with Jason Statham is promising, so fingers crossed it all works out in the end. And Ritchie is also revising the script himself.</p>\n<p>When the film was first announced, Adam Fogelson, of production company STXfilms Motion Picture Grou, said: &#8220;Jason is a global box office heavy weight, and when teamed with Guy Ritchie, that’s an irresistible combination. It’s a thrill to be back in business with Guy, Bill and the team at Miramax after our shared success on The Gentlemen and we believe Five Eyes is the kind of film our partners overseas will love as much as we do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-guy-ritchie-movie-aubrey-plaza/\">Aubrey Plaza Joins the Cast of New Guy Ritchie Movie Starring Jason Statham</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/pIFg9ZdQ6SE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:30:56 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Guy-Ritchie-Movie-Aubrey-Plaza-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f7026c598a72bc8a0207aa981687b2ac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-43-760_953cbd105bb74a18.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":24958,"destBytes":12318,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Guy-Ritchie-Movie-Aubrey-Plaza-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-43-760_953cbd105bb74a18.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-58-347_b044a6ec33c9bf01.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pIFg9ZdQ6SE:jhJVLATkfXM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-57-592_69ba4554a1e6701b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/pIFg9ZdQ6SE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn87@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-58-794_ba4edf088aa62bbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711222},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"‘Babylon’ Switch-Up: Margot Robbie May Replace Emma Stone in Damien Chazelle’s Hollywood Drama","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648138","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-648146 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Babylon-cast-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Babylon cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Babylon-cast.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Babylon-cast-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>After taking a detour to space for his most recent film, <em>First Man</em>, filmmaker <strong>Damien Chazelle</strong> is returning to a Hollywood setting for his newest movie, <em><strong>Babylon</strong></em>. <strong>Emma Stone</strong>, who won an Oscar for her performance in Chazelle&#8217;s terrific 2016 movie <em>La La Land</em>, has had to drop out of playing the lead role in his upcoming feature – and <strong>Margot Robbie</strong> (<em>Birds of Prey</em>) is being eyed to replace her.<span id=\"more-648138\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Margot Robbie may end up leading the <em>Babylon</em> cast, since Emma Stone had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. I haven&#8217;t been able to find any active projects that she&#8217;s attached to as an actress, but she started a production company earlier this year and is producing her <em>Zombieland</em> co-star Jesse Eisenberg&#8217;s feature directorial debut, so maybe the conflict has something to do with her work as a producer. (She&#8217;s also starring in the <em>Cruella</em> origin film for Disney, which has already wrapped, but her requirements to do press for that project could potentially be what&#8217;s causing the interference here.)</p>\n<p>Robbie is in early talks to take Stone&#8217;s place and to reunite with her <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> co-star <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>, who has been attached to this project as the male lead since the beginning. Since Robbie and Pitt did not share any significant screen time in Tarantino&#8217;s L.A.-based movie, I look forward to seeing what they can do together here.</p>\n<p>But Stone and Robbie have very different energies as performers. Robbie is not an easy 1:1 replacement for Stone&#8217;s easy-going charm, and while Stone&#8217;s character in <em>La La Land</em> talks about having an &#8220;old soul,&#8221; I think the actress has a bit of that, too. She can be modern when needed, but there&#8217;s also a timelessness to her which seems to allow her to work well in period pieces, also. But even though Robbie did great work as Sharon Tate and was a strong Tonya Harding in <em>I, Tonya</em>, she still feels like a more modern performer to me, so it should be a nice challenge for her to step into a movie set all the way back in the 1920s.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a loose description of the plot:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The story is said to be set in the late 1920s, during the movie industry&#8217;s transition from silent films to talkies. The rise and fall of fictional and historical characters figure into the proceedings. If deals are made, [Robbie] would portray Clara Bow, the early sex symbol and box office star who was Hollywood&#8217;s first &#8220;It&#8221; girl. Pitt would play a fictional character, a silent film star who fails to make the transition to the new technology; sources say he is based on real-life figure John Gilbert.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/babylon-cast-margot-robbie/\">&#8216;Babylon&#8217; Switch-Up: Margot Robbie May Replace Emma Stone in Damien Chazelle&#8217;s Hollywood Drama</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ixE_fcfF9k4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Babylon-cast-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"d80e4d1e6568f282e1fcd68b59229337","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn65@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-37-233_19469b02012d2d54.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":44766,"destBytes":31626,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Babylon-cast-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn65@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-37-233_19469b02012d2d54.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn71@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-57-633_88c754595e6b72be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ixE_fcfF9k4:vZVAl4Mh8Z0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-57-423_17cedb59d166b496.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ixE_fcfF9k4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn67@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-58-721_fa35f4205301f637.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711230},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"The New ‘Scream’ Cast Was Given Fake Scripts to Keep the Ending a Secret","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648087","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646339\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-700x364.jpeg\" alt=\"scream 5 filming\" width=\"700\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-700x364.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-360x187.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-768x399.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s par for the course for any twisty horror movie to hide the true ending from cast members to keep secrets from leaking out to the public. And the new <strong><em>Scream</em></strong> might have a fair few twists, judging by the lengths the production went to keep the film&#8217;s ending a secret from its cast. Producer <strong>William Sherak</strong> revealed that several members of the upcoming fifth installment in the <em>Scream</em> franchise still don&#8217;t know the identity of the killer in their movie, due to the multiple fake scripts that were given to the cast to hide the ending.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-648087\"></span></p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2559540/why-even-scream-5s-cast-might-not-know-who-ghostface-truly-is?pv=related_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cinema Blend</a>, Sherak confirmed that the production team led by directors <strong>Matt Bettinelli-Olpin</strong> and <strong>Tyler Gillett</strong> (<em>Ready or Not</em>) handed out several fake versions of the script to the cast during filming to keep the film&#8217;s ending a secret:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the two things to remember for us. One is there are multiple versions of the draft out there and most of the cast don’t know if they have the right version or not. So, we’ve been playing that game with them as well. And the fun of a Scream movie is that everyone is guilty until proven innocent, not the other way around. So, the goal is to keep that going for as long as possible and have fun with it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not an uncommon technique to create multiple scripts to keep cast members in the dark, especially for high-profile projects like the upcoming <em>Scream</em>. It was notably used by Marvel Studios for films like <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, which were shot back-to-back, during which several cast members didn&#8217;t even know if they would make it to the sequel.</p>\n<p>The killer changes in every <em>Scream</em> film — the identity of Ghostface has been adopted by several characters to go on their bloody killing sprees. The only commonality each Ghostface shares is the desire to kill poor Syndey Prescott (<strong>Neve Campbell</strong>, returning to the franchise after 9 years). Which means it could be any of the returning cast members, which include <strong>David Arquette</strong> and<strong> Courteney Cox</strong>, or franchise newcomers <strong>Jack Quaid</strong>, <strong>Melissa Barrera</strong>, <strong>Jenna Ortega</strong>, <strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>, <strong>Mason Gooding</strong>, <strong>Kyle Gallner</strong>, <strong>Jasmin Savoy Brown</strong>, <strong>Mikey Madison</strong>, and <strong>Sonia Ben Ammar</strong>. Plot details aren’t known yet for <em>Scream</em>, which is primed as a soft reboot for the franchise created by Wes Craven.</p>\n<p><em>Scream</em> is set to debut in theaters on<strong> January 14, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/scream-scripts-alternate/\">The New &#8216;Scream&#8217; Cast Was Given Fake Scripts to Keep the Ending a Secret</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eaCyP0QQUDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 20:00:25 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-700x364.jpeg","linkMd5":"fe37254e672c33b842a97a5f93d0fc8b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-31-816_a70ef0ce1d52a8e0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":364,"sourceBytes":24354,"destBytes":14502,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-700x364.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-31-816_a70ef0ce1d52a8e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-58-760_7e23bb0520b4d99e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eaCyP0QQUDY:ZXEm5cm5qpE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-58-623_17a42adcaaaf344a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eaCyP0QQUDY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn64@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-58-834_16a6132c57dae0ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711228},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"‘Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone’ Early Cut Was Nearly As Long as ‘Fellowship of the Ring’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647681","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-280040 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone2-700x290.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Early Cut\" width=\"700\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone2-700x290.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone2-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Harry Potter</em></strong> book series took the world by storm and the story of The Boy Who Lived was a phenomenon by the late 1990s. Of course, that meant the books were destined to be adapted for the big screen, and director <strong>Chris Columbus</strong> was the one who was tapped to take a crack at it for Warner Bros. Pictures. The pressure was on for the <em>Home Alone</em> director to deliver the fantastical world that fans have been imagining in their heads for years. That&#8217;s why an early cut of the movie screened for audiences was almost as long as the theatrical cut of <em>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, which came close to hitting the three-hour mark.<span id=\"more-647681\"></span></p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <a href=\"https://collider.com/harry-potter-1-chris-columbus-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a>, Columbus recalled just how much anxiety he felt, worrying that he was going to get fired every single day. The director said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The first film was fraught with anxiety for me. The first two weeks I thought I was gonna get fired every day. Everything looked good, I just thought if I do one thing wrong, if I fuck up, I’m fired. And that was intense. I didn’t let any of that show on the set, there was no frustration, I’m not a screamer, I get along with everybody and I want everybody to feel like they’re part of the family, so I just had to hide that side of my emotions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>But he made it to the end of the production, and when they were ready to screen the film for the first audience to ever see a Harry Potter movie, they went to Chicago. Initially, producers wanted an audience outside of the usual test screening audiences in New York and Los Angeles, and they figured the largest city in the Midwest would give them a different perspective. This was a tradition that carried on for every <em>Harry Potter</em> movie in the franchise, and fans lucky enough to see these test screenings were usually treated to longer versions of the movies. In the case of <em>The Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em>, they saw nearly 18 extra minutes. Columbus recalled:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;By the time we finished the film and we screened it in Chicago — it’s good luck for us to screen our films in Chicago, so back in the day when we could go to a movie theater we would fly to Chicago and show films to an audience — the audience loved it.

But it&#8217;s Miyazaki&#8217;s son, Goro Miyazaki, who will direct the studio&#8217;s first film in 7 years, and Studio Ghibli&#8217;s first-ever fully CG-animated feature, <strong><em>Earwig and the Witch</em></strong>.

I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. But this first trailer for <strong><em>Earwig and the Witch</em></strong> doesn&#8217;t give me much confidence in Ghibli&#8217;s first foray into 3D animation. The first images from the film already clued us into the film&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/aya-and-the-witch-images-studio-ghibli-cg/\">disappointing</a> art style (it&#8217;s like the filmmakers tried to translate Ghibli&#8217;s signature hand-drawn animation style to 3D and it doesn&#8217;t work), but I was willing to chalk it up to unfinished animation and rendering. But the trailer, which should be as close to the finished product as we&#8217;d get, looks like an un-rendered video game. The lighting is flat, the colors are stale, and the animation just looks bad.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not anti-CG animation in particular, though I have a particular fondness for the hand-drawn animation that Studio Ghibli has helped turn into high art over the decades, and I&#8217;m even intrigued to see the studio (and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/best-foreign-movies-and-tv-streaming-june-28/\">especially Goro Miyazaki</a>, who shows a lot of potential but can&#8217;t seem to find his own style) experiment with their house style beyond Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s big, looming shadow. But after seeing what Marza Animation Planet and TMS Entertainment did with <em>Lupin III: The First</em>, and how director Takashi Yamazaki managed to capture the spirit of the 2D franchise in 3D animation, I feel like Ghibli could do so much better.</p>\n<p><em>Earwig and the Witch</em> was initially set to premiere at this year&#8217;s Cannes Film Festival, where it was part of the official selection, but that premiere was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. But Japanese audiences get to see the film when it airs on NHK in winter 2020, and U.S. audiences soon to follow next year.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Earwig and the Witch</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Growing up in an orphanage, Earwig has no idea that her mother had magical powers. Her life will take a new turn when a strange family takes her in, and she is forced to live with a selfish witch.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Earwig and the Witch</em> will be broadcast on Japan’s NHK general TV in <strong>winter 2020</strong>. It will hit the U.S. sometime in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/earwig-and-the-witch-trailer/\">&#8216;Earwig and the Witch&#8217; Trailer: See Studio Ghibli&#8217;s First CG Animated Feature</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HJQk9hQZ-M8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:00:25 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aya-and-the-witch-1-e1594145398734-700x355.jpg","linkMd5":"86271a183ec41d164850d6708747353d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-31-760_82190dd92ea36a62.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":355,"sourceBytes":23171,"destBytes":11986,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aya-and-the-witch-1-e1594145398734-700x355.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-31-760_82190dd92ea36a62.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn8@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-164_eba8f050a370c1ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HJQk9hQZ-M8:mUbZTzH4908:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn30@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-57-515_9775605d7b265310.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HJQk9hQZ-M8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn55@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-58-629_95061c4664d90a95.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711229},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"‘Euphoria’ Special Episode Streaming Early on HBO Max","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648110","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-648122\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"euphoria special early premiere\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/euphoria-special-episode-trailer/\">trailer</a> for the <strong><em>Euphoria</em></strong> special episode dropped yesterday, and if the brief amount of footage there had you craving more, you&#8217;re in luck! Because HBO Max is dropping the new episode early – on Thursday, <strong>December 3</strong>. The episode will then premiere on HBO on <strong>December 6</strong>. It&#8217;s the first of two special episodes, with one focusing on the holiday season and the other covering COVID-19.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-648110\"></span></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a hip youngster in need of more <em>Euphoria</em>, HBO Max is giving you an early holiday present. The first of two special episodes will air early, on Thursday, December 3. The episode will then debut on HBO on December 6, as previously announced. Most HBO subscribers in the U.S. have access to the HBO Max app as part of their HBO subscription and can visit HBOMax.com for more details.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the episode is about:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the aftermath of being left by Jules at the train station and relapsing, the first special episode follows Rue (played by Emmy-winner <strong>Zendaya</strong>) as she celebrates Christmas. Jules (played by <strong>Hunter Schafer</strong>) will also appear in the episode. Written and directed by series creator Sam Levinson, the first episode, titled &#8220;Trouble Don&#8217;t Last Always,&#8221; also stars <strong>Colman Domingo</strong>, who appeared in season one. The title and date of the second episode are forthcoming. Both special episodes were produced under COVID-19 guidelines.</p></blockquote>\n<p>HBO and Zendaya <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/euphoria-pandemic-episode/\">teased</a> at the special episodes back in October, with HBO president <strong>Casey Bloys</strong> saying a &#8220;special COVID episode&#8221; would air at some point, and Zendaya adding: &#8220;We might end up doing a little bridge episode. I don&#8217;t really know how to describe it, but an episode that we can do with a limited amount of people in a safer environment…so we have something to live on until we are able to go into Season 2.&#8221; But since then the one special episode morphed into two. The COVID episode is still to come – no date has been announced yet, but it will arrive before season 2 of the show.</p>\n<p><em>Euphoria</em> follows &#8220;a group of high school students as they navigate love and friendships in a world of drugs, sex, trauma, and social media,&#8221; and was adapted from the Israeli show of the same name. The American version was created by <strong>Sam Levinson</strong>, who also wrote all the episodes of the first season as well as this new special. There&#8217;s no premiere date for season 2 just yet, but at least fans will have these two specials to hold them over.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/euphoria-special-early-premiere/\">&#8216;Euphoria&#8217; Special Episode Streaming Early on HBO Max</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/OdIoKJQ9jf4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:30:03 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5e6c5c58ac6bcfb04b507475d48ae0ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-31-868_5c24ed2b1cc9fa9a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":29071,"destBytes":16152,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/euphoria-special-early-premiere-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-31-868_5c24ed2b1cc9fa9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn62@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-57-626_18caec220bad3770.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OdIoKJQ9jf4:D9kL6vDQya0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn81@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-57-675_d6daca8d243c187b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/OdIoKJQ9jf4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-58-861_f5700d393ee84415.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711228},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"Here’s What George Lucas Originally Pitched for the Backstory of Anakin Skywalker","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647683","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647695\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/anakin-skywalker-700x297.jpg\" alt=\"anakin skywalker original backstory\" width=\"700\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/anakin-skywalker-700x297.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/anakin-skywalker-360x153.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/anakin-skywalker.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Back in July 1981, few people were privy to the idea that was starting to form in <strong>George Lucas</strong>&#8216; mind: an origin story for the iconic <em>Star Wars</em> villain Darth Vader.

Thus he laid out what we essentially see in 2005&#8217;s <em>The Revenge of the Sith</em>, which chronicles Anakin&#8217;s descent into paranoia at the hands of the manipulative Chancellor Palpatine, and his transformation into the disfigured villain Darth Vader. There are a few differences — Lucas&#8217; original pitch seems to take place over a longer period of time than what occurred in the movie, Anakin&#8217;s wife&#8217;s death takes place after all the action — but otherwise Anakin&#8217;s backstory pretty much stayed the same in the 20-odd years it took to bring it to the big screen.</p>\n<p>Though there is one funny thing to note: Lucas compares Palpatine&#8217;s rise to power and his subversion of the government to Richard Nixon, which is an apt comparison, but definitely one tied to the era in which this conversation took place.</p>\n<p>Here is the full passage detailing Lucas&#8217; pitch during the five-day story conference for <em>Return of the Jedi</em> from <em>The Star Wars Archives: 1995-2005</em>:</p>\n<p><em>Anakin Skywalker began hanging out with the Emperor, who at that point nobody knew was that bad, because he was an elected official. He was a politician. Richard M. Nixon was his name. He subverted the senate and finally took over and he was really evil. But he pretended to be a really nice guy. Luke&#8217;s father gets subverted by the Emperor. He gets a little weird at home and his wife begins to figure out that things are going wrong and she confides in Ben, who is his mentor.</em></p>\n<p><em>On his missions through the galaxies, Anakin has been going off and doing his Jedi thing and a lot of Jedi have been getting killed — and it&#8217;s because they turn their back on him and he cuts them down. The President is turning into the Emperor and Luke&#8217;s mother suspects that something has happened to her husband. She is pregnant. Anakin gets worse and worse, and finally Ben has to fight him and he throws him down into a volcano and Vader is all beat up.</em></p>\n<p><em>When he falls into the put there is hardly anything left of him by the time the Emperor&#8217;s troops fish him out of the drink. Then when Ben finds out that Vader has been fished out and is in the hands of the Empire, he is worried. He goes back to Vader&#8217;s wife and explains that Anakin is the bad guy, the one killing all the Jedi.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mrs. Skywalker has had the kids, the twins, two little babies who are six months old or so. The Skywalker line is very strong with the Force, so Ben says, &#8220;I think we should protect the kids, because they may be able to to help us right the wrong that your husband has created in the universe.&#8221; Ben takes one and gives him to a couple out there on Tatooine and he gets his little hideout in the hills and he watches him grow. Ben can&#8217;t raise Luke himself, because he&#8217;s a wanted man. Leia and Luke&#8217;s mother go to Alderaan and are taken by the king there, who is a friend of Ben&#8217;s. She dies shortly thereafter and Leia is brought up by her foster parents. She knows that her real mother died.</em></p>\n<p><em>I think you can make Ben take the blame for Vader. &#8220;I should have given him more training. I should have sent him to Yoda, but I thought I could be as good a teacher as Yoda. I wish that I could stop the pestilence that I&#8217;ve unleashed on the galaxy.&#8221; His burden is that he feels responsible for everything that Vader has done.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-anakin-skywalker-original-backstory/\">Here&#8217;s What George Lucas Originally Pitched for the Backstory of Anakin Skywalker</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/JDy99FjQTqQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 01:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/anakin-skywalker-700x297.jpg","linkMd5":"c40a96f56470a69d1f1a9aa659952243","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-35-859_f535aab939aed79c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":297,"sourceBytes":35637,"destBytes":21920,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/anakin-skywalker-700x297.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-35-859_f535aab939aed79c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn47@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-57-488_16207062b22d4f05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JDy99FjQTqQ:LOGF-9LcoF0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn49@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-57-668_2c702b64f0bc6e90.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/JDy99FjQTqQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn38@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-57-490_87d77ec86880e7c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711229},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"‘Cherry’, the New Russo Brothers Movie Starring Tom Holland, Will Hit Theaters in February Before Going to Apple TV+ in March","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648134","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-648143\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"cherry release date\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Cherry</em></strong>, the first <strong>Russo Brothers</strong> movie since <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, now has a release date. The pic, which stars <strong>Tom Holland</strong> as an Army vet who becomes a bank robber, will open in theaters in February 2021 before heading to Apple TV+ in March 2021. In addition to Holland, <em>Cherry </em>stars <strong>Ciara Bravo</strong>, <strong>Jack Reynor</strong>, <strong>Michael Rispoli</strong>,<strong> Jeff Wahlberg</strong>, <strong>Forrest Goodluck</strong>, and <strong>Michael Gandolfini</strong>, and is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Nico Walker.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-648134\"></span></p>\n<p>The <em>Cherry</em> release date has finally been revealed. Actually, make that release <em>dates</em>. The movie will first open in theaters on <strong>February 26, 2021</strong>, and then premieres globally on Apple TV+ on <strong>March 12, 2021</strong>. That will also still qualify it for a potential Oscar run, since the Academy Awards expanded the eligibility period for feature films through February 28, 2021.</p>\n<p><em>Cherry</em> &#8220;follows the wild journey of a disenfranchised young man from Ohio who meets the love of his life, only to risk losing her through a series of bad decisions and challenging life circumstances. Inspired by the best-selling novel of the same name, <em>Cherry</em> features Tom Holland in the title role as an unhinged character who drifts from dropping out of college to serving in Iraq as an Army medic and is only anchored by his one true love, Emily (Ciara Bravo). When Cherry returns home a war hero, he battles the demons of undiagnosed PTSD and spirals into drug addiction, surrounding himself with a menagerie of depraved misfits. Draining his finances, Cherry turns to bank robbing to fund his addiction, shattering his relationship with Emily along the way. Brought to the screen in bold, gritty fashion by visionary directors Anthony and Joe Russo, “Cherry” is a darkly humorous, unflinching coming-of-age story of a man on a universal quest for purpose and human connection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film is adapted from the novel of the same name, and the novel is based partially on a true story, as author Nico Walker is indeed an Army vet who served time in prison for bank robbery (he was released in October 2019). Anthony and Joe Russo direct from a script by Angela Russo-Otstot and Jessica Goldberg.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cherry-release-date/\">&#8216;Cherry&#8217;, the New Russo Brothers Movie Starring Tom Holland, Will Hit Theaters in February Before Going to Apple TV+ in March</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3AxpoRzH7XA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 23:00:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"4ef62ff545bb817b2359ff16326a306f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-31-835_deae436f878a61ba.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":37580,"destBytes":23136,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cherry-release-date-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-31-835_deae436f878a61ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-58-859_e7ae214f0f944b97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3AxpoRzH7XA:r_0_ttJ3NOw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn31@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-433_1b6574817352ac1d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3AxpoRzH7XA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn96@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-58-322_a7b561d19cee8a80.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711228},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"Exclusive: Hear a Track From the ‘Half Brothers’ Soundtrack","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648079","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-648081\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/half-brothers-e1606924936611-700x328.jpg\" alt=\"half brothers soundtrack\" width=\"700\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/half-brothers-e1606924936611-700x328.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/half-brothers-e1606924936611-360x169.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/half-brothers-e1606924936611-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/half-brothers-e1606924936611.jpg 780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Half Brothers </em></strong>is something very rare at this point in 2020: a theatrical release.

The new Disney+ film </span><strong><i>Godmothered</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would fall into the “re-imagining” camp; it’s not officially a remake of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cinderella</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the 1950 film that made the concept of the fairy godmother feel like an iconic Disney creation. Instead, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is merely inspired by that film. But this movie is just as inspired by fish-out-of-water high-concept family comedies like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elf</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both of which are a) not streaming on Disney+ and b) much, much, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> funnier, smarter, and more heartwarming.  </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-648057\"></span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stars Jillian Bell as Eleanor, a young, up-and-coming fairy godmother who is horrified to learn that the entire race of fairy godmothers in her home of The Motherland are about to transition into new roles as tooth fairies. It’s for one simple reason: no one has been making requests or wishes of their fairy godmothers on Earth. As a desperate last move, Eleanor sees a letter from a Bostonian girl named Mackenzie, and endeavors to secretly travel to Earth to make her dreams come true. Once in Boston, Eleanor is shocked to learn that Mackenzie (Isla Fisher) has grown up, had two kids, gotten divorced, and found herself in a TV-producing job that’s slowly killing her from the inside. So now it’s up to Eleanor to figure out how to make Mackenzie’s happily ever after come true decades later than expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relative to the other Disney+ original movies you can stream right now, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is&#8230;fine. That barometer is arguably the baseline of the streamer’s original movies, few of which have been genuinely good. (Not coincidentally, the best films Disney+ has premiered so far have been films that were supposed to go to theaters first, such as their summer release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamilton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) Most of what Disney+ has released among its live-action fare is the kind of mid-budget movie that served as the Disney studio’s bread and butter in the 1990s. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even with its connection to the Disney fairy-tale universe, is very much in line with those watchable, wholly unremarkable films. It helps that Jillian Bell and Isla Fisher do their best in predictable roles, but the roles being so predictable is hard to look past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell is particularly committed to playing the hopeful, very sincere, and mostly clueless Eleanor, a far cry from her roles in more adult fare like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 Jump Street</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eastbound and Down</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brittany Runs A Marathon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The problem with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">isn’t Bell at all – for a character like Eleanor, you need an actor who so fully throws themselves into a part that they convince you out of sheer will. Bell does that, following in the footsteps of&#8230;well, Amy Adams in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or Will Ferrell in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elf</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On one hand, there’s nothing wrong with being inspired by those two films – they’re quite good, and they’re bolstered by remarkable lead performances. (Please note that, for all the awards talk surrounding Amy Adams, she should’ve won an Oscar for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Look into your hearts. You know this to be true.) The problem is that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, written by Kari Granlund and Melissa Stack, is so obviously inspired by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elf</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that each plot twist seems to serve as a reminder of those films. There is the idealistic, innocent-to-the-point-of-insanity lead character; there is the hard-bitten straight-man character who must be won over; there’s at least one charming, kewpie-doll-style kid who’s won over instantly; there’s a not-at-all-fun workplace whose denizens will change just a bit after being inspired by our hero. And so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, most of the humor in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fails to rise to a funny enough level to make it easy to forget about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elf</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (At one point on Earth, Eleanor communicates with a fellow godmother played by June Squibb. For&#8230;reasons, Squibb’s face appears in an old grandfather clock, which she explains by snapping, “What, you’ve never heard of Face Time?”) Some movies can coast on the charms of its performers. Certainly, Bell and Fisher have charm to spare, but the material is lifeless enough that it takes these two and the rest of the ensemble to elevate the movie to being just tolerable.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> being so similar to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elf</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is no problem for Disney+, because it’s not like you can stream either of those films on the service. (For anyone asking, “But isn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enchanted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;y’know, a Disney movie?” It sure is! I don’t know why you can’t stream it on Disney+ right now either!) For now, you can simply watch this high-concept comedy, which tries very hard to reclaim the concept of the fairy godmother and a happily-ever-after ending. By the end, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suffers from the same problems many of Disney’s live-action and computer-animated remakes have stumbled across. (Considering that Granlund wrote the 2019 remake of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady and the Tramp</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, maybe this isn’t shocking.) Repeating the past in the 21st century feels antiquated unless you do things differently&#8230;but only </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">somewhat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> differently. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godmothered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tries to be modern, but only at the end, and only after serving as a reminder that you could be watching a much better version of the same kind of story. If only.</span></p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 4 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/godmothered-review/\">&#8216;Godmothered&#8217; Review: Disney&#8217;s Latest is a Merely Okay Retread of &#8216;Enchanted&#8217; and &#8216;Elf&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/0hg96JF_3q4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 17:00:04 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-jillianbell-magic-700x313.jpg","linkMd5":"5aad0afc4f9aa01bb0a639c41d17cb4f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-43-638_656df74cac931d8c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":313,"sourceBytes":21856,"destBytes":11572,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-jillianbell-magic-700x313.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-43-638_656df74cac931d8c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-318_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn59@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-49-02-656_79cea3b308872960.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-59-264_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0hg96JF_3q4:eBjL6z517fE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn12@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-58-446_71e5f7d27afef2e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/0hg96JF_3q4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn21@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-57-379_2c1b296f5f325f31.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963711228},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:31","title":"The Academy Awards Will Not Be Going Virtual for the 2021 Ceremony","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648085","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-621989 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-1-e1592226495961-700x311.jpg\" alt=\"2021 oscars date\" width=\"700\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-1-e1592226495961-700x311.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-1-e1592226495961-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-1-e1592226495961-768x342.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>A few months ago, the 72nd Primetime Emmys ceremony went virtual with television&#8217;s biggest stars and creators checking into the live broadcast virtually from their homes and various locations. But when the <strong>93rd Academy Awards</strong> come around in April next year, the Academy of Motion Arts and Sciences won&#8217;t be making the ceremony virtual. A representative from the Academy and hosting network ABC stated: &#8220;The Oscars in-person telecast will happen.&#8221;<span id=\"more-648085\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/oscars-in-person-show-will-happen-2021-1234843255/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> has news on the 2021 Oscars ceremony opting out of a virtual ceremony, despite the coronavirus still looming large in the United States and having a huge impact on every facet of Hollywood operations. But the ceremony was pushed back to <strong>April 25, 2021</strong>, around the time that a vaccine will likely have been made available, so the risk of having an in-person ceremony could be far less worrisome than it would be in the current state.</p>\n<p>At the same time, not everyone will be ready to take the risk of packing the 3,400-seat Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, no matter how less dangerous the pandemic might be in the spring. And it sounds like the Academy is anticipating that as an awards publicist told Variety, &#8220;The Academy has done a walkthrough of the Dolby recently to see all the multiple options.&#8221; So maybe we&#8217;ll see far less people in the theater for the ceremony spread out in a socially distanced manner. But even then, there will undoubtedly be some stars who won&#8217;t feel safe in such a gathering.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still too early to know for sure what safety protocols will be in place for the ceremony, but that&#8217;s why the Academy is figuring this stuff out now. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s necessary for the ceremony to be in-person, but I&#8217;m betting the Academy wants some semblance of normalcy for Hollywood&#8217;s biggest night after a year that was anything but normal.</p>\n<p>As for the other major awards ceremonies leading up to the Oscars, those details are still being worked out too. The Golden Globes, slated for February 28, said the ceremony would air live from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler returning to host. But it&#8217;s not clear how that event will unfold since the Hollywood Foreign Press Association did not provide any comment on the ceremony. Meanwhile, the Screen Actors Guild Awards set for March 14 are still considering &#8220;a variety of options&#8221; and SAG-AFTRA is &#8220;working to create an entertaining and safe show for all of our nominees.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of time for the details for these awards ceremonies to be ironed out, especially for the Academy Awards. We&#8217;ll be sure to keep you posted as new information becomes available.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2021-oscars-ceremony-wont-be-virtual/\">The Academy

Some movies originally intended for release early next year have already shifted to later in the year, such as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ghostbusters-afterlife-release-date-delayed-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em></a> and the Aretha Franklin biopic <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/aretha-franklin-biopic-respect-and-rumble-delayed-tomb-raider-pulled-from-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Respect</em></a>, but studios are considering sending some releases from the first quarter of 2021 to streaming, such as the live-action/animated hybrid <strong><em>Tom and Jerry</em></strong> and the previously delayed <strong><em>Kingsman</em></strong> franchise prequel <strong><em>The King&#8217;s Man</em></strong>.<span id=\"more-648053\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/coronavirus-movie-theaters-release-dates-1234842520/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> has a whole story on the state of theatrical distribution as the coronavirus pandemic continues to get worse in the United States, forcing the tightening of restrictions in some states and continuing to keep people away from movie theaters. Even the Thanksgiving weekend box office was dismal despite the sea of travelers ignoring advice from the Center for Disease Control. And for anyone who though the first months of 2021 would see things getting a little bit back to normal for movie theaters, think again.</p>\n<p>In the wake of <em><strong>Wonder Woman 1984</strong></em> striking a deal that will see it released simultaneously in theaters and streaming on HBO Max <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">starting on Christmas Day</a>, it sounds like Warner Bros. Pictures is considering doing the same with a few of their upcoming theatrical releases for early 2021.</p>\n<p>First up, there&#8217;s the thriller <strong><em>The Little Things</em></strong> starring <strong>Denzel Washington</strong>. The movie from <em>The Blind Side</em> and <em>The Founder</em> director <strong>John Lee Hancock</strong> is currently slated for release in theaters on <strong>January 29, 2021</strong>. Then we have <em><strong>Tom and Jerry</strong></em> slated for <strong>March 5, 2021</strong>, and the biographical drama <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/judas-and-the-black-messiah-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em></strong></a> with <strong>Daniel Kaluuya</strong> and <strong>Lakeith Stanfield</strong>, which currently doesn&#8217;t have a set release date. All three of those movies are being considered for potential hybrid releases in theaters and on HBO Max.</p>\n<p>Just last weekend we heard <strong><em>Godzilla vs Kong</em></strong> is in the mix to spark a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/godzilla-vs-kong-streaming-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">potential streaming deal at HBO Max</a>, a much bigger movie than the aforementioned releases that Warner Bros. Pictures is considering for streaming. Apparently the studio also considered doing the same with the upcoming <strong><em>Mortal Kombat</em></strong> movie, but they&#8217;ve decided to hold it back for a full-on theatrical release without a streaming option to go along with it.</p>\n<p>Warner Bros. Pictures isn&#8217;t the only studio considering more streaming releases either. Disney&#8217;s 20th Century Studios could also have two of their releases end up on streaming. The <em>Kingsman: The Secret Service</em> prequel <strong><em>The King&#8217;s Man</em></strong> has a theatrical date of <strong>February 12, 2021</strong>, and the coming-of-age drag queen musical <em><strong>Everyone&#8217;s Talking About Jamie</strong></em> is set for release on <strong>February 26, 2021</strong>. Apparently there are discussions about sending those movies to streaming, with the musical likely heading to Disney+ and <em>The King&#8217;s Man</em> potentially arriving on Hulu.</p>\n<p>It might seem like a no-brainer to release some of these movies on streaming instead of theaters, but studios have a lot of things to consider outside of box office. Contracts with directors, major movies stars or producers where box office can impact bonuses can make shifting a release to streaming more complicated. Plus, studios have international theatrical deals that they&#8217;re contractually beholden to, and some filmmakers aren&#8217;t keen on pushing back the release in the United States to align with the global release, mostly due to piracy concerns and the need to have two separate marketing campaigns at two different times. But these are unprecedented times, and concessions will be made, but we&#8217;ll have to wait and see how these potential streaming deals play out.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-kings-mand-and-tom-and-jerry-movie-streaming-release-could-be-happening/\">&#8216;Tom and Jerry&#8217; and Other Warner Bros.

The library will feature over 55,000 episodes from over 2,500 shows from across Discovery, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, OWN, Travel Channel, and Animal Planet, not to mention programs from A&#38;E, History Channel and Lifetime, as well as BBC’s Natural History collection. That&#8217;s a hell of a lot of non-fiction programing.<span id=\"more-648093\"></span></p>\n<p>Discovery announced the discovery+ streaming service today, but it won&#8217;t launch until January 4, 2021. The new service will have an ad-supported version that will cost $4.99 per month, and there will be an ad-free version available for $6.99 per month. Each subscription will allow users to have up to five different profiles and four concurrent streams, which isn&#8217;t a bad deal considering how limiting other streaming services can be at that price point. If you&#8217;re a Verizon customer, you&#8217;ll get a chance to try discovery+ for 12 months before you have to start paying for it.</p>\n<p>The programming from discovery+ will bring all your favorite shows from Discovery, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, OWN, Travel Channel, and Animal Planet. You&#8217;ll be able to soak up hours of shows from the <strong>Irwins</strong>, <strong>Jonathan and Drew Scott</strong>, <strong>Chip and Joanna Gaines</strong>, <strong>Bobby Flay</strong>, <strong>Ree Drummond</strong>, <strong>Guy Fieri</strong>, <strong>Giada De Laurentiis</strong>, <strong>Lieutenant Joe Kenda</strong> and many more.</p>\n<p>discovery+ will also include early access to new shows from Chip and Joanna Gaines, such as their forthcoming new iteration of <strong><em>Fixer Upper: Welcome Home</em></strong>, the upcoming cooking show <strong><em>Magnolia Table with Joanna Gaines</em></strong>, the documentary <strong><em>Courage to Run</em></strong>, which chronicles a fortuitous meeting that inspired Chip to train for and complete his first marathon, and more.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, content from A&#38;E will include such reality favorites as <strong><em>The First 48</em></strong>, <strong><em>Bring It</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dance Moms</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ice Road Truckers</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pawn Stars</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ancient Aliens</em></strong>, <strong><em>Storage Wars</em></strong>, <strong><em>60 Days In</em></strong>, <strong><em>Intervention</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ghost Hunters</em></strong>. And BBC’s Natural History collection will include <strong><em>Planet Earth</em></strong>, <strong><em>Blue Planet</em></strong>, and <em><strong>Frozen Planet</strong>,</em> as well as the all-new nature documentary series <strong><em>A Perfect Planet</em></strong>, narrated by <strong>Sir David Attenborough</strong> and created by the executive producer of <em>Planet Earth </em>and <em>The Hunt</em>.</p>\n<p>But discovery+ won&#8217;t just be home to library content from all those channels. They&#8217;ll also have an entire slate of originals that will make up over 1,000 hours of content in the service&#8217;s first year. They announced an entire slate of original shows on the way, including tons of programs for all the <em><strong>90-Day Fiancé</strong></em> fans out there. You can see the entire list below and see if there&#8217;s anything for you to get excited about when the library launches in January 2021.</p>\n<p>Internationally, discovery+ will include a massive library of local-language content, as well as a slate of live sports, across more than 25 key markets in 2021, including the Nordics, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Latin American markets, and a later launch in Brazil and in parts of Asia.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of all the original programming expected to be exclusively available on discovery+ throughout 2021:</p>\n<h2>Love and Relationships</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>90 Day Bares All</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Get ready for your favorite <em>90 Day</em> couples to bare it all &#8211; the lies, the secrets and everything we couldn’t show on TV.
