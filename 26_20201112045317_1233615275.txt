Founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tadeoyerinde?lang=en\">Tade Oyerinde</a> in 2018, Campuswire is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/campuswire-launches-to-redesign-classroom-communications/\">virtual solution</a> for any teacher who wants to digitize their internal classroom communications, from Q&#38;A time to the lecture itself.</p>\n<p>The strategy, for the most part, has worked. Campuswire is now used at more than 300 universities among 200,000 students, Oyerinde tells me.</p>\n<p>While Campuswire’s pitch was set to boom overnight, the founder instead saw a bigger challenge approaching: more competition. As professors moved online, lectures <a href=\"https://zoom.us/education\">moved to Zoom</a> or tools <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/\">built atop of Zoom</a>. Microsoft Teams and Google Hangouts filled in the gap for classrooms that couldn’t afford fancy licenses. Campuswire’s key monetization strategy, which was selling pro licenses for its online class software, felt threatened by alternatives.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>So, after months of iterating, Campuswire has adapted its monetization strategy and today announced that it is launching live courses taught by professors. Instead of solely working with professors to streamline internal class communications, Campuswire will now help teachers produce classes that students can then take for a fee. The tuition revenue will be split between the teacher and Campuswire.</p>\n<p>Campuswire courses kick off with an angel investing class taught by Charles Hudson, the founder and general partner of Precursor Ventures. Hudson lectures at Stanford occasionally, and working with Campuswire allows him to teach a broader set of students.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Campuswire software will be free to use starting in January 2021.</p>\n<p>The move marks Campuswire’s further dive into synchronous learning. Campuswire’s model is built on how existing classrooms work in universities and colleges. Classes on Campuswire are capped at 500 to promote conversation, and large lectures are supplemented with teacher assistant (TA) classes to hammer home confusing concepts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, it’s clear amid the pandemic that asynchronous learning has its perks (students can learn on their own schedule, while educators are able to work more flexible hours). Still, Oyerinde thinks a pre-recorded format is not effective for pedagogy purposes.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3f7DFcCLcX\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/\">Teachers are leaving schools.

It’s the reason why MOOCs, or massive open online course providers, only have a 2-3% completion rate on their courses, he argues.</p>\n<p>At its core, Campuswire has evolved from a platform trying to compete with Zoom to a platform that is trying to compete with these MOOCS through engaging content taught by experienced professors. Its main differentiation from MOOCs is that it&#8217;s live and has teacher assistants.</p>\n<p>There are a number of startups that are trying to create engaging, celebrity professor-taught classes through hybrid plays. MasterClass, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/masterclass-just-raised-100-million-for-celebrity-fueled-content/\">just raised $100 million</a> a few months ago, sells entertainment and education in one go, offering cooking classes from Gordon Ramsay and tennis lessons from Serena Williams.

Indeed, he says that when he announced he was <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dropbox-boasted-solid-results-but-its-cfos-departure-is-worrisome-2020-08-07\">leaving Dropbox</a> in early August to join the world of venture capital, he didn&#8217;t know where he would land. He instead &#8220;wanted my intentions out there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was an effective tactic, from the sounds of things. Vashee hints that he talked with numerous firms, deciding that later-stage IVP was the best fit for a variety of reasons, including experience he&#8217;d gained at Dropbox helping to navigate the company through multiple stages of growth, including both as a private and then a public company.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Vashee also had experience working with IVP, which led Dropbox&#8217;s Series B round, and he says he saw firsthand the value the firm brings to a deal. &#8220;They helped us build our board, they were a sounding board for so many strategic decisions and always hustled for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As an added bonus, he isn&#8217;t starting until January, giving him a little extra time to spend with his extended family in the Bay Area and, most importantly, with his young daughters, ages 4 and 1.</p>\n<p>Vashee, who attended Columbia and headed to Morgan Stanley as an analyst right out of college, first fell in love with venture during his second job, which was as a senior associate with NEA, where he spent four years. &#8220;I absolutely loved investing and wasn&#8217;t planning to leave to join a company, but the opportunity to join Dropbox came up, and, knowing that I ultimately wanted to build a career as an investor, it if felt like something I couldn&#8217;t pass up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Though a generalist at NEA, Vashee says he will be focused on enterprise software &#8212; including companies focused on collaboration and finance automation &#8212; at IVP.</p>\n<p>Vashee has already made some personal bets in the area, including investing in startups <a href=\"https://getmetronome.com/\">Metronome</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mosaic.tech/\">Mosaic</a> and <a href=\"https://golayer.io/\">Layer</a>.</p>\n<p>He suggests that he&#8217;ll also be spending a lot more time thinking about the going-public process, now that many choices are on the table in addition to traditional IPOs. Interestingly, he says that if he were taking Dropbox public today, an option like a direct listing is something he&#8217;d want to evaluate.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, he says a handful of IVP partners serve on the boards of companies that are right now evaluating tie-ups with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, too.</p>\n<p>In either case, he stresses that companies eyeing the public market need to be prepared, noting that the &#8220;operational readiness and rigor&#8221; that was instilled at Dropbox has proved &#8220;invaluable&#8221; to the company. Adds Vashee, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the IPO process is broken, but has room for improvement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>IVP announced its last fund &#8212; its biggest to date &#8212; in September 2017, closing at the time on $1.5 billion in capital. Given that three years have elapsed and that fund sizes have only continued to balloon, and that new partners are usually brought in just before a new fund closes, the firm appears poised to announce an even bigger vehicle any day now.</p>\n<p>One of the firm&#8217;s highest-profile investors, Todd Chaffee, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/longtime-vc-todd-chaffee-of-ivp-says-late-stage-scene-is-now-ma-world/\">already said</a> that he won&#8217;t be actively investing in that new fund, following

</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What does President-elect Biden’s victory mean for U.S. immigration and immigration reform? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>I’m in tech in SF and have a lot of friends who are immigrant founders, along with many international teammates at my tech company. What can we look forward to?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>—Anticipation in Albany</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Anticipation,</p>\n<p>Glimpsing into my crystal ball, I see opportunity ahead. President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris have long stood committed to important immigration changes that will directly affect the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they&#8217;ve never seen it before.</em></p>\n<p>&#8212; Kamala Harris</p></blockquote>\n<p>We’re appreciative of what’s to come. As my firm’s mission is to transcend borders, expand opportunity and connect the world by practicing compassionate, visionary and expert immigration law in service of the betterment of humanity, we’re looking forward to a deluge of immigration changes that will support our clients as well as innovation and entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley and beyond. Please <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1516050298124/WN_PAPab_RYQ2SjteikBn-aow\">join me tomorrow</a> for a free webinar as we take a look at what’s ahead for U.S. immigration in 2020, what these important developments mean for Silicon Valley, for startup founder immigration, and for recruiting, hiring and retaining top talent.</p>\n<p>I’m confident we’ll see meaningful changes in immigration for startups, founders, investors, researchers, highly skilled professionals, students, Dreamers and families under the Biden administration.

So the legal uncertainty around EU-US transfers is set to stretch well into next year at a minimum. (<a href=\"https://pro.politico.eu/news/joe-biden-win-kicks-us-eu-privacy-deal-into-long-grass\">Politico</a> suggests a new data deal isn&#8217;t likely in the first half of 2021.)</p>\n<p>In the meanwhile, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints/\">legal challenges</a> to ongoing EU-US transfers are stacking up &#8212; at the same time as EU regulators know they have a legal duty to intervene when data is at risk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Standard contractual clauses and other transfer tools mentioned under Article 46 GDPR do not operate in a vacuum,&#8221; the EDPB warns in an executive summary. &#8220;The Court states that controllers or processors, acting as exporters, are responsible for verifying, on a case-by-case basis and, where appropriate, in collaboration with the importer in the third country, if the law or practice of the third country impinges on the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards contained in the Article 46 GDPR transfer tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In those cases, the Court still leaves open the possibility for exporters to implement supplementary measures that fill these gaps in the protection and bring it up to the level required by EU law. The Court does not specify which measures these could be. However, the Court underlines that exporters will need to identify them on a case-by-case basis. This is in line with the principle of accountability of Article 5.2 GDPR, which requires controllers to be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles relating to processing of personal data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The EDPB&#8217;s recommendations set out a series of steps for data exporters to take as they go through the complex task of determining whether their particular transfer can play nice with EU data protection law.</p>\n<h2>Six steps but no one-size-fits-all fix</h2>\n<p>The basic overview of the process it&#8217;s advising is: <strong>Step 1)</strong> map all intended international transfers; <strong>step 2)</strong> verify the transfer tools you want to use; <strong>step 3)</strong> assess whether there&#8217;s anything in the law/practice of the destination third country which &#8220;may impinge on the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards of the transfer tools you are relying on, in the context of your specific transfer&#8221;, as it puts it; <strong>step 4)</strong> identify and adopt supplementary measure/s to bring the level of protection up to &#8216;essential equivalent&#8217; with EU law; <strong>step 5)</strong> take any formal procedural steps required to adopt the supplementary measure/s; <strong>step 6)</strong> periodically re-evaluate the level of data protection and monitor any relevant developments.</p>\n<p>In short, this is going to involve both a lot of work &#8212; and ongoing work. tl;dr: Your duty to watch over the safety of European users&#8217; data is never done.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the EDPB makes it clear that there very well may not be <em>any</em> supplementary measures to cover a particular transfer in legal glory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You may ultimately find that no supplementary measure can ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection for your specific transfer,&#8221; it warns. &#8220;In those cases where no supplementary measure is suitable, you must avoid, suspend or terminate the transfer to avoid compromising the level of protection of the personal data. You should also conduct this assessment of supplementary measures with due diligence and document it.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"epZuhO914n\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling/\">Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling/embed/#?secret=epZuhO914n\" data-secret=\"epZuhO914n\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In instances where supplementary measures <em>could</em> suffice the EDPB says they may have &#8220;a contractual, technical or organisational nature&#8221; &#8212; or, indeed, a combination of some or all of those.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Combining diverse measures in a way that they support and build on each other may enhance the level of protection and may therefore contribute to reaching EU standards,&#8221; it suggests.</p>\n<p>However it also goes on to state fairly plainly that technical measures are likely to be the most robust tool against the threat posed by foreign surveillance. But that in turn means there are necessarily limits on the business models that can tap in &#8212; anyone wanting to decrypt and process data for themselves in the US, for instance, (hi Facebook!) isn&#8217;t going to find much comfort here.</p>\n<p>The guidance goes on to include some sample scenarios where it suggests supplementary measures <em>might</em> suffice to render an international transfer legal.</p>\n<p>Such as data storage in a third country where there&#8217;s no access to decrypted data at the destination and keys are held by the data exporter (or by a trusted entity in the EEA or in a third country that&#8217;s considered to have an adequate level of protection for data); or the transfer of pseudonymised data &#8212; so individuals can no longer be identified (which means ensuring data cannot be reidentified); or end-to-end encrypted data transiting third countries via encrypted transfer (again data must not be able to be decrypted in a jurisdiction that lacks adequate protection; the EDPB also specifies that the existence of any &#8216;backdoors&#8217; in hardware or software must have been ruled out, although it&#8217;s not clear how that could be done).</p>\n<p>Another section of the document discusses scenarios in which <em>no</em> effective supplementary measures could be found &#8212; such as transfers to cloud service providers (or similar) which require access to the data in the clear and where &#8220;the power granted to public authorities of the recipient country to access the transferred data goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Again, this is a bit of the document that looks very bad for Facebook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPB is, considering the current state of the art, incapable of envisioning an effective technical measure to prevent that access from infringing on data subject rights,&#8221; it writes on that, adding that it &#8220;does not rule out that further technological development may offer measures that achieve the intended business purposes, without requiring access in the clear&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the given scenarios, where unencrypted personal data is technically necessary for the provision of the service by the processor, transport encryption and data-at-rest encryption even taken together, do not constitute a supplementary measure that ensures an essentially equivalent level of protection if the data importer is in possession of the cryptographic keys,&#8221; the EDPB further notes.</p>\n<p>It also makes it clear that supplementary contractual clauses aren&#8217;t any kind of get-out on this front &#8212; so, no, Facebook can&#8217;t stick a clause in its SCCs that defuses FISA 702 &#8212; with the EDPB writing: &#8220;Contractual measures will not be able to rule out the application of the legislation of a third country which does not meet the EDPB European Essential Guarantees standard in those cases in which the legislation obliges importers to comply with the orders to disclose data they receive from public authorities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The EDPB does discuss examples of potential clauses data exporters could use to supplement SCCs, depending on the specifics of their data flow situation &#8212; alongside specifying &#8220;conditions for effectiveness&#8221; (or ineffectiveness in many cases, really). And, again, there&#8217;s cold comfort here for those wanting to process personal data in the US (or another third country) while it remains at risk from state surveillance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The exporter could add annexes to the contract with information that the importer would provide, based on its best efforts, on the access to data by public authorities, including in the field of intelligence provided the legislation complies with the EDPB European Essential Guarantees, in the destination country. This might help the data exporter to meet its obligation to document its assessment of the level of protection in the third country,&#8221; the EDPB suggests in one example from a section of the guidance discussing transparency obligations.</p>\n<p>However the point of such a clause would be for the data exporter to put up-front conditions on an importer to make it easier for them to avoid getting into a risky contract in the first place &#8212; or help them with suspending/terminating a contract if a risk is determined &#8212; rather than providing any kind of legal sticking plaster for mass surveillance. Aka: &#8220;This obligation can however neither justify the importer’s disclosure of personal data nor give rise to the expectation that there will be no further access requests,&#8221; as the EDPB warns.</p>\n<p>Another example discussed in the document is the viability of adding clauses to try to get the importer to certify there&#8217;s no backdoors in their systems which could put the data at risk.</p>\n<p>However the EDPB warns this may just be useless, writing: &#8220;The existence of legislation or government policies preventing importers from disclosing this information may render this clause ineffective.&#8221; So the example could just be being included to try to kneecap dodgy legal advice that suggests contract clauses are a panacea for US surveillance overreach.</p>\n<p>The EDPB&#8217;s full guidance can be found <a href=\"https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also reached out to Facebook to ask what next steps it&#8217;ll be taking over its EU-US data transfers in light of the EDPB guidance and will update this report with any response. <strong>Update:</strong> Facebook has now sent this statement: &#8220;The CJEU ruled that Standard Contractual Clauses are a valid legal mechanism for the transfer of data from the EU, including to the US. We note that new guidelines on supplementary measures have been submitted for consultation and, like many other companies, will be reviewing them carefully.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"UqgME289bo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/\">Max Schrems on the EU court ruling that could cut Facebook in two</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Max Schrems on the EU court ruling that could cut Facebook in two&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/embed/#?secret=UqgME289bo\" data-secret=\"UqgME289bo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Un_6nnbXK38\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 17:38:10 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b9bd6dad207340a8afc878e3b6fcfb56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Lomas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-439_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-505_9553a6a685f441bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Un_6nnbXK38:3E9g7sXgqFg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn67@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-595_2d4d99a7bbe9c158.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-581_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Un_6nnbXK38":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-544_39d15c131c4da004.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156591256},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","title":"London and SF have become Impact Tech hubs, with 280% increase in VC in 5 years","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2072867","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">New research has found that San Francisco and London have become two of the world’s leading hubs for VC investment into tech solutions that address one or more of the 17 <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">UN’s Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDG), more commonly referred to as &#8220;Impact Tech&#8221;.

More than 5,000 startups were surveyed to create the data.</p>\n<p>According to the research, VC investment into London-based impact tech startups has grown by almost 800% (7.8 times) since 2015, compared to 3.1 times in Europe as a whole. 2020 is set to be a record year for London’s impact tech companies, which have received $1.2 billion in VC investment from January to October, already matching 2019 levels. London’s impact firms have also secured 429 deals between 2015 and 2020, more than any other city globally.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WHLz88WQg7\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/gousto-a-uk-meal-kit-service-raises-another-41m-as-business-booms-under-lockdown/\">Gousto, a UK meal-kit service, raises another $41M as business booms under lockdown</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Gousto, a UK meal-kit service, raises another $41M as business booms under lockdown&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/gousto-a-uk-meal-kit-service-raises-another-41m-as-business-booms-under-lockdown/embed/#?secret=WHLz88WQg7\" data-secret=\"WHLz88WQg7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>San Francisco’s impact-based tech companies have also shown strong growth over the past five years, with the data revealing that VC investment into its impact tech companies has almost tripled (2.8 times) from 2015 to 2020. So far this year, SF-based impact tech companies attracted $1.7 billion of VC investment in 2020 &#8212; more than any other city globally. At a national level, the United States received more VC funding for impact tech companies than any other country in the past five years, with investors pumping $35.8 billion into U.S. firms since 2015, double the amount invested into China ($16.8 billion) and the United Kingdom ($6.1 billion).</p>\n<p>The research also found that the U.K. capital has produced 241 impact startups since 2006, with 95 companies founded in San Francisco. In London, &#8220;impact unicorns&#8221; include Octopus Energy (green energy), Arrival (zero-emission, public transportation vehicles), Gousto (food) and Babylon Health (AI health tech).</p>\n<p>Climate change and clean energy solutions have attracted the most interest from investors in both cities, making up over 50% of overall VC investment over the last five years. Funding rounds including at least one North American investor made up $234 million of VC investment so far this year in London, up from $85 million in 2018, and equating to a fifth of all VC investment into London’s impact startups.</p>\n<p>Funding rounds for London impact companies involving North American investors in 2020 include a $118 million growth equity round into Arrival by BlackRock, an $80 million Series B round for COMPASS Pathways and a $25 million Series C funding for Tractable.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FsLNhB6fO5\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/tractable-claims-25m-to-sell-damage-assessing-ais-to-more-insurance-giants/\">Tractable claims $25M to sell damage-assessing AIs to more insurance giants</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Tractable claims $25M to sell damage-assessing AIs to more insurance giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/tractable-claims-25m-to-sell-damage-assessing-ais-to-more-insurance-giants/embed/#?secret=FsLNhB6fO5\" data-secret=\"FsLNhB6fO5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, impact startups are crossing the pond in both directions. Arrival is now operating in Los Angeles, while Octopus Energy launched in the U.S. market in September after closing a $360 million funding round in April and acquiring Silicon Valley-based startup Evolve Energy. And San Francisco-based Allbirds, the sustainable shoe retailer, opened its first European flagship store in London in July 2018.</p>\n<p>Commenting, Janet Coyle, managing director for business, London &#38; Partners said: “San Francisco and London are two of the world’s top hubs for innovation and technology.

However, more options will follow, including a base version that will have a smaller range of at least 250 miles and a price below $67,000.</p>\n<p>Information on the three editions and their accompanying equipment packages, paint options and pricing is just a few of the <a href=\"https://stories.rivian.com/time-to-build\">numerous details</a> released Wednesday on Rivian&#8217;s website. Perhaps one of the more notable tidbits include the addition of cheaper base version of the pickup and SUV, the official inclusion of the camp kitchen accessory and confirmation that a battery pack capable of more than 400 miles will be offered at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>Rivian, which has attracted investment from the likes of Ford, Amazon, funds managed by BlackRock, T. Rowe Price and Associates and Cox Automotive, is aiming to become the first to bring an EV pickup truck to market. But it&#8217;s facing competition from legacy automakers such as GM as well as Tesla, which says it will start production of its futuristic looking Cybertruck in late 2021. Ford is also planning to bring an all-electric F-150 pickup truck to market in 2022.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2072899\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rivian-c.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2072899\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2072899 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rivian-c.gif\" alt=\"rivian interior gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2072899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rivian</p></div></p>\n<p>Deliveries of the first and, so far, most expensive version of the pickup truck called the Launch edition will begin in June 2021. The Launch edition of the RT1 truck will start at $75,000 (that&#8217;s before federal tax incentives are applied) and be able to travel more than 300 miles on the standard battery. The Launch edition will also have a special paint color called &#8220;Launch Green&#8221; along with other special badging and 20-inch all-terrain or 22-inch sport wheel upgrades included.</p>\n<p>Tho other packages — the Adventure and Explore — will be offered for the RT1 truck and the R1S SUV. All of these versions will have more than 300 miles of range. The big differences come in the finishes. The Launch and Adventure editions, for instance, come standard with an off-road upgrade with reinforced underbody shield, dual front bumper tow hooks and air compressor as well as &#8220;compass yellow&#8221; interior accents, 100% recycled microfiber headliner and &#8220;Chilewich floor mats.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The various pickup truck editions range between $75,000 and $67,500 in price. The R1S SUV prices range between $77,500 and $70,000. And all of these editions will arrive in the marketplace at different times between June 2021 and into January 2022.</p>\n<p>Customers who place pre-orders now, which requires a $1,000 deposit, will have access to a configurator November 16. Everyone else will have access to the configurator, which allows customers to pick the paint color, equipment package and other details, on November 23.</p>\n<p>The bigger 400-plus mile battery will come to the pickup truck first, starting in January 2022, according to Rivian. A longer range R1S SUV with both five- and seven-passenger seating will be announced following start of production, the company said on its website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-5.54.18-PM.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2072900

moment? The firm is well-known for its investments into SaaS and cloud companies, a key startup cohort that has performed well. Recent days have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/\">shaken that narrative as Q4 races to the halfway mark</a>, with public investors seeming to rotate into other equities, punishing software firms that had been the market&#8217;s favored bet for most of the year.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll dig into what&#8217;s changing on the private side of that coin, looking to understand today&#8217;s software venture capital dynamics, and what Deeter sees happening in 2021.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s more to Bessemer&#8217;s active portfolio than SaaS.

One key example of that has been Facebook, which has added more tools to Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram to make the apps more useful to businesses that want not just to market themselves to customers, but to use the apps to handle questions from them, and potentially sell things to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Although Snap may be interested in Voca.ai simply as a way to build better interactions with its own customers &#8212; it registered a 52% growth in revenues this past quarter (<a href=\"https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2020/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Financial%20Highlights&#38;text=Revenue%20increased%2052%25%20to%20%24679,million%20in%20the%20prior%20year.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Q3</a>), and $679 million in business is nothing to sniff at &#8212; it&#8217;s a natural and logical move for it to consider how it could build more business services into Snapchat, and diversify its own revenues along with that. </span></p>\n<p>In its home page for its business services, the company notes that &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">People use Snapchat to communicate with friends, build relationships, play and learn.

just for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, they could just mislead mom or dad by saying they are helping them set up the new Alexa device, and &#8212; o<em>h, can I borrow your phone to confirm something for the setup?</em> (Or some other such deception.)</p>\n<p>A more appropriate option to protect user privacy would be to have Alexa periodically ask the loved one if they were still okay with the Care Hub monitoring option being enabled, and to alert the loved one via the Alexa mobile app that a monitoring option was still turned on.</p>\n<p>Of course, there may certainly be older adults who appreciate the ability to be connected to family in this way, especially if they are located at a distance from their family or are feeling isolated due to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing requirements that&#8217;s keeping family members from being able to visit.</p>\n<p>Amazon says Care Hub is rolling out in the U.S. The company notes it will learn from customer feedback to expand the feature set over time.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HmFwcri6TBQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 17:36:18 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-12.28.09-PM.jpg?w=680","linkMd5":"39fcf46c2d81b2259ab45bebd7f50c1a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-49-54-589_73eaaca45c08fae7.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":336,"sourceBytes":18470,"destBytes":18470,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-12.28.09-PM.jpg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-49-54-589_73eaaca45c08fae7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-439_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn87@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-51-59-631_8319dd13de1a774b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HmFwcri6TBQ:pQkrxPeA_aM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-51-58-629_9656afca87661222.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-581_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HmFwcri6TBQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn92@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-51-59-528_8148ae16c2abbcaf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156591250},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","title":"Facebook extends its temporary ban on political ads for another month","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2072646","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The election is settled, but the nation is far from it.</p>\n<p>Before Election Day in the U.S., <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> hit pause on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/facebook-to-block-new-political-ads-1-week-before-nov-3-adds-more-tools-and-rules-for-fair-elections/\">all political and social issue ads</a>.

The service, now merged haphazardly with YouTube Music, recalled the early days of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> when they sometimes just made cool internet things. It made it nearly a decade, though — pretty impressive for a one of their products.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll just say it up front: I&#8217;m a lifelong music pirate. Oh yes, I&#8217;ve reformed in recent years, but I&#8217;ve got a huge library of tracks that I&#8217;ve cultivated for decades and don&#8217;t plan to abandon any time soon (likewise you can pry Winamp from my cold, dead hands). So <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/google-music-opening-for-everyone-features-full-song-sharing-to-google/\">when Google announced back in 2011</a> I could stream it all to myself for free, it sounded too good to be true.</p>\n<p>And indeed it was a relic of the old Google, which was quite simply all about taking things that are difficult to do yourself (find things online, set up a new email address, collaborate on a spreadsheet) and make them easier.</p>\n<p>Google Music — as we&#8217;ll call it despite it having gone through several branding changes before the final indignity of being merged into another, worse service as a presumably short-lived tab — was not first to the music-streaming or downloading world by a long shot, but its promise of being able to upload your old music files and access them anywhere as if they were emails or documents was a surprisingly generous one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-312269\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"997\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg 997w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Generous not just in that it was providing server space for 20,000 songs (!) for free and the infrastructure for serving those songs where you went, but in its acknowledgement of other models of owning media. It didn&#8217;t judge you for having 20,000 MP3s — they weren&#8217;t subjected to some kind of legitimacy check, and they didn&#8217;t report you to the RIAA for having them, though they certainly could have.</p>\n<p>No, Google Music&#8217;s free media locker was the company, or at least a quorum of the product team, announcing that <em>they get it</em>: not everyone does everything the same way, and not everyone is ready to embrace whatever business model tech companies decide makes sense. (Notably it has shifted several times more since then.)</p>\n<p>Though my perennial work frenemy at the time MG Siegler <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/10/google-music-beta/\">was not impressed</a> with the beta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/dont-be-too-disappointed-by-google-musics-lackluster-debut/\">I vigorously defended it</a>, noting that Google was starting simple and looking forward rather then trying to beat Apple at their own game. Plus, secretly, I was feverishly uploading a hundred gigs of music I&#8217;d gotten from Audiogalaxy, Napster, and SoulSeek. Here, I thought, was a bridge between my antiquarian habits and the cutting edge of tech.</p>\n<p>Since then, like the resentfully loving owner of a junker, over the years I&#8217;ve been frustrated by Google Music in the ways that only one who truly relies on something can be. The app became essential to me even as its ever-changing and confusing interface confounded me. As Google&#8217;s media strategy and offerings fluctuated and blurred, my uploaded music sat there quietly, doing the same thing it did at launch: hosting my music files. Whatever it did in addition to that, it still let me access the glitchy, 128kbps version of The Bends I downloaded in 2001. I also had the security of knowing if my many drives died in a fire, I could at least recover my precious MP3s.</p>\n<p>Whether I&#8217;d ripped it myself, pirated it in college, bought it on Bandcamp, or got it from a code inside the vinyl I bought at a show, it worked on Google Music. It integrated all my music in a truly all-accepting cloud player, and for that reason, I loved it in spite of its flaws and total lack of hipness.</p>\n<p>Now, in deference to the explosion of YouTube&#8217;s popularity as a music platform — which more  than anything else really is due to a new type of laziness and platform agnosticism peculiar to the next generation — Google Music exists as a sort of ghost of itself within the YouTube Music app, itself an evolution of a couple other failed music strategies.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Google felt that the optics of obsoleting a service and cutting off millions of users from something useful and beloved were not worth risking — after doing exactly that with Reader (RIP).</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mKNmjuOM8W\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/god-damn-it-google/\">God Damn It, Google</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;God Damn It, Google&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/god-damn-it-google/embed/#?secret=mKNmjuOM8W\" data-secret=\"mKNmjuOM8W\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>So (after culling the users who forgot they had accounts) they settled on the next best thing, which was making Google Music suck. Buried inside the new app, the music I uploaded has undergone a regression: intermingled and mixed, poorly organized, unable to be searched through, and at every occasion presented as the worse option, the uploaded library function seems to have been hidden away and hobbled.</p>\n<p>The ugly and reliable Music Manager, which has run in the background on my Windows PCs for years, is dead, and adding new music is done by manually dragging the files onto the YouTube Music tab. Complaining about having to move my fingers a few inches when I get a new album seems a bit pampered, so I&#8217;ll just say that it&#8217;s telling that Google chose to make the user do the work when the whole service was built around preventing exactly that kind of work from having to be done.</p>\n<p>I suppose I&#8217;m an exception to the usual Google and YouTube user, and as I&#8217;ve been careful to show the company for the last 20 years or so, there&#8217;s no money to be made from me. Yet as soon as I understood that Google was going to make it hard for me to do what I had been doing with them for a decade, I decided I was willing to pay for it. Now I pay Plex for a service Google decided was below them, and incidentally it&#8217;s <em>way</em> better. (Come to think of it, I started paying for Feedly after Google killed Reader, too.)</p>\n<p>In a way I&#8217;m thankful. The idea of divorcing myself entirely from Google&#8217;s ecosystem isn&#8217;t a realistic one for me, though I do it where I can (though having moved to iOS, the cure sometimes seems worse than the disease). One of the tattered bindings holding me to Google was the music thing. And while I do plan to take up a hundred gigabytes on one of their databases somewhere for as long as I possibly can, I&#8217;m glad the company admitted that what they were giving me didn&#8217;t make sense for them any more. It means one less reason that what Google has to give makes sense for me.</p>\n<p>Every service from Google now, especially with those new, bad logos, feels less like it&#8217;s offering a solution to a problem and more like it&#8217;s just another form of leverage for the company. We were spoiled by the old, weird Google that did things like Books because they could, throwing it in the teeth of the publishers, or Wave, an experiment in interactivity that in many ways is <em>still</em> ahead of its time. They did things because they hadn&#8217;t been done, and now they do things because they can&#8217;t let you leave.</p>\n<p>So, RIP Google Music. You were good while you lasted, but ultimately what you did best was show me that we deserved better, and we weren&#8217;t going to get it by waiting around for Google to return to its roots.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bi37oSjQFDo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:31:56 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg","linkMd5":"1c374c5be884d889f99d4b50e2237b46","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn15@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-49-51-940_6af57e1e916722d4.webp","destWidth":997,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":73582,"destBytes":59824,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-music-beta.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn15@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-49-51-940_6af57e1e916722d4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-439_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn7@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-575_24141d8c62d5836c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bi37oSjQFDo:D8xKa81dRUc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn28@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-51-59-635_d16ea217e86cf5a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-581_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bi37oSjQFDo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn13@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-51-58-541_217e9508b2678985.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156591253},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","title":"Twitter brings its Stories feature, Fleets, to Japan","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2072830","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> own version of Stories, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/twitter-starts-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-fleets-which-disappear-after-24-hours/\">it calls &#8220;Fleets</a>,&#8221; have arrived in Japan.

In the early days, we saw this trend with the &#8220;feed&#8221; format, modeled after Facebook&#8217;s News Feed. The Stories format, popularized by Snapchat, came next. And now apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/instagrams-tiktok-clone-reels-updates-to-allow-longer-videos-easier-edits/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/\">Snapchat</a> are ripping off TikTok with their own short-form video features.</p>\n<p>The result is that apps are losing focus on what makes them unique.</p>\n<p>Twitter, for what it&#8217;s worth, has historically been slow to copy from other social networks. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the last to embrace Stories &#8212; a feature that&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/\">now even on LinkedIn,</a> of all places.</p>\n<p>Plus, in Twitter&#8217;s case, the Stories feature may end up serving a different purpose than on other networks.</p>\n<p>Instead of offering users a way to post content of lesser quality &#8212; posts that didn&#8217;t deserve a more prominent spot in the feed, that is &#8212; Fleets may encourage users who haven&#8217;t felt comfortable with the platform&#8217;s more public nature to begin posting for the first time. Or, at least, it could push users to increase their content output and engagement.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"buszlGuJma\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/\">LinkedIn launches Stories, plus Zoom, BlueJeans and Teams video integrations as part of wider redesign</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;LinkedIn launches Stories, plus Zoom, BlueJeans and Teams video integrations as part of wider redesign&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/embed/#?secret=buszlGuJma\" data-secret=\"buszlGuJma\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s Fleets work much like Stories on other platforms.

A report from the firm suggests that the title has pulled in more than $1 billion in revenue since the start of the year, a marked increase since 2019 that might be surprising, given the social effects of a pandemic. Those revenues have allowed Niantic to be one of the more active acquirers in the AR infrastructure space, buying up small buzzy AR startups like Escher Reality, Matrix Mill and, most recently, 6D.ai.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That latest purchase in particular has acted as a signal for what the company&#8217;s next plans are for its augmented reality platform. 6D.ai was building cloud AR mapping software, with companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airbnb\">Airbnb <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> among its early customers. The tech allowed users to quickly gather 3D information of a space just by holding up their phone to the world. Since the acquisition, Niantic has been integrating the tech into their developer platform and has been aiming to juice the technology with their own advances in semantic understanding so they can not only quickly gather what the geometry of a space looks like, but also peer into the context of what the objects are that make up that 3D mesh.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG08OzwNvis?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>&#8220;We ultimately have this vision that for an AR experience, everything has to come together for it to be really magical,&#8221; Joel Hesch, Niantic&#8217;s senior director of Engineering, told TechCrunch. &#8220;You want precise location information so that you can see content in the right location and experience things together with others who are in the same location.

The capabilities of the system that Rivian describes suggests it is a Level 2 system as designated by SAE International. Level 2 means the system can perform two or more parts of the driving task under supervision of the driver. To support this level of driving, the system will be powered by two redundant compute platforms, 12 ultrasonic sensors, 10 exterior cameras, five radars and high-precision GPS. This essentially gives the vehicle 360-camera and radar visibility. It&#8217;s a robust suite of hardware that exceeds what Tesla uses for its driver assistance system. The hardware suite is similar to GM&#8217;s hands-free Super Cruise system, with the exception that Rivian appears to have more cameras.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZGqx4zCBoe\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021/\">Rivian to begin deliveries of electric pickup truck in June 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Rivian to begin deliveries of electric pickup truck in June 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021/embed/#?secret=ZGqx4zCBoe\" data-secret=\"ZGqx4zCBoe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Rivian is also placing a driver-monitoring system that includes a cabin-facing camera in its vehicles to ensure that drivers keep their eyes on the road when the system is engaged. Initially, the hands-free system will only be available on select highways and will then expand over time — improvements achieved via over-the-air software updates — to include a broader geographic area and more road types. This is similar to GM&#8217;s approach with its hands-free Super Cruise system, which was initially limited to certain divided highways and eventually expanded.</p>\n<p>While there are a number of automakers with Level 2 systems, they vary in capability.

Basically, if you&#8217;re on a free account and a semi-regular Google Photos user, get ready to pay up next year and subscribe to <a href=\"https://one.google.com/\">Google One</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, every free Google account comes with 15 GB of online storage for all your Gmail, Drive and Photos needs. Email and the files you store in Drive already counted against those 15 GB, but come June 1, all Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms or Jamboard files will count against the free storage as well. Those tend to be small files, but what&#8217;s maybe most important here, virtually all of your Photos uploads will now count against those 15 GB as well.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a big deal because today, Google Photos lets you store <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&#38;hl=en\">unlimited images</a> (and unlimited video, if it&#8217;s in HD) for free as long as they are under 16MP in resolution or you opt to have Google degrade the quality. Come June of 2021, any new photo or video uploaded in high quality, which currently wouldn&#8217;t count against your allocation, will count against those free 15 GB.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2072641\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Storage-management-tool.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2072641\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2072641\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Storage-management-tool.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"399\" height=\"399\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2072641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>\n<p>As people take more photos every year, that free allotment won&#8217;t last very long. Google argues that 80% of its users will have at least three years to reach those 15 GB. Given that you&#8217;re reading TechCrunch, though, chances are you&#8217;re in the 20% that will run out of space much faster (or you&#8217;re already on a Google One plan).</p>\n<p>Some good news: To make this transition a bit easier, photos and videos uploaded in high quality before June 1, 2021 will not count toward the 15 GB of free storage. As usual, original quality images will continue to count against it, though. And if you own a Pixel device, even after June 1, you can still upload an unlimited number of high-quality images from those.</p>\n<p>To let you see how long your current storage will last, Google will now show you personalized estimates, too, and come next June, the company will release a new free tool for Photos that lets you more easily manage your storage. It&#8217;ll also show you dark and blurry photos you may want to delete &#8212; but then, for a long time Google&#8217;s promise was you didn&#8217;t have to worry about storage (remember Google&#8217;s old Gmail motto? &#8220;Archive, don&#8217;t delete!&#8221;).</p>\n<p>In addition to these storage updates, there&#8217;s a few additional changes worth knowing about. If your account is inactive in Gmail, Drive or Photos for more than two years, Google &#8220;may&#8221; delete the content in that product. So if you use Gmail but don&#8217;t use Photos for two years because you use another service, Google may delete any old photos you had stored there. And if you stay over your storage limit for two years, Google &#8220;may delete your content across Gmail, Drive and Photos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cutting back a free and (in some cases) unlimited service is never a great move. Google argues that it needs to make these changes to &#8220;continue to provide everyone with a great storage experience and to keep pace with the growing demand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>People now upload more than 4.3 million GB to Gmail, Drive and Photos every day. That&#8217;s not cheap, I&#8217;m sure, but Google also controls every aspect of this and must have had some internal projections of how this would evolve when it first set those policies.</p>\n<p>To some degree, though, this was maybe to be expected. This isn&#8217;t the freewheeling Google of 2010 anymore, after all. We&#8217;ve already seen <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/11/06/google-photos-editor-lock-features-google-one/\">some indications</a> that Google may reserve some advanced features for Google One subscribers in Photos, for example. This new move will obviously push more people to pay for Google One and more money from Google One means a little bit less dependence on advertising for the company.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/g5S-JJGPBxA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:00:25 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Storage-management-tool.gif","linkMd5":"cd697bf295c8cb464da491687defde91","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn64@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-52-21-263_f1e139f9a71143e7.webp","destWidth":1080,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":5885793,"destBytes":2928800,"author":"Frederic Lardinois","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Storage-management-tool.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-53-15-831_f1e139f9a71143e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-439_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn74@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-51-58-563_73a567d2c4698778.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5S-JJGPBxA:9C__LvyKQA8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-58-577_ad07a359a64a6a13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-581_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/g5S-JJGPBxA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-51-58-551_07f2242f8a17a65e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156591256},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","title":"President-elect Joseph Biden reportedly plucks Revolution’s Ron Klain as new chief of staff","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2072905","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">President-elect Joseph Biden has plucked Ron Klain, a longtime colleague and confidant and the current executive vice president of the venture capital firm Revolution, as his White House chief of staff, reports The <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/us/politics/ron-klain-biden.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/us/politics/ron-klain-biden.html\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">New York Times. </a></p>\n<p>Klain was Biden’s chief of staff for two years during the Obama administration and <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/ron-klain-leaving-vice-presidents-staff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/ron-klain-leaving-vice-presidents-staff\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">left his post as chief of staff </a>in 2011 to join Revolution, the firm founded by former AOL chief executive and founder Steve Case. Revolution did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>If Klain makes his second entrance into the White House, Biden will be bringing on a chief of staff he&#8217;s known for more than 35 years. The duo first worked together in 1989, when the president-elect was a senator and Klain was a newly graduated law student from Harvard Law School. He most recently worked as the White House Ebola Response coordinator from October 2014 to February 2015, and helped as a debate advisor to President Obama and President Clinton, as well as nominees Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Klain&#8217;s appointment could pacify some of the presumed tension that could occur between startups and the government under the Biden-Harris administration. Biden has been vocal about pursuing aggressive regulation on the tech industry, which could negatively impact behemoths like Google, Apple and Facebook. Klain has spoken up (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/22/the-regulatory-fault-line-for-startups-moves-to-washington/\">in TechCrunch!</a>) about how regulatory hurdles could hinder key innovation in startup-land. Klain also helped lead efforts for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/higher-ground-labs-2018-dnc-startups/\">Higher Ground Labs</a>, an incubator and accelerator focused on politically-focused (and Democrat-loved) startups. While that likely wouldn&#8217;t impact Big Tech, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that, reportedly, one of Biden&#8217;s closest confidants will have a soft spot for startups.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QGNZXol7AdE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 01:32:08 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"0ce450f92f3a7a8dd68bcdd40e4f9727","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-03-573_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-439_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-51-58-576_1625bc910ede2f0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QGNZXol7AdE:Le6NPAkemiI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn97@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-51-58-547_3cf6a86426fa3d94.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-51-59-581_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QGNZXol7AdE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-51-58-546_5b106b31ae2aa364.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156591254},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:51","title":"Only 72 hours left until early-bird savings end for TC Sessions: Space 2020","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2070658","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">We’re just about a month away from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&#38;utm_campaign=space2020&#38;utm_content=3daysleft&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=3daysleftpost&#38;display=\">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, a two-day conference dedicated to bold visionaries with the passion, audacity and technical skills to chart a new course in space.
