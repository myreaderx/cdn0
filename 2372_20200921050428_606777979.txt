And this time, with new Pixel-first features on Android 11, your Pixel has even more smarts to make it better and more helpful—like giving you new ways to control your media and organize your apps, and making it easier to communicate with friends and family. And it all comes with privacy as a priority. Everything happens over the air, so you get that new-phone feeling over and over again. </p><br/><h3>Prioritize people, with Pixel</h3><p>Beginning today, new Android 11 features are hitting Pixel first to help you focus on connecting with those close to you, whether you’re meeting in a park for a socially distant picnic, or quickly responding to your loved ones’ texts. </p><br/><p>You can now use Live View with Location Sharing in Google Maps to easily meet up with friends IRL. If your friends have chosen to share their location with you, simply tap on their icon and then on Live View on the right side of your screen. You’ll see where they are in relation to you, along with how far away they are. Tapping on start will then show you arrows and directions placed right on top of your world so you can see exactly which way to go.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"21_LiveView_Marketing_en-US (2).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/21_LiveView_Marketing_en-US_2_GLmb3fW.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The new Smart Reply on your Pixel’s keyboard makes typing effortless by giving you helpful suggestions when you’re using chat apps.
