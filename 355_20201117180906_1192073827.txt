On your journey to improving your wellness, you might want to monitor your sleep, see if you’re meeting your workout goals and keep an eye on your heart rate. We wanted to make it easier to find all of this quickly, and more easily in one place.  To do this, we’ve made a few new updates to Google Fit and Wear OS by Google that make tracking and understanding all of your wellness information easier.<br/><br/></p><h3>A single hub for all your health and wellness information</h3><p></p>We’ve revamped the Google Fit app on Android and iOS to bring all of this information across your different <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3000e6f_googlefit_all?clp=CicKJQofcHJvbW90aW9uXzMwMDBlNmZfZ29vZ2xlZml0X2FsbBBKGAM%3D:S:ANO1ljJmomI&amp;gsr=CikKJwolCh9wcm9tb3Rpb25fMzAwMGU2Zl9nb29nbGVmaXRfYWxsEEoYAw%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljIYa4o&amp;hl=en\">connected apps and devices</a> into one easy-to-view hub. In addition to being able to view a summary of your metrics at a glance on the homescreen, you’ll be able to see if you’re meeting your daily and weekly goals for Heart Points and Steps, view your most recent workout and keep track of your heart rate, weight and blood pressure trends over time.<br/><br/><p>As part of our ongoing effort to provide you with <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/digital-wellbeing/improve-your-sleep/\">bedtime tools</a>, we’ve also brought more sleep information into Google Fit. If you have a connected device like the <a href=\"https://www.fossil.com/en-us/smartwatches/learn-more/gen-5e/\">Fossil Gen 5E Smartwatch</a>, <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/\">Oura Ring</a> or <a href=\"https://www.withings.com/us/en/sleep\">Withings sleep tracking mat</a>, or use a sleep-tracking app like <a href=\"https://sleep.urbandroid.org/\">Sleep As Android</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sleepcycle.com/\">Sleep Cycle</a>, you’ll be able to track your nightly activity, view sleep stages, set a goal for your bedtime schedule and more. Look out for more supported devices and apps as we expand this feature. </p><p></p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Google Fit homescreen and sleep\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/1._Google_Fit_Home_Screen__Sleep.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Tracking your favorite workouts just got easier</h3><p>Staying active and achieving your weekly Heart Point goals can help you stay healthy through the holiday season.
