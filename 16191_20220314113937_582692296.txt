Made from its leaves, the extract was fed to worms in various doses in Bohnert&#8217;s lab.</p>\n<p>The treated worms who received the highest and second-highest dose showed near-immediate improvement in their metabolic health. Not only did the treated worms live up to 40% longer than the untreated control group &#8212; they also grew fat and a little slow, as their increased body mass made it harder for them to move around. But the worms also became healthier and more resilient.</p>\n<p>It was easier for the treated worms to handle stress. In addition, the researchers found that Artemisia scoparia helps convert unhealthy fat stores into healthy fat stores in the body.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10469\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10469\" style=\"width: 476px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://humanbioscience.org/2022/02/researchers-feed-worms-a-natural-plant-extract-watch-them-fatten-live-40-longer.html/imagej1-52p\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-10469 follow noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-10469\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/humanbioscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LSU-Researchers-Feed-Worms-a-Natural-Plant-Extract-Watch-Them-Fatten-Live-40-Longer.jpg?resize=476%2C476&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/humanbioscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LSU-Researchers-Feed-Worms-a-Natural-Plant-Extract-Watch-Them-Fatten-Live-40-Longer.jpg?w=476&#38;ssl=1 476w, https://i0.wp.com/humanbioscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LSU-Researchers-Feed-Worms-a-Natural-Plant-Extract-Watch-Them-Fatten-Live-40-Longer.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/humanbioscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LSU-Researchers-Feed-Worms-a-Natural-Plant-Extract-Watch-Them-Fatten-Live-40-Longer.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Worms treated with Artemisia scoparia lived up to 40% longer and grew visibly fatter and stockier.

Now, it appears Artemisia scoparia also can activate many pro-longevity pathways in the body, and effectively turn on multiple genes involved in the lifespan regulation process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until recently, it wasn&#8217;t really known how aging could be modified through diet, or how core metabolic signaling pathways influence longevity,&#8221; Bohnert said. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve been able to show is that a natural extract can come in and influence these pathways in much the same way a genetic mutation would.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The study positions aging as non-deterministic and under our control.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Importantly, it gives us a therapeutic standpoint,&#8221; Bohnert said. &#8220;We know age is the primary risk factor for many diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, but if you think of aging as a treatable disease, you can actually treat many diseases at once.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the worms who lived the longest were fed Artemisia scoparia during the time they reached reproductive maturity, or adulthood, Bohnert&#8217;s team also observed significant effects in worms treated for the first time in middle age. Instead of a 40% increase in lifespan, these worms still managed to live about 20% longer.</p>\n<p>The study offers a first look at how Artemisia scoparia could change aging and longevity. It also reinforces the connection between metabolic health, fat regulation and longer lifespans.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px 8px 8px 0; float: left;'>\n<p><a href=\"http://ominymarket.com/se//?utm_source=Ominy%20science%20ad&#38;utm_medium=Ominy%20science%20post&#38;utm_campaign=Seller%20registration\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-10421\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/humanbioscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/20220123_063157.jpg?resize=800%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p><hr /><p>Make more money selling and advertising your products and services for free on <a href=\"https://ominymarket.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Ominy market<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6\"></span></a>.

The researchers investigated several kinds of related plant extracts and only observed positive effects on fat regulation and longevity with Artemisia scoparia.</p>\n<p>Common wormwood, Artemisia absinthium, used as an ingredient in the alcoholic beverage absinthe, is moderately poisonous and was not included in the study.</p>\n<p>This work was funded by a pilot grant through Pennington Biomedical&#8217;s NIH-funded Botanicals Dietary Supplements Research Center.

Natural products that modify core metabolic parameters, including fat content, may provide entry points to extend animal lifespan and promote healthy aging.</em></p>\n<p><em> Here, we show that a botanical extract from Artemisia scoparia (SCO), which promotes fat storage and metabolic resiliency in mice, extends the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by up to 40%. </em></p>\n<p><em>Notably, this lifespan extension depends significantly on SCO’s effects on fat; SCO-treated worms exhibit heightened levels of unsaturated fat, and inhibiting Δ9 desaturases, which oversee biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, prevents SCO-dependent fat accumulation and lifespan extension.</em></p>\n<p><em> At an upstream signaling level, SCO prompts changes to C. elegans fat regulation by stimulating nuclear translocation of transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, an event that requires AMP-activated protein kinase under this condition. </em></p>\n<p><em>Importantly, animals treated with SCO are not only long lived but also show improved stress resistance in late adulthood, suggesting that this fat-promoting intervention may enhance some aspects of physiological health in older age. These findings identify SCO as a natural product that can modify fat regulation for longevity benefit and add to growing evidence indicating that elevated fat can be pro-longevity in some circumstances.</em></p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button loading preset\" data-postid=\"10467\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#000b16;border-color:#f4f4f4;color:#ededed;\">Loading<span class=\"sf-icon-spinner-wrapper\"><i class=\"sf-icon-spinner\"></i></span></button><div class='code-block code-block-4' style='margin: 8px auto;
