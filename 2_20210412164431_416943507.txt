It’s warming at least <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-arctic-is-warming-so-fast/\">twice as fast</a> as the rest of the planet, which is setting off vicious feedback loops that accelerate change. Ice, for instance, is more reflective than soil, so when it melts, the region absorbs more solar energy. More dark vegetation is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/beautiful-yet-unnerving-photos-of-the-arctic-getting-greener/\">growing in northern lands</a>, absorbing still more of the sun’s heat. And when permafrost thaws, it releases gobs of greenhouse gases, which further warm the climate.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has gone so bizarro that lightning—a warm-weather phenomenon most common in the tropics—is now <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-lightning-strikes-in-an-arctic-gone-bizarro/\">striking near the North Pole</a>. And according to new modeling, the electrical bombardment of the region will only get worse. By the end of the century, the number of lightning strikes across the Arctic could more than double, which may initiate a shocking cascade of knock-on effects—namely, more wildfires and more warming. “The Arctic is a rapidly changing place, and this is an aspect of the transformation that I'm not sure has gotten a whole lot of attention, but it's actually really consequential,” says UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756004#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756004&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 10:45:39 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Science_sandra_angers-blondin_lightning_Qikiqtaruk-800x549.jpg","linkMd5":"793920051fe29e8733c9f2c6045c757f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-43-34-184_f0e35b90485a3595.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":549,"sourceBytes":54162,"destBytes":44012,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Science_sandra_angers-blondin_lightning_Qikiqtaruk-800x549.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-43-34-184_f0e35b90485a3595.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-28-458_7aad24cb0a767d0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn3@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-28-434_b1d7b41227127c0a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-447_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn73@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-399_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245778531},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","title":"Diablo II Resurrected impressions: Unholy cow, man","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755982","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/d2-alpha-listing-01-800x419.jpg\" alt=\"Diablo II Resurrected impressions: Unholy cow, man\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/d2-alpha-listing-01.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1240\" data-width=\"2368\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Blizzard / Sam Machkovech)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/diablo-ii-resurrected-tops-blizzcon-announcement-flurry/\"><em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em></a> is slated to launch on PC and consoles \"later this year,\" but in the meantime, the remaster is far enough along that its handlers launched an early \"technical alpha\" demo over this weekend.

Two years later, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/recreate-your-own-apollo-11-moon-landing-with-a-new-lego-set/\">Lego followed up with the Apollo 11 lunar lander</a>, and in 2020 it was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/clear-your-calendar-and-desk-legos-iss-inspired-set-arrives-on-february-1/\">the turn of the International Space Station</a>. And earlier this April, Lego released the latest set to bear NASA's famous worm logo: <a href=\"https://fave.co/2QadOf8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">space shuttle <em>Discovery</em></a>, as it was for 1990's STS-31 mission. This was an important mission, reaching the highest orbit for a space shuttle to date. <em>Discovery</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/the-hubble-space-telescope-launched-30-years-ago-then-the-problems-began/\">put the Hubble space telescope into orbit</a>, and its crew even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/07/30-years-of-manned-space-flight-the-last-flight-of-the-space-shuttle/3/\">captured the event on IMAX cameras</a> brought along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Lego has made a number of space shuttle sets over the years, but none has been as detailed as this 2,354-piece set. The finished orbiter is a substantial 21.8 inches (55.46 cm) long with a 13.6-inch (34.6 cm) wingspan, and it lends itself well to reproduction in Lego bricks at this scale; the space shuttle was covered in blocky tiles, after all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755772#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755772&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ygmiXF6F5c0:k9ZiXp9Pypg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ygmiXF6F5c0:k9ZiXp9Pypg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ygmiXF6F5c0:k9ZiXp9Pypg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ygmiXF6F5c0:k9ZiXp9Pypg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ygmiXF6F5c0:k9ZiXp9Pypg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ygmiXF6F5c0:k9ZiXp9Pypg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 17:00:31 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lego-Space-Shuttle-1-980x735.jpg","linkMd5":"5e4d7718e887db60c145a02dea682f6e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn25@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-27-495_c98dabf927f66783.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":735,"sourceBytes":106679,"destBytes":51958,"author":"Jonathan M.

Even during the pandemic, the country, a hub for the oil industry, had seen plenty of passengers from Europe and South Africa, where two concerning variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 hold sway. But the strains weren’t yet circulating widely in Angola, so this winter, health officials battened down the hatches. Before any passports get stamped, travelers receive a rapid antigen test and wait 30 minutes for a result. A negative test means self-quarantine, followed by another test a few days later. A positive test means a two-week stay at a quarantine hotel. For the three travelers, it was option two.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, samples taken from their noses arrived 2,000 miles south in South Africa, at the lab of Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He was in for a surprise. The virus that had infected these three travelers didn’t resemble the strains circulating in most other places, including those labeled as “variants of concern” for their ability to spread faster and evade certain types of immunity. If those variants are like siblings, this one was more like a forgotten second cousin. It came from a lineage of the virus that emerged in the early days of the pandemic but had disappeared soon thereafter, apparently outcompeted by other variants. And yet here it was, a year later.

The virus had since accumulated dozens of mutations, including many of the same ones that made those other strains worrisome because of increased transmissibility and immune evasion.

A Vostok-K rocket sent the capsule, carrying Yuri Gagarin, into low orbit with an apogee of 327 km.</p>\n<p>Gagarin would make one pass around the Earth before his spacecraft reentered the planet's atmosphere, enduring forces above 8 g. Because the Vostok capsule had no means of making a soft landing, Gagarin was ejected at 7 km above the ground and landed about 10 minutes later under his parachute. The flight lasted just 108 minutes, but Gagarin's legacy would be eternal.</p>\n<p>Amid the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union, the Soviets had struck a tremendous blow with this flight. Although the mission was used for propaganda purposes, in later remarks, Gagarin expressed a peaceful sentiment since repeated by subsequent generations of astronauts. \"Looking at the Earth from afar, you realize it is too small for conflict and just big enough for cooperation,\" he said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756237#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756237&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:59:19 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EywkMQ_XAAEo4He.jpg","linkMd5":"cffb03fbdb8b0df0f45aaf5a8f47f72a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn48@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-00-340_8caa3cbc6a1aaa47.webp","destWidth":850,"destHeight":634,"sourceBytes":383703,"destBytes":64488,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EywkMQ_XAAEo4He.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn48@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-00-340_8caa3cbc6a1aaa47.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn28@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-28-640_08db2fc607f8685e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bPqfgfMsXFE:pWPFvEW1SZ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-28-513_a798cba920e72269.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-447_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn73@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-399_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245778531},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","title":"A new documentary highlights the visionary behind space settlement","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755700","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gerard-ONeill_1-800x590.jpg\" alt=\"Black-and-white photograph of a teacher lecturing while casually leaning across his desk.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gerard-ONeill_1.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2118\" data-width=\"2870\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Physicist Gerry O'Neill popularized the notion of space settlement.

His ideas spread through the space-enthusiast community at a time when NASA was about to debut its space shuttle, which first flew in 1981. NASA had sold the vehicle as offering frequent, low-cost access to space. It was the kind of transportation system that allowed visionaries like O'Neill to think about what humans could do in space if getting there were cheaper.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755700#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755700&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 13:00:46 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gerard-ONeill_1-800x590.jpg","linkMd5":"c051b3187909f2dbfcaf457bb97e3ec4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-19-953_31d946f3d568aac3.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":590,"sourceBytes":54168,"destBytes":27708,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gerard-ONeill_1-800x590.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-19-953_31d946f3d568aac3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn14@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-471_75d9e3188fd25a69.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GkNoEBJh7tc:J7clsawfm10:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-28-465_fa016e6af1596f88.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-447_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn73@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-399_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245778532},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","title":"Ecological impacts of solar geoengineering are highly uncertain","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755823","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1015076main_ISS005-E-19024-800x515.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of volcanic eruption.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1015076main_ISS005-E-19024.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"644\" data-width=\"1000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Most geoengineering plans involve humanity doing what some volcanoes already do: inject particles into the stratosphere that reflect sunlight.

Called solar radiation modification (SRM), this strategy is a type of geoengineering that involves scattering particles into the sky to reflect sunlight back out into space so it can't warm the Earth's atmosphere.</p>\n<p>In theory, SRM could cool off the planet and help limit <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\">global warming</a> to 1.5ºC compared to preindustrial levels. But it's viewed as something of a last-resort tool to tackle climate change. Two new analyses explore what deploying this tactic could mean for the environment and the flora, fauna, and people living in it. In all, the authors of both reports suggest that more work needs to be done to understand SRM.</p>\n<h2>Greater cooperation</h2>\n<p>The idea has gained some traction. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/07/bill-gates-funded-solar-geoengineering-could-help-stop-global-warming.html\">Bill Gates</a>, for example, advocated for it in 2019.

Wynonna (Melanie Scrofano) takes on \"revenants,\" the repeatedly reincarnated outlaws that Wyatt Earp killed. They won't stay dead until the Earp heir—Wynonna—offs them with Wyatt's famous 16-inch-barrel revolver, dubbed Peacemaker. Over the course of four seasons, she has battled witches, vampires, vengeful spirits, nutty sister-wife cults, possessed neighbors, demonic nuns, and killer trees, among other threats. She is not without allies, however, including the immortal being, Doc Holliday (Tim Rozon), with whom Wynonna becomes romantically entangled (and yes, it's complicated). Then there is her baby sister, Waverly (Dominique Provost-Chalkley), who falls for local deputy Nicole Haught (Katherine Barrell)—a popular pairing dubbed \"Wayhaught\" by shippers—and the local sheriff, Nedley (Greg Lawson), who becomes a father figure and demon-hunting ally. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1702105#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1702105&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 21:26:50 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/earp8-980x651.jpg","linkMd5":"eb8f35e9a84320ec443ce1fed1a2ab0d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-24-499_8e0a4889c2fab96f.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":651,"sourceBytes":65989,"destBytes":37494,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/earp8-980x651.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-24-499_8e0a4889c2fab96f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-28-475_03560e0c95c66864.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gUl8di0xEm4:clxeZpET5AQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn88@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-28-927_ee3175722055f436.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-447_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn73@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-399_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245778531},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:42:58","title":"The Rolls-Royce Ghost: A magic carpet ride that costs as much as a house","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754152","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-Rolls-Royce-Ghost-12-980x735.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          And the award for most improved goes to.... the 2021 Rolls-Royce Ghost, which is better than the car it just replaced in almost every way.
