Over 300,000 people have been affected by the rainfalls, with hundreds missing and dozens dead. The region of Tabasco hadn&#8217;t seen floods of this scale for over 50 years.</p>\n<p>Even though the storm has passed, the damage and the tragedy endures. The Mexican Marine Secretariat (SEMAR) has actively been on a rescue mission ever since, scouring the flooded streets and searching for those that were stranded. One of the few lucky ones was this golden Labrador retriever, who has been effectively been rescued by the aforementioned SEMAR.</p>\n<p class=\"post-content-source\">More info: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/semar_mx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SEMARMX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEMAR_mx\">Twitter</a></p>\n<h2>Region of Tabasco hadn&#8217;t witnessed floods like this for over 50 years</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dog-that-was-rescued-from-a-flood-in-Mexico-seems-to-thank-you-with-your-eyes-5fb3a8ce91283__880.jpg\" width=\"880\" height=\"471\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-content-media-source\">Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.cydnoticias.mx/2019/11/28/lluvia-ahoga-a-mazatlan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cydnoticias.mx</a></p>\n<h2>This desperate golden Labrador retriever has been spotted by SEMAR</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dog-that-was-rescued-from-a-flood-in-Mexico-seems-to-thank-you-with-your-eyes-5fb3a8c11a799__880.jpg\" width=\"880\" height=\"484\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-content-media-source\">Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SEMARMX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Secretaría de Marina</a></p>\n<p>The published video, which went viral, shows how the story went.

The SEMAR took him in and given him medical service, along with other care, as he was very scared, emaciated, making hardened soldiers want to cry.

In all fairness, maybe that&#8217;s for the best.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dog-that-was-rescued-from-a-flood-in-Mexico-seems-to-thank-you-with-your-eyes-5fb3a8efb776b-png__880.jpg\" width=\"880\" height=\"474\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-content-media-source\">Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SEMARMX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Secretaría de Marina</a></p>\n<h2>The Labrador got inducted into the large family of Mexican Marine Secretariat</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dog-that-was-rescued-from-a-flood-in-Mexico-seems-to-thank-you-with-your-eyes-5fb3a8f6485b4__880.jpg\" width=\"880\" height=\"1044\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-content-media-source\">Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SEMARMX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Secretaría de Marina</a></p>\n<p>SEMAR didn&#8217;t give him a name yet, and there&#8217;s an open contest to give him one. Given the dog&#8217;s medical state and mood, one of the officials had admitted that they want to make him a rescue dog himself. &#8220;The dog shows great potential and ability for that,&#8221; he said. There&#8217;s a hope that he&#8217;ll be one of the best rescue dogs since it had the experience of being rescued itself. Goes to show that even in the heavy clouds there are a few rays of light and hope shining through.</p>\n<p><img
