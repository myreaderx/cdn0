If you answered ‚Äúnot a lot,‚Äù you‚Äôre not alone. In fact, <a href=\"https://luna1.co/f88e13.png\">1 in 4 businesses</a> say they either have no process in place or rely on ‚Äúgut feel‚Äù to distribute work. As a result, a whopping <a href=\"https://luna1.co/f88e13.png\">80% of employees</a> report feeling overworked and close to burning out. Workload management gives you a window into your team‚Äôs projects, so you can make sure your team isn‚Äôt in that 80% and help them achieve balance‚Äîinstead of burnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you get started with Workload management? If you use Asana, you already have‚Äî<a href=\"https://asana.com/product/workload\">Workload</a> is available to all <a href=\"https://asana.com/business\">Business</a> and <a href=\"https://asana.com/enterprise\">Enterprise</a> Asana customers. With Workload, you can visualize how much your team has on their plate and easily rebalance work when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get started with Workload</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Workload without any setup‚Äîall you have to do is add a project or group of projects to a <a href=\"https://asana.com/guide/team/onboard/portfolio-management\">Portfolio</a>, then navigate to the <strong>Workload </strong>tab. There, you‚Äôll see each team member‚Äôs work‚Äîacross all of the projects in your Portfolio‚Äîin one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://blog.asana.com/2019/07/workload-effort/\">add effort and capacity in Workload</a>, in order to better understand how much work your team has lined up. From the Workload tab, click <strong>Add effort </strong>to set a custom field for effort based on hours or points.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-hours-1024x534.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10634\" srcset=\"https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-hours-1024x534.png 1024w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-hours-520x271.png 520w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-hours-1536x801.png 1536w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-hours-1024x534@2x.png 2048w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-hours-520x271@2x.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, set a maximum capacity for each team member. If team members go over that capacity, you‚Äôll see a red line in Workload that means they have too much to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-capacity-1024x534.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10633\" srcset=\"https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-capacity-1024x534.png 1024w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-capacity-520x271.png 520w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-capacity-1536x801.png 1536w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-capacity-1024x534@2x.png 2048w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Workload-set-capacity-520x271@2x.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Balance team workloads with just a few clicks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice a team member has too much on their plate, you can quickly take action and reassign tasks from within the Workload tab. Click the drop down to open the drill down view, then drag and drop tasks to reschedule them or reassign tasks to other team members. You can also rebalance due dates and <a href=\"https://blog.asana.com/2020/08/asana-tips-tight-schedules-shifting-priorities/\">shift priorities</a> to make sure no one burns out. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://luna1.co/8ff4bd.gif\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a1.png\" alt=\"üí°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />Tip:</strong> Make sure you use start and end dates so you have an accurate view of how much effort a given task will take.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Track your team‚Äôs work in a central project</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure you have visibility into every assignment your team is working on‚Äîand that those tasks are accurately represented in Workload‚Äîcreate a centralized project to capture all of your team‚Äôs work. You could even set a <a href=\"https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/rules\">Rule</a> to add a task to your team‚Äôs central project, so no work gets left behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Staffing-project-rule-1024x534.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10635\" srcset=\"https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Staffing-project-rule-1024x534.png 1024w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Staffing-project-rule-520x271.png 520w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Staffing-project-rule-1536x801.png 1536w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Staffing-project-rule-1024x534@2x.png 2048w, https://blog.asana.com/wp-content/post-images/Staffing-project-rule-520x271@2x.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a1.png\" alt=\"üí°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />Tip:</strong> Remember that subtasks will not show up in Workload‚Äîjust like they don‚Äôt show up in Timeline or Calendar View. If you or a team member has a task with several subtasks capturing large pieces of work, consider <a href=\"https://asana.com/guide/help/tasks/actions#gl-convert-to-project\">converting that task into a project</a>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prevent burnout with Workload</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Workload management is a critical part of promoting balance for your team. When you have a clear insight into your team‚Äôs work across all of your different projects and initiatives, you can best rebalance work and shift priorities to support your team. Use Workload as a springboard to <a href=\"https://asana.com/resources/effectively-manage-team-workload\">connect with your team</a> about their capacity in your next 1:1 meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you‚Äôre an Asana Business customer, <a href=\"https://app.asana.com/-/login\">log in</a> to Asana to try Workload today.
