Their names are Jay Belsky and Terrie Moffitt, and they’re professors of human development, and two of the four contributors to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674983459/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0674983459&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Origins of You: How Childhood Shapes Later Life</em></a>. To begin our conversation, Jay and Terrie discuss the longitudinal studies they and their colleagues have used to track people over decades of their lives, and how aggressiveness and shyness in childhood end up impacting adulthood. We then discuss the limitations of the famous marshmallow experiment, and what these more expansive longitudinal studies have shown about the importance of self-control in achieving a successful adulthood. We unpack whether the negative outcomes associated with being bullied in childhood are inevitable, who’s most likely to become a bully, and who’s most likely to be bullied (which as it turns out, isn’t a matter of being fat or wearing glasses). We discuss how children who act out in childhood, but avoid making certain mistakes in adolescence, can still turn out okay, and why you probably shouldn’t worry about children who were good kids, but get into a little trouble in their teen years. We also dig into the impact that childcare has on kids, and the role that genes play in development. We end our conversation with some allowance-related ideas for cultivating greater self-control in your kids. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Does childhood temperament influence personality later in life?</li>\n<li>When and how should parents intervene with perceived problems in their children?</li>\n<li>Self-control and the famous marshmallow test</li>\n<li>How mistakes in adolescence impact adulthood </li>\n<li>Who’s more likely to be bullied?
