Spanning many geographical regions globally, including the United States, Europe, and Asia, we demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with cancer have a higher fatality rate compared with that of COVID-19 patients without cancer. The overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with cancer measured 22.4%, which is comparable with that of the authors’ report from a single institute (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa214#djaa214-B2\" class=\"reflinks\">2</a>) and recent meta-analysis involving similar populations from other multinational cohorts (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa214#djaa214-B3\" class=\"reflinks\">3</a>,<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa214#djaa214-B4\" class=\"reflinks\">4</a>). Based on the available individual patient data, our analysis suggested that patients being older than 65 years and male was associated with a higher risk of worse outcomes, a finding that is consistent with other large cohort studies.</span>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":20809,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0c25f4b1949e6e4ea47a417701a7a30c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Zhang H, Han H, He T, et al.
