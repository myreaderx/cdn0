Coming to Netflix October 4 2020, the film addresses some of the biggest challenges facing life on our planet, providing a snapshot of global nature loss in a single lifetime. With it comes a powerful message of hope for future generations as Attenborough reveals the solutions to help save our planet from disaster.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>In the trailer (embedded above), Attenborough says “I had the most extraordinary life. It’s only now that I appreciate how extraordinary.” In saying that, he’s speaking not only as a living legend whose long career in television and science has brought him nearly universal acclaim, but also as someone who can look back and see how recognizably and thoroughly the Earth has changed during his lifetime. The depletion of animal populations, the changing climate, the shifting habitats — he’s witnessed firsthand how much humans have fucked up the planet. We should listen to his testimony and suggestions for fixing what he calls “our greatest mistake”. I hope it’s not too late.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/David%20Attenborough\">David Attenborough</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/David%20Attenborough%3A%20A%20Life%20on%20Our%20Planet\">David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Earth\">Earth</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Netflix\">Netflix</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:26:48 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"626897ffd441fd7050d79f135200aa33","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364890},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"Like Humans, Crows Can “Ponder the Content of Their Own Minds”","link":"https://kottke.org/20/10/like-humans-crows-can-ponder-the-content-of-their-own-minds","description":"<p>A recent study that looked at the brain patterns of crows when performing tasks found evidence that they <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/24/crows-possess-higher-intelligence-long-thought-primarily-human/\">“know what they know and can ponder the content of their own minds”</a>, an attribute that was previously thought to exist only in humans and some monkeys.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The birds were aware of what they subjectively perceived, flash or no flash, correctly reporting what their sensory neurons recorded, Nieder told STAT. “I think it demonstrates convincingly that crows and probably other advanced birds have sensory awareness, in the sense that they have specific subjective experiences that they can communicate,” he said. “Besides crows, this kind of neurobiological evidence for sensory consciousness only exists in humans and macaque monkeys.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>(via <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/coronavirus-daily-briefing/episodes/40cbf8bf-8a74-49a4-a23c-cecd536ee05a\">kottke ride home</a>)</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/birds\">birds</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 15:02:27 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"157adeaffa242116b74a925166ce6120","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364891},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"Werner Herzog’s Entertaining Answer to “How Many Languages Do You Speak?”","link":"https://kottke.org/20/10/werner-herzogs-entertaining-answer-to-how-many-languages-do-you-speak","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6pY-0JfEdLY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>This clip of an off-screen interviewer asking film director Werner Herzog how many languages he speaks and then Herzog answering is only slightly more than 90 seconds long, but it’s a masterclass in how to tell an entertaining story.

Here was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkottke/status/1308443353919488000\">my paraphrased tweet</a> about it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>With a very effective vaccine ready in Nov/Dec, distributed widely, and if lots of people take it (i.e. the best case scenario), the earliest we could return to “normal life” in the world is the end of 2021.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>At the New Yorker Festival earlier in the week, Michael Specter asked him about a return to normalcy and Fauci elaborated a bit more on this timeline (starts ~10:22 in the video).</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwFHbiwtBBw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>When are we gonna get back to something that closely resembles, or is in fact, normal as we knew it?</p> \n <p>We’re already making doses, tens and hundreds of millions of doses to be ready, first at least, in graded numbers at the end of the year in November/December. By the time we get to April, we likely will have doses to be able to vaccinate anybody who needs to be vaccinated. But logistically by the time you get everybody vaccinated, it likely will not be until the third or even the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021.</p> \n <p>So let’s say we get a 70% effective vaccine, which I hope we will get, but only 60% of the people get vaccinated. There are going to be a lot of vulnerable people out there, which means that the vaccine will greatly help us to pull back a bit on the restrictions that we have now to maintain good public health, but it’s not going to eliminate things like mask wearing and avoiding crowds and things like that.</p> \n <p>So I think we can approach normality, but I don’t think we’re going to be back to normal until the end of 2021. We may do better than that; I hope so but I don’t think so.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Leaving aside what “normal” might mean and who it actually applies to,<sup id=\"fnref:1602170462\"><a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/10/dr-fauci-earliest-well-be-back-to-normal-is-the-end-of-2021#fn:1602170462\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> there’s some good news and bad news in there. The good news is, they’re already producing doses of the vaccine to be ready if and when the phase 3 trials are successful. Ramping up production before the trials conclude isn’t usually done because it’s a waste of money if the trials fail, but these vaccines are so critical to saving lives that they’re spending that money to save time. That’s great news.</p> \n<p>The bad news is that we’re not even halfway through the pandemic <em>in the best case scenario</em>. We’re going to be wearing masks in public for at least another year (and probably longer than that). Large gatherings of people (especially indoors) will continue to be problematic — you know: movie theaters, concerts, clubs, bars, restaurants, schools, and churches — and folks staying within small pods of trusted folks will likely be the safest course of action.</p> \n<p>A change in national leadership in both the executive branch and Senate could change the outlook for the better. We could get some normalcy back even without a vaccine through measures like a national mask mandate/distribution, a real national testing &amp; tracing effort, taking aerosol transmission seriously, and easing the economic pressure to “open back up” prematurely. We’re never going to do as well as Vietnam or Taiwan, but I’d settle for Greece or Norway.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Oct 08, 2020\">Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/938102\">In an interview posted yesterday</a>, Johns Hopkins epidemiologist <a href=\"https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/rivers/\">Dr. Caitlin Rivers</a> gives her best guess at a return to normalcy:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Topol: When do you think we’ll see pre-COVID life restored?</p> \n <p>Rivers: I wish I knew. I’m thinking toward the end of 2021. It’s really hard to say with any certainty.

The recording for the ‘62 Berlin show was presumed lost until it was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/arts/music/ella-fitzgerald-lost-berlin-tapes.html\">recently rediscovered</a> in the archive of a record executive.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Early this year, Mr. Field and Ken Druker, a vice president at Verve — which survives today under the auspices of Universal Music Group — were digging through a rediscovered trove of live recordings that Granz had stashed away decades ago. They came across an apparently untouched reel-to-reel, with yellowed Scotch tape still holding the box shut, featuring a concert Fitzgerald had given in Berlin two years after that first famous outing.</p> \n <p>Upon inspection, they found that recordings had been made in both mono and stereo — a rare stroke of luck.

Remarkably, Lyon was the grandson of John Tyler, the 10th President of the United States. His brother Harrison Ruffin Tyler is still alive. <a href=\"https://kottke.org/12/01/president-john-tylers-grandsons-are-still-alive\">Here’s what I wrote about the Tylers back in 2012</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>John Tyler was the 10th President of the United States. He was born in 1790 and took office in 1841. His son, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, was born in 1853, when Tyler was 63 years old. In turn, Lyon had six children with two different wives, two of whom were Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr. and Harrison Ruffin Tyler (born 1924 &amp; 1928 respectively, when Lyon Sr. was in his 70s).</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>John Tyler was born barely a year into George Washington’s first term and undoubtably met and even worked with some of the nation’s earliest political figures, including Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams. Amazing to think that just three generations of the same family stretch almost all the way back to the founding of our country. It underscores just how young the United States is — after all, the last person to receive a Civil War pension <a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/06/last-person-to-receive-a-civil-war-pension-dies\">just died back in June</a>.

All of this information has been posted in Twitter and other forums, but can be difficult to find. Having multiple experts working together, and having the ability to update this information also improves its quality. These FAQs represent our best understanding at this time, and should always be similar or more stringent than information provided by CDC, WHO, and most regional &amp; local health authorities. If your authority has a more stringent guideline than discussed here, follow that more stringent guideline.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The group was organized by chemist Jose-Luis Jimenez, who has been studying aerosols for 20 years. You may remember Jimenez from <a href=\"https://time.com/5883081/covid-19-transmitted-aerosols/\">his excellent piece in Time magazine</a>, where he used <a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/08/smoke-on-the-wind-the-aerosol-spread-of-covid-19\">the analogy of smoke</a> to explain aerosol transmission. Here’s a snippet from the FAQ, highlighting something I’ve been concerned about lately: people wearing face shields instead of masks and employees in stores not wearing masks behind plexiglass shields:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>7.13. Are face shields and masks interchangeable?<br />No, face shields do not offer much protection against aerosols (also see this video), while masks do. Face shields are good for blocking ballistic droplets released by the wearer or that might fly into the wearer’s face when close to others. Face shields are considered a supplement to masks for partial eye protection (but less useful than closed glasses, as discussed above), but not a substitute for them.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote>\n <p>7.14. Are plexiglass barriers helpful?<br /> Plexiglass barriers are generally useful to avoid direct droplet infection and direct aerosol transmission whenever people are in close proximity and distance cannot be kept. Therefore, it is recommended to use them as a direct transmission suppression tool at such places, such as a supermarket checkout.</p> \n <p>However, as aerosols follow the air movements indoors, the protective effects of the plexiglas barriers against aerosols will be limited. Plexiglas barriers alone are not a sufficient approach to protect against aerosol transmission. Their installation alone cannot protect against indoor aerosol transmission and should not be regarded as safe and sufficient protection.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>MIT Technology Review’s Charlotte Jee <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/02/1009235/this-scientist-made-a-google-doc-to-educate-the-public-about-airborne-coronavirus-transmission/\">interviewed Jimenez about the FAQ document</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>We update the document all the time. We’re effectively having to be a little WHO or CDC. We’re saying the things that they should be saying. This is frustrating, but it’s the situation we find ourselves in. These organizations have been flat-out refusing to consider if aerosol transmission is important, which leaves people unprotected. So we feel it’s our duty to communicate directly with the public.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Right now, in my opinion as someone who has done a ton of reading about Covid-19, the most best accessible information on how individuals and societies can protect themselves and others during the pandemic (and why) is available in <a href=\"https://time.com/5883081/covid-19-transmitted-aerosols/\">Jimenez’s Time article</a>, Aaron Carroll’s NY Times piece about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/opinion/coronavirus-schools-tradeoffs.html\">how to think about risk management</a>, Zeynep Tufekci’s piece in the Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/\">about dispersion and superspreading</a>, and now <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fB5pysccOHvxphpTmCG_TGdytavMmc1cUumn8m0pwzo/preview?pru=AAABdQ5s5mA*YrLy9epGlHWhKPSl5JMT3w#\">this Google Doc by Jimenez et al.</a></p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jose-Luis%20Jimenez\">Jose-Luis Jimenez</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 19:05:48 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a1a8553e6439e8fa2d9f1b09a9e46d1e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364891},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"Artemisia Gentileschi, Praised and Reappraised","link":"https://kottke.org/20/09/artemisia-gentileschi-praised-and-reappraised","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/susanna-elders-artemisia.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1421\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Painting of Susanna and the Elders (1610) by Artemisia Gentileschi\" /></p> \n<p>For the New Yorker, Rebecca Mead <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/05/a-fuller-picture-of-artemisia-gentileschi\">writes about the 17th-century Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi</a>, whose work has been growing in stature and popularity in recent years.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Increasingly, Artemisia is celebrated less for her handling of private trauma than for her adept management of her public persona. Throughout her career, she demonstrated a sophisticated comprehension of the way her unusual status as a woman added to the value of her paintings. On a formal level, her representation of herself in the guise of different characters and genders prefigures such postmodern artists as Cindy Sherman. Unlike Sherman, however, Artemisia had few female peers. She was not the only woman working as an artist during the early seventeenth century: a slightly older contemporary was the northern-Italian portraitist Fede Galizia, born in 1578, whose father, like Artemisia’s, was also a painter. But Artemisia must often have felt singular. In a series of letters written to one of her most important patrons, the collector Antonio Ruffo, she wittily referred to her gender: “A woman’s name raises doubts until her work is seen,” and, regarding a work in progress, “I will show Your Illustrious Lordship what a woman can do.” In 2001, the scholar Elizabeth Cropper wrote, “We will never understand Artemisia Gentileschi as a painter if we cannot accept that she was not supposed to be a painter at all, and that her own sense of herself — not to mention others’ views of her — as an independent woman, as a marvel, a stupor mundi, as worthy of immortal fame and historical celebration, was entirely justified.” On art-adjacent blogs, Artemisia’s strength and occasionally obnoxious self-assurance are held forth as her most essential qualities. She has become, as the Internet term of approval has it, a badass bitch.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/artemisia\">An exhibition of Gentileschi’s work</a> is set to open early next month at the National Gallery in London and is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54338537\">getting rave reviews</a>. Man, I’d love to go see this in person!</p> \n<p>BTW, when reading Mead’s piece, I kept stopping to search for the art she referenced and I recommend you do the same. It’s a) frustrating that the New Yorker doesn’t use hyperlinks for this purpose in the online version and b) still wondrous after all these years that this fantastic art is available to view online with a few quick clicks and keystrokes. Imagine reading a piece like this in 1989 and wanting to look at the art - it would take a trip to the library and then probably hours of searching.</p> \n<p>Oh hell, I’ll just do this quick…here’s every painting referenced in Mead’s piece:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.khm.at/objektdb/detail/1564/\">“Susanna and the Elders”, Tintoretto</a>: “…he portrayed Susanna as serene and

But, at other times, COVID-19 can be surprisingly much <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30471-0/fulltext#seccestitle130\">less contagious</a>. Overdispersion and super-spreading of this virus is found <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7277812/\">in</a> <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/36/22430\">research</a> <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/24/2020.06.28.20142133.full.pdf\">across the globe</a>. A growing number of studies estimate that a majority of infected people may not infect a single other person. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1092-0\">A recent paper</a> found that in Hong Kong, which had extensive testing and contact tracing, about 19 percent of cases were responsible for 80 percent of transmission, while 69 percent of cases did not infect another person. This finding is not rare: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1092-0\">Multiple</a> <a href=\"https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67/v3\">studies</a> from the beginning have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185944/\">suggested</a> that as few as 10 to 20 percent of infected people may be responsible for as much as 80 to 90 percent of transmission, and that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13689.pdf\">many people barely transmit it</a>.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>We’ve known, or at least suspected, this about SARS-CoV-2 for awhile now — I linked to two articles about superspreading back in <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/why-do-some-covid-19-patients-infect-many-others-whereas-most-don-t-spread-virus-all\">May</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/\">June</a> — but Tufekci says we have not adjusted our thinking about what that means for prevention. We should be avoiding superspreading environments/events (<a href=\"https://time.com/5883081/covid-19-transmitted-aerosols/\">“Avoid Crowding, Indoors, low Ventilation, Close proximity, long Duration, Unmasked, Talking/singing/Yelling”</a>), doing backwards contact tracing, and rapid testing.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>In an overdispersed regime, identifying transmission events (someone infected someone else) is more important than identifying infected individuals. Consider an infected person and their 20 forward contacts-people they met since they got infected. Let’s say we test 10 of them with a cheap, rapid test and get our results back in an hour or two. This isn’t a great way to determine exactly who is sick out of that 10, because our test will miss some positives, but that’s fine for our purposes. If everyone is negative, we can act as if nobody is infected, because the test is pretty good at finding negatives. However, the moment we find a few transmissions, we know we may have a super-spreader event, and we can tell all 20 people to assume they are positive and to self-isolate-if there is one or two transmissions, it’s likely there’s more exactly because of the clustering behavior. Depending on age and other factors, we can test those people individually using PCR tests, which can pinpoint who is infected, or ask them all to wait it out.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Part of the problem is that dispersion and its effects aren’t all that intuitive.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Overdispersion makes it harder for us to absorb lessons from the world because it interferes with how we ordinarily think about cause and effect. For example, it means that events that result in spreading and non-spreading of the virus are asymmetric in their ability to inform us. Take the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6928e2.htm\">highly publicized case</a> in Springfield, Missouri, in which two infected hairstylists, both of whom wore masks, continued to work with clients while symptomatic. It turns out that no apparent infections were found among the 139 exposed clients (67 were directly tested; the rest did not report getting sick). While there is a lot of evidence that masks are crucial in dampening transmission, that event alone wouldn’t tell us if masks work. In contrast, studying transmission, the rarer event, can be quite informative. Had those two hairstylists transmitted the virus to large numbers of people despite everyone wearing masks, it would be important evidence that, perhaps, masks aren’t useful in preventing super-spreading.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The piece is an important read and interesting throughout: <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/\">just read the whole thing</a>.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Zeynep%20Tufekci\">Zeynep Tufekci</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 15:13:26 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6f53d70680148194e786b6ee1fa662ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364891},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"Xi’an Famous Foods Cookbook!","link":"https://kottke.org/20/10/xian-famous-foods-cookbook","description":"<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9781419747526\"><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/xian-famous-foods-cookbook.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1249\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Xi'an Famous Foods Cookbook\" /></a></p> \n<p>I moved away from NYC more than four years ago, and I still think about <a href=\"https://www.xianfoods.com/\">Xi’an Famous Foods</a> <em>all the time</em>.

He reveals what it was like to experience the astonishing worldwide success of an object he made purely for his own play. And he offers what he thinks it means to be a true creator (hint: anyone can do it). Steeped in the wisdom and also the humility of a born inventor, Cubed offers a unique look at the imperfect science of creation.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Even the structure of the book is odd. From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/books/erno-rubik-rubiks-cube-inventor-cubed.html\">a review of the book</a> in the NY Times by Alexandra Alter:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“On the way to trying to understand the nature of the cube, I changed my mind,” Rubik said. “What really interested me was not the nature of the cube, but the nature of people, the relationship between people and the cube.”</p> \n <p>Reading “Cubed” can be a strange, disorienting experience, one that’s analogous to picking up and twisting one of his cubes. It lacks a clear narrative structure or arc — an effect that’s deliberate, Rubik said. Initially, he didn’t even want the book to have chapters or even a title.</p> \n <p>“I had several ideas, and I thought to share this mixture of ideas that I have in my mind and leave it to the reader to find out which ones are valuable,” he said. “I am not taking your hands and walking you on this route. You can start at the end or in the middle.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I’ve never learned how to solve one without consulting a book, but like many people who grew up in the 80s, I’ve always been captivated by the Rubik’s Cube. It’s both simple and endlessly complex and can somehow be solved in under 3.5 seconds now. It’s exactly the type of thing that could only have been invented by an amateur in his spare time and who still wonders about it almost 50 years later.

There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless.</p> \n <p>We have known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the release of greenhouse gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>According to the video, global population growth and economic growth will be working against us over the next few decades and that increasing our energy efficiency and lowering emissions from energy sources are the main ways in which we will be able to slow things down. It’s worth noting that on <a href=\"https://kottke.org/18/03/i-recommend-that-you-read-the-wizard-and-the-prophet\">the wizard vs. prophet continuum</a>, this video is firmly in the wizard camp. That’s not wrong or bad; it’s just that other people have different ideas about how to combat climate change.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/global%20warming\">global
