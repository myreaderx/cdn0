Penn, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/financialaidpodcast/8715247256/\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7435/8715247256_e031d68218.jpg\" alt=\"Blighted apple\" width=\"300\" height=\"288\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s becoming fashionable to take a bite out of Apple. There was Jean-Louis Gassée’s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/18/apple-microsoft\">scathing article in the Guardian</a>. There was <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2013/03/ceding_the_crown\">Jon Gruber</a> (of Daring Fireball) damning Apple with faint praise: blaming the media for cherrypicking the news to weave a narrative about Apple’s slow demise. I expect the chorus to grow louder before it weakens. Blood in the water, and all that.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn’t do itself many favors. Its trenchant secrecy used to seem cool – and I daresay it would still be considered cool – if not for the fact that a) competitive technologies are legitimately “catching up” to the iDevices and, b) the company’s <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-02/apple-avoids-9-2-billion-in-taxes-with-debt-deal.html\">accounting tricks</a> seem increasingly slinky and mean-spirited.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg reported: “Apple avoided as much as $9.2 billion in taxes by financing part of a $55 billion stock buyback with debt rather than offshore cash that would have been billed by the U.S. government.”</p>\n<p>Juxtapose that legal money laundering with the typical mindset of the prototypical iConsumer. I daresay most of Apple’s biggest fans are Obama supporters, and certainly the media tastemakers skew more liberal. At some point the corporate accounting chicanery will sound a discordant note that continues to toll. “These guys at Apple? These are not good guys. They are not pro-American. They’d go to any length to avoid paying taxes that would benefit America’s defense, infrastructure and education. And worst of all, sin above all sins: their tech is now only on-par with everybody else.”</p>\n<p>In other words: not cool. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>What do you do about this if you work at Apple PR?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/nibbles-at-the-apple/\">Find out my suggestions on the SHIFT Communications blog</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Todd Defren<br />\nSHIFT CEO</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=XfJuz1WX3k4:QNAPnxc8CUU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=XfJuz1WX3k4:QNAPnxc8CUU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=XfJuz1WX3k4:QNAPnxc8CUU:W9dqtTZ0I2U\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/XfJuz1WX3k4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 May 2013 11:22:54 +0000","feedId":28329,"bgimg":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7435/8715247256_e031d68218.jpg","linkMd5":"080bc1c204472e4004e137ef7a4e4681","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_3/2020/10/13/06-11-01-114_a3ae80ec0873e118.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":480,"sourceBytes":41857,"destBytes":12912,"author":"cpenn","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7435/8715247256_e031d68218.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_3/2020/10/13/06-11-01-114_a3ae80ec0873e118.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_6/2020/10/13/06-11-02-253_3ce7c01f1f70fff6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn84@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-11-04-369_aa3ad4895192e821.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn80@2020_3/2020/10/13/06-11-02-268_9fbef25ee7ba3941.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/XfJuz1WX3k4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_3/2020/10/13/06-11-02-222_3adda34158626cd4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602569460772}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:11:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:11:00","feedId":28329,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:11:00 +0000","fetchMs":199,"handleMs":180336,"totalMs":184908,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"b724f4db74bd861dbefaff97f3fb6faf","hostName":"europe-58*","requestId":"84bf54d8a2a34b6fb81f609c53ef5e01_28329","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":14092,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":5,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":5,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx4":2,"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx5oss":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:43:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:50:19","id":28329,"name":"PR-Squared -
