The sample build path is <code>/build/arm-specter-linux-uclibcgnueabi</code>, that is why we named it Specter.</p>\n<p>At present, Specter has a lot of <code>unprofessional aspects</code>. For example, it releases two libraries required by runtime while releasing Loader, but they are all dynamically linked.We also noticed  that Plugin does not expand and load directly in memory.<a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40500\">The vulnerability being targeted is also quite old, a 5 years old on</a>. On the other hand, this botnet has a good layered design, complex network communication and some other characteristics，which is obviously a work of professional. <code>Professional aspects come with unprofessional aspects</code>, this contradiction makes us speculate that Specter is in the test development stage. We will see how it goes in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Specter is a remote control Trojan (RAT) for the Linux platform.</p>\n<p>It consists of 3 parts, Dropper, Loader, and Plugin.
