It&#8217;s difficult to incorporate intuitive user control into these builds, and quite important that they stay out of the way of the user&#8217;s own balance. This one approaches those issues with the use of a walker that both provides a means of steadying one&#8217;s self, and facilitates sending commands to the exosuit. Using the OLED screen and buttons incorporated on the walker, the user can select and control the walking, sitting, and standing modes.</p>\n<p>The exoskeleton is meant to provide assistance to people with weakness or lack of control. They still walk and balance for themselves, but the hope is that these devices will be an aid at times when human caregivers are not available and the alternative would be unsteady mobility or complete loss of mobility. Working with the assistive device has the benefit of continuing to make progress in strengthening on the march to recovery.</p>\n<p>The team is hard at work on the design, and with less than two weeks left before the entry deadline of the <a href=\"https://prize.supplyframe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Hackaday Prize</a>, we&#8217;re excited to see where the final push will bring this project!</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-427586\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRaNE3lJjNU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<div id=\"sidebar-mobile-1\" class=\"widget_text widget widget_custom_html amr_widget\"><div class=\"textwidget custom-html-widget\"><div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 24px; font-weight: 300; margin-top: 12px;\">\n\tThe <a href=\"https://prize.supplyframe.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span\n\t\t\tstyle=\"font-weight: bold;\">Hackaday</span>Prize2020</a> is Sponsored by:\n</div>\n<div class=\"prize-footer-2020\">\n\t<a href=\"https://supplyframe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-supplyframe.png?w=300\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Supplyframe\" style=\"width:auto; height:100%;\" />\n\t</a></div>\n<div class=\"prize-footer-2020\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.digikey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-digi-key.png?w=300\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Digi-Key\" style=\"width:auto; height:100%;\" />\n\t</a></div>\n<div class=\"prize-footer-2020\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.microchip.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-microchip.png?w=300\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Microchip\" style=\"width:auto; height:100%;\" />\n\t</a></div>\n<div class=\"prize-footer-2020\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.arm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-arm.png?w=300\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Arm\" style=\"width:auto; height:100%;\" />\n\t</a></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div></div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 18:31:56 +0000","feedId":305,"bgimg":"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-exosuit-project-walker.jpg?w=400","linkMd5":"522d4ad8c5551432fe172d4dc392788a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/18/20-39-32-494_a714f4f20aa74b32.webp","author":"Mike Szczys","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-exosuit-project-walker.jpg?w=400":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/18/20-39-32-494_a714f4f20aa74b32.webp","https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-supplyframe.png?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/18/20-39-56-731_193ca31946d20fcf.webp","https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-digi-key.png?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn12@2020_5/2020/08/18/20-39-56-192_4fc24a8a6b4498ae.webp","https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-microchip.png?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/18/20-39-56-218_8dd361210bbb0e55.webp","https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hackaday-prize2020-sponsors-arm.png?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn25@2020_1/2020/08/18/20-39-56-304_7d728b281b85469e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597783171860},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 04:39:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 04:39:32","title":"Linux-Fu: One at a Time, Please! Critical Sections in Bash Scripts","link":"https://hackaday.com/?p=423519","description":"<p>You normally think of a critical section &#8212; that is, a piece of a program that excludes other programs from using a resource &#8212; as a pretty advanced technique. You certainly don&#8217;t often think of them as part of shell scripting but it turns out they are surprisingly useful for certain scripts. Most often, a critical section is protecting some system resource like a shared memory location, but there are cases where a shell script needs similar protection. Luckily, it is really easy to add critical sections to shell scripts, and I&#8217;ll show you how.</p>\n<h2>Sometimes Scripts Need to Be Selfish</h2>\n<p>One very common case is where you want a script to run exactly one time. If the same script runs again while the original is active, you want to exit after possibly printing a message. Another common case is when you are updating some file and you need undisturbed access while making the change.</p>\n<p>That was actually the case that got me thinking about this. I have a script &#8212; may be the subject of a future Linux-Fu &#8212; that provides dynamic DNS by altering a configuration file for the DNS server. If two copies of the script run at the same time, it is important that only one of them does modifications. The second copy can run after the first is totally complete.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-423519\"></span></p>\n<h2>Atomic Files</h2>\n<p>The problem is one of atomicity. You could, for example, create a temporary file with an obscure name and make sure that the file doesn&#8217;t exist. But what if someone else checks at the same time? You both note the file isn&#8217;t there and then you both create the file thinking you are running alone. No good.</p>\n<p>It turns out files are a possible answer, but the locking of a file using <code>flock</code> is the right way to do it. There are two general options here: call <code>flock</code> to execute a command for you and it will acquire the lock and release it when the command completes, or you can use <code>flock</code> in your own script to protect a block of code.</p>\n<h2>The Easy Case</h2>\n<p>The idea behind <code>flock</code> is that it will put a lock on a file. The file can be open for reading or writing &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t really matter. You can get a shared lock or &#8212; the default &#8212; ask for an exclusive lock. You can only get an exclusive lock if there are no other locks on the file.</p>\n<p>What file do you use? It depends. For a script, sometimes it is worth using the script file itself as the lock. That certainly makes it unambiguous although if someone copies the script to a new name, lookout. Another answer is to use a temporary file. Most systems will have <code>/var/lock</code> directory for just this purpose.</p>\n<p>Consider a case where you have a script that works with a file. One option to the script deletes the file, but you don&#8217;t want to do that if another instance of the file is using it at the time. You might do something like this:</p>\n<pre>flock \"$0\"  rm \"$SHAREDFILE\"</pre>\n<p>This gets an exclusive lock. Other parts of the script might look like this:</p>\n<pre>flock -s \"$0\" awk -f script.awk \"$SHAREDFILE\"</pre>\n<p>The -s means the lock is shared, so anyone else asking for a shared lock will get it, but the exclusive lock for the rm will block until the file &#8212; which in this case is the shell script itself &#8212; is unlocked.</p>\n<h2>Unblocking</h2>\n<p>Of course, sometimes you don&#8217;t want to wait forever. You can use the -n option to tell <code>flock</code> to not block. Or use -w to wait for a specified number of seconds (which does not have to be an integer). By default, if the lock doesn&#8217;t work, <code>flock</code> will return a 1, but you can change that by using -E to select a different code since the command you run may also return a 1 for some reason.</p>\n<h2>Critical Section Blocks</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to run a single command. You want to lock up an entire portion of a script. You can do that, too. The <code>flock</code> command can take a numeric file descriptor. The file can be open for reading or writing, but it must exist. If you use the script file, that&#8217;s a sure bet that it exists, of course.</p>\n<p>You can use all the same options for blocking and time outs and you have to open up a file descriptor using bash constructs. There are several ways to do that &#8212; and I&#8217;ve made <a href=\"https://github.com/wd5gnr/shellcs\" target=\"_blank\">a repo of examples</a> which I&#8217;ll reference below &#8212; but I usually just use a redirect in a subshell. You can also use <code>exec</code> to get the same effect.</p>\n<p>Have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/wd5gnr/shellcs/blob/master/cs0.sh\" target=\"_blank\">this script</a>. It is a bit contrived, but it prepares a log file and then calls itself twice to create two different entries in that log file. There&#8217;s no critical section protecting the log, so you&#8217;ll see after the script completes how the output from both subprocesses mix together.</p>\n<p>You can use the easy method by just having <code>flock</code> lock the script file before calling the subprocesses. That&#8217;s the approach in cs.sh that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/wd5gnr/shellcs/blob/master/cs.sh\" target=\"_blank\">see here</a>. However, in a script like this it is usually more effective to use the block with a numeric file handle. Here&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://github.com/wd5gnr/shellcs/blob/master/cs1.sh\" target=\"_blank\">same example using that style of <code>flock</code></a>. The subprocesses look like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\">\n( flock 99 \necho Here is a log entry from A along with a directory of /etc &#62;&#62;&#34;$LOGFILE&#34;\nls /etc &#62;&#62;&#34;$LOGFILE&#34;\necho That is all from A &#62;&#62;&#34;$LOGFILE&#34; ) 99&#60;&#34;$LOCKFILE&#34;\nexit 0\n</pre>\n<p>Of course, this is a silly example. It would be just as easy in this case to run process A, wait for it to complete, and then run process B. But that&#8217;s not always the case and in a complex script, you may have work that both processes can execute in parallel, only waiting for specific critical sections. In that case, running the processes in series would be less efficient.</p>\n<h2>Singleton</h2>\n<p>A very common use case for the critical section block is to stop a script from running more that one instance at any given time.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\">\n#!/bin/bash\nLOCKFILE=&#34;$0&#34;\n( if flock -n 99\nthen\n  echo Running task\n  sleep 20\n  echo Done\n  exit 0\nelse\n  echo You can only run one copy of this script at a time!\n  exit 1\nfi ) 99&#60;$LOCKFILE&#34;\n</pre>\n<p>This pattern is useful if you have a program that you plan to run periodically using something like cron. You might run it every minute, but &#8212; on occasion &#8212; the program might take more than a minute to complete. A flock barrier can prevent a large number of copies from running all at once.</p>\n<p>In all of these cases, the file closing automatically releases the lock, so you don&#8217;t have to explicitly let go of the lock. If you ever do need to release it early, the -u option is your friend.</p>\n<h2>A Few Notes</h2>\n<p>Turns out <code>flock</code> isn&#8217;t part of the POSIX standard, but it is pretty common. Before Linux kernel 2.6. 12, <code>flock</code> didn&#8217;t work correctly over NFS, either. If you use /var/lock or /tmp, those are very unlikely to be NFS mounted, anyway. If, for some reason, you are on a system without <code>flock</code>, mkdir is not assured to be atomic, but it usually is, so that could be another option since it also returns a status if it created a directory or not.</p>\n<p>This locking technique is one of those things you won&#8217;t need every day. But when you do need it, it is invaluable.</p>\n<p>The opposite of running things one at a time is <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/06/29/linux-fu-parallel-universe/\">running them in parallel</a>. You normally don&#8217;t need to unlock a lock file, since <code>flock</code> takes care of that when the file closes, but if you want to be super defensive, maybe consider cleaning up anything that needs cleaning using <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2019/08/26/linux-fu-its-a-trap/\">a trap</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 17:01:23 +0000","feedId":305,"bgimg":"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LinuxFu-blogview.jpg","linkMd5":"f17972f0e09d5ca7d26f51f3fc824ac6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/18/20-39-56-403_ac5e5d277001fec1.webp","metaImg":"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LinuxFu-blogview.jpg","destWidth":3000,"destHeight":938,"author":"Al Williams","publishedOrCreatedDate":1597783172219},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 04:39:31","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 04:39:31","title":"Get Your SQL Statements Right the First Time With SQL Lint","link":"https://hackaday.com/?p=427313","description":"<p>What&#8217;s your average success rate of getting a SQL statement right on the first try?

I looked these keyboards up and found out that you can buy them new for a lot more than what I paid.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_424007\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-424007\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"424007\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/08/18/inputs-of-interest-the-infogrip-bat-chording-keyboard/bat-beauty-shot/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2656,1494\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"BAT-beauty-shot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?w=800\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-424007 size-large\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg 2656w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?resize=400,225 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-beauty-shot.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-424007\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My gently used BAT in all its angular glory.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_424035\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-424035\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"424035\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/08/18/inputs-of-interest-the-infogrip-bat-chording-keyboard/bat-lowercase-alpha/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png\" data-orig-size=\"600,299\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"BAT-lowercase-alpha\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png?w=600\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-424035 size-medium\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png 600w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png?resize=250,125 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-lowercase-alpha.png?resize=400,199 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-424035\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The lowercase letter chords use either the middle thumb key or no thumb key.

It&#8217;s a chording keyboard that&#8217;s meant to be used a standard PC input device by anyone who either can&#8217;t use a regular keyboard or has a need for speed. <a href=\"https://spinoff.nasa.gov/database/spinoffDetail.php?this=/spinoff//ssc/SSC-SO-37\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Years of research went into the BAT&#8217;s chording scheme, which was developed in conjunction with NASA&#8217;s Stennis Space Center</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of stretching your fingers all over a regular keyboard, poking keys one at a time to spell out words, you press combinations of keys simultaneously, like playing chords on a piano.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re meant to use your thumb for the red, grey, and blue keys, and lay the other four on the rest of the keys. All of the alphabet keys are chorded with or without the gray thumb key, and all the number, symbol, and modifier keys are accessed through the red and blue layers.</p>\n<p>Why would you want one of these? Well, given enough time to learn the chords, you can do anything a standard 104+ keyboard can do with only seven keys. You would never need to look down, not even for those weird seldom-used keys, and the only finger that ever travels is your thumb. All of this reduced hand/finger/wrist travel is going to be easier on the body.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_424764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-424764\" style=\"width: 206px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"424764\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/08/18/inputs-of-interest-the-infogrip-bat-chording-keyboard/bat-cad/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"303,368\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"BAT-CAD\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg?w=303\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg?w=303\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-424764 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg?w=206\" alt=\"\" width=\"206\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg 303w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-CAD.jpg?resize=206,250 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-424764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The BAT lets you CAD like a madlad.

Imagine how fast you could type if you chorded everything <em>and</em> split the typing duties between both hands! The only trouble is learning all those different finger combinations, although they say it doesn&#8217;t take that long.</p>\n<p>So why is it called the BAT? Legend has it that it&#8217;s because company started out in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but also because <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/buxtoncollection/a/pdf/BAT%20Tandy%20Review.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a pair of BATs sitting next to each other resembles a bat</a> (PDF).</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-420196\"></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: none\">Connector Inspector</h2>\n<p>This version of the BAT seems to be from the middle of the availability timeline &#8212; the late 1990s.

I thought these keyboards were still being made, because they have new ones that look very much like this one, but come in black and use USB. I got an email back from a rep who told me Infogrip went out of business, and that their company is selling off the new old stock until it runs out.</p>\n<p>I started my initial cord searches with the mini DIN side, and my thinking was simply that it&#8217;s newer technology. Yes, but it turns out that mini DIN cords are kind of uncommon and difficult to find &#8212; at least cords that terminate in something I can use on the other end.</p>\n<p>The BAT started out with an RS-232 serial port, then moved to this AT/5-pin mini DIN version that I have, and then to USB-Boxy sometime in the early 2000s. I gave up on searching for a mini DIN when I found a cheap AT to PS/2 converter and equally inexpensive PS/2 cable to use with one of those PS/2 to USB cables that you couldn&#8217;t swing a ball mouse without hitting in the early 2000s. It seems to work, at least partially. My system recognizes it and declares it ready to use. I can get all the LEDs to light up, but none of the chords I try will produce output in any text editor I&#8217;ve tried. I might have better luck if I can find an AT to PS/2 cord.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: none\">Tour and Teardown</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to give a fair assessment about a device without using it for a while. So far, I haven&#8217;t been able to do that. But outwardly, the BAT feels like it was designed for the best possible user experience.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_424671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-424671\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"424671\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/08/18/inputs-of-interest-the-infogrip-bat-chording-keyboard/bat-red-black-springs-deskthority-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"BAT-red-black springs deskthority\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg?w=800\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-424671 size-medium\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg 1200w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg?resize=250,188 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg?resize=400,300 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAT-red-black-springs-deskthority-1.jpg?resize=800,600 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-424671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The BAT&#8217;s keys take very little actuating force because of the springs. Image via <a href=\"https://deskthority.net/wiki/BAT_Keyboard\" target=\"_blank\">Deskthority</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The point of a keyboard like this is that you should never have to look down at your hand(s). To help with that, both of the red and blue thumb keys have homing bumps, and the gray one doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>All the keycaps seem to be mounted backwards, as in 180° from normal &#8212; and based on the pictures I&#8217;ve found, this is how Infogrip intended them to be. This way, the keys have a really low profile and are easier to actuate. The pinky key is taller than the rest to account for how short and weak pinkies tend to be. And underneath each keycap, there are three layers of 1/8&#8243; thick foam to absorb the shock of typing.</p>\n<p>The BAT&#8217;s keyswitches are Cherry MX blacks that have been modified with exceptionally light springs that make them take even less force to actuate than reds. I can&#8217;t fathom how they could have made this keyboard any easier or more comfortable to type on, unless maybe the wrist rest was gel instead of foam, or it had adjustable tenting to change the typing angle.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand why it has a coin cell, especially considering <a href=\"https://www.infogrip.com/blog/article/bat-tech-issues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this troubleshooting blog post from Infogrip that suggests removing the battery altogether because &#8220;you don&#8217;t need it and it can cause problems&#8221;</a>. Does anyone know or care to speculate? I did try this, along with the hard reset sequence, but it still behaves the same way.</p>\n\n<a

But if that doesn&#8217;t happen, I think it would make a fantastic macro pad, especially if I come up with my own scheme for chorded shortcuts. And there&#8217;s plenty of room in the case to design a board that fits the keyswitch footprint.</p>\n<p>Since my hand is small, there might be enough room for a trackball just below the thumb keys, and some mouse buttons and a scroll wheel under the other keys. I&#8217;m in the middle of designing <a href=\"https://hackaday.io/project/171576-5-keeb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a 5-key macro pad</a> that will sit right in front of my trackball mouse, but the idea of combining a trackball mouse and a macro pad into a track-ro is tempting.

With the remaining process variables being tricky to model and control, there&#8217;s only so much we can expect on dimensional accuracy from extruded plastic processes. But what if we mixed machines, adding a second machining process to give the resulting part a machined quality finish? That&#8217;s exactly what the folks at E3D have been cooking up over the last few years: a toolchanging workflow that <a href=\"https://e3d-online.com/blogs/news/asmbl\" target=\"_blank\">mixes milling and 3D printing into the same process</a> to produce buttery smooth part finishes with tighter dimensional accuracy over merely 3D printing alone.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"427326\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/08/18/e3d-teaches-additive-machines-how-to-subtract/asmbl/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/asmbl.gif\" data-orig-size=\"480,320\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"asmbl\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/asmbl.gif?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/asmbl.gif?w=480\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-427326 alignleft\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/asmbl.gif?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" />Dubbed ASMBL (Additive/Subtractive Machining By Layer), the process is actually the merging of two complimentary processes combined into one workflow to produce a single part. Here, vanilla 3D printing does the work of producing the part&#8217;s overall shape. But at the end of every layer, an endmill enters the workspace and trims down the imperfections of the perimeter with a light finishing pass while local suction pulls away the debris. This concept of mixing og coarse and fine manufacturing processes to produce parts quickly is a re-imagining of a tried-and-true industrial process called <em>near-net-shape manufacturing. </em>However, unlike the industrial process, which happens across separate machines on a large manufacturing facility, E3D&#8217;s ASMBL takes place in a single machine that can change tools automatically. The result is that you can kick off a process and then wander back a few hours (and a few hundred tool changes) later to a finished part with machined tolerances.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of such an odd complimentary concoction, you might ask? Well, for one, truly sharp outer corners, something that&#8217;s been evading 3D printer enthusiasts for years, are now possible. Layer lines on vertical surfaces all but disappear, and the dimensional tolerances of holes increases as the accuracy of the process is more tightly controlled (or cleaned up!) yielding parts that are more dimensionally accurate&#8230; in theory.</p>\n<p>But there are certainly more avenues to explore with this mixed process setup, and that&#8217;s where you come in. ASMBL is still early in development, but E3D has taken generous steps to let you build on top of their work by posting their <a href=\"https://github.com/AndyEveritt/ASMBL\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion 360 CAM plugin</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4206827\" target=\"_blank\">bill-of-materials and model files for their milling tool</a>, and even the STEP files for their <a href=\"https://github.com/e3donline/Motion-System\" target=\"_blank\">toolchanging motion system</a> online. Pushing for a future where 3d printers produce the finer details might just be a matter of participating.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting to see the community of 3D printer designers continue to rethink the capabilities of its own infrastructure when folks start pushing the bounds beyond pushing plastic.

Your only constraint is that there needs to be some type of working circuit involved.</p>\n<p>Three entries will be chosen as top winners in the Most Functional, Most Beautiful, and Best Video categories and be awarded $200 in components from Digi-Key who are sponsoring this contest and also putting together a calendar with images of the top twelve sculptures.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_412183\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-412183\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-attachment-id=\"412183\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/05/12/a-twisted-tale-of-woven-wires/wirestory_feat/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"wirestory_feat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg?w=800\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-412183\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg 800w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wirestory_feat.jpg?resize=400,225 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-412183\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/05/12/a-twisted-tale-of-woven-wires/\"><em>Wonderlandscape</em> by [Michael Aichlmayr]</a> takes the &#8220;sculpture&#8221; part of Circuit Sculpture to new levels.</figcaption></figure>Tell us the story of your creation, including a deep dive into how you built the sculpture and what trial and error you went through to pull it off.

[Ayan Pahwa] was well acquainted with this frustration, so he created <a href=\"https://github.com/iayanpahwa/anywheredoor\" target=\"_blank\">AnywhereDoor</a>, a cross-platform clipboard sharing utility that uses MQTT.</p>\n<p>Some cloud-based solutions already exist to do this, but that means sending your private clipboard data to someone else&#8217;s server. Not keen on that idea, [Ayan]&#8217;s solution makes use of a MQTT broker that can run anywhere on the local network, and lightweight python clients to run on Mac, Windows and Linux. The client checks your clipboard at specified intervals, and publishes new data to a topic on the broker, to which all the clients are subscribed. The data is end-to-end encrypted using <a href=\"https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/fernet\" target=\"_blank\">Fernet</a> symmetrical key encryption, so the data won&#8217;t be readable to anyone else on the network. Currently, AnywhereDoor only supports copying text, but media is planned for a future version.</p>\n<p>We like the relative simplicity of the utility, and see it being very handy for hackers bouncing between machines in the lab. Simple software utilities that solve a specific and real problem can are very useful, like a <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/06/23/an-open-source-tool-to-document-your-wiring/\">wiring documentation tool</a>, or <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/07/31/transform-kicad-design-to-patchwork-for-isolation-routing/\">Kicad to isolation routing patchwork</a>
