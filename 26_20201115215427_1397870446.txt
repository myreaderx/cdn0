This is the first time that SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket will be officially used as a spacecraft certified by NASA for human flight on a regular astronaut transportation operation. NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, along with JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi, will also be aboard the Dragon spacecraft and, barring any weather delays, on their way to the International Space Station later Sunday night.</p>\n<p>SpaceX has already flown people using Dragon – NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley had the honor of being the first humans ever to be launched to the ISS aboard a commercial spacecraft when they took part in SpaceX&#8217;s Demo-2 mission earlier this year. That was obviously a historic achievement, but it was also technically the last stage in SpaceX&#8217;s test and demonstration program for Dragon and Falcon 9, whereas today&#8217;s Crew-1 launch no longer qualifies as a test. Think of it this way: If Demo-2 was akin to the Wright Brothers&#8217; Kitty Hawk flight, Crew-1 will be the equivalent of the first U.S. scheduled commercial airline flight in 1914.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Crew-1 will be the first time that a full complement of astronauts are flown on Dragon (there are six total seats but NASA has said it will only ever fly a max of four of its and partner agency crew to the ISS on these flights). The astronauts will join the existing crew on the ISS for a regular tour of performing experiments, maintaining and upgrading the station, which will also see the active ISS population swell by one additional astronaut for the first time during a standard rotation, which means more science can get done according to the agency.</p>\n<p>The launch system is designed to work in a completely automated way, which means that it requires no action on the part of the crew on board from launch all the way through its docking with the ISS. That&#8217;s also true of the return trip, which will take place sometime around next June.</p>\n<p>SpaceX will also be attempting a recovery of the first stage booster used during this launch, using its autonomous drone landing ship in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p>Everything should get started closer to the liftoff target time, but NASA will also have programming all day related to the Crew-1 mission, the Dragon program and much more via the livestream above.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8tA49jDE8tE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 15:02:01 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"971d1f230533189b643531e998e5a337","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-53-51-316_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-53-51-316_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn43@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-53-52-414_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn13@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-53-52-365_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-53-52-562_b1a0011686a037c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8tA49jDE8tE:eZ-IMCPOQOE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-53-52-372_eb901adde7a41928.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-53-52-507_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8tA49jDE8tE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-25-936_e8ac163170043ab3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477231094},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:53:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:53:51","title":"Reliance Retail buys Urban Ladder for $24.4 million","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074074","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/reliance-retail\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"reliance-retail\">Reliance Retail <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has acquired a majority stake in furniture and decor platform <a href=\"https://www.urbanladder.com/\">Urban Ladder</a>, making a broader push into e-commerce as the largest retail chain in India gears up to fight Amazon and Flipkart.</p>\n<p>In a filing to the local stock exchange, Reliance Retail said it had acquired a 96% stake in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/urban-ladder\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"urban-ladder\">Urban Ladder <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> for about $24.43 million.

And “The Vow” features an astonishing amount of footage showing Raniere and other high-level NXIVM members at work — for that reason alone, the series is worth watching for anyone interested in the NXIVM story.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>However, it’s also hampered by some unfortunate storytelling choices. For one thing, by parceling the story out over nine hour-long episode, the series often feels unnecessarily drawn out and repetitive.</p> \n<p>And by focusing on a handful of high-ranking NXIVM members who subsequently became important whistleblowers and critics (including Mark Vicente, the filmmaker responsible for a great deal of that behind-the-scenes footage), “The Vow” has also <a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/in-the-nxivm-docuseries-showdown-seduced-is-the-clear-1845420016\">opened itself up to criticism</a> that it downplays the stories of Raniere’s true victims and obscures the extent of his crimes (unlike the Starz documentary “Seduced”) .</p> \n<p>In addition to reviewing the series, we also discuss <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/\">the latest Disney+ growth numbers</a> and the new season of “The Bachelorette.”</p> \n<p>You can listen to our review in the player below, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/original-content/id1271763098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subscribe using Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;or find us in your podcast player of choice.
