This article was originally published in March 2010.</em></p>\n<p>While writing our first book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YL4AQC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B003YL4AQC&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Art of Manliness: Classic Skills and Manners for the Modern Man</em></a>, we decided to throw a few old-time 19th century slang words into the text just for fun. While scouring old dictionaries for some virile words and phrases that would fit into the book, we came across many others that were beyond awesome but didn’t make the cut. Here’s a glossary of some of our favorites (with their original definitions) that were tossed about on the streets and saloons back in the day. These colorful expressions probably won’t ever come back into popular parlance, but they’re a real hoot to read through.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Art of Manliness Dictionary of Manly 19th Century Vernacular</h3>\n<p><strong>Admiral of the Red: </strong>A person whose very red face evinces a fondness for strong potations.</p>\n<p><strong>All-overish:</strong> Neither sick nor well; the premonitory symptoms of illness. Also the feeling which comes over a man at a critical moment, say just when he is about to “pop the question.” Sometimes this is called, “feeling all-over alike, and touching nowhere.”</p>\n<p><strong>Anointing:</strong> A good beating. A case for the application of salve.</p>\n<p><strong>Barking-Iron, or Barker:</strong> A pistol. Term used by footpads and thieves generally.</p>\n<p><strong>Bellows:</strong> The lungs.

An idle and useless person is often told that he is only fit to lead the blind monkeys to evacuate.</p>\n<p><strong>Blinker:</strong> A blackened eye. Also a hard blow in the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Bone Box:</strong> The mouth. Shut your bone box; shut your mouth.</p>\n<p><strong>Bully Trap:</strong> A brave man with a mild or effeminate appearance, by whom the bullies are frequently taken in.</p>\n<p><strong>Bunch Of Fives:</strong> The fist.

There are several species of the “cut,” such as the cut direct, the cut indirect, the cut sublime, the cut infernal, etc. The cut direct is to start across the street, at the approach of the obnoxious person, in order to avoid him. The cut indirect is to look another way, and pass without appearing to observe him. The cut sublime is to admire the top of King’s College Chapel, or the beauty of the passing clouds, ’til he is cut of sight. The cut infernal is to analyze the arrangement of your shoe-strings, for the same purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Dash-fire:</strong> Vigor, manliness.</p>\n<p><strong>Draw the Long Bow:</strong> To tell extravagant stories, to exaggerate overmuch; same as “throw the hatchet.” From the extremely wonderful stories which used to be told of the Norman archers, and more subsequently of Indians’ skill with the tomahawk.</p>\n<p><strong>Drumsticks:</strong> Legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth Bath:</strong> A grave.</p>\n<p><strong>Eternity Box:</strong> A coffin.</p>\n<p><strong>Fart Catcher:</strong> A valet or footman, from his walking behind his master or mistress.</p>\n<p><strong>Firing a Gun:</strong> Introducing a story by head and shoulders.

Also, “in a state of hugger-mugger” means to be muddled.</p>\n<p><strong>Job’s Turkey:</strong> “As poor as Job’s turkey” — as thin and as badly fed as that ill-conditioned and imaginary bird.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep a Pig:</strong> An Oxford University phrase, which means to have a lodger. A man whose rooms contain two bedchambers has sometimes, when his college is full, to allow the use of one of them to a freshman, who is called under these circumstances a pig. The original occupier is then said to “keep a pig.”</p>\n<p><strong>Ladder:</strong> “Can’t see a hole in a ladder,” said of anyone who is intoxicated. It was once said that a man was never properly drunk until he could not lie down without holding, could not see a hole through a ladder, or went to the pump to light his pipe.</p>\n<p><strong>Lay Down the Knife and Fork:</strong> To die. Compare “pegging-out,” “hopping the twig,” and similar flippancies.</p>\n<p><strong>Monkey With a Long Tail:</strong> A mortgage.</p>\n<p><strong>Month of Sundays:</strong> An indefinite period, a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>Muckender:</strong> A pocket handkerchief, snottinger.</p>\n<p><strong>Nose-ender:</strong> A straight blow delivered full on the nasal promontory.</p>\n<p><strong>Nose in the Manger:</strong> To put one’s nose in the manger, to sit down to eat. To “put on the nose-bag” is to eat hurriedly, or to eat while continuing at work.</p>\n<p><strong>O’clock: </strong>“Like one o’clock” — a favorite comparison with the lower orders, implying briskness; otherwise “like winkin’.” “To know what’s o’clock” is to be wide-awake, sharp, and experienced.</p>\n<p><strong>Off One’s Chump:</strong> To be crazy is to be off one’s chump; this is varied by the word “chumpy.” A mild kind of lunatic is also said to be “off his head,” which means of course exactly the same as the first phrase.</p>\n<p><strong>Off the Horn: </strong>A term used in reference to very hard steak.</p>\n<p><strong>Out of Print:</strong> Slang made use of by booksellers. In speaking of any person that is dead, they observe, “he is out of print.”</p>\n<p><strong>Perpendicular:</strong> A lunch taken standing-up at a tavern bar. It is usual to call it lunch, often as the perpendicular may take the place of dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>Pocket:</strong> To put up with. A man who does not resent an affront is said to pocket it.</p>\n<p><strong>Pot-hunter:</strong> A man who gives his time up to rowing or punting, or any sort of match in order to win the “pewters” which are given as prizes. The term is now much used in aquatic and athletic circles, and is applied, in a derogatory sense, to men of good quality who enter themselves in small races they are almost sure to win, and thus deprive the juniors of small trophies which should be above the attention of champions, though valuable to beginners. Also an unwelcome guest, who manages to be just in time for dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>Rain Napper:</strong> Umbrella.</p>\n<p><strong>Rib: </strong>Wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Rumbumptious:</strong> Haughty, pugilistic.</p>\n<p><strong>Rusty Guts:</strong> A blunt, rough, old fellow.</p>\n<p><strong>Saucebox:</strong> A pert young person, in low life also signifies the mouth.</p>\n<p><strong>Saw Your Timber: </strong>“Be off!” equivalent to “cut your stick.” Occasionally varied, with mock refinement, to “amputate your mahogany.”</p>\n<p><strong>Scandal-water:</strong> Tea; from old maids’ tea parties being generally a focus for scandal.</p>\n<p><strong>Shake the Elbow:</strong> A roundabout expression for dice-playing. To “crook the elbow” is an Americanism for “to drink.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sit-upons:</strong> Trousers.</p>\n<p><strong>Smeller:</strong> The nose; “a blow on the smeller” is often to be found in pugilistic records.</p>\n<p><strong>Sneeze-lurker:</strong> A thief who throws snuff in a person’s face, and then robs him.</p>\n<p><strong>Sneezer: </strong>A pocket handkerchief.</p>\n<p><strong>Snooze-case:</strong> Pillow case.</p>\n<p><strong>Snotter, or Wipe-hauler:</strong> A pickpocket whose chief fancy is for gentlemen’s pocket handkerchiefs.</p>\n<p><strong>Sober-water:</strong> A jocular allusion to the uses of soda water.</p>\n<p><strong>Tail Down:</strong> To get the tail down generally means to lose courage. When a professional at any game loses heart in a match he is said to get his tail down. “His tail was quite down, and it was all over.” The origin is obvious.</p>\n<p><strong>Tune the Old Cow Died Of:</strong> An epithet for any ill-played or discordant piece of music.</p>\n<p>___________________</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><em>Grose’s Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</em>, 1823</p>\n<p><em>The Slang Dictionary</em>, 1874</p>\n<p><em>Slang and Its Analogues Past and Present</em>, 1891</p>\n<p><em>Dictionary of Americanisms</em>, 1877</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manly-slang-from-the-19th-century/\">Manly Slang from the 19th Century</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/xQFVYghzPCw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 11:02:49 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"de7d8c562f8c9c014a142284f50e5d6f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2010/03/slang-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn13@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-00-210_01c1e9c72a6d3638.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/xQFVYghzPCw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-29-53-920_d3d0a35cffd5e5d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901783728},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:43","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:43","title":"How to Test if a Plant Is Edible","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=129613","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129634\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1.jpg 1200w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1-768x1328.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1-888x1536.jpg 888w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1-1184x2048.jpg 1184w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1-320x553.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Edible-1-640x1107.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></img></p>\n<p>Many people, especially outdoorsy types, know the story of Christopher McCandless, as famously told in author Jon Krakauer’s book (and the film of the same name) <i>Into the Wild. </i></p>\n<p>After surviving in the Alaskan wilderness for over 100 days, the rogue adventurer ultimately died in an abandoned bus there. The official cause of McCandless’ death has always been listed as starvation, but Krakauer felt like there was more to the story. In a journal entry a few weeks before he died, McCandless wrote, “Extremely weak. Fault of pot. seed . . .” He was referring to seeds from Eskimo potato, also known as alpine sweetvetch.</p>\n<p>After years of investigation, Kraukeur and a chemist discovered a toxin in the potato seeds that could have extremely negative effects on the body, if enough of them were consumed. </p>\n<p>The story of Christopher McCandless reminds us that eating and foraging wild plants is a risky game. As a hiker or backpacker, you might encounter a thousand plant species on a single trip, and any number of them might be edible. Others . . . could kill you with a single bite. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/wild-edible-plants/\">The best way to determine if a plant is edible is to study up before you ever hit the trail</a>, and consider carrying an edible plant identification guide. But, if you find yourself in a desperate situation, and you’re not sure if you can eat something or not, there is a universal edibility test, which we walk you through above, that can lead you toward safer plants. </p>\n<p><strong>Like this illustrated guide?

Despite this venerable history, and though I’m a guy who generally respects tradition, I think it’s perfectly fine to toy with its long-standing formula in the modern age. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That begins with how the s’more is roasted: while campfire-generated flame is certainly ideal, if that’s not an option because you’re living under a burn ban or due to other circumstances, you can get perfectly suitable results in roasting your mallows over a grill, gas stove, or propane fire pit. You can also get indoor s’more makers powered by </span><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lnNt7x\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electricity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lnJk3v\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sternos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which are great for parties. You can even make them in the microwave or en masse on a baking sheet in the oven, though the results aren’t quite the same, and you miss out on attempting </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-roast-the-perfect-marshmallow/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the masterful, delicate art of roasting your marshmallow to a perfect golden brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A break from tradition is also entirely acceptable when it comes to the actual recipe of the s’more itself. A sandwich of two graham crackers, toasted marshmallow, and ½ chocolate bar is undeniably tasty, but certainly does not represent the limits to which the s’more horizon can extend. A few swaps and tweaks can actually elevate the classic treat to new heights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last few weeks, with help from various friends and family members, I’ve experimented with a number of these s’more “recipe” variations and upgrades. The fun part of the testing was doing it sort of buffet-style, laying out all the possible ingredients and allowing everyone to sample and rank their favorite combinations. Our findings were dutifully filed (with sticky fingers), and you’ll find our recommendations grouped into the four categories below. </span></p>\n<h3>1. Swap Out the Hershey’s for Other Chocolates</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_129531\" style=\"width: 612px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129531\" class=\"wp-image-129531 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/gooey.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/gooey.jpg 602w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/gooey-320x272.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129531\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chocolates with caramel, like Ghirardelli’s caramel-filled squares, make especially good substitutions for a Hershey’s bar.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and best upgrade for your s’mores is to use other candies besides a plain old Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bar. The thick, rounded shape of other candy bars (like Snickers) makes them a little tougher to work with, so look for alternatives that still have a flatter, easy-to-sandwich architecture. Taking a stroll down the candy aisle of a drug or grocery store will give you plenty of ideas to experiment with; here are a few that work particularly well:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghirardelli’s filled chocolate squares (especially the ones with caramel)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolos (sort of shove them into the marshmallow) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symphony almond and toffee bars</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro tip: With any kind of chocolate, let the just-toasted marshmallow sit on top of it for 20-30 seconds in order to let its heat melt the candy a bit.</span></p>\n<h3>2. Swap Out the Graham Crackers for Other Cookies</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129534\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/oreo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/oreo.jpg 450w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/oreo-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides swapping out the inner components of the s’more, you can also change the exterior. Rather than using a graham cracker, sandwich your marshmallow and chocolate (or other candy) between two scrumptious cookies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not just any cookie works, though. In our testing, the group consensus was that soft cookies, like Chips Ahoy Chewy, weren’t texturally different enough from the chewy marshmallow. It all just sort of blended together. It wasn’t an unanimous opinion though — one of our friends indeed loved the chewy cookie s’more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any crunchy cookie will do, though something </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crunchy will just squish the marshmallow out the sides and back as you’re chomping down. It requires a surprisingly Goldilocks approach, which thankfully just involves some tasty experimentation. Here are a few can’t-miss options:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oreos</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chips Ahoy! (non-chewy)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fudge Striped Cookies (use a piece of chocolate to cover the hole on the bottom cookie)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lorna Doone Shortbread Cookies</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A note on Oreos: The tactic there is to separate the Oreo and put the toasted mallow between the two pieces. I added an extra bit of chocolate bar, too. Though the Oreo is admittedly a touch small, the result is, nonetheless, a chocolatey, creamy concoction with a perfect textural balance of creamy, crunchy, and melty-squishy. </span></p>\n<h3>3. Add Interesting Toppings</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_129533\" style=\"width: 572px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129533\" class=\"wp-image-129533 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/nutella.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/nutella.jpg 562w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/nutella-320x370.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129533\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banana + Nutella makes for an awesome s’more combo.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because a standard s’more has only three ingredients — cracker/cookie, chocolate, and marshmallow — doesn’t mean you can’t add more elements into the mix. Fruits (their natural sweetness adds a nice balance to the artificial sugariness of the mallow), nut butter spreads, and even everyone’s favorite salty meat add another layer of flavor to the sandwich. Try:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banana slices</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raspberries</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strawberry slices</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peanut butter (alone or + banana slice)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutella (can be used in place of a chocolate bar, or in addition, and by itself or paired with fruit) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bacon</span></li>\n</ul><div id=\"attachment_129529\" style=\"width: 598px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129529\" class=\"wp-image-129529 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/bacon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/bacon.jpg 588w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/bacon-320x354.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129529\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bacon adds a nice savoriness to an otherwise very sweet s’more sandwich.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A note on the bacon: Yes, it requires some prep work — bacon needs to be cooked beforehand — but it adds a salty, crispy complement to the sweet meltiness of the mallow. The key is to add more bacon than you’d think. We started with just half a strip, thinking the strong flavor would more than hold its own. But it actually just got lost in the marshmallow. With a full strip (split into two halves to offer better coverage), you can really taste the bacon and get all the flavors together. </span></p>\n<h3>4. Dip It in Baileys</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129530\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/baileys.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/baileys.jpg 450w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/baileys-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S’mores are often thought of as a kids’ treat, but they’re of course enjoyed by all ages — and the grown-up set will particularly like this last twist. While there are a number of ways to use booze in a s’more, we found the best to also be the simplest: pour a few ounces of Baileys Irish Cream into a small dish; then, after toasting the marshmallow and while it’s still on the roasting stick, dunk it into the liquid and place it on a prepared cracker. You’d think it would be messy, but it’s really not.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What at first seemed like it would be a kitschy idea turned out to be one of my favorites. This one can (and should) be utilized in combination with any of the above. The Baileys adds a wonderful, almost surprising flavor to any of the other upgrades (or just a regular ole s’more, or roasted mallow on its own). I didn’t expect to actually taste the Baileys as much as I did. Delish. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/4-ways-to-upgrade-your-smores/\">4 Ways to Upgrade
