It was also one of the most uncomfortable. Ditching the cable for wire-free VR is definitely the way forward as far as I&#8217;m concerned, but not when the headset in question crushes my nose, pinches my cheeks and makes me feel like I wanted to rip it off my head after just 30 minutes of use. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, the <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/09/16/oculus-quest-2-will-start-at-299-when-it-launches-in-october-replacing-the-rift-s/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oculus Quest 2</a> addresses all of these concerns and more. Its lighter, slimmer chassis sits much more evenly on my head, and its redesigned strap makes it much easier to get a better, more comfortable fit. It also brings with it several key spec upgrades, a lower price, and that all-important flexibility to plug it into your PC via its <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/05/19/you-can-now-use-any-usb-cable-with-your-oculus-quest-on-pc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oculus Link</a> technology if you want to take advantage of their more demanding Rift experiences.
