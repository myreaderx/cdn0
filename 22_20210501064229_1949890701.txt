Last year, the Mexican government confirmed at least one of its citizens had been the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-citizen-received-non-consensual-surgery-while-in-ice-detention-2020-10\">victim of an unauthorized surgery</a> while detained there.</p>\n<p>\"Do I still have ovaries?\" one person asked after waking up from an operation, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-22/women-allege-medical-abuse-georgia-immigration-detention\">the Los Angeles Times reported</a>. \"Can I still have kids?\"</p>\n<p>ICE states it only has records of two women undergoing hysterectomies. But dozens of women are now taking part in <a href=\"https://time.com/5924021/women-lawsuit-irwin-detention-ice/\">a class-action lawsuit</a> against Dr. Mahendra Amin, the gynecologist who performed the surgeries, alleging medical malpractice that in some cases is alleged to have been tantamount to sexual assault. Amin is not board certified and LaSalle Corrections, the for-profit company that runs the detention center, has severed its relationship with him.</p>\n<p>\"ICE knew about this as far back as 2018 and yet they did nothing,\" Azadeh Shahshahani, Legal &amp; Advocacy Director at Project South, the group that publicized the whistleblower complaint in September 2020, told Insider. \"I think the explanation there is the dehumanization of the Black and brown immigrant women at this detention center.\"</p>\n<p>Some of those women have since been deported; the majority have been released; and about 80 to 100 men are still there, according to Shahshahani, who is co-counsel on the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Removing the women who were still being detained in Irwin County is an acknowledgement, Shahshahani said, that the critics were right. Still, where some of these women have gone is not seen as much of an upgrade. </p>\n<p>The Stewart Detention Center, about 140 miles south of Atlanta, is run by CoreCivic, one of the largest for-profit prison companies. While the facility has over the years developed a <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2021/02/02/ice-now-detaining-women-at-one-of-nations-most-deadly-facilities/\">reputation for medical neglect</a>, Shahshahani believes it's been picked - after not hosting women for more than a decade - because it lacks the infamy that now taints the Irwin County Detention Center.</p>\n<p>Detention Watch Network, a group that advocates shuttering immigration detention centers altogether, is calling for the women to be released.</p>\n<p>\"The Irwin detention center is emblematic of how the immigration detention system as a whole is inherently abusive, unjust and fatally flawed beyond repair,\" Setareh Ghandehari, the group's advocacy director, said in a statement. \"The Biden administration must shut down detention centers immediately and end detention contracts.\"</p>\n<p>As of 2019, ICE had contracts with 106 privately run detention facilities, according to <a href=\"https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-02/OIG-19-18-Jan19.pdf\">a report</a> by the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General. The vast majority of detained immigrants are being held in for-profit ventures.</p>\n<p>During a speech Thursday, not far from the Irwin County Detention Center, activists interrupted President Joe Biden, demanding that he \"abolish private detention.\"</p>\n<p>\"Private detention centers should not exist,\" Biden responded, \"and we are working to close all of them.\"</p>\n<p>But that is not what is happening. A week after taking office, Biden <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-private-prisons-executive-order-official-calls-trump-dangerous-2021-1\">signed an executive order</a> requiring the Department of Justice to phase out its use of for-profit prisons - but the order does not not extend to ICE.</p>\n<p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article251034949.html\">the Miami Herald reported</a> the Biden administration is conducting negotiations with GEO Group, a private prison company, about renewing a contract to run an ICE detention center in Florida.</p>\n<p>\"They say the right thing, which is welcome,\" Shahshahani told Insider, \"but they need to follow that up with action.\"</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

If you change phones, as long as you keep the SIM card, these contacts and text messages will come with you to the new phone.</p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>Types of SIM cards</strong></h2><p>SIM cards need to fit in mobile phones, so as time has progressed, there has been a need for smaller cards as phones have become increasingly thin and filled with larger batteries and more sophisticated electronics.</p><p>Today there are several kinds of SIM cards:<br><br></p><ul><li><strong>Full SIM</strong>: No longer in use, the original SIM card was developed in the 1990s and measured 86x54mm. Despite the large size, virtually all of it was a plastic card - the actual contact surface was the same as later cards.</li><li><strong>Mini-SIM</strong>: Because the full-size SIM is no longer used, these days this is often thought of as the full or standard SIM. It measures 25x15mm and the contact surface is surrounded by a large segment of plastic.  </li><li><strong>Micro-SIM</strong>: A micro-SIM has the exact same contact surface but is smaller (15x12mm) because the plastic is trimmed away, leaving a card almost entirely of just the contact surface. </li><li><strong>Nano-SIM</strong>: This is the smallest SIM format in use today. It has a smaller contact surface, making it physically incompatible with older phones that expect a micro-SIM. It measures 12.3x8.8mm.</li><li><strong>eSIM</strong>: An embedded SIM, or eSIM, is a new, emerging format in which the SIM is embedded directly into the device and is therefore not removable. Although not widely used, the advantage of an eSIM is that it allows you to change phones without transferring SIM cards; the mobile operator transfers the account information remotely. </li></ul></aside><h2>How to remove a SIM card</h2><p>SIM cards vary in size, but they all work the same way - they&#39;re designed to be easily transferred between phones. Your phone probably came with a small SIM card removal tool (it looks like a small pin), but if you&#39;ve misplaced yours, you can use a small paperclip.</p><p>Find the SIM tray on the side of your phone and insert the SIM tool or paperclip in the hole; the tray should pop out easily. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c67adf22c6b00185db12c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What is a SIM card 2\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A SIM card in its tray with a SIM removal tool.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For more details on how to do this, see our articles on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-remove-sim-card-from-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to remove the SIM card from an iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-remove-sim-card-from-samsung-galaxy-s10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samsung Galaxy phone</a>.

And, if you want to brew cafe-quality drinks in your kitchen while building your skills, a home espresso maker is a necessity.</p><p>To achieve a perfect pour, you&#39;ll need a good machine that can produce and maintain roughly 8 to 10 bars of pressure, and hold up after being turned on and off hundreds (and ideally thousands) of times.</p><p>For our guide, we looked at semi-automatic machines as well as manual and fully automated pod-based devices that are made for home use. In order to find the best for most people, we consulted a handful of experts and baristas, conducted extensive testing, and held multiple blind taste tests. We also tested budget semi-automatic machines and professional units, but we passed on these because they didn&#39;t meet our criteria. (Read more about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-espresso-machine#our-testing-methodology-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our methodology</a>.)</p><p>It&#39;s important to note that making quality espresso can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition to the machine, you&#39;ll need <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-espresso-machine#what-do-you-need-to-make-espresso-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good burr grinder</a>, which can cost at least $250 for one that is suitable for espresso. You&#39;ll also need to factor in top-grade beans, accessories, and lots of trial and error if you&#39;re a newbie. Expect to pay at least $400 for a capable automated machine, not including the grinder; a manual device is cheaper, but it will still add up.</p><p>When it comes to picking the gear that&#39;s right for you, &#34;you get what you pay for, but you should also take your own level of experience into consideration,&#34; said Jordan Rosenacker, the executive creative director of <a href=\"https://atlascoffeeclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Atlas Coffee Club</a>. &#34;If you&#39;re just learning the ropes, get an affordable machine that won&#39;t break your heart when - and yes, when - it breaks down.&#34;</p><h2>The best espresso machines you can buy in 2021</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>Best overall espresso machine: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ3NL76/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07RQ3NL76&linkId=395882de4db6b277801cc9b20da6c9384db6b277801cc9b20da6c938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Gaggia Classic Pro</a></li><li>Best all-in-one espresso machine: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08133HX34?tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Breville Barista Pro</a></li><li>Best manual device: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X916JM8/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&slotNum=23&imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&ie=UTF8&tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06X916JM8&linkId=5eef4bd46a358ce4d8338d7133424771kId=5eef4bd46a358ce4d8338d7133424771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Flair Espresso</a></li><li>Best pod espresso machine: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SRDQBY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipg_01092019_best-coffee-pod-machines-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07SRDQBY2&linkId=34446c65690dc5ccbb30fb6b972cd908690dc5ccbb30fb6b972cd908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Breville-Nespresso Pixie</a></li></ul><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Updated on 04/30/2021:</strong> We recently discussed espresso machine budgets and do&#39;s and don&#39;ts with Onyx Coffee Labs&#39; Lance Hedrick (check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/LanceHedrick/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his Youtube channel</a>), tested Breville&#39;s new <a href=\"https://breville.oie8.net/c/196318/501677/8631?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fespresso%2Fbes450.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Bambino</a> (not to be confused with Breville&#39;s older <a href=\"https://breville.oie8.net/c/196318/501677/8631?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fespresso%2Fbes500.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Bambino Plus</a>) for a potential pick, and while we didn&#39;t fall in love with it, we were impressed with the machine considering its price ($299).

There are three buttons with corresponding lights (letting you know when the machine is primed) and a steam valve. The fact that there's no adjusting can seem a bit limiting at first, but fewer variables are a good thing for the budding barista.</p><p>It's a single-boiler model, which means it's going to take a while to switch between pulling shots and priming the steam wand (although this shouldn't be a problem if you're only making a few drinks at once). And while Gaggia claims that this machine puts out 15 bars of pressure, you really only need nine to achieve true espresso.&#160;</p><p>It also includes a small dosing spoon and a plastic tamping device, which &#8212; I have to admit &#8212; feels a little cheap considering that the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ3NL76/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07RQ3NL76&#38;linkId=395882de4db6b277801cc9b20da6c938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Classic Pro</a> used to come with a nicely-weighted stainless steel tamper. That being said, you don't need to put much muscle behind tamping in the first place, and those plastic parts do get the job done.&#160;</p><h3>Testing notes</h3><p>While the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ3NL76/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07RQ3NL76&#38;linkId=395882de4db6b277801cc9b20da6c938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Gaggia Classic Pro</a> was a little less forgiving than the Breville Barista (both Express and Pro), I found that when I took my time, I was able to get a much more sophisticated shot. On my first few tries, I produced some bitter over-extractions &#8212; which at least prove that the machine is up to the task when it comes to pressure &#8212; but when I nailed it, which was around the 30-second mark for a one-ounce pour, I was rewarded with some of the best espresso I've ever made. Here, I should mention that I've also tested machines in the $2,000 range.</p><p>That's not to say that this model isn't without its shortcomings. The plastic tamping device I mentioned earlier falls a couple of millimeters short of fitting the portafilter baskets (although <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tamper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tampers</a> are easy to upgrade). I also wish there was a dedicated water spout, but you can get water out of the steam wand and the brewing head, provided you purge them of milk and coffee grounds first.</p><p>One last gripe: The portafilter baskets tend to stick to the group head if you don't remove your portafilter right away. This is a bit annoying, but it does show what a great seal you get between the group head and basket, and it's nothing you can't manage: If you do end up forgetting to remove it, just turn the machine on when you're ready for another shot, let it warm up, and it should come off easily enough.</p><p>You get a two-year limited warranty with this machine, but it doesn't cover user error. It's important to descale &#8212; or remove limescale deposits from &#8212; the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ3NL76/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07RQ3NL76&#38;linkId=395882de4db6b277801cc9b20da6c938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Classic Pro</a> regularly, which goes for all espresso machines and can be done at home with a simple vinegar solution.&#160;</p><p>If you want to put time and effort into learning how to make espresso like a professional, don't have a lot of counter space, or on a relatively tight budget, invest in a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ3NL76/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07RQ3NL76&#38;linkId=395882de4db6b277801cc9b20da6c938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Gaggia Classic Pro</a> and a good burr grinder and you'll have a long way to go before you outgrow your setup.&#160;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gaggia-classic-pro-espresso-machine-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of the Gaggia Classic Pro, including detailed specs</a>.</h3>\n\tThe best espresso machine with a built-in grinder\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f99df4f69331a0011bc5ece?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best espresso machine 2021 breville barista pro 4x3\" height=\"1249\" width=\"1666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chloé Seytre/Courtesy of Owen Burke/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>Equipped with Breville's Smart Grinder Pro and everything you need to make espresso save for the beans, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CH9QWOU/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=5&#38;imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00CH9QWOU&#38;linkId=303ed70d7142708c64d3194d649da735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Breville Barista Pro</a> is among the easiest and fastest ways you can get a close-to-caf&#233;-quality pour at home.</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>No need to buy a grinder, user-friendly, quick prep time</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Doesn't include the pressure gauge found on other models, built-in grinder could have more settings, probably not repairable out of two-year limited product warranty</p><p>A faster, quieter, and more digitally advanced version of its predecessor the Barista Express, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CH9QWOU/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=5&#38;imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00CH9QWOU&#38;linkId=303ed70d7142708c64d3194d649da735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Barista Pro</a> is equipped with the brand's excellent <a href=\"http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fcoffee-grinders%2Fbcg820.html&#38;xcust=1603285654398anib03h0m%7Cxid:fr1603285658314aia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Smart Grinder Pro</a>, which would run you $200 on its own.

Still, everyone enjoyed the espresso it produced, and by putting slightly finer grounds through it compared to other machines, we were able to achieve results nearly on par with the Gaggia's.&#160;</p><p>Some minor pitfalls: Having the hopper over the boiler is a potential problem, since coffee needs to be stored in a cool dry space, and while we appreciate the built-in grinder for convenience, there could be more grind settings to accommodate different beans. Again, a pressure gauge is a very helpful learning instrument, and we wish it was included.

Why? Again, it's about control. You pour water directly from a kettle and adjust the pressure manually until you get a steady golden flow of thick, <em>crema</em>-rich java. Machines in the same price bracket as the Flair often start out with excessive pressure and end a little on the light side.&#160;</p><p>What makes this device relatively foolproof is the fact that the cylinder has a maximum water capacity of 60ml, so controlling extraction time for somewhere between 30 and 45 seconds (for espresso and more concentrated ristretto, respectively) is actually much easier, and you can get the hang of maintaining the right pressure pretty quickly.&#160;</p><p>This maker weighs just under five pounds and it's portable, which means you can use it anywhere so long as you have a way to boil water. And, unlike most of the machines we tested, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X916JM8/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=23&#38;imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B06X916JM8&#38;linkId=5eef4bd46a358ce4d8338d7133424771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Flair</a> comes with an impressively long five-year limited warranty.</p><h3>Testing notes</h3><p>Sure enough, Kehn was right. During a series of five rounds of blind taste tests, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X916JM8/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=23&#38;imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B06X916JM8&#38;linkId=5eef4bd46a358ce4d8338d7133424771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Flair</a> won four times &#8212; three unanimously. There's something about being able to control the pressure with your own hands that allows you to deliver a steady flow. Everyone involved in the blind taste test agreed that the intensity of flavor, viscosity or texture, and strength was favorable to almost every other shot we pulled from the other machines, save for the Gaggia Classic Pro a couple of times.</p><p>The only caveat here is that when we adjusted the grinder to finer settings to find the threshold of each device, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X916JM8/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=23&#38;imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B06X916JM8&#38;linkId=5eef4bd46a358ce4d8338d7133424771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Flair</a> was the first to choke and we could not physically pull a shot without breaking the device &#8212; a sticker on the lever warns not to exceed 70 pounds of pressure. (Even if we had, the resulting espresso would have been unpalatably bitter judging from the drops we were able to manage.)</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X916JM8/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=23&#38;imprToken=90ba8e7b-05d5-a86d-c6d&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B06X916JM8&#38;linkId=5eef4bd46a358ce4d8338d7133424771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Flair</a> requires a little more effort and time to operate than your average espresso machine, but it is the easiest and most budget-friendly way to get the best possible shot you can, especially if you're new to the espresso game. The fact that it doesn't take up much counter space is another bonus. If you want to step up and spend a little more, Kehn recommends the Cafelat Robot, which he says is the \"same animal,\" but heftier and made with all metal components.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flair-espresso-maker-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Read our full review of the Flair Original Espresso Maker here.</a></h3>\n\tThe best pod espresso machine\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f846e8b642e9400180b555e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best espresso machine 2021 Breville-Nespresso Pixie\" height=\"2937\" width=\"3916\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Owen Burke/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>If you want to keep your investment low and save time, there's no better way to go than the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SRDQBY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_01092019_best-coffee-pod-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07SRDQBY2&#38;linkId=34446c65690dc5ccbb30fb6b972cd908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Breville-Nespresso Pixie</a>.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Easy, convenient, affordable, small footprint</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Pods can get expensive, on the lower end of espresso, pod grounds are not fresh</p><p>Turn the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SRDQBY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_01092019_best-coffee-pod-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07SRDQBY2&#38;linkId=34446c65690dc5ccbb30fb6b972cd908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Nespresso Pixie</a>&#160;on, pop in a pod, press a button, and within under a minute you will have an espresso-like drink, foamy <em>crema </em>and all.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SRDQBY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_01092019_best-coffee-pod-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07SRDQBY2&#38;linkId=34446c65690dc5ccbb30fb6b972cd908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Pixie</a>&#160;has just two settings: one for espresso and one for a lungo, which is just a long, or more diluted pour of an espresso.

Even if you buy the freshest pods you can, they're no competition for freshly roasted and ground beans from a good local roaster.</p><p>Still, the <em>crema </em>was certainly present. And everyone in the testing group agreed this machine does the trick in a pinch, which is how most coffee is made at home anyway.&#160;</p><p>When you use the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SRDQBY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_01092019_best-coffee-pod-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07SRDQBY2&#38;linkId=34446c65690dc5ccbb30fb6b972cd908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Pixie</a>, you're mostly limited to what comes in pods, which is where the device falls short of espresso machines with group heads and portafilters. There are refillable capsules (see our <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-coffee-and-espresso-pod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide to coffee and espresso pods</a>), and you can get much better results by using fresh beans and grinding them yourself, but that eliminates the point of a pod machine. That said, if this is the route you want to go, it's manageable, if somewhat frustrating to fill and tamp tiny little capsules with a teaspoon of grounds.&#160;</p><p>Take this machine for what it is, considering its compact size, convenience, and price. Using pods can be expensive but there's no way you're going to get espresso (or espresso-like drinks) into a demitasse any faster than this, which is almost certainly the way to go&#160;for the convenience crowd.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-coffee-and-espresso-pod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out our guide on the best coffee pod machines</a>.</h3>\n\tWhat else we tested\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ca19789569b5571013a0f63?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best espresso machine 2021 Breville Espresso Machine 1\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hollis Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>What else we recommend and why:</strong></h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-the-bambino-espresso-machine%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Breville Bambino</a> ($299.95): </strong>Breville's newest addition, the Bambino, is its most pared-down offering.

The problem is, it is a bonafide challenge to learn how to pull a good shot of espresso out of one of these things, and it takes time.

Since there are currently more options in the way of third-party pods and refillable capsules for Nespresso machines (currently, there are no refillable Illy capsules), you should go with Nespresso. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-espresso-machine#the-best-pod-machine-4\">model we recommend above</a> is among the most affordable, and there's little point in splurging when you decide to buy a pod machine. If you want frothed drinks, consider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-milk-frother\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investing in a frother</a> separately, which is easier to use <em>and&#160;</em>clean.</p><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bedbathandbeyond.com%2Fstore%2Fproduct%2Faeropress-reg-coffee-espresso-maker%2F126430%3FskuId%3D17429019%26enginename%3Dgoogle%26mcid%3DPS_googlepla_nonbrand_coffeetea_online%26product_id%3D17429019%26adtype%3Dpla%26product_channel%3Donline%26adpos%3D%26creative%3D356296492463%26device%3Dc%26matchtype%3D%26network%3Dg%26rkg_id%3D0%26utm_campaignid%3D71700000053870711%26utm_adgroupid%3D58700005143200875%26targetid%3D92700045203754089%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KLiW2X1MnZes1C5__83tRX32G6K5y9ljYyRXVMTN4kW8CTjIHhDkdQaApwhEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Aeropress</strong></a><strong> ($29.99)</strong><strong>:</strong> Aeropress is a great coffee-making tool that many a coffee snob keeps on their kitchen counter, where it is their sole coffee-brewing device.

In addition, we factored in pricing to determine a machine's overall value.</p><h3>Noting TDS measurements</h3><p>We wanted to make sure we were getting true espresso, which is generally agreed to be at least somewhere between 7% and 12% total dissolved solids (TDS). Getting more involved, you'll find some baristas reaching extraction percentages in the 20% range, but we stuck with the basics.</p><p>To measure TDS, we used a device called the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LTH2PUG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00LTH2PUG&#38;linkId=b65324fd3306119cafada174e4db5d35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Atago Pocket Barista</a>, which gave us concrete proof that some machines are better able to churn out a thicker, richer, more viscous potion without over-extracting than others.&#160;</p><h3>Holding taste tests&#160;</h3><p>We held several side-by-side blind taste tests and used the freshest roasts we could get our hands on from <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/TUJGRk1NTEJGSEhLR01CRktORkdH?url=https%3A%2F%2Fatlascoffeeclub.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Atlas Coffee Club</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stonestreetcoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stone Street Coffee Company</a>,&#160;and <a href=\"https://counterculturecoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Counter Culture Coffee.</a> These taste tests involved dialing a grinder to prepare grounds for 30-second extraction times, then having five participants taste shots from four machines that became our final contenders.</p><h3>Pulling shot after shot to check for consistency</h3><p>Dozens of hours were spent grinding and pulling shots from more than 10 pounds of fresh coffee beans. We paid close attention to the consistency of brewing to see if we could pull the same four shots in a row. We got very close with almost every machine, but the \"machine\" that seemed to work the best was the Flair Espresso Maker, a manual lever device. Chalk it up to the fact that we were better able to control the flow of pressure ourselves.</p><h3>Considering prices</h3><p>We found that the sweet spot for a reliable entry-level home espresso machine is around $400-$500. But remember, you'll still need a good burr grinder. Lance Hedrick of Onyx Coffee Lab recommends budgeting for a grinder of at least the same price, if not twice that. If you have the budget, consider spending much more on a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-coffee-grinder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">burr grinder</a>.</p><p>Anything less, and you're probably investing in a machine that might be able to produce the standard nine bars of pressure, but won't necessarily maintain it throughout the brewing process. We did test several machines in the $100-$300 range but found that they fell short in producing thick, full-bodied, and <em>crema</em>-rich espresso. Likewise, you can step up into the four figures, but according to Kehn, \"At some point, there are diminishing returns.\"</p>\n\tWhat we're testing next\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8f4a37b0526700185cc772?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Flair Espresso\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>We're working on adding a recommendation for a fully automatic machine, and while those we've already tested &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XV3U82?tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Gaggia's Brera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fdelonghi-dinamica-fully-automatic-coffee-espresso-machine%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">DeLonghi's Magnifica</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/saeco-picobaristo-super-automatic-espresso-machine-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saeco's PicoBaristo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.terrakaffe.com/product/tk-01-b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Terra Kaffe's TK-01</a> &#8212; all worked well, none really turned out espresso comparable to the more budget-friendly semiautomatic machines in this guide.

On top of the financial commitment, it's going to take time and patience. Be prepared to dedicate a good section of your kitchen counter to your kit, accept that you're going to make plenty of mistakes along the way, and know that it is part science and part art. Above all else, dedication is everything.</p><p>If you're just getting started, expect to spend a lot of time pouring bad shots down the drain, fussing with settings as you learn to dial in your machine, and cleaning up coffee grounds. It costs about $700 to $800 just to get up and running with a machine and a burr grinder. If you're willing to go the manual route, you can get a portable device and a burr grinder for under $500, but that's still costly.</p><p>Making espresso is one of the most time-consuming and messy ways to produce a cup (let alone demitasse) of coffee. If, in the end, you need something quick and easy on your way out the door in the morning, you may want to consider the Nespresso system. On the flip side, know that are few things as rewarding in the world of home coffee as achieving an immaculate shot of velvety espresso all on your own.</p><hr /><h3><strong>What do I need to make espresso?</strong></h3><p><strong>Fresh coffee beans:</strong>&#160;Paramount to making espresso are coffee oils, so you need freshly roasted coffee beans. If you're buying months-old coffee and putting it through an espresso machine, you're not going to get a lot of the coveted foam or any of the nuanced flavors associated with espresso. Simply put, get the best, freshest coffee beans you can find. If you like traditional coffee with chocolatey-nutty flavors, go with a medium-dark roast. If you like brighter, more nuanced flavors with floral, citrus, and fruit profiles, go with a light roast.</p><p><strong>A burr grinder:</strong> Okay, here's where many of us make our most crucial mistake. Any old grinder simply will not do.</p><p>The coffee grinder you choose is possibly more important than the device itself. For espresso, you'll want a burr grinder, which is made up of two serrated pieces of ceramic or steel that uniformly grind in a way that blade grinders, which indiscriminately chop like blenders, do not. Uniform grounds are always superior, but they're paramount when it comes to espresso. Our<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-coffee-grinder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> guide to coffee grinders</a> is in the process of being updated, but we like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075G11F9N/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B075G11F9N&#38;linkId=d05979aa2154779ce127fc844a116192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Baratza Sette 30</a>&#160;or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G82WVZ0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_042717_best-espresso-machines-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01G82WVZ0&#38;linkId=d0c91c58c4908e9908dfe1901ffcbbbd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Baratza Sette 270</a>&#160;for now.</p><p>No matter the beans you use, you want to wind up with grounds that are somewhere between white flour and table salt. If it's so fine that it's almost comparable to dust, the machine is likely going to choke and pour next to nothing. If your grounds are too coarse, you'll get something more like watery coffee, which will have no <em>crema</em>.</p><p><strong>Mineral water:&#160;</strong>The best water for making espresso, according to Lance Hedrick, is distilled water with an added mineral solution like this one from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYPX1Y4?tag=biip_112620_black-friday-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Third Wave Water</a>. Otherwise, any charcoal water filter will do. Just make sure to not use tap water, as that will scale up your machine and render it useless in six months' time.</p><p><strong>An espresso machine: </strong>Here's the thing: If you're not willing to put in the time to learn how to pull a shot like the professionals, you don't want a machine like the ones professionals use. Consider something more pared-down, like our top recommendation, the Gaggia Classic Pro (don't let the \"Pro\" intimidate you here, though), or something completely automatic.</p><hr /><h3>What are the different types of espresso?</h3><p><strong>Normale, or standard espresso:</strong> A standard espresso is the most traditional form of the drink, and it's usually defined by a 1:1.5 or 1:2 ratio of input (coffee in grams) to output (what ends up in your cup/demitasse), or by size at about one to 1.5 ounces (30ml-45ml).</p><p><strong>Ristretto:</strong> A ristretto is a 1:1 or 1:1.5 input to output ratio, or about three-quarters of an ounce (20ml-25ml) and an even more concentrated version of espresso where flavor profile is concerned. The caffeine amount is the same, or less because you're pulling a shot from the same amount of grounds.</p><p><strong>Lungo:&#160;</strong>A lungo is a slightly diluted espresso, somewhere between three and four ounces (90ml-120ml), which is between a normale and an Americano.</p><p><strong>Americano, or long black:</strong> An Americano is a shot of espresso diluted with hot water to fill out a cup.</p><hr /><h3>Why are espresso machines so expensive?</h3><p>An espresso machine contains a powerful motor that pumps near-boiling water through a chamber and out the group head (the part of the machine that receives the portafilter). Everything needs to be expertly sealed so that it can contain piping-hot water under immense pressure, or the machine won't work at all.</p><p>Good espresso machines are assembled by hand and are designed to be repaired. Just like your car's engine, the motor of an espresso machine needs a little care, and unfortunately, the very thing most of us do with at-home espresso machines is among the worst things one can do with a motor: repeatedly turn it on and off. This wears down on the motor and will require some level of repair after a few hundred shots.</p><p>They're also built using expensive components usually made of steel. Espresso machines need to be able to generate and maintain about nine bars of pressure at roughly 200 degrees Fahrenheit, and higher-end machines will allow you to control the temperature. On top of that, every component has to be able to withstand vastly changing temperatures, pressures, and levels of humidity since there's also steam involved.</p><hr /><h3>Can you make regular coffee with an espresso machine?</h3><p>This depends on your idea of coffee. The closest thing you can get to drip coffee is going to be an Americano, or a long black, which is an enjoyable way of stretching out that precious little ounce that is a shot. Simply pull a shot of espresso and then add whatever amount of hot water to fill out your cup.</p><p>If you're really looking to drink drip coffee most of the time, you may want to save your money and buy a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-coffee-maker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regular coffee machine</a>. Consider a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-stovetop-espresso-maker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stovetop moka pot</a> to have on hand for an espresso-like drink.</p>\n\tGlossary\n\t\n\t<p><strong>Espresso:</strong> A concentrated form of coffee made by forcing near-boiling water through finely-ground coffee using roughly seven to nine bars of pressure. A 1-ounce shot of espresso has 60 to 65mg of caffeine and a standard 8-ounce cup of coffee has anywhere from 95mg to 120mg.</p><p><strong>Burr grinder: </strong>A set of two abrasive surfaces capable of uniformly crushing coffee beans to a much finer form than a blade grinder.</p><p><strong>Group head, brew group, or brew head:</strong> The fixture on the front of an espresso machine that brings water from the machine and into the portafilter</p><p><strong>Portafilter:</strong> The holder for the basket and coffee grounds that attaches to the group head.</p><p><strong>Portafilter basket:</strong> The basket that fits into the portafilter and into which beans are ground and tamped.</p><p><strong>Portafilter basket (non-pressurized):</strong> Lined with a grid of tiny pinholes, these baskets allow the tamped grounds to generate their own pressure resistance to the group head, resulting in rich, foamy espresso.</p><p><strong>Portafilter basket (pressurized):</strong> Specially designed for pre-ground coffee and ESE pods that don't pack as tightly as fresh grounds, these have fewer holes and help build pressure resistance.</p><p><strong>Shot:</strong> A pour of espresso.</p><p><strong>Tamper:</strong> The device used to tamp down grounds into the portafilter basket.</p><p><strong>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): </strong>This is the percentage of solids dissolved into a solution. In the case of espresso, 7%-12% TDS is generally considered the threshold.</p>\n\tWho we consulted\n\t\n\t<p>To determine non-negotiable espresso machine features and narrow down my list of

travel restrictions on India starting Tuesday in light of the COVID-19 epidemic, barring most non-U.S. citizens from entering the United States, a White House official told Reuters.</p><p>The new restrictions are on the advice of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are imposed &#34;in light of extraordinarily high COVID-19 case loads and multiple variants circulating in India,&#34; the official said. A formal announcement is expected on Friday and the policy will take effect on Tuesday, May 4 at 12:01 a.m. ET.</p><p>Biden in January issued a similar ban on most non-U.S. citizens entering the country who have recently been in South Africa. He also reimposed an entry ban on nearly all non-U.S. travelers who have been in Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 26 countries in Europe that allow travel across open borders.</p><p>The policy means most non-U.S. citizens who have been in one of those countries - and now India - within the last 14 days are not eligible to travel to the United States. China and Iran are also both covered by the policy.</p><p>Second only to the United States in total infections, India has reported more than 300,000 new cases daily for nine days in a row, hitting another global record of 386,452 on Friday.</p><p>Total deaths have surpassed 200,000 and cases are nearing 19 million - nearly 8 million since February alone - as virulent new strains have combined with &#34;super-spreader&#34; events such as political rallies and religious festivals.</p><p>Medical experts say real numbers may be five to 10 times higher than the official tally.</p><p>Other countries have imposed similar travel restrictions on India, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Singapore, while Canada, Hong Kong and New Zealand have suspended all commercial travel with India.</p><p>Permanent U.S. residents and family members and some other non-U.S. citizens are permitted to return to the United States under the order.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-to-ban-most-travel-from-india-to-us-reuters-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/okAY1tNhzeA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 18:41:44 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608c4f2435c46f0018c0bae9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a5882293feb328b3abcff508f15fec79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn29@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-21-028_a4caaa7740bf8685.webp","destWidth":5347,"destHeight":4010,"sourceBytes":516518,"destBytes":516518,"author":"insider@insider.com (David Shepardson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606c5884a7d803001963eead?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn76@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-21-854_c84e64d3197169ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-23-799_65d1963394f9fab8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=okAY1tNhzeA:xSUN2r4BH4M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn87@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-22-754_74ae7ee844408dc0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/okAY1tNhzeA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn44@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-22-473_636c44f93aa8f59e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324324},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"Lush store shelves are bare as beauty company says its experiencing major supply chain woes","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/lush-retail-bath-bomb-supply-chain-shopping-shortage-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608b03dd34af8d0018599fc5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Lush shortage\" height=\"739\" width=\"828\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Shelves at a Lush store in Glendale, CA, in April\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alicia Huidor/Instagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Lush customers on social media have been complaining about a lack of inventory.</li>\n<li>On social media, Lush said it is experiencing a materials shortage but expected a resolution soon.</li>\n<li>Lush did not respond to a request for comment on the specifics of the shortage. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Lush has made waves on social media in the past month for empty shelves and low online inventory.

The limited raw material inventory means that an interruption in supply can be very noticeable. </p><p>The brand has not confirmed the exact nature of the interruption to its supply chain and did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Insider. It is possible that the shortages are in part due to ripple effects from the Suez Canal blockage last month. The Ever Given <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/suez-canal-reopened-supply-chain-issues-shipping-delays-experts-2021-3\">blocked shipping routes</a> from March 23 to 29, with major ripple

guide.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros:&#160;</strong>Easy to operate, uses propane canisters which can be purchased at gas stations and grocery stores, durable, two-burner design adds versatility</p><p><strong>Cons:&#160;</strong>For car camping only (you won't be packing this thing along on a backpacking trip)</p><p>This classic two-burner propane camp stove from Coleman is <em>the</em> quintessential camp stove &#8212; I'd ask you to think of something more iconic but it'd be a waste of time because you can't. And one of the main reasons it's as recognizable as it is is because it's just plain dependable. For car campers, it doesn't get much better.&#160;</p><p>As the name suggests, the stove features two separate burners, each with its own adjustable dial for temperature control. A single propane tank fuels both burners and the stove itself comes with two wind panels that can be situated to create a contained cooking area (that, of course, blocks wind).&#160;</p><p>When not in use, the stove closes suitcase-style for easy transport, and it stores easily in a closet, garage, or in a camp tote. It's durable, too, comprised of sturdy aluminum components that can stand up to the beating normal outdoor gear takes.&#160;</p><p>If you're looking for an easy to use, versatile camp stove, there really aren't any better than this two-burner option from Coleman. Being able to cook on two separate burners is a luxury while car camping and the fact I often see this at prices under $70 makes it a highly valuable choice, even for casual car campers.&#160; &#160;</p>\n\tThe best budget camp stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59c556d019d2f5a8188b49dd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coleman\" height=\"1235\" width=\"1646\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Coleman</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PUR5E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_092517_best-camping-stoves-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0009PUR5E&#38;linkId=11d93cf83666782b633a6d62df14864c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\">Coleman Bottle Top Propane Stove</a> acts like a standard stovetop burner, and it's powerful, rugged, and well-priced.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Low price point, long burn time, easy flame output adjustment</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Very heavy and bulky</p><p>With camp stoves, it's easy to look at the price and think that's a steal &#8212; but you have to also factor in camp stove fuel, which some gas stations and outdoor retailers like to gouge you on. But the best field stove in the world is just a paperweight without fuel, so buy it you will, regardless of the price.</p><p>With the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PUR5E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_092517_best-camping-stoves-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0009PUR5E&#38;linkId=11d93cf83666782b633a6d62df14864c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\">Coleman Bottle Top Propane Stove</a>, those canisters of propane fuel are surprisingly low-priced &#8212; you can often get a two-pack of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FColeman-Propane-Fuel-16oz-2-pack%2F20971271\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">16-ounce fuel cylinder</a> for less than 10 bucks. One such tank will burn for two hours at full blast and as long as eight or nine hours on a low setting. So if you want to make campsite risotto, go for it. Oh, and the stove itself is affordable, too.</p><p>Flame control is remarkably easy with this stove, just twist that large plastic knob all the way open for a roaring 10,000-BTU output or dial it back for hours of simmering. And thanks to the deep bowl shape and generous wind baffles, this stove will maintain a consistent burn in all but the most powerful gusts of wind. The burner is large and stable enough to accommodate an 8-inch pan or pot, so you really can almost treat it like a standard stovetop.</p><p>I used one of these stoves for several years and still keep one on hand in case the stove in my house ever has a problem or for some sort of apocalyptic nightmare during which I still wanted to cook pasta. But you'll probably never see me bringing this stove along for another hike or climb.</p><p>Why? Weight and size. This stove weighs more than two pounds, with the canister adding another three pounds or more when filled. That's heavier than some tents and sleeping pads combined. So while I highly recommend this stove for car campers or emergency preparedness, it's a poor choice for climbers or trekkers. <em>&#8212; Steven John</em></p>\n\tThe best charcoal-burning camp stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6074ac913e3fe7001882a363?format=jpeg\" alt=\"HeroGrill1\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Rick Stella/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.fireandflavor.com/products/hero-grill-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hero Grill System</a> is an easy-to-use charcoal-burning grill that heats up in under 10 minutes, comes with a non-stick ceramic cooking surface, and allows for up to an hour of grilling.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros:&#160;</strong>Charcoal pods have instant light coating that makes them easy to ignite, comes with its own carrying case, bamboo cutting board, and bamboo spatula, coals stay hot for up to an hour</p><p><strong>Cons:&#160;</strong>Requires more cleanup than a normal camp stove, single-use charcoal pods are $40 for a two-pack</p><p>Almost all camp stoves use some sort of gas like propane or butane for heat, but the Hero Grill System leans on one of the most traditional forms of fuel: charcoal. And if you're a fan of using charcoal to grill at home, this is the stove you want for car camping.</p><p>The Hero Grill System relies on two main parts for operation, the grill itself which is a non-stick ceramic grill with foldable legs to prop it up, and a box of charcoal pods that slides underneath. The pods can be lit using a match or lighter and take just 10 or so minutes to completely heat up. I found that lighting just two of the corners worked well in igniting the entire box (instead of needing to light all four).&#160;</p><p>It does need to be placed on any non-combustible surface, though I used one of the picnic tables that are often placed at a campsite and it worked just fine. However, this means you shouldn't just place it on grass &#8212; I recommend packing along a small table or something similar that you can place on the ground to set the stove on top of.&#160;</p><p>Being as used to normal camp stoves as I am, I was quite impressed with the Hero Grill. It's not often you're able to make charcoal barbecued food while camping (unless you bring actual charcoal, which can be a mess), so it was a nice change of pace. I liked how easy it was to light the grill and how well it cooked everything from burgers and hot dogs to grilled vegetables.</p><p>Although cleanup is a little more involved than a normal propane stove, it still was relatively easy to just douse the charcoal before throwing the box away. I will say that a downside would be to have to replace the charcoal pod box after every use, and replacements cost $40 for a two-pack. You <em>do&#160;</em>have to replace propane and charcoal for a normal grill, but spending $20 for one hour of grilling can get expensive.</p>\n\tThe best wood-burning camp stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b7ae52d0ce5f596208b4700?format=jpeg\" alt=\"biolite camp stove\" height=\"933\" width=\"1244\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">BioLite</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&#38;mi=10248&#38;pw=184534&#38;ctc=biipgf_092517_best-camping-stoves&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F115523%2Fbiolite-wood-burning-campstove-2-with-flexlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">BioLite CampStove 2</a>&#160;cooks your meal and charges your phone at the same time thanks to a built-in, thermoelectric generator fueled by heat.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Charges small devices, built-in fans regulate heat, works with myriad accessories</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Getting initial fire burning can be frustrating</p><p>When you're out there in the wilderness, you shouldn't be staring at your phone; you should be looking at the stars, the mountains, or the valleys and such.

If you're traveling to remote locations, this is the reliable and rebuildable stove to take with you.</h3><p><strong>Pros:&#160;</strong>Compatible with various types of fuel, excellent longevity</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not the lightest stove</p><p>Isobutane is great for cooking fast with a steady flame and comes packaged in convenient canisters. Unfortunately, you can't fly with it, which could be an issue if you're going to some remote area where there isn't a camping store nearby.

Not only can the stove burn white gas, kerosene, or unleaded gas, it's also incredibly robust.</p><p>This reliability combines with MSR's clever shaker jet design, which prevents the fuel jet from getting clogged by using a needle inside the jet &#8212; cleaning it out when the stove is shaken. All of this makes the Whisperlite International the go-to choice for big expeditions.</p><p>With some practice, you'll be able to quickly light the Whisperlite International (you do need to bring a lighter). Advanced users can regulate the flame enough to simmer water if required. I'll admit that most of my uses have been limited to heating water and making oatmeal and coffee, but more adventurous cooks will be happy with the Whisperlite, especially when the alternative is going stove-less or using a wood or alcohol stove with pitiful heat output. <em>&#8212; James Stout</em></p>\n\tThe best high-powered camp stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b7ec6411982d83b008b5546?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mr steak cmap stove\" height=\"978\" width=\"1304\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mr. Steak</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_092517_best-camping-stoves/https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/mr-steak-1-burner-infrared-portable-grill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Steak 1-Burner Infrared Portable Grill</a> cranks out 14,000 BTUs and can heat up to an astounding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Amazing heat output, large cook surface, electric ignition system</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive, not suitable for hauling on foot</p><p>If you're pushing for the mountain summit of Denali or the Eiger, then it's probably best to leave the <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_092517_best-camping-stoves/https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/mr-steak-1-burner-infrared-portable-grill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Steak 1-Burner Infrared Portable Grill</a> back at base camp.</p><p>At around 30 pounds and measuring 25 by 16 by 16 inches, this is most definitely a car camping grill. But with that size comes 165 square inches of cooking space, below which an immensely powerful ceramic infrared burner can heat up to as much as 1,000 degrees.

Some function better for rapidly boiling water while others are light enough for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-backpacking-stoves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backpacking trips</a> or pack a more powerful cooking punch.</p><p>Any decent stove produces plenty of heat and resists the elements, but beyond that, there are all sorts of differences between various brands and models that make a given unit ideal for one user but a poor choice for others. In discussing the six camp stoves on this list, we'll cover not only each option's inherent qualities but will also talk through why each model is well suited to specific activities, as well as why a given stove may be a poor choice for other scenarios.</p>\n\tHow we test camp stoves\n\t\n\t<p>Each of the camp stoves featured in this guide went through a series of tests to see how well it compared across these six categories: <strong>Boil time, ease of setup and use, wind resistance, heating power (total BTUs), fuel type, </strong>and <strong>value</strong><strong>. </strong>Here are the main features to consider when shopping for camp stoves (and the criteria we judged when doing our own testing over many nights spent camping, backpacking, or just taking to our <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/backyard-camping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">own backyard</a>):&#160;</p><p><strong>Boil time:&#160;</strong>How quickly a stove can bring water to a boil is one of the most important features for anyone who wants to quickly prepare food that only requires hot water, campers who want the ability to reliably purify gathered water, or those who need their coffee brewed mere moments after they wake up in the morning.</p><p><strong>Ease of setup and use:&#160;</strong>Being able to easily set up your stove when you need it is vital. Most stoves are intuitive once you get the hang of them but it's still nice to have one without steep learning curve.&#160;</p><p><strong>Wind resistance: </strong>Depending on where you plan to do the bulk of your camping, a stove that's able to not only light but stay lit while it's windy is highly useful. While most stoves won't have a specific wind-resistant rating, many should list how well they'll work in blustery conditions.</p><p><strong>Heating power (and total BTUs):&#160;</strong>Lighting the stove is one thing but how powerful it ends up being while lit is something else entirely. After all, you don't want to be sitting around for upwards of an hour waiting for a simple can of soup to heat up. The higher the BTUs (British thermal units), the more powerful the stove will be. Look for a stove between 10,000 and 30,000 BTUs.&#160;</p><p><strong>Fuel type:&#160;</strong>There are generally two kinds of camp stove fuel: Gas fuel like propane and butane or liquid fuel. Propane and butane canisters tend to be easier to use in terms of lighting the stove and don't require priming before being lit. Liquid fuel stoves require a bit more work (such as priming) but perform better in colder weather. They're also liable to be more dangerous to use. If possible, we recommend using propane or butane canisters as they're far easier to manage.</p><p><strong>Value: </strong>The importance of a camp stove's price point is completely up to you. If you have the budget to buy a more full-featured stove, by all means, go for it. If you're looking for a budget option, there are plenty of those, too, and many have negligible differences to more expensive options.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

It was programmed to fly on Friday morning, lifting itself 16 feet in the air and tilting so that its rotors would carry it about 436 feet to the south, over uncharted terrain. NASA engineers expect to get data from that flight attempt throughout the afternoon. This aerial adventure was originally scheduled for Thursday, but a non-damaging software glitch <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-failed-lift-off-ambitious-fourth-flight-2021-4\">prevented the helicopter from lifting off</a>. NASA engineers expect that outcome in 15% of flight attempts.</p><p>If Friday&#39;s flight worked, Ingenuity should have snapped photos along the way, then flown back to its original spot to land. With those flight photos, the NASA team plans to construct a 3D map of the nearby terrain and pick out a new landing spot for Ingenuity. They also expect to record the first audio of Ingenuity in flight.</p><p>On its fifth flight, which should happen in about a week, Ingenuity is expected to zip to that new airfield and touch down. From its new perch, it&#39;s set to conduct at least two more flights in May.</p><p>The helicopter may even investigate &#34;areas of interest to the rover,&#34; according to Lori Glaze, director of NASA&#39;s Planetary Science Division.</p><h2>NASA is pushing Ingenuity to the limit</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6070d5f7a451820019b3a683?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mars ingenuity helicopter rotor blades spin\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Perseverance rover captured the Ingenuity helicopter before (left) and after (right) spinning its rotor blades.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For now, NASA is only extending Ingenuity&#39;s mission for 30 days. But it could keep flying even longer - as long as it&#39;s still alive and doesn&#39;t interfere with Perseverance&#39;s science work.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re in a kind of see-how-it-goes phase,&#34; Glaze said on Friday.</p><p>Ingenuity has stayed healthy so far, but it was only designed for a 30-day mission.</p><p>&#34;In doing these operational scenarios, we will naturally be pushing the limits of Ingenuity,&#34; MiMi Aung, project manager for Ingenuity, said in the briefing. &#34;We hope we will be flying over unsurveyed terrains and, over time, continuing to transfer to airfields that are not well characterized. So there is a higher probability of bad landing.&#34;</p><p>Aung has previously said that a bad landing would end Ingenuity&#39;s flights.</p><h2>Perseverance will start investigating rocks from an ancient lake</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606f4a6f4d3e410018b70112?format=jpeg\" alt=\"NASA Perseverance \" height=\"2160\" width=\"2880\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Perseverance captured a &#34;selfie&#34; with Ingenuity before driving away.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/Seán Doran</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Both Ingenuity and the Perseverance rover are in Mars&#39; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-mars-rover-landing-jezero-crater-search-for-alien-life-2021-2\">Jezero Crater</a>, a 28-mile-wide impact basin that was filled with water about 3.5 billion years ago. Scientists think that lake may once have been home to microbial life. So Perseverance is about to start looking for fossils of those alien microbes, which could be trapped in sediment that drifted to the bottom of the lake.</p><p>The rover wasn&#39;t originally going to scour the area right where it landed - instead it was set to drive west, to the cliffs of the ancient river delta that fed Lake Jezero. But the robot recently photographed some promising rocks that convinced NASA scientists to further investigate the region.</p><p>&#34;These rocks are likely to be mudstones, very fine grained, once mud on the bottom of the lake,&#34; Farley said. &#34;These are very important for our investigation, because this is the kind of environment that we expect to be the most habitable by organisms that might have existed on Mars billions of years ago.&#34;</p><p>That change of plans is part of what makes Ingenuity&#39;s extended mission possible. The helicopter can&#39;t fly without Perseverance nearby, since it must communicate with NASA through the rover.</p><p>&#34;Based on the rocks that we have seen in the area, we really wish to spend a considerable amount of time where we are,&#34; Farley said. &#34;It&#39;s sort of a fortuitous alignment.&#34;</p><p>Perseverance aims to take its first samples of those rocks in July. Over its years-long mission, the rover is set to collect dozens of samples and cache them for a future spacecraft to retrieve and bring back to Earth. Those would be the first samples humanity has ever brought home from Mars.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

become more common in the Arctic as a result of the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>The pizzly bear is the result of polar bears and grizzly bears breeding, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0D0SC-32Zs\">according to Larisa DeSantis</a>, a biology professor at Vanderbilt University.</p>\n<p>\"We've known about pizzlies for quite some time, but their occurrence may be more common with ongoing Arctic warming,\" DeSantis said.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a

slash emissions. Cashing in on the pandemic e-commerce boom suddenly made them much harder to reach.</a></em></p>\n<p>A pizzly was first discovered in the wild in 2006, when a hunter in Canada's far north killed a bear with white fur and brown patches as well as the humped back and long claws characteristic of a grizzly bear. DNA testing confirmed the bear was a hybrid, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/a48d3967d653e5a081e071ad73c7526f\">The Associated Press</a> reported at the time.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608ceff4f22c6b00185db1c5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"pizzly bear polar grizzly hybrid\" height=\"2552\" width=\"3403\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Pizzly bear and grolar bear are both unofficial terms for the animal. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">Philippe Clement/Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Since then, sightings of pizzlies in the wild have become more common. A <a href=\"https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/arctic/article/view/67681\">2017 study</a> published in the journal Arctic documented eight pizzlies who were the offspring of one female polar bear that had mated with two separate grizzly bears.</p>\n<p>According to DeSantis, grizzly bears are moving further north as temperatures rise. Meanwhile, \"polar bears are increasingly having to search for other food sources, when hunting seals from sea ice become untenable,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Polar bears typically rely on sea ice to hunt for seals, which make up the vast majority of their diet. A <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6375/568\">2018 study</a> published in Science found as sea ice continues to decline, \"polar bears are likely to experience increasingly stressful conditions and higher mortality rates.\" And arctic sea ice is declining rapidly, as the Arctic experiences higher rates of warming than the rest of the globe, according to the <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-minimum-arctic-sea-ice-extent\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608cf04f34af8d001859a696?format=jpeg\" alt=\"pizzly bear grolar polar grizzly hybrid animal\" height=\"3315\" width=\"4420\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   A pizzly bear, pictured here in captivity, was first discovered in the wild in 2006. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">Philippe Clement/Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>DeSantis said polar bears and grizzly bears have been observed near whale carcasses, prompting them to \"engage in opportunistic mating.\" Since polar bears and grizzlies only diverged about 500,000 to 600,000 years ago, she said, their offspring are able to produce offspring as well.</p>\n<p>But it will take time and additional research to know how well suited these hybrids are to survival.</p>\n<p>\"Most of the time, hybrids are not more vigorous than either of the two species,\" DeSantis said, adding that individual species generally have adaptations best suited for their habitat. But she said there have been some instances where hybrids are more vigorous, \"particularly if that environment is deviating from what it once was.\"</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

news that the FBI raided the property of yet another lawyer working for former President Donald Trump.</p><p>The feds on Wednesday executed search warrants on Rudy Giuliani&#39;s home and office and seized his electronic devices. Agents also seized a computer belonging to his personal assistant, Jo Ann Zafonte, served Zafonte with a grand jury subpoena, and raided the Washington, DC, home of Giuliani&#39;s associate Victoria Toensing.</p><p>It was the most significant development to date in an ongoing Justice Department investigation into whether Giuliani broke foreign lobbying laws while working as Trump&#39;s lawyer.</p><p>Giuliani has not been charged with a crime, and he has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, Robert Costello, called the FBI&#39;s raids &#34;legal thuggery&#34; and said in a <a href=\"https://rudygiulianics.com/2021/04/28/statement-by-robert-j-costello-on-april-28-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> that they reflected a &#34;corrupt double standard&#34; at the Justice Department.</p><p>Here&#39;s everything you need to know about Trumpworld&#39;s latest scandal:</p><h3>Who&#39;s investigating Giuliani?</h3><p>The US attorney&#39;s office for the Southern District of New York - sometimes called the Sovereign District of New York because of its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/with-bannon-arrest-sovereign-district-sends-another-salvo/2020/08/21/c9b51f16-e36c-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">independent reputation</a> - is leading the investigation. It&#39;s an ironic twist for Giuliani, who served as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/09/magazine/high-profile-prosecutor.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">head of the SDNY</a> from 1983 to 1989.</p><h3>How did Giuliani land in the SDNY&#39;s crosshairs?</h3><p>Federal prosecutors began scrutinizing the former New York mayor as part of a broader investigation into two of his Soviet-born business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The two men were arrested in October 2019 on suspicion of trying to funnel foreign money into a pro-Trump super PAC and other entities to gain leverage in US political circles. Prosecutors also alleged that Parnas and Fruman tried to influence US-Ukraine relations.</p><p>The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/two-business-associates-of-trumps-personal-lawyer-giuliani-have-been-arrested-and-are-in-custody/2019/10/10/9f9c101a-eb63-11e9-9306-47cb0324fd44_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that the men had been working with Giuliani since late 2018 to find damaging information about the Bidens ahead of the 2020 election. John Dowd, an attorney representing Parnas and Fruman, told Congress in a statement shortly before their arrest that they had helped Giuliani in his work for Trump.</p><h3>What are prosecutors investigating?</h3><p>The full scope of the criminal inquiry is unclear, but its central thread appears to be focused on Giuliani&#39;s longrunning effort to dig up dirt on the Bidens. Specifically, prosecutors are examining if he was working solely in his capacity as Trump&#39;s lawyer, or if he was also working on behalf of foreign interests who believed they would benefit from Trump&#39;s reelection.</p><p>Investigators are said to be particularly focused on Giuliani&#39;s role in the abrupt removal of Marie Yovanovitch, the US&#39;s former ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch&#39;s ouster was part of a broader effort by Trump and Giuliani to strongam Ukraine into launching political investigations targeting the Bidens ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>Yovanovitch <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-yovanovitch-testimony-updates-2019-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">testified to Congress</a> that as part of that effort, Giuliani collaborated with corrupt Ukrainian interests on a smear campaign against her that was based on &#34;false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.&#34;</p><p>Giuliani confirmed his role in Yovanovitch&#39;s removal, telling The New Yorker that he needed her <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rudy-giuliani-i-needed-yovanovitch-out-of-the-way-2019-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"42c6d9023c4ee91f74140224f11b3867\">&#34;out of the way&#34;</a> because &#34;she was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.&#34;</p><p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/nyregion/giuliani-yovanovitch-search-warrant-ukraine.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prosecutors are looking at</a> whether Giuliani targeted Yovanovitch at <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/recording-appears-capture-trump-private-dinner-ukraine-ambassador/story?id=68506437\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump&#39;s direction</a>, or if he also did so at the behest of Ukrainian officials who wanted Yovanovitch ousted for their own reasons.</p><h3>What could Giuliani be charged with?</h3><p>If Giuliani was working on behalf of foreign interests, it could violate a law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).</p><p>Put simply, FARA requires that American citizens notify the Justice Department of any contacts they have with foreign governments or officials, and if they interact with the US government or media at the direction of those officials.</p><p>In its modern context, &#34;the core purpose of FARA is to put US government officials and the American people on notice when a foreign government or other foreign interest is behind efforts to influence their opinions or actions, so that they can appropriately consider and weigh information or content in light of that underlying foreign interest,&#34; David Laufman, a partner at Wiggin and Dana and former top Justice Department official who oversaw FARA enforcement, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fara-foreign-agents-registration-act-doj-enforcement-rudy-giuliani-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told Insider&#39;s Dave Levinthal and Ryan Barber.</a></p><h3>Where does the investigation currently stand?</h3><p>The longrunning inquiry entered an aggressive new phase with this week&#39;s FBI raids.</p><p>Executing a search warrant on a lawyer is an extraordinary step that requires high-level approval and a sign-off from a federal magistrate judge. To secure such a warrant, prosecutors would have had to prove they had reason to believe Giuliani&#39;s home and office contained evidence of a crime.</p><p>According to The Times, investigators had been trying to secure a warrant against Giuliani for months, but Trump appointees at the Justice Department quashed their efforts. The probe <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-criminal-investigation-into-rudy-giuliani-resumes-ap-2021-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"986615219eb32a20e3d7891ccc3ab36a\">resumed in earnest last month</a>, and the department lifted its objection to the warrant after Merrick Garland was confirmed as attorney general.</p><h3>What&#39;s the next shoe to drop?</h3><p>It&#39;s tough to say.</p><p>Giuliani has been in Trump&#39;s orbit for years, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-warned-giuliani-he-was-target-russian-disinformation-campaign-report-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the FBI warned him</a> as early as 2019 that the Russian government was using him as a tool to spread disinformation about Ukraine and the Biden family before the election. Despite the warning, Giuliani forged ahead with a trip to Kyiv in December 2019 where he met with Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian official and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/treasury-sanction-ukraine-andrii-derkach-russia-trump-biden-dirt-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">active Russian agent</a>, as part of his mission to find dirt on the Bidens.</p><p>Giuliani was a fixture on conservative airwaves in the months leading up to the election, where he repeatedly amplified conspiracy theories about the Bidens and Ukraine. He also pushed the lie that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election, a talking point that can be traced back to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Last October, he was instrumental in placing a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-post-hunter-joe-biden-giuliani-red-flags-disinformation-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highly controversial New York Post story</a> that purported to detail the Bidens&#39; corrupt ties to Ukraine based on a laptop the tabloid said belonged to Hunter Biden. Shortly after, NBC News reported that the FBI was investigating if the emails contained in the story, which the Post obtained from Giuliani, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-investigating-hunter-biden-burisma-emails-foreign-intelligence-operation-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were part of a foreign influence operation</a>.</p><p>These episodes are not known to be part of the federal criminal probe into Giuliani, but they highlight his repeated disregard for counterintelligence officials&#39; warnings that a foreign government was using him to further its own agenda.</p><p>Michael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer who was also raided by the FBI and is currently serving out a sentence for an array of crimes, put forward a blunt assessment of Giuliani&#39;s mounting legal troubles this week.</p><p>&#34;We have no idea how expansive this investigation is going to ultimately reveal itself because Rudy&#39;s an idiot,&#34; he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-michael-cohen-giuliani-idiot-who-will-flip-on-trump-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told CNN</a>. &#34;And that&#39;s the problem. Rudy drinks too much, Rudy behaves in such an erratic manner that who knows what&#39;s on those telephones or what&#39;s on his computers.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rudy-giuliani-landed-in-doj-crosshairs-what-to-know-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Ce1hnbpJ8R4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 19:11:34 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/601990adee136f00183a9d5a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d11c7846a1de63b7caa9d8e7e68755a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn93@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-21-201_659e0045e9e28007.webp","destWidth":4338,"destHeight":3254,"sourceBytes":1554344,"destBytes":1554344,"author":"ssheth@businessinsider.com (Sonam Sheth)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/605738c3cad7d300183f835b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn75@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-22-306_1fc22ec463811999.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-22-782_3ec33dbd5819f167.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-21-775_90d707d374ff31ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ce1hnbpJ8R4:mnO9TLSoxD0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn41@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-25-706_1def3b5847782295.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Ce1hnbpJ8R4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-26-496_2ff136e81beedca3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324322},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"SCOTT GALLOWAY: College has soared in price with few changes to justify the cost - and the pandemic is finally challenging America's obsession with it","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-galloway-what-america-gets-right-and-wrong-college-education-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60624250c9d73b00186e90c6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"AP20281389054160\" height=\"2746\" width=\"3661\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Upward mobility in the US is still being stifled as Ivy Leagues continue to cater to the 1%, while second-tier schools are slowly being erased.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Scott Galloway is a bestselling author and professor of marketing at NYU Stern.</li>\n<li>The following is a recent blog post, republished with permission, that originally ran on his blog, &#34;<a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\">No Mercy / No Malice</a>.&#34;</li>\n<li>In it, Galloway says the elite educational institutes are still profiting while second-teir schools struggle. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Higher education is the most important industry in America.

But every year, my industry falls further from that promise. The underpinnings of that view are simple and static: Higher ed has increased its prices by 1,400% since the late 1970s, but the product has not appreciably changed - the biggest cost driver is administrative bloat. And, rather than catalyzing economic mobility, US higher ed is stifling it. At 38 of the top 100 colleges in America, including five of the Ivies, there are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html\">more students</a> from the top 1% of income earning households than there are from the bottom 60%.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c3d1e35c46f0018c0ba6a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway 2\" height=\"642\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Yet, higher ed&#39;s brand strength (nobody donates $20 million to name a building on Apple&#39;s campus), cash reserves (among elite institutions), and stranglehold on the American psyche have insulated it from disruption for decades. The litmus test for success - and for determining your role in our species - is if your daughter graduates from college (and which one). Suzy might be a heroin addict, but if she&#39;s at Dartmouth, all is forgiven.</p><p>Last year, we predicted the pandemic would be the fist of stone that finally meets higher ed&#39;s glass jaw. Were we correct regarding the coming storm? Or were we alarmist, underestimating institutional strength (or rather, inertia)? The answer is … yes.</p><h2>K-Shaped (college) recovery</h2><p>As we begin to emerge from COVID-19 (God&#39;s ears), American colleges look like the rest of America. Specifically, the fifth installment of the Hunger Games franchise, wherein our society engages in the idolatry of economic winners, everyone else hopes to survive, and many meet a gruesome end.</p><p>The most selective schools received 17% more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/colleges-covid-applicants.html\">applications</a> than last year, and the elite of the elite saw even greater increases: Yale, 33%; Harvard, 43%; MIT 66%. The rich are getting richer.</p><p>These schools (and the media) have emphasized that the increases in applications include record numbers from poor students and students of color - at UCLA, for example, overall applications rose 28%, but the school received 48% more applications from Black students. The result is that top schools are reporting their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/minority-acceptance-ivy-league-cornell.html\">most diverse cohort of admitted students in history</a>.</p><p>Two factors drove these increases: dropping the standardized test requirement, and the increased attention paid to racial and economic justice over the past year. Few people are in a position to make as immediate and tangible of an impact on the lives of promising young students from disadvantaged backgrounds as are elite college admissions officials. In 2021, they leveraged this power.</p><p>Widen the lens, however, and this trend starts to look less encouraging. Admission to a top school can be life changing, but in a country that graduates over 3.5 million people from high school every year, the 1,700-person freshman class at Harvard is immaterial. Over the past 30 years, the number of seats at Ivy League schools has increased only 14%, while the number of high school graduates has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/harvard-and-its-peers-should-be-embarrassed-about-how-few-students-they-educate/2021/04/08/3c0be99c-97cb-11eb-b28d-bfa7bb5cb2a5_story.html\">expanded by 44%</a>. The Ivy League sits on a total endowment of $140 billion, and shares this wealth with just <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/941545/ivy-league-students-class/#statisticContainer\">17,000 freshmen</a> each year.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c3de935c46f0018c0ba6d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway 3\" height=\"741\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>A year ago, I <a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/post-corona-higher-ed/\">predicted</a> that these schools would leverage their extraordinary brand strength and the forced adoption of distance learning technology to partner with big tech and radically expand their class sizes. &#34;In 10 years,&#34; I told <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/scott-galloway-future-of-college.html\">New York magazine</a>, &#34;it&#39;s feasible to think that MIT doesn&#39;t welcome 1,000 freshmen to campus; it welcomes 10,000.&#34;</p><p>I was wrong. The leadership and alumni of elite universities continue to register tremendous psychic reward from the Hermes-ification of their institutions, versus any remaining claim of public service. Expect another round of undue self-congratulation from these schools in the fall - but look closely, as the anticipated record-setting enrolled student numbers this year simply reflect the record number of deferred enrollments last year.</p><h2>Zombie schools walking</h2><p>Widen the lens a bit more, and the picture gets worse. While applications were up at elite schools, they were way <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/colleges-covid-applicants.html\">down</a> at second-tier schools. Applications for federal financial aid are also <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2021/03/18/financial-aid-applications-are-down-does-that-mean-fewer-college-students/\">down</a> 9%, which suggests that college ambition among poor and working class kids is declining. In a society where college degrees are the vaccine against inequality, this is disturbing news. Declining college attendance among those who would benefit most is a <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-fda-inspection-report-emergent-biosolutions-baltimore-2021-20210421-xizdfxwipbahvhki2t2zulld4i-story.html\">contamination of the vaccine supply</a>.</p><p>The prediction that generated the most controversy we&#39;ve inspired (with my shirt on) was when we <a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/post-corona-higher-ed/\">wrote</a> in April 2020: &#34;We&#39;ll see a culling among universities … we&#39;re going to see dozens, maybe hundreds, of universities not reopen.&#34; And we named names. In May, we <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/scott-galloway-future-of-college.html\">predicted</a>: &#34;There will be a lot of zombie universities. Alumni will step in to help. They&#39;ll cut costs to figure out how to stay alive, but they&#39;ll effectively be the walking dead.&#34; Within 72 hours I received my first, second, and third cease and desist letters from universities we said were likely to perish. The threats of legal action have tempered my actions and caused a number of sleepless nights. The last sentence is a lie.</p><p>So far, though, there has not been a rash of post-pandemic college closings. Some schools have <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/01/28/covid-19-colleges-concordia-new-york-education/4302980001/\">closed</a>: MacMurray, Mills, Concordia, and Holy Family, all small schools with long histories and proud traditions - but also financial weaknesses that left them exposed to the pandemic&#39;s impact.</p><p>Many more schools have similar weaknesses. One <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/edify/2020/05/08/higher-education-financial-crisis\">study</a> found that one-third of private colleges are at &#34;high risk&#34; of financial failure. (The study was never formally released, however, thanks to cease and desist letters from many of those schools … #feelyou.) COVID-related costs, coupled with the decline in applications, portend more problems. Many of these schools will graduate more Hunger Games contestants, but the odds are not in their favor.</p><p>Bankruptcy, as Hemmingway observed, happens two ways: &#34;Gradually, then suddenly.&#34;</p><h2>Wildlings</h2><p>While the lords of American higher ed fortify their walls, and the erasures of second-tier castles multiply, there is a gathering force about to ignite a fire the North has never seen. Last year, I believed the change would occur on the supply side, with expanded enrollments at the top schools. It now looks as if the demand side will change the game: Employers are rethinking certification.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1208841343440568320\">Elon</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html#:~:text=%20Google%2C%20Apple%20and%2012%20other%20companies%20that,6%20Apple.%20%207%20Chipotle.%20%20More%20\">Apple</a>, some of the most admired employers are dropping the college degree requirement from more and more jobs. Over 130 companies have committed to accepting Google-certified courses as equivalent to credits earned at traditional four-year colleges. More than <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/google-announces-certificates-in-data-project-management-and-ux.html\">250,000</a> people took Google&#39;s IT certificate program in its first two years - and 57% of them did not have a college degree.</p><p>Similarly, Amazon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1381952098900774919\">announced</a> a partnership with Lambda School, launching a nine-month, full-time training program in software engineering, designed to put graduates in jobs with an average base salary of $80,000. Students are not obligated to pay anything upfront; instead, they pay based on their salary after graduation. Again: no college degree required.</p><p>Here in Florida, Governor DeSantis has <a href=\"https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/22/desantis-proposes-75-million-initiatives-boost-florida-workforce/4797937001/\">proposed</a> using $75 million in federal COVID relief funds to invest in vocational training programs. There&#39;s a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005265/en/U.S.-Skilled-Trades-Labor-Shortage-Heightens-as-In-Demand-Jobs-Remain-Unfilled-the-Longest\">scarcity</a> of skilled tradespeople, and those are good paying, secure jobs - it will be a long time before robots replace electricians and plumbers.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c3fbd35c46f0018c0ba7b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway 4\" height=\"687\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This is bad news for schools without the global brand equity of the elites. They are being unbundled, piece by piece, just as newspapers were dissected (classifieds, movie listings, news, sports) and sold for parts to benign billionaires. Today, we have a handful of elite newspapers that are thriving, a wasteland of dead/dying second-tier papers, and a roiling maelstrom of tech-enabled news sources serving the mass market. Since 2004, two thousand newspapers have shuttered. It could be as bloody among universities.</p><h2>Break it all</h2><p>As bad as this looks for America&#39;s second-tier, four-year colleges, it may be great news for America. This unbundling presents the opportunity to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J-rxmk6zPxA\">break the wheel</a> of four-year college dominance over the American Dream.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c401c35c46f0018c0ba7e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway 5\" height=\"945\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>That dream itself is at risk. Wealth is being hoarded by the old, which has left young people adrift and unattached. We need to find ways to invest in the non-college bound, and create on-ramps into the corporate economy without the ritual of a $200,000 college education.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c405d35c46f0018c0ba82?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway 6\" height=\"936\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>These programs could also liberate education from its ageism. College is the most ageist sector in the US, a huge industry set up to serve 18-24 year olds. Even graduate schools are designed to appeal to twenty-somethings. Yet our innovation economy means people will need new skills at every phase of life.</p><p>One lesson can be taken from universities, though. Just as they dropped the requirement of standardized tests, and registered enormous progress around diversity and inclusion, America can register the same unlock if US corporations broaden the on-ramp to a better life by dropping their fetishization of the college degree.</p><p>Life is so rich,</p><p>Scott</p><p>P.S.

A nice queen, don&#39;t worry.</p><h2>Here&#39;s our list of the most exclusive spots in America&#39;s Disney parks.</h2><h3>1. Cinderella Castle Suite</h3><p>First up, the Cinderella Castle Suite. At the top of the iconic Cinderella Castle in Magic Kingdom, there&#39;s a private suite hidden inside. With towering princess beds, an ornate bathroom, and &#34;Cinderella&#34; props throughout, the suite is definitely fit for a royal. A night&#39;s stay here is so exclusive, you can&#39;t actually book it. The suite is by invite only. But it&#39;s rumored Disney turned down an offer of $40,000 for a one-night stay. Some lucky fans have scored a stay by winning various contests. Special guests at the Cinderella Suite have included Tom Cruise and Mariah Carey.</p><h3>2. Imagineer Dinner</h3><p>You&#39;ve probably heard of the Disney Imagineers - or the masterminds behind the rides, the shows, the music, pretty much everything that&#39;s cool at Disney parks - and if you&#39;ve ever wanted to meet one, we&#39;ll do you one better. How about a dinner with an Imagineer? Once a month, you can learn from one of these Disney legends over a four-course meal at Cítricos in the Grand Floridian Resort. The only thing is, you won&#39;t know who you&#39;re eating with until you get there. The experience will set you back $89 and is limited to guests 14 and older.</p><h3>3. Victoria and Albert&#39;s </h3><p>Located in Disney&#39;s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Victoria and Albert&#39;s is probably the ritziest restaurant at Disney World. With only 18 tables, reservations are required, and a fancy dress code is strictly enforced. But getting all glammed up is definitely worth it for their chef&#39;s tasting menu. The 11-course meal comes in at $250. But if you&#39;re wanting something even more exclusive, you can book a table for up to eight people in a completely separate and private space, in the Queen Victoria Room.</p><h3>4. Morimoto Asia</h3><p>Morimoto Asia isn&#39;t as high-end as Victoria and Albert&#39;s, but it does have a little something special up its sleeve. &#34;Iron Chef&#34; Masaharu Morimoto opened the glitzy restaurant in 2015. Located in Disney Springs, it specializes in Pan-Asian cuisine. Their most exclusive dish is the Japanese A5 Wagyu beef. The beef has the highest rating for Wagyu and is imported from Japan. Each ounce costs $25, but there&#39;s an order minimum of 3 ounces, so be prepared to pay about $75 at least. They also have a Toku-Jyo Sashimi Platter that runs for $100.</p><h3>5. Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique</h3><p>Looking to spoil your little ones? Hop over to Cinderella&#39;s Castle in Magic Kingdom to the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. Here, one of the Fairy Godmother&#39;s apprentices will transform your kiddo into a knight or one of their favorite princesses. The all-in package for knights costs $80, but for Disney princesses, a full transformation starts at $450. It includes a hair styling, makeover, manicure, gown, and tiara. You can get princess shoes but for an extra cost. These magic makeovers require a reservation and are only available for kids 3 to 12.</p><h3>6. Golden Oak Residences </h3><p>Four miles away from Magic Kingdom is the super-exclusive gated community called Golden Oak. Three-hundred homes, each with a little Disney flair, make up eight neighborhoods. But living so close to all the Disney magic doesn&#39;t come cheap. Each one runs for about $2.3 million. All Golden Oak residents get access to a luxurious clubhouse complete with a pool, gym, and spa. Another perk: Markham&#39;s Restaurant. You have to be a resident here to experience all their Disney-themed meals.</p><h3>7. Club 33</h3><p>A luxury Disney experience doesn&#39;t stop in Florida. Over at Disneyland in California, Club 33 has been serving an exclusive group of fans since 1967. Located in New Orleans Square, the club&#39;s existence was once secret, but now it&#39;s pretty well known although few get to experience it. Reportedly, the initiation fee runs between $25,000 and $100,000. Members pay an additional annual fee from $12,500 to $30,000 depending on how exclusive their membership is. And for those willing to foot that bill, membership does come with a couple perks, like the swanky restaurant Le Grand Salon and the lounge attached to it, which is the only place that serves alcohol in Disneyland.</p><h3>8. Lilly Belle Train</h3><p>Anybody can ride the steam-powered train of Disneyland&#39;s railroad, but you might not know that there&#39;s a separate train that runs only occasionally. The Lilly Belle car is named after Walt Disney&#39;s wife, Lillian, and apparently it&#39;s the last remaining car from the opening day of the park back in 1955. It doesn&#39;t run every day, but when it does, you can ride it for free, but you have to be one of the first 14 people in line, so get there bright and early. But for the rest of us late risers, the $85 Grand Circle Tour will get you a peek of the train as well.</p><h3>9. Walt Disney&#39;s Apartment</h3><p>Back in 1954, as Disneyland was under construction, Walt Disney wanted a place where he could watch over his project.

Biden never explicitly said this, but he has gone back and forth on the issue of travel bans or restrictions. </p><p>On the same day Trump announced travel restrictions on China last January, Biden during a campaign speech in Iowa said, &#34;This is no time for Donald Trump&#39;s record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering to lead the way instead of science.&#34;</p><p>The Biden campaign <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/26/trumps-faux-facts-fox-news/\">told the Washington Post</a> that he was referencing Trump&#39;s call for travel bans during the Ebola crisis as well as his travel restrictions on predominantly Muslim countries, and pointed to similar remarks Biden made in a USA Today op-ed four days before the China ban was announced. &#34;I remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 Ebola epidemic,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/01/27/coronavirus-donald-trump-made-us-less-prepared-joe-biden-column/4581710002/\">Biden said</a> in the op-ed, denouncing Trump for pushing for &#34;reactionary travel bans that would only have made things worse.&#34;  </p><p>Biden was also critical of Trump&#39;s restrictions on travel with regard to Europe. </p><p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1238254697695326209?s=20\">a tweet</a> last March after Trump suspended travel both to and from a number of European countries, Biden said, &#34;A wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe - or any other part of the world - will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet - and we need a plan to combat it.&#34; </p><p>Around that time, Biden also unveiled a plan to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to reporters on the plan, <a href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-speech-transcript-on-coronavirus-march-12-2020\">Biden said,</a> &#34;Banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world may slow it, but as we&#39;ve seen, it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics rather than a risk will be counterproductive.&#34;</p><p>But Biden in early April then came out and expressed support for Trump&#39;s travel restrictions on China. &#34;Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,&#34; Kate Bedingfield, Biden&#39;s deputy campaign manager at the time, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/joe-biden-trump-china-coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told CNN</a>. &#34;Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.&#34;</p><p>Some public health experts have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/12/815146007/public-health-experts-question-trumps-ban-on-most-travelers-from-europe\">questioned the efficacy of travel bans</a> in preventing the spread of COVID-19, though many have also advocated for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-surge-india-travel-restrictions/\">varying levels of travel restrictions</a> regarding certain countries where the outbreaks are especially bad - including India. </p><p>Lawrence Gostin, director of the O&#39;Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center, in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LawrenceGostin/status/1388210151589564416?s=20\">a tweet</a> on Friday said, &#34;[The] US has started a humanitarian mission to assist India. A flat travel ban impedes our vital humanitarian goals. That&#39;s why proof of vaccination or a negative test makes sense, but not a ban. It doesn&#39;t stop the flow of medical supplies, but does help keep variants from our shores.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-bans-most-travel-india-once-said-bans-dont-work-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/MIuVgeyXO3k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 19:53:14 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608c5dd235c46f0018c0bb44?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"53e4bc4f8155fe7fda44e8aed3c6891c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn57@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-21-026_de1339935c94e611.webp","destWidth":1784,"destHeight":1338,"sourceBytes":51738,"destBytes":51738,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/608c5df535c46f0018c0bb46?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn42@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-23-857_6de7c30eb2986f31.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-26-314_529f61510471c030.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn17@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-23-082_010bbc1103d4d626.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MIuVgeyXO3k:TQ8rBf7-WKU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn80@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-24-385_a992748d0ad5aa80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/MIuVgeyXO3k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-26-405_33d4137e8978a837.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324324},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"Abercrombie & Fitch is cool again, after years as the most hated retailer in the US, because it caught up to what millennials and Gen Z want","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/abercrombie-and-fitch-is-back-how-af-became-cool-again-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607ed76544f4540019207a6e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"abercrombieandfitch.JPG\" height=\"1665\" width=\"2220\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Abercrombie &#38; Fitch has made a comeback.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Andrew Kelly/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>It&#39;s official - Abercrombie &#38; Fitch is cool again. </li>\n<li>After a massive rebrand that embraces inclusion and more wholesome, brand-agnostic clothing, its stock is on the rise.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\">A&#38;F <strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">was once loathed for its superficiality, but now it&#39;s embracing the authenticity</strong> millennials and Gen Z want.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Abercrombie &#38; Fitch is cool again.</p><p>The dimly lit mall stores filled with the smell of cologne and shirtless male greeters were once the trademarks of a brand that former CEO Mike Jeffries described as being geared toward high school&#39;s &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/abercrombie-wants-thin-customers-2013-5\">cool kids</a>&#34; who weren&#39;t &#34;overweight or unattractive.&#34;</p><p>But it turns out that Jeffries&#39; style wasn&#39;t resonating, and neither was he.

(ANF), began falling in the early to mid-2010s and dropped below $10 per share four years ago, its lowest point since May 2000. Meanwhile, the company <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/abercrombie-fitch-co.-anf-stock-hammered-but-is-wall-street-wrong-2017-07-10\">struggled to find a buyer</a>. In 2014, Jeffries stepped down. By 2016, what was once a teen status symbol became America&#39;s <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/abercrombie-fitch-americas-hated-retailer/\">most hated retailer</a>. </p><p>Roughly a year after Fran Horowitz became CEO in 2017, ANF&#39;s stock started to climb. It&#39;s soared 271% over the past year alone. The underlying reason is simple: the brand became cool again. And it doesn&#39;t look like the Abercrombie of yore.</p><p>While Hollister drives the majority of <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1018840/000101884021000023/anf-20210130.htm\">A&#38;F Co.&#39;s revenue</a> (which <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/anf/financials\">totaled $3.6 billion</a> in 2020), Abercrombie is growing its contribution thanks to a brand revival.</p><p>Along with A&#38;F&#39;s shirtless models and stark <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-modeling-for-abercrombie-and-fitch-2016-7\">black-and-white photo campaigns</a>, Jeffries&#39; &#34;cool&#34; kids comment went out of style years ago. An A&#38;F Co. spokesperson said that statement was made over 15 years ago and doesn&#39;t reflect the brand&#39;s current values. JP Morgan CPA Matt Boss noted in a recent report that the Abercrombie product has &#34;improved materially&#34; over the past two years. </p><p>The shopping experience is also different: scrolling through the Abercrombie brand&#39;s website today is a much brighter experience than strolling its low-lit mall stores. The colors and fonts are light and breezy. The clothes are casual, familiar, and brand-agnostic now that they&#39;re mostly free of the iconic moose logo. The floral dresses and ripped jeans are photographed against a white background and worn by models diverse in both size and ethnicity. This new vibe places Abercrombie on the fashion spectrum between Reformation and Mango.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); data.width~540;\">\n\t<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n\t\t<div style=\"background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div style=\"background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p style=\"margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNne571nvWa\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Abercrombie &#38; Fitch (@abercrombie)<time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"\"></time>\n\t\t</p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" defer=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script><h2><strong>Speaking to millennials and Gen Z</strong></h2><p>The rebrand seems to have been in the works since shortly after Jeffries&#39; departure. In 2016, Abercrombie&#39;s former executive chairman, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/abercrombie-and-fitch-then-and-now-2016-1#abercrombie-used-to-feature-naked-people-1\">Arthur Martinez, told Insider</a> that the brand wanted to appeal to an older demographic, subsequently toning down its once sultry ads.</p><p>&#34;They&#39;re entering a true adulthood,&#34; he said of Abercrombie&#39;s targeted shopper. &#34;They have a more refined sensibility, a great sense of themselves.&#34; </p><p>While the brand&#39;s old style may have spoken to its predominently teenage customers, Abercrombie has &#34;been trying to attract older youth and young professionals with casual wear,&#34; said Jonathan Treiber, cofounder and CEO of management solutions company RevTrax. Boss agreed, noting that the canny update of both Abercrombie and its sister brand Hollister has carved out separate niches for the digital consumer in their mid-20s and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-25/are-u-s-malls-dead-not-if-gen-z-keeps-shopping-the-way-they-do\">teen mall shopper</a>, respectively. </p><p>A company spokesperson confirmed these observations, stating that Abercrombie seeks to cater to &#34;global young millennials&#34; while Hollister is the &#34;quintessential brand of the global teen customer.&#34; The spokesperson described the brand as celebrating &#34;the individuality and authenticity of our associates and customers.&#34; It&#39;s no coincidence that this tracks with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-luxury-is-struggling-to-connect-with-gen-z-tiktok-2020-1\">the values that next-gen consumers want</a> - everybody is a &#34;cool kid&#34; in the TikTok era. </p><p>The company was &#34;wise&#34; to evolve to a more accepting image. Treiber recalls the brand&#39;s &#34;raunchy&#34; days when scantily-clad, kissing couples adorned the stores&#39; walls, displays, and shopping bags. Today&#39;s color photos of a diverse group of smiling, beach-going, bike-riding young people fit the more modern lifestyle ideals of wellness and inclusion perpetuated by millennials and Gen Z.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6081dbc44becb800190f6a36?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Abercrombie\" height=\"599\" width=\"799\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An ad from the old days of Abercrombie &#38; Fitch.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Abercrombie</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Shoppers also won&#39;t find as many shirts or hoodies emblazoned with &#34;Abercrombie&#34; anymore, which is &#34;something that resonated with younger shoppers who want less billboard-type apparel these days,&#34; Treiber said. </p><p>Younger generations also care about building a &#34;<a href=\"https://stylewise-blog.com/sustainable-ethical-capsule-wardrobe/\">capsule wardrobe</a>&#34; to be more sustainable, buying a few good items of good quality that will be seen as timeless as the endless cycle of fast fashion prevails. A spokesperson said the company is looking at making its practices more sustainable, telling Insider the brand knows there is still more work to be done. </p><p>The company says it has doubled-down on social media and influencer marketing to reach its target demographic. Its Instagram has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/abercrombie/?hl=en\">nearly 5 million followers</a> and has been featured on popular content creators such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mikzazon/\">Mik Zazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whitneywiley/\">Whitney Wiley</a>.</p><p>This also includes getting involved in issues millennials and Gen Z value. Last year, the brand launched The Abercrombie Equity Project, a social and racial justice initiative to &#34;empower&#34; the voices of &#34;marginalized&#34; communities. It partnered with The Steve Fund, a nonprofit that supports mental health initiatives for people of color. In support of Black History Month, Abercrombie Equity Project donated <a href=\"https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/about-us\">$250,000</a> to the organization. </p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); data.width~540;\">\n\t<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n\t\t<div style=\"background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div style=\"background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p style=\"margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CM4q3ZRHPnd\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Abercrombie &#38; Fitch (@abercrombie)<time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"\"></time>\n\t\t</p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" defer=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script><p> </p><p>Despite Abercrombie&#39;s social revival, the brand has become unprofitable in the past 12 months with revenue dropping by 14%.

Boss of JPMorgan noted that Abercrombie expects a low-single-digit long-term growth rate in revenue. </p><p>As Saunders wrote in 2018, &#34;In our view, the range - especially at Abercrombie - is now more sophisticated, is more on-trend, and better reflects what modern consumers want.&#34; </p><p>And those consumers seem to agree. According to Piper Jaffray&#39;s semi-annual Taking Stock with Teens survey, the number of teens who said they didn&#39;t wear Abercrombie and Fitch declined from 8% to 4% between spring 2018 and fall 2019.

This summer, pool owners and builders are bracing for &#34;the worst chlorine shortage the country has ever seen,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/a-major-chlorine-shortage-is-set-to-spoil-swimming-pool-fun-this-summer.html\">CNBC reported Friday.</a> </p><p>Industry publications started reporting on the shortage of chlorine tablets last year. Supply was squeezed due to a fire at a chlorine manufacturer called BioLab as well as an increase in demand for pools and pool upkeep as homeowners weathered the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, <a href=\"https://www.poolmagazine.com/industry-news-news/chlorine-tablet-shortage-due-to-covid-19-biolab-fire/\">Pool Magazine reported in September. </a> More pool companies were switching to alternative methods of sanitizing pool water, the magazine reported, predicting the price of chlorine would continue to rise. The trade publications&#39; predictions came to pass. </p><p>The price for chlorine used in pools has nearly doubled over the past year, and it&#39;s expected to keep rising this summer as pool use increases, according to CNBC. The shortage is set to be the worst in recent US history, CNBC reported.</p><p>However, there are alternatives to chlorine pools. Saltwater pools are a popular method that many find to be gentler on their hair, skin, and eyes and don&#39;t require the in-demand chemical. </p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts also recently warned of the chlorine tablet shortage and discussed other methods to keep pools clean, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chlorine-shortage-stands-to-wreak-havoc-on-summer-pool-season-goldman-sachs-165313311.html\">Yahoo Finance reported on Monday</a>. &#34;There&#39;s no shortage of ways to sanitize the pool. It just simply means at a certain point people will shift,&#34; an executive from Pool Corp said on the bank&#39;s earnings call, according to Yahoo. &#34;We&#39;ve also seen certain parts of the country accelerating the use of salt as a method of sanitization too.&#34;</p><p>Saltwater pools, according to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/salt-water-pool\">Healthline</a>, work by generating their own chlorine, but in a much smaller amount than in traditional tablets or liquid chemicals. Saltwater pools require testing for salt buildup and erosion, but are less harsh on people with allergies and asthma. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/pool-owner-chlorine-shortage-saltwater-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lYlSoQChFjw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 18:52:17 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fee2e429ff41f001883f9e9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a3c090210a1abaf398f32accdf43354e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn25@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-644_14a335dbb0f29ae2.webp","destWidth":3543,"destHeight":2657,"sourceBytes":413450,"destBytes":413450,"author":"awilliams@insider.com (Annabelle Williams)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fee2e429ff41f001883f9e9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn25@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-644_14a335dbb0f29ae2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn27@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-24-787_ac71f3efbb5fdc3d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn91@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-22-423_1f79af974ff96ca3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lYlSoQChFjw:GSsxtTFkbTA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn33@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-24-937_e6aadf473e05b700.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lYlSoQChFjw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn28@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-22-250_5b5aa23737cdde5c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324322},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"Newsmax settles a defamation lawsuit from a Dominion executive at the center of election conspiracy theories and issues an apology","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/newsmax-settles-dominion-executive-eric-coomer-defamation-lawsuit-and-apologizes-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb24eca1c741f0019ac9e83?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Newsmax Media CEO Christopher Ruddy attends a dinner with the US president and business leaders in Bedminster, New Jersey, on August 7, 2018.\" height=\"2206\" width=\"2941\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Newsmax Media CEO Christopher Ruddy attends a dinner with Donald Trump and business leaders.\n<p class=\"copyright\">BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Dominion executive Eric Coomer reached a settlement with Newsmax, which he sued for defamation.</li>\n<li>Newsmax pushed false theories Coomer was in an &#34;Antifa conference call&#34;

RSS - which stands for &#34;Really Simple Syndication&#34; - is a protocol that provides a standard method for websites to publish updates that anyone can see by displaying them in a program or website called an RSS reader. </p><h2>What is an RSS feed?</h2><p>Fundamentally, RSS is simply an XML text file. It&#39;s created by a website publisher and contains a running list of articles or other content published by the site, with the newest entry always at the top of the list. Each entry contains details like the article&#39;s title, description, and link to the content.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RSS feeds</a> are published and updated in real time, so if you subscribe to a site&#39;s RSS feed, you&#39;ll always have access to the newest published content. That can be handy for news sites and podcasts that are frequently updated. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c422e35c46f0018c0ba8e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_an_RSS_feed 1\" height=\"1246\" width=\"1939\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An RSS file is unremarkable - it&#39;s just a text file with information about updates to the website.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What to know about RSS readers</h2><p>Because an RSS feed is a text file that contains a stream of article descriptions and links, it isn&#39;t designed to be read or used directly by you. Instead, users rely on a program called an RSS reader. This is a simple program that reads the RSS feed and displays the list of articles in a way that makes them easy to browse.</p><p>Many RSS readers can display a single unified view that aggregates content from all the websites you have subscribed to in chronological order - sort of like the way a unified inbox shows email from multiple accounts at once - or you can browse each website individually. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c42cb35c46f0018c0ba92?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_an_RSS_feed 2\" height=\"1446\" width=\"2010\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A typical RSS reader reads an RSS feed and displays summaries of all the new articles which you can browse and read.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>RSS readers are used to aggregate news. Users can subscribe to RSS feeds from the websites and sources of interest to them, and use an RSS reader to scan headlines and read articles from a variety of sources. This is less common today because many people tend to use social media to aggregate news, though it&#39;s less efficient because social media platforms use proprietary algorithms to determine what headlines users see. With RSS, you see everything that&#39;s published by the sources you subscribe to. </p><p>There are quite a number of RSS reader programs to choose from. Some are free, while others are paid programs that you need to purchase or subscribe to. </p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>How to use an RSS feed </strong></h2><p>To use RSS, you need to perform these steps: </p><ol><li><strong>Get an RSS reader</strong>. Some of the most popular RSS readers include <a href=\"https://jangernert.github.io/FeedReader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feedreader</a>, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feedly</a>, and <a href=\"https://theoldreader.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Old Reader</a>. Create an account so you&#39;re ready to subscribe to some RSS feeds. </li><li><strong>Find the link to an RSS feed</strong>. You&#39;ll need to know the URL to the RSS feed for the website you want to subscribe to. Some websites place an RSS link on their homepage - look for it at the very top (in the header of the site) or at the bottom in the footer. It will look like waves, similar to a Wi-Fi icon. Click it and copy the URL. Finding RSS icons on the homepage of a website is less common than it used to be, so if you don&#39;t see it, you can perform a web search, such as &#34;Insider RSS feed.&#34; Find the page and copy the link.<br><br><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c441135c46f0018c0baa0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_an_RSS_feed 3\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2511\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Some websites display an RSS icon that gives you direct access to the RSS feed URL.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li><li><strong>Subscribe to the RSS feed</strong>. In the RSS reader program, find the link to add a new feed and enter the URL of the feed. After you add it, you should immediately see a list of articles. You can now browse and click the article you want to read. </li><li><strong>Subscribe to more feeds</strong>. You can continue adding RSS feeds to your RSS reader until you&#39;re aggregating all the websites you want to keep track of. <br><br><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c45c134af8d001859a51e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_an_RSS_feed 4\" height=\"1667\" width=\"1998\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An RSS reader is a great tool for making sure you see a broad range of news from multiple sources.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li></ol><p> </p></aside><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module-end-of-article\" class=\"mceNonEditable\"><a data-type=\"6055217ba7e94b52167b9b69\" data-title=\"What are Twitter Newsletters?

president of IT Michael Kail was convicted by a federal jury on Friday of 28 counts of fraud and money laundering, the US Department of Justice announced in a press release.</p><p>Kail, who was indicted in 2018, used his position to create a &#34;pay-to-play&#34; scheme where he approved contracts with outside tech companies looking to do business with Netflix in exchange for taking bribes and kickbacks, according to evidence presented to the jury, the release said.</p><p>Kail accepted bribes or kickbacks from nine different companies totaling more than $500,000 as well as stock options, according to the DOJ&#39;s press release.</p><p>The jury also ordered Kail to forfeit to the government a home he purchased in Los Gatos, California, using the funds he obtained through the illegal scheme.</p><p>&#34;Bribery undermines fair competition and innovation in any business arena, and particularly Silicon Valley&#39;s highly competitive environment of cutting-edge innovation,&#34; acting US Attorney Stephanie Hinds said in a press release.</p><p>&#34;As Netflix&#39;s Vice President of IT Operations, Michael Kail wielded immense power to approve valuable Netflix contracts with small tech vendors, and he rigged that process to unlock a stream of cash and stock kickbacks to himself.

The home builder became one of the biggest in the nation to provide affordable housing. Broad also found success when he bought Sun Life Insurance, then later sold it for $18 billion in stock in 1998.</p><p>In the 1970s, Broad was named fouding chairman of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and in 2008, he saved the institution from collapse with a $30-million grant. </p><p>He worked with developers to transform Los Angeles&#39; Grand Avenue into a cultural hub, alive with hotels, restaurants, a park, and his own museum.</p><p>Broad and his wife, Edythe, were avid art collectors and enthusiasts. They opened the <a href=\"https://www.thebroad.org/\">Broad Museum</a> in LA in 2015, which offers free admission to fellow art appreciators to view works from the couple&#39;s collection of more than 2,000 works.</p><p>Through two foundations, the couple supported medical research, public education, and the visual and performing arts.

Currently, putting loans into deferment or forbearance while deployed don&#39;t count as qualifying payments, and this new legislation would expedite the process for service members to get earned student loan forgiveness.</p><p>&#34;Service members take enormous risks to protect our freedoms, and it is unacceptable that members of the military can return home after active duty and not be any closer to receiving loan forgiveness,&#34; Hassan said in a <a href=\"https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=AC567CBA-D0DB-4E4A-996E-E5547B166B0E\">statement</a>. &#34;This bipartisan bill is a commonsense fix to help some of our country&#39;s most deserving public servants get out from under the burden of their student debt more quickly.</p><p>According to a bill summary, this legislation would count military student loan deferment and forbearance as qualifying payments toward PSLF, including for:</p><ul><li>Active-duty service members deployed overseas;</li><li>Active-duty service members deployed away from their families and home station;</li><li>National Guard and Reserve members brought onto active duty for more than 30 days;</li><li>And National Guard members brought onto state active duty.</li></ul><p>The PSLF program allows government and non-profit employees with federally-backed student loans to apply for loan forgiveness after proof of 120 monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan. But the PSLF program is flawed - according to a Government Accountability Office <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-65\">report</a>, as of January 2020, 287 Dept. of Defense personnel received loan forgiveness, while 5,180, or 94% of DOD borrowers, were denied.</p><p>Even beyond service members, <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/loan-forgiveness/pslf-data\">98% of all borrowers</a> from the general public have been rejected from the program.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a <a

after the GAO&#39;s findings were released last week, calling PSLF &#34;nothing short of a disaster.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Our student loan system is utterly broken, and the best way to deliver relief to borrowers and service members crushed by student loan debt is to cancel their debt - and not after 10 years of bureaucratic torture and miscounted payments, but today,&#34; Warren said.</p><p>She also <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-introduce-legislation-to-expand-and-improve-public-service-loan-forgiveness-amid-covid-19-pandemic\">introduced</a> legislation

times</a> over the program&#39;s high denial rate, and President Joe Biden even <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/education/\">campaigned</a> on reforming PSLF to ensure that borrowers can the student loan forgiveness they deserve, but reforms have yet to be made. </p><p>Rubio said &#34;service members make an incredible sacrifice to serve our country, and we should do everything in our power to recognize their service and provide them with the option for loan forgiveness.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Skincare - with its glamour and markups - seemed like a natural fit.</p><p>As industry outsiders, Kim and company were able to pinpoint the norms that needed challenging. &#34;The first oddity of the skincare industry that we noticed was that it&#39;s run like the fashion industry,&#34; Kim explained. &#34;Marketers create trends and endless product varieties in an attempt to maximize sales. What you end up with is a ton of undifferentiated products hyped by overzealous marketers, which leads to confusion among shoppers.&#34;</p><p>The team recruited friends from all disciplines - cancer and brain researchers, chemical engineers, lawyers, and medical doctors - to hone in on the research without the baggage of preconceived notions. In essence, Maelove is one huge - and very successful - science experiment.</p><p>First, the team leverages decades of clinical research. &#34;There are abundant and widely accepted published works that show which compounds work well for maintaining skin health. These are the tried-and-true ingredients recommended by every dermatologist and [which] are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths (the classic ingredients like retinol, AHA, certain vitamins and peptides, etc).&#34; In short, these are the ingredients that should work.</p><p>Then, Maelove uses artificial intelligence to scan millions of self-reported product reviews - what Kim refers to as empirical real-world data - to determine which ingredients correlated with success, and which to avoid. These are the ingredients that, according to users, do work. </p><p>Finally, the company finds human volunteers to test the formula to verify that it&#39;s effective. So instead of building a business around variety for the sake of variety, Maelove focuses on making one line of stellar skincare that can work for all skin types. </p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>This radically affordable luxury skincare line is the real deal. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmaelove.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Maelove</a> makes some of the best and some of the cheapest skincare products that I&#39;ve found. And while I don&#39;t often get to stick to my own skincare routine as a product reviewer, I&#39;ve surprised myself by preferring to use the cheaper Maelove products over luxury skincare I often test for work because they&#39;re simple, gentle, and effective. </p><p>I recommend Maelove to everyone who asks me for recommendations because it works for all skin types and doesn&#39;t cost much, but skincare is also a notoriously subjective experience. What works for me may not work for you - even a skincare line built to cater to every skin type. Luckily, Maelove has a 100-day, 100% money-back guarantee, so you&#39;re not risking much if you want to give it a try yourself.  </p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmaelove.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Shop Maelove here</a>.</h3><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/maelove-skin-care-review'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oM93ctc4USg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 22:10:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5c8033022628980f6905f5e4?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8e323f250c7c794d03cabba09c186f8d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-23-223_10aa5ee78fbec9b6.webp","destWidth":2906,"destHeight":2179,"sourceBytes":101488,"destBytes":101488,"author":"insider@insider.com (Mara Leighton)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5c8032b82628984e76781f65?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn49@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-22-881_66eca7141c1036c1.webp","https://i.insider.com/5bd76f5438150704f1374003?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn97@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-23-739_8dcce1bc4e055b79.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn53@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-25-305_10343d863acf0080.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn75@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-22-984_c5d0646d54c34de5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oM93ctc4USg:ZKQ_omVQ7HM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn97@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-26-119_8d883d744e6ed0a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oM93ctc4USg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324335},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"The 6 best robot vacuums we tested in 2021","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-robot-vacuum","description":"<ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>A good robot vacuum cleans floors with little work from you, clearing debris with a button push.</li>\n<li>We tested 25 robot vacuums and consulted three experts to find the best options for different needs.</li>\n<li><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RLRWWPJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07RLRWWPJ&linkCode=as2&tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&linkId=6cab9763e175055d14489cb66510fda5e175055d14489cb66510fda5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Roborock S6 Robot Vacuum</a><strong> is the best robot vac; it cleans</strong><strong> well, mops, and has a helpful app.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>A robot vacuum can remove the small but time-consuming task of vacuuming from your never-ending to-do list.

The S6 gets within half an inch of corners &#8212; the deepest of all the vacuums we tested.</p><p>The vacuum also rarely gets stuck. In fact, it even somehow managed to keep going despite a floor strewn with Nerf darts after an epic battle with my kids.</p><p>The Roborock S6's mop function worked well and I appreciated that waterflow is adjustable so you're not creating mini puddles.&#160;</p><p>The Roborock app lets you schedule sessions, adjust the suction power, and set how many passes the unit completes in a certain space. After a few runs, the S6 will have enough data to make a map of your home so you can set no-go zones.</p><p>Including scheduling, set up took about 15 minutes. All you need to do is charge the vacuum on the dock, pair the vac with the app, and you're ready to go.</p><p>It was loud; I recorded it at 70 decibels (dB) on high suction, which is similar to city traffic. However, it does sport a Quiet mode, which is only around 56 dB.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/roborock-s6-robot-vacuum-mop-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full Roborock S6 Robot Vacuum review.</a></p>\n\tThe best affordable robot vacuum\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6042582b2dc90100183559f9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best Roboto Vacuums Moosoo MT 720\" height=\"1251\" width=\"1668\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James Brains/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>If you're looking for a cost-effective vac that cleans well on a variety of surfaces, gets deep into corners, and runs quietly, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089R737HV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B089R737HV&#38;linkId=d1a054248c513a9c596f901d411672c4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Moosoo MT-720 Robot Vacuum</a></strong><strong>&#160;is your best bet.</strong></h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Robot vacuum size: </strong>12.5\" x 12.5\" x 3\"</li><li><strong>Main brush length:</strong> 5.5\"</li><li><strong>Dust bin capacity:</strong> 600 mL</li><li><strong>Battery life: </strong>2 hours</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> 2 years</li><li><strong>Features: </strong>Wi-Fi app connectivity (available for iOS and Android), compatible with Alexa and Google Home, scheduling</li><li><strong>Extras:</strong> Extra side brushes, a remote control, extra air filter, cleaning tool</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Good performance on carpet and hardwood, excellent corner cleaning, quiet operation, compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa, low-profile design</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Gets stuck easily, can't set no-go zones</p><p>Of the models that performed well in our testing, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089R737HV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B089R737HV&#38;linkId=d1a054248c513a9c596f901d411672c4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Moosoo MT-720</a> has the lowest price. It's powerful, easy to use, and gets deep into corners.&#160;</p><p>Setting up the vacuum took five minutes.&#160;The app lets you schedule the vacuum to clean at the same time every day or mix it up. You can also choose smart, wall follow, spiral, random, and manual control cleaning modes. The app creates a map of the area cleaned, but you cannot set no-go zones as you can with other room mapping robot vacs.</p><p>The MT-720's performance was good on hardwood and carpet, picking up almost all of the coffee grounds, kitty litter, and pet hair. In corners, it did an outstanding job, coming within an inch of the corner and picking up 70% of the flour on carpeting and 85% on hard flooring. At 12.5 inches in diameter and 3 inches high, the vac is small enough to get into tight spaces that other models might miss.</p><p>Counterintuitively, the strong suction didn't translate into loud operation. On high suction, the sound meter registered 66 dB, or a little louder than a business office. On low, it was 59 dB, which is quieter than normal conversation.&#160;</p><p>The biggest negative with the MT-720 is that it tends to get stuck easily. During testing, it regularly got stuck on the one-inch threshold between the living room and kitchen of the testing area.</p>\n\tThe best robot vacuum and mop\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faee660402d49001924ee67?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best Robot Vacuums 2021 Ecovacs T8 AIVI\" height=\"1249\" width=\"1666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James Brains/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GH3N618/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08GH3N618&#38;linkId=a6483c2f86210449ed1308218dc525e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo Pro Mopping System</a>&#160;thoroughly cleans floors as opposed to pushing a wet cloth around.

With the app, you can choose from four water flow levels to reach a balance of moistness and quick drying, and two mopping patterns. The deep scrubbing option provides a thorough cleaning, and the quick scrubbing is for routine mopping. And, I appreciated that it automatically avoids carpeting.</p><p>As for the robot vac itself, the Ozmo T8 AIVI has HD video and a microphone so you can watch your pets or check for open windows and doors from your phone. I didn't find the home surveillance features particularly useful, but they could be handy if you're concerned about security.&#160;</p><p>The more useful feature is the auto-empty station that automatically empties the dustbin after cleaning sessions. You just replace the disposable pouch every month or two.&#160;</p><p>On both carpeting and hardwood, the Ozmo T8 AIVI was among the best at removing the debris types we tested. Plus, it remains fairly quiet at just 67 dB on the highest cleaning setting and 58 dB on Quiet mode.&#160;</p><p>However, the vac consistently got stuck on a one-inch lip between rooms. It also wasn't able to come within two inches of corners.</p><p>Setup was seamless. I plugged in the dock to charge the vacuum, connected the app, updated the firmware, and set a schedule for cleaning. After two cleanings, the vac created a map of my layout so I could set no-go zones to keep the T8 AIVI away from sensitive areas.</p><h3>Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo Pro Mopping System</h3><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"button\" data-pid=\"5faee705be509c5cf91e4a31\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Deebot Ozmo Pro Mopping System (button)</bi-shortcode><h3>Ecovcas Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI Robot Vacuum</h3>\n\tThe best robot vacuum for hardwood floors\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa58b82f7d1cb0019e3a423?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best Robot Vacuums 2021 Roomba S9&#43;\" height=\"1251\" width=\"1668\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James Brains/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The D-shaped <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://store.irobot.com/default/roomba-vacuuming-robot-vacuum-irobot-roomba-s9-plus/s955020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iRobot Roomba s9+ Robot Vacuum</a> did the best in our hardwood floor tests and features a self-emptying dustbin, impressive app that lets you set no-go zones, and large main brushes that pick up debris on the first pass.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Robot vacuum size: </strong>12.25\" x 12.25\" x 3.5\"</li><li><strong>Main brush length: </strong>two brushes, each 9.5\"</li><li><strong>Dust bin capacity: </strong>380 mL</li><li><strong>Battery life (per manufacturer): </strong>2 hours</li><li><strong>Warranty: </strong>One year parts and labor</li><li><strong>Features: </strong>Wi-Fi app connectivity (available for iOS and Android), compatible with Alexa and Google Home, scheduling, virtual no-go zones, zoned cleaning</li><li><strong>Extras: </strong>Auto-empty station, two disposable dirt bags, extra side brush, extra air filter, cleaning tool</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Cleans well on hardwood flooring, good performance on carpeting, rarely gets stuck, comes with a charging dock that empties the dustbin, large main brushes, has a useful app with virtual no-go zones</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Loud, poor performance in carpeted corners</p><p>As iRobot's top-of-the-line model, the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://store.irobot.com/default/roomba-vacuuming-robot-vacuum-irobot-roomba-s9-plus/s955020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Roomba s9+ Robot Vacuum</a> is packed with features.

The unit didn't get stuck in our testing area either.&#160;</p><p>At 77 dB (about as loud as a busy city street) on high suction power, the s9+ was by far the loudest model we tested, and even in Quiet mode, the vacuum is not unnoticeable.&#160;</p><p>Additionally, the vac got within an inch of the carpeted corner, but it left behind about 70% of the flour, which suggests it doesn't do as well picking up fine debris on carpeting, especially in areas the main brushes have trouble reaching.</p><p>Installation was easy, but it took about 25 minutes.

Specs aside, a portion of each sale also goes to the <a href=\"https://www.bissellpetfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bissell Pet Foundation</a>, which is committed to finding loving homes for pets.</p><p>The Bissell SpinWave picked up all of the cat and dog hair we laid out on carpeting and hardwood. Additionally, on the hardwood, it only left a trace of kitty litter and flour. In corners, it came within two inches and picked up more than 60% of the flour on both the carpet and hardwood.</p><p>It's also among the quietest vacs we tested &#8211; 58 decibels on Quiet mode (slightly quieter than a normal conversation) and 65 on high suction. If you have particularly skittish pets, the low-decibel output is less likely to startle your fur friends.&#160;</p><p>The vacuum's extras are useful to any pet parent, including a mop tank attachment, spinning mop pads, and a trial-size bottle of cleaning formula. Plus, you receive a cleaning tool that helps remove hairs from the brushes and clean the filter.</p><p>In testing, the mop attachment worked seamlessly. You just fill the tank with water and some of the cleaning formula and attach it to the vacuum in place of the dustbin. The mop pads spin to scrub away stuck-on debris while avoiding carpeting.</p><p>The SpinWave has a quick setup taking all of five minutes, including installing the app and connecting the unit.&#160;</p><p>The biggest limitation is it consistently got stuck on the one-inch threshold between rooms.&#160;</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5faee9f6bf96b9404b3e3819\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5faee9f6bf96b9404b3e3819&type=button&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div>\n\tWhat else we tested\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faf04c6402d49001924ef53?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best Robot Vacuums 2021\" height=\"2239\" width=\"2986\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James Brains/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>We've tested 25 robot vacuums and counting, here are the ones that didn't make our top picks.</p><h3>What else we recommend and why</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RGDFZ5Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07RGDFZ5Q&#38;linkId=763a2aa988c732c44882011b576928b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Eufy RoboVac 15C Max</strong></a><strong> ($175.99):</strong> Formerly our pick for the best affordable robot vacuum, the 15C Max offers an impressive suite of high-end features for its reasonable price, including smart connectivity and powerful suction on carpeting and hardwood. We dropped it from our guide because the Moosoo MT-720 performed similarly, including doing a better job in corners, and it's currently $11 cheaper. However, the 15C Max doesn't get stuck as easily. If that's important to you, you may want to choose this model instead when on a budget.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F2S98DM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08F2S98DM&#38;linkId=e0736ed6b699ff74cbd82092ddfac20d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Ecovacs U2 Pro</a> ($299.99):</strong> Of the eight vacuums I've tested since the last update, this was the best. It did excellent cleaning hardwood and carpeting and rarely got stuck. The U2 Pro also comes with a mop attachment, which didn't do a good job of cleaning up dried Tang on linoleum. Despite good performance, it couldn't compete with our current top picks, and was too expensive for consideration as our best budget pick. Other negatives include loud operation, poor corner cleaning, and boundary strips for setting no-go zones are sold separately.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JCDCH22/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08JCDCH22&#38;linkId=03522593de8c83a7ce7d027435b6ab82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">ILife A10</a> ($279.99 with coupon/$349.99 without): </strong>If setting no-go zones is important to you, then the A10 might be a good option. After it maps your house, you can set up virtual barriers in the app. This model also does an outstanding job of cleaning hardwood and carpet. But, there are plenty of cons: The A10 barely picked up any flour in carpeted corners, it runs loudly, and it gets stuck easily.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C2WLBRX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08C2WLBRX&#38;linkId=faa0c9854eb0227f6fd790d4b938f0a1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Proscenic M7 Pro</a> ($419)</strong>: I enjoy the automation afforded by self-empty charging docks, and the M7 Pro has one that works well. You can also set no-go zones in the app. Plus, the vac didn't get stuck easily and performed well on carpeting and hard flooring. Yet, it had trouble cleaning corners and was loud. Plus, with a height of four inches, it doesn't fit under low-clearance furniture.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HPGVT4J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08HPGVT4J&#38;linkId=b433d9fb3b5ed8a50a7dae9aa6a034e3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Moosoo R3</a> ($249.99 with coupon/$299.99 without)</strong>: If you mainly have hardwood flooring, the Moosoo R3 may be a smart choice for you, especially if you can get it on sale. It performed excellent on hardwood in our tests, ran quietly, and you can set no-go zones in the app. The vac did well on carpeting too, but it had trouble cleaning corners.

It picked up almost all of the debris on hardwood in our testing, got deep into the corners, and got all of the grounds, hair, and litter on the carpet. However, it left 20% of the flour behind, got stuck easily, and runs loudly. Plus, in my long-term testing, the vac regularly disconnected from the app and required my attention to run on schedule.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TXGQS3H/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07TXGQS3H&#38;linkId=9d9b61f60b91551d1ee45e8b69e992fe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Roborock S4</a> ($429.99): </strong>There's a lot to like about the Roborock S4. However, the main reasons it didn't make our top picks are because it's loud, doesn't come with many extras, and at 3.75 inches high, it doesn't fit under low-clearance furniture. It's pretty similar to our top pick, the S6, but lacks many of the features, such as a mop attachment. However, the S4 was excellent on carpeting, hardwood, and in corners, and it rarely got stuck. This is a more affordable alternative to the S6 if you're not interested in a mop attachment.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084Z5JD5Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B084Z5JD5Q&#38;linkId=271016f7d693e42c27c9d7e3460af317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Roborock S6 MaxV</strong></a><strong> ($699.99): </strong>For the most part, Roborock is doing a terrific job in the robot vac space. We recommend the S6 MaxV because of its excellent performance in our carpeting, hardwood, and corner tests. It also has video surveillance and a two-way microphone if you're looking for additional home security, no-go zones, and a useful app. But it has the same large dimensions as the S4 and it kept getting stuck on the one-inch lip leading into the kitchen of our testing course. It isn't as loud as the S4, but louder than others we've tested.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FiRobot-Roomba-i7-Wi-Fi-Connected-Robot-Vacuum-with-Automatic-Dirt-Disposal-7550-i755020%2F306684926%3Firgwc%3D1%26cm_mmc%3Dafl-ir-10078-456723-businessinsider.com%26clickid%3DQHK3vPSsNxyOWjLwUx0Mo3bxUkiXsfw3j1Zq2o0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>iRobot Roomba i7+</strong></a><strong> ($599.99): </strong>The Roomba i7+ was the first robot vacuum to feature an automatic dirt disposal charging dock. Since then, iRobot has introduced two other models that improve upon the i7+. Though this Roomba has great high-end features, its performance doesn't justify its price. It only did a satisfactory job on carpeting and hardwood, and it got stuck fairly often. If you find the i7+ on sale, we recommend picking it up.

I also consulted three experts and took their advice and expertise into consideration &#8212; Dr. Luis Javier Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez, a lung and sleep health specialist at the <a href=\"https://pcsifl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulmonary, Critical Care &#38; Sleep Disorders Institute of South Florida</a>; Andrea Ferro, Ph.D., a professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Clarkson University and the current president of the American Association for Aerosol Research; and Jill Notini, the Vice President of Communication and Marketing for the <a href=\"https://www.aham.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers</a>.</p><p>In addition to using each robot vacuum daily for at least several weeks, I tested each one for its suction on various types of flooring including corners, ability to maneuver around obstacles, noise, and special features. Our testing methodology has gotten more comprehensive over the years, so for any models that I'd previously tested but didn't have the vacuums on hand anymore, I extrapolated the data as best as possible based on previous testing and manufacturer info. Those vacuums are the iRobot Roomba i7+, Neato Botvac D7 Connected, Eufy 11S Max and 15C Max, and Roborock S4, S6, and E35.&#160;</p><p>Here are the main attributes we look for and how we test them</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>I note the specs of the overall unit, main brush, and side brushes. This gives me an idea of how well a vacuum can clean floors and carpet &#8212; the larger the brushes, the more they can usually sweep up. The main brushes are often somewhere between 5 to 10 inches long and side brushes are usually 2 to 3 inches long. Of the vacs I've tested, only Roomba models have two main brushes; others just have one. I've noticed that longer brushes tend to facilitate faster cleaning. If this appeals to you, consider a unit with a longer brush, such as the Roomba s9+.</p><p><strong>Carpet cleaning: </strong>I poured a tablespoon each of flour, coffee grounds, and kitty litter on 18-inch-square sections of carpeting. To make sure I had enough pet hair, I also collected pet hairs from my rat terrier and two cats to place on carpeting. I ran the vacuum on its most powerful mode for two cleaning cycles and compared before-and-after photos to estimate the percentage of each material picked up or left behind.</p><p><strong>Hardwood floor cleaning: </strong>This is the same test as the carpet cleaning test, but on hardwood flooring.</p><p><strong>Corner cleaning</strong>: To test corner cleaning abilities, I poured a teaspoon of flour in an approximately four-inch-radius in a corner on hardwood and carpeting. I took pictures of the messes before and after running the robot vac for two cleaning cycles to compare how much flour was left over. I also measured how close to the corner the vac was able to reach.</p><p><strong>Obstacle avoidance</strong>: You don't want your robot vac to get stuck while it's cleaning or when it's returning to its charging dock, both of which force you to hunt it down while it's sending you notifications or making annoying error sounds. I tested the vacuum in an approximately 500-square-foot room with several obstacles, including stairs, a one-inch threshold to a kitchen, and a table with chairs.</p><p><strong>Loudness: </strong>I used <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ECCZWWI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_012220_best-robot-vacuum-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00ECCZWWI&#38;linkId=ccc28310a5f40b3188ec924737266e85\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">a sound meter</a> to measure the decibel output of each of the robot vacuums from 12 inches away as they ran on the highest and lowest settings. For vacuums I no longer had in my possession for testing, I relied on manufactures' info and my previous notes.&#160;</p><p><strong>Brushes: </strong>I noted the lengths of the main and side brushes as they'll likely indicate performance in our cleaning tests.</p><p>Robot vacuums work using a combination of suction and brushes. There are two types of brushes on a robot vacuums: the side brush and the main brush. Units have either one or two side brushes that are about three inches in diameter and protrude from the forward portion of the vac. They move in a circular motion, get into corners, and feed debris to the main brush. There appears to be little difference in the performance of vacuums with two side brushes versus those with one.</p><p>The main brush is between five and ten inches long, located under the unit, and is made of a rubber-like material. The vacuum sucks debris into the main brush which spins to feed the materials into the dustbin. Of the vacs I've tested, only Roomba models have two main brushes. Other models just have one. I've noticed that longer brushes tend to facilitate faster cleaning. If this appeals to you, consider a unit with a longer brush, such as the Roomba s9+.</p><p><strong>Extras:</strong> I note if the vacuums included extras such as filters and side brush replacements, mop attachments, a cleaning tool, and more.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><strong>Special features: </strong>All of the vacuums featured some method for scheduling and returning to their charging dock on their own, so those weren't useful differentiators. Auto-dirt disposal, voice control, and home surveillance aren't universal, so you may want to consider if those are important.

It also has cameras for obstacle detection and avoidance and home surveillance. The biggest negatives appear to be the expensive price and the 5.6-inch height, which may keep it from fitting under furniture.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-latest-innovations-for-a-better-normal-at-ces-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samsung JetBot 90 AI+ (price not yet available)</a>:</strong> Samsung just announced the release of an AI-based robot vac at the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ces-2021-best-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2021 CES trade show</a> and we're looking forward to testing its smart-learning capabilities to avoid obstacles.

Generally speaking, the higher the Pa, the better, but that's a misleading metric of comparison.&#160;</p><p>When I talked to engineers at iRobot about a year ago, they told me that there are several ways to measure suction power, but there are no industry standards. They viewed the reported Pa measurements as essentially useless, hence why it's nearly impossible to find suction power for iRobot vacs. It's also difficult to find the Pa for Ecovacs, though Eufy and Roborock report the measurements for their models.</p><p>Due to the inconsistent reporting from manufacturer s, we don't include Pa as a part of our testing methodology and criteria.</p>\n\tHow to shop for a robot vacuum\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faf05dd1c741f0019ac9d05?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best Robot Vacuums 2021\" height=\"3996\" width=\"5328\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James Brains/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>While using a robot vacuum is easy enough, shopping for one can be overwhelming. Here are the main aspects to look for when considering which one to buy.&#160;</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> If you have furniture that's hard to move or low-clearance pieces like sofas or bed frames, you'll want to pay attention to the height of a robot vacuum; the other dimensions are usually within the range of reason for a normal household. For example, I have several radiators in my house with a 3.5-inch clearance that slim vacuums can get under, while just-slim-enough models sometimes get stuck, and too-thick models bump up against and go elsewhere. If you want your robot vacuum to get under your low-clearance furniture, make sure you choose a model that is slim enough to do so.&#160;</p><p><strong>Features: </strong>It's important to think about what features you actually need. For instance, if you work from home and are rarely away, HD cameras aren't useful since you can keep tabs on your home with your own eyes. If your floors are covered with carpet, you don't need your robot vac to mop. I also almost never use voice control out of personal habit, but if you use Alexa or Google Assistant for everything, then compatibility with those services is a must.</p><p><strong>Extras: </strong>You can easily purchase extra filters or brushes for robot vacs, but we think having them included with the unit is better. All of our top picks include useful extras like brushes or dirt disposal bags.</p><p><strong>Price: </strong>Robot vacuums go on sale often, and the discounts are steepest during Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. We expect most of the models we recommend in this guide to go on sale so it pays to wait until those sale days.</p>\n\tHow to use a robot vacuum\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faf07e71c741f0019ac9d0e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best Robot Vacuums 2021\" height=\"4000\" width=\"5333\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James Brains/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Robot vacuums make keeping your house clean easier, but there's still some regular maintenance needed to improve the performance and longevity as well as help your indoor air quality.&#160;</p><p><strong>Run your robot vac when no one is around: </strong>Andrea Ferro, Ph.D., a professor at Clarkson University and president of <a href=\"https://www.aaar.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AAAR</a>, and Dr. Luis Javier Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez, a lung and sleep health specialist at <a href=\"https://pcsifl.business.site/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PCSI</a>, both recommend running your robot vacuum in unoccupied areas. The robot vacs can kick dust, pollutants, and microbes back into the air as it vacuums floors, which can lead to subpar indoor air quality. \"Every vacuum, including a robot vacuum, has the potential to release some dust, particles, and allergens back into the air, but the benefits still outweigh the risks,\" said Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez.&#160;</p><p><strong>And run it regularly: </strong>Ferro and Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez agree that you should run your robot vac at least once per week and more if you have pets and heavy-traffic areas. Ferro even suggests that daily cleaning isn't a bad idea. I generally set my vacuums to run in the early morning before I wake up or when the level of my house where the vacuum is running will be unoccupied, especially since I live in a large house with three pets and no HVAC system.</p><p><strong>Clean the dustbin and filter:</strong> If you're regularly vacuuming your space, you'll need to make sure to empty the dustbin and clean the filter. According to Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez, you should clean the vacuum's filter at least once a week, or twice a week if you have a pet.&#160;&#160;</p><p>You'll also need to replace the filter and brushes every few months. Manufacturers usually give guidelines in the vac's user manual on how often you should replace these components, but a good sign that it's time to replace your filters or brushes is if they appear to be damaged or if your vac just isn't doing as good of a job of cleaning as it once did.&#160;</p><p>Fortunately, many models come with extra filters and brushes, but eventually, you'll have to purchase replacements. Manufacturers usually link to their parts store in your robot vac's app, but you can also usually find parts on Amazon so it's worth shopping around. Just make sure that you are buying the right parts for your model.</p><p><strong>Use it in addition to a traditional vacuum:&#160; </strong>Despite how far robot vacuums have come in the last decade, they won't replace your stick and upright vacuums anytime soon.</p>\n\tFAQs\n\t\n\t<h3>Do you still need another vacuum if you have a robot vac?</h3><p>While the dream is to set your robot vacuum on a schedule and have it do all the floor cleaning for you, it's just not the reality at the moment. Robot vacuums don't clean as much dirt and debris as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-vacuum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upright vacuums</a>. \"I think you'd still need a stick or upright vacuum for spots that the robot vac can't reach,\" Ferro said.</p><p>Robot vacs function best as maintenance cleaners. Having them run a couple times a week will make your floors less gunky, especially if you have pets. But these vacuums also need babysitting. You need to clear their path of anything that might get tangled in their wheels, and some have trouble getting into or out of tight spaces. Their bins are fairly small, so you'll need to empty them more regularly than an upright or stick version.&#160;</p><p>Even squarish robot vacuums &#8212; as opposed to round ones &#8212; aren't perfect at getting into corners. Some are too tall to fit under certain types of furniture. They obviously avoid stairs, too. Upright vacuums typically come with attachments that are useful for cleaning things like drapes or furniture, which robot vacs can't handle.&#160;</p><p>\"Research indicates that robot vacuums are not meant to replace upright vacuums,\" Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez said. \"That likely has to do with their smaller motor size. They're good for touch-ups and in-between uses.\"</p><p>When it comes to robot vacuums, expect maintenance not miracles.</p><hr /><h3>How have robot vacuum cleaners improved?</h3><p>Since iRobot's first Roomba came on the market in the early 2000s, robot vacuum technology has improved a lot. You can now find square-ish models in addition to round ones, and the mapping technology is much better.&#160;</p><p>Cameras and optical sensors can help with obstacle recognition, and LiDAR-based navigation uses lasers to detect objects. These capabilities aren't perfect, but vacuums are now more adept at finding their way back to charging docks than they were even a few years ago. Another new feature is self-emptying bins, which suck the debris out of the robot and into a canister in the charging dock.&#160;</p><p>Many robot vacuums are now smart, letting you start a cleaning session from an app or by asking a smart speaker. Some, like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VCQRY4W/?tag=bisafetynet2-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Roborock S6 Robot Vacuum</a>, let you block off entire rooms in an app, so you don't have to worry about them getting stuck on your kid's clothing piles. With cameras and connectivity come some privacy concerns.&#160;</p><p>Some interesting features aren't universal, such as auto-dirt disposal and home surveillance. To get more guidance on these features, I spoke with Jill Notini, Vice President of Communications and Marketing for<a href=\"https://www.aham.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> AHAM</a>.</p><p>A few of the new features she's excited about &#8212; and that are found in many if not all of the models in our guide &#8212; include:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Advanced navigation: </strong>\"Many of today's models have the ability to map a home and remember how to get around objects and stay out of tough spots. You can also program the robots to vacuum specific areas of the home.\" You can also set no-go zones that the vacuum should avoid on your phone via the app.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Mopping ability: </strong>\"Robots are evolving into floor care multitaskers,\" said Notini. \"In addition to vacuuming, some models now have the ability to mop, both wet and dry.\"</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Voice control: </strong>\"Robotic vacuums can now respond to voice commands, either directly or through an outside system like Amazon Alexa.\"</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Remote operation: </strong>\"You can start, stop, or control your robotic vacuum with your mobile device.\"</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Cameras: </strong>\"Cameras have been incorporated into some models to help the robot map the room and allow you to get a robot's eye view of cleaning and keep an eye on your house while you're away.\"</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Fall prevention: \"</strong>Even with all of the new features and technological advances, robotic vacuums still have not gained the ability to climb stairs. Many models now utilize sensors to prevent themselves from taking a tumble down the stairs or off a higher level.\" All of the robots in our testing were able to sense cliffs and avoid falling down stairs.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Automatic dirt disposal: </strong>One of the most useful features that's becoming more ubiquitous is the charging dock that automatically empties the vacuum's dustbin. Even the largest bins need to be emptied with regular use so it's a maintenance task you'll need to perform once a week &#8212; at best. But with the self-emptying dock, the chore is no longer necessary. You just throw away and replace the disposable dirt bag every month or two.</li></ul><hr /><h3>Can a robot vacuum prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus?</h3><p>The novel coronavirus is most easily spread through face-to-face interactions and in close quarters, and if someone in your household has been sick &#8212; even if it's not with COVID-19 &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it's recommended to clean and disinfect the area</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"Currently the CDC recommends that we take precautionary measures for vacuuming during the COVID-19 outbreak although there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming,\" Pe&#241;a-Hern&#225;ndez said. \"It recommends using a vacuum with a HEPA filter, opening outside doors and windows to increase air circulation, and not vacuuming areas with people in it.\"&#160;</p><hr /><h3>How do you clean a robot vac?</h3><p>Though robot vacuums automate cleaning your floors, they are not completely hands-off. There are several care and maintenance steps you should take to ensure your vac operates properly for many years to come. Manufacturers provide clear instructions for how to clean and maintain your robot vacuum in the user manual or app.&#160;</p><p>Here are some general maintenance tasks:</p><ul><li><strong>Empty the dustbin:</strong> Depending on how dirty your home is, you will want to empty your robot vacuum's dustbin after every use. If you run your vac on a daily basis and don't have pets, you can get away with doing this chore once a week.</li><li><strong>Clean the filter and dustbin:</strong> This is a weekly task. Cleaning the filter is important because the vacuum doesn't clean as well when the filter is dirty. Most models' filter and dustbin can be cleaned with water. I usually clean and thoroughly dry the dustbin while letting the filter air dry. While the filter is air drying, I insert the extra filter that most units come with. Whatever you do, make sure the filter and dustbin dry completely before you use them again.</li><li><strong>Clean front wheel, brushes, sensors, and charging contacts:</strong> You should do this every two to four weeks. Most robot vacuums come with a cleaning tool with a brush on one end and a cutting blade on the other. Use these to cut out hairs that are wrapped around the brushes and wheel and to brush away debris. Use a soft dry cloth to dust the sensors and charging contacts per the manufacturer's instructions.</li></ul><p>Additionally, after about two months of use, it's time to replace the filter. The front caster wheel and brushes &#8212; both the main brush and side brushes &#8212; should be replaced every year or so.</p><hr /><h3>Can you fix a robot vac?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the problem. In my years of testing robot vacuums, I've probably ran into every problem a robot vacuum can experience: falling down stairs (surprisingly uncommon), running through pet accidents, attempts at taking up crocheting, etc. I've learned that these machines are resilient.&#160;</p><p>That said, any attempt to fix a problem with your robot vacuum should start with consulting customer service. After I determined there was no chance I could clean the pet waste off my robot vacuum, I reached out to the manufacturer. And, even though the warranty specifically states these accidents aren't covered, they still provided me with a replacement unit for free.&#160;</p><p>The most common problem I face is the vacuum finding my wife's yarn and wrapping it around its wheels and brushes. When this happens, you can usually work the thread free if you're patient. I usually just cut it free.&#160;</p>\n\tCheck out our guides to more great vacuum cleaners\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ed0070cf34d051f873bd7d4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"best cordless

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/voip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VoIP</a> is shorthand for a telecommunication technology called Voice over Internet Protocol, and it&#39;s a modern alternative to traditional phones. For a century or so, landline telephone systems have carried voice data over a network called the public switched telephone network (PTSN). VoIP, on the other hand, allows voice calls to be transmitted over the internet. Your VoIP phone is simply a node on the internet with an IP address, much like your desktop computer. </p><p>Although VoIP phones work over the internet, they behave almost exactly the same as traditional landline phones - they use area codes and phone numbers, not usernames or passcodes. </p><p>It&#39;s also worth noting that even though your smartphone is an internet device and uses the cellular network to connect to the internet, phone calls you make with your voice plan are not VoIP - instead, cellular calls are transmitted using the voice cellular network. This is why most plans track voice and internet data usage separately. </p><h2>How VoIP works</h2><p>To use Voice over IP, you generally need a dedicated VoIP desktop phone (usually called an IP phone) which, instead of plugging into a phone jack, connects to the internet - usually by plugging into an internet router with an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethernet cable</a> or another <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-mesh-wifi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">form of high-speed internet</a> connection.</p><p>To enable the phone, you need to subscribe to a service plan with a VoIP service provider. Generally, businesses have VoIP accounts which are substantially less expensive than traditional landline phone plans. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c4a2a35c46f0018c0babf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"woman using landline phone in office\" height=\"1668\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>VoIP phones can be used in office spaces in place of landlines.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Morsa Images/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>When you dial a phone number using a VoIP phone, the phone sends packets of data to the internet, which is transmitted much like any other kind of internet data. The VoIP service provider sends the data from your phone to the phone that was dialed, where the data arrived and is turned back into audio information. </p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>The advantages and disadvantages of VoIP</strong></h2><p>In general, VoIP is a substantial improvement over traditional landline services, but there are few obvious downsides to VoIP.<br><br></p><h3><strong>The advantages:</strong></h3><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>It&#39;s more reliable.</strong> While the PTSN has little redundancy and calls can be lost or incomplete if there are network issues, VoIP uses the internet, which is robust and can routinely work around outages and hardware problems. </li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>VoIP can be significantly cheaper than landlines.</strong> Businesses like VoIP because it requires substantially less hardware to connect a large number of phones to the PTSN. Residential users can often get VoIP bundled with internet and cable TV for less money than a landline from a traditional phone provider would cost. </li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>It&#39;s mobile.</strong> Because IP phones are simply internet devices, you can typically move an IP phone to any available Ethernet connection - it&#39;s not restricted to a specific desk or location. Even better, a VoIP user can generally use a compatible VoIP app on their phone to make calls when away from the VoIP phone.  <br><br></li></ul><h3><strong>The disadvantages:<br></strong></h3><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You generally need a broadband internet connection.</strong> You don&#39;t need a lot of bandwidth for voice communication, but if your internet connection is below about 10Mbps, you can have problems with audio quality. </li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Internet connectivity issues can disrupt phone service</strong>. As a general rule, VoIP is highly reliable. But if you do have an internet connectivity problem, it can take out both data and voice at the same time. If you had a landline, it would probably not have been affected by the internet outage. </li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You might have issues with 911 services.</strong> The FCC requires that VoIP provider who fully connect to the PTSN provide emergency 911 services. But there are exceptions - not all VoIP systems need to be compatible with Enhanced 911 services - and there might be situations when a call to 911 does not automatically provide emergency services with your location. </li></ul></aside><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module-end-of-article\" class=\"mceNonEditable\"><a data-type=\"5ecd62683ad86133445d5ae5\" data-title=\"What is Wi-Fi calling?

I personally enjoyed it when he guided hatha yoga, a type of yoga that is paired with breathing techniques. Some of his tips for practicing mindfulness in yoga include <strong>forming an intention to settle into stillness, adjusting your back to be comfortable, and embracing awareness of your body, </strong>which I now try to keep in mind whenever I meditate or do yoga. It was also soothing to hear his calming voice during the guided practice.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c5ae135c46f0018c0bb37?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jon Kabat-Zinn MasterClass\" height=\"1538\" width=\"2870\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">MasterClass</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3>Mindfulness can directly help you alleviate a stress response.</h3><p>Kabat-Zinn is very solution-oriented and amplifies how mindfulness is beneficial in alleviating symptoms of health issues many people face today. One thing that really resonated with me is how practicing mindfulness can help your body recover from its stress response. Whenever I feel anxious, exhausted, or irritated, I make an attempt to be aware of the context of the stress and take a few moments to just breathe. <strong>Through this practice, my body starts to cool down and a lot of my physical symptoms - like sweaty palms - start to subside as well.</strong> Ultimately, Kabat-Zinn frames mindfulness as a problem-focused strategy that can help cultivate a calm mind when your body is under duress. </p><h3>Greater awareness helps you focus on things that will actually make you happy.</h3><p>Kabat-Zinn emphasizes how mindfulness can be crucial in uncovering important truths about yourself. He identifies how this state of being aware helps you incorporate more trust, self-improvement, and kindness in your daily life. Personally, it&#39;s helped me reduce my desires for things I initially believe will make me happy. <strong>I&#39;m guilty of worrying about perfection and spreading myself too thin, but after taking this course, I started to reflect more and recognized that these habits weren&#39;t cultivating real happiness.</strong> When I think mindfully, I try to focus on myself - not the outside world - and identify how I can find happiness from within to be fulfilled in the long term.</p><h2>What to expect from the class</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c5d3c35c46f0018c0bb3f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jon Kabat-Zinn MasterClass\" height=\"1520\" width=\"2862\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">MasterClass</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Kabat-Zinn teaches the ins and outs of mindfulness in a very organized fashion, <strong>making abstract concepts easy to understand through real-life examples and analogies.</strong> Every lecture is divided into subtopics, which makes the material easy to follow and review. The key ideas from the course are also available in the guide, along with many charts and diagrams. </p><p>This course includes 20 videos, which collectively add up to over six hours of lectures. Therefore, you can take it all in one sitting or over a few weeks, watching videos whenever you have free time. In addition to the lectures, the course comes with a 26-page downloadable PDF guide with key takeaways and highlighted facts. MasterClass also offers an optional community forum where you can start discussions with other students on course content.</p><p>As with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-better-sleep-masterclass-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MasterClass courses in general</a>, I really like how this class can be taken at your own pace and time. And while courses with interactive quizzes and exams can help you stay on track, I like that MasterClass lets me focus solely on learning the content instead of thinking about my grades.  </p><h2>The bottom line</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c5a5335c46f0018c0bb36?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jon Kabat-Zinn MasterClass\" height=\"1536\" width=\"2866\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">MasterClass</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Ultimately, this class doesn&#39;t just broadly teach you about mindfulness - it shows you tangible daily practices to better cope with stress, develop a calm mind, and feel more fulfilled. By the end, you&#39;ll know exactly how mindfulness transforms your body and mind, so you can empower and influence others with tips to live more fulfilling, healthier lives just by boosting their awareness.</p><p>For instance, <strong>after taking the class, I find myself more frequently recommending mindfulness apps to friends who feel drained or burned out. </strong>As a result, a lot of my friends have gotten more into deep breathing practices and meditation. We&#39;ve also started gifting each other gift cards and mindfulness app subscriptions in an effort to inspire each other to engage in this practice. </p><p>It all ties in with what Kabat-Zinn emphasizes in the course: that mindfulness is a necessity to humanity, a medicine that can help reduce human suffering.<strong> He also believes that mindfulness can bring communities together, maximizing everyone&#39;s wellbeing.</strong> Even though adding mindfulness to our lives is a small change, it can make meaningful differences in helping us discover who we are, improve our relationships, and harness our inner potential to make an impact. </p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"small\" data-pid=\"608c20b1a3247900115899a6\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Jon Kabat-Zinn Teaches Mindfulness and Meditation (small)</bi-shortcode><h2>About MasterClass:</h2><p>An annual subscription to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterclass.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">MasterClass</a> is $180 (or $15 a month), giving you unlimited access to over 100 classes, with new ones added monthly.

We tested 11 different tables for kids, from picnic tables to basic-use tables, considering their durability, stability, ergonomic positioning, and ease of cleaning.

The table has raised edges to stop crayons, markers, and other supplies from rolling off, and it has a large storage drawer with two compartments. The table surface is gray while every other surface is white.&#160;</p><p>Although it doesn't come with chairs, it's the right height for younger kids to stand at the table and for older kids to kneel or sit. The table is 19.5 inches from the ground, which is about belly button height on my 3-year-old.</p><p>In our cleaning test, everything came off easily with a basic household cleaner with the exception of the colored pencil, which came off with a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mr-clean-magic-eraser-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magic Eraser</a>. The storage drawers in the front have pros and cons when it comes to cleaning. The pro: If you're in a rush, pull out the drawer and push everything in with one arm swipe. The con: If you don't clean up a liquid spill on the table quickly, it will drip into the drawer.&#160;</p><p>From the second I picked up the box, I could tell the table would be very sturdy. It does not budge unless you have one or two adults trying to move it. It has also proven to be durable, with no dents, chips, or other signs of wear.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best activity table for kids\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c4d6d35c46f0018c0bad8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pottery Barn Kids Carolina Grow With You Activity Table\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alica Betz/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.potterybarnkids.com%2Fproducts%2Fcarolina-grow-with-you-activity-table-espresso%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Pottery Barn Kids Carolina Grow-With-You Activity Table</a> has the look and feel of being high quality plus it's durable and easy to clean &#8212; two musts for kids tables.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Two leg-length options, very sturdy, raised edges, three color options<strong> &#160;</strong></p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Pricey, crumbs get stuck in corners<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>With a high-end design and three color options, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.potterybarnkids.com%2Fproducts%2Fcarolina-grow-with-you-activity-table-espresso%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Pottery Barn Kids Carolina Grow-With-You Activity Table</a> will not be an eyesore in your home. Ideal for crafts and activities, it has raised edges to keep everything on the surface.&#160;</p><p>It has proved to be very durable and stable in our tests. The table doesn't wobble or tip, and we haven't seen any chips, cracks, dents, or other signs of wear. In addition to our clean test, this table also saw a lot of daily use throughout our testing as the main craft table for my toddler.&#160;</p><p>In our cleaning test, everything came off very easily with a basic household cleaner. However, cleaning crumbs and other small scraps was a bit more difficult. Because it has raised edges, small detritus tends to get stuck in the corners.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Like other activity tables, it does not come with chairs. However, there are two leg-length options, fulfilling the \"grow-with-you\" moniker. We tested the 15-inch legs; 24 inches is the other option. When kids are old enough for the 24-inch legs, the table becomes tall enough to add on chairs. This table is so beautifully crafted and low to the ground that my husband attempted to overtake our testing and convert it into a coffee table.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best basic kids table\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c4e7535c46f0018c0bae3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Kidkraft farmhouse activity table for kids\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alicia Betz/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G3ZL8BM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_121018_best-kids-tables-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07G3ZL8BM&#38;linkId=a91a7a0fbee4881177dd01cdd7bc04ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Kidkraft Farmhouse Table and Four Chairs</a> was the easiest to clean out of everything we tested.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very easy to clean, comes with four chairs, durable and sturdy<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong>&#160;Cons: </strong>Messes can get stuck in screw holes <strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>A basic kids table and chair set should be a staple in every child's home.

It comes in four colors: espresso, white, natural, and pecan.&#160;</p><p>Easy cleaning is a parent's dream and this table passed our cleaning test with flying colors. Everything wiped clean using a regular household cleaner. The only downside when it comes to cleaning is that the chairs have quite a few uncovered screw holes. Cleaning can become a bit tricky when messes get into those indentations.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Like our other top picks, this set is very durable and looks new after months of use. It doesn't have any dents or chips. The table and chairs are also sturdy and have never wobbled or tipped over.&#160;</p><p>As a basic set, this table doesn't come with any bells and whistles. It's simply a flat surface for kids to eat, play, and create without distractions.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best picnic table for kids\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c4dcc35c46f0018c0badc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Little tikes easy store picnic table\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alicia Betz/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flittle-tikes-easy-store-jr-play-table-with-umbrella%2F-%2FA-53661913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Little Tikes Easy Store Jr. Picnic Table</a> is built to withstand outdoor conditions, and it even has a built-in multipurpose tray with cup holders.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very sturdy, multipurpose tray and cup holders, folds up for storage, can withstand harsh weather conditions<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Umbrella is flimsy, max seating capacity would be a tight squeeze <strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flittle-tikes-easy-store-jr-play-table-with-umbrella%2F-%2FA-53661913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Little Tikes Easy Store Jr. Picnic Table</a> was a clear winner between the two picnic tables we tested. It's sturdy, cleans easily, and can seat up to six kids, though four is more comfortable. It's available with or without an umbrella. We found the umbrella a bit flimsy, but it does the trick if you want some shade.&#160;</p><p>During our testing period, we left the table in a backyard surrounded by other large toys. When high winds sent a small slide playset and a playhouse flying, this table stayed put. It also never wobbled or tipped, even when we sat one adult on one side, within the 200-pound weight limit.</p><p>In our cleaning test, most messes came out easily. This table has some texture, which trapped the crayon and colored pencil marks. With a bit of scrubbing using regular household cleaner for the crayons and a Magic Eraser for the colored pencils, everything cleaned off.&#160;</p><p>After over one month of testing, the table does not have any dents, cracks, or other obvious signs of wear. As an outdoor table, it does get a bit dirty, but dirt, pollen, and other outside messes clean quickly with a hose.&#160;</p><p>The table can seat up to six kids with a maximum weight of 200 pounds per bench. Based on experience, I'd say it seats four comfortably; six kids would really need to squeeze to fit.&#160;</p><p>One of our favorite features is the indentation in the middle of the table.

The table shouldn't wobble when kids put their elbows on it, for example. To test stability, we observed daily and regular use and noted any instances of tipping or wobbling in both the chairs and the tables.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Ease of cleaning</strong>: It's a fact of life: Kids make messes.

Although ideal chair and tabletop heights vary by a child's age, ideal differences between chair seat height and table top height are consistent.

Unfortunately, the table wobbled in our tests. For a $250 set &#8212; the most expensive we tested &#8212; a structural issue like wobbling is a deal breaker.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JF4H61/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_121018_best-kids-tables-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B071JF4H61&#38;linkId=e2fb7d10396b1f954be68bea50ae4b32\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">B. Spaces by Battat &#8211; Kids' Furniture Set</a></strong>: This is a nice set that has a few minor flaws. Because the chairs curve up on the edges, we found that they tip and can fall over if kids sit on the very edge. Additionally, we couldn't get both chairs to fully fit under the table, and this one needed some extra scrubbing in our cleaning test.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://deltachildren.com/products/chelsea-table-and-chair-set-with-storage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Delta Children Chelsea Chair Set With Table</a>: </strong>I really, really wanted to love this set. It has storage under the table and it includes a reversible chalkboard/whiteboard. Unfortunately, it had a strong off-gassing smell that lasted over a month, and within a couple months of use, the chair legs became loose and almost fell off.&#160;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.melissaanddoug.com/wooden-table-and-chairs---natural/2427.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Melissa and Doug Wooden Table and Chairs</a></strong>: We really liked this set and didn't find any major flaws. There simply wasn't anything that made it stand out, and it's more expensive than some of the similar tables we tested.&#160;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://shop.humblecrew.com/products/tot-tutors-2-in-1-lego-compatible-activity-table\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Humble Crew Tot Tutors Forever 2-in-1 LEGO Compatible Activity Table</a></strong>: We were unable to spend much time testing this table.

Warburg emphasized this as well. \"Dangling feet cause children to round their backs and lead to back pain and sloppy handwriting,\" she said.</p><p>Warburg noted that having a good table and chair fit is critical when kids are expected to sit for long periods of time. Having proper positioning is helpful for eating, completing school work, completing artwork, and playing and kids might even sit for longer periods of time for meals or homework if they're seated comfortably.&#160;</p><p>\"Another benefit of a chil- size table and chair is that it gives the child a specific and special place for daily activities,\" Stoffel said. \"Knowing the table and chair are their own, the child might be more motivated or invested in the activity.\"</p><hr /><h3>How can I tell if a table is the right size for my child?&#160;</h3><p>According to Warburg, a good table allows a child to sit with their feet flat on the floor. Tabletop height&#160; should be 2 inches above the height of the elbow when the child is sitting. Hips, knees, and ankles should also be at 90-degree angles when the child is seated.</p><p>Stoffel added that kids should be able to gently rest their elbows on the table without reaching up or leaning down.&#160;She also gave us an example of what a child might look like if the chair and table are not a supportive size. \"You might observe the child squirming, shifting around in the seat, getting up from the table frequently or demonstrating decreased success with fine motor tasks,\" she said.</p>\n\tOur sources\n\t\n\t<aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ahs.uic.edu/occupational-therapy/directory/stoffel-ashley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ashley Stoffel</a>, OTD, OTR/L, FAOTA, is a clinical associate professor of occupational therapy at University of Illinois College of Applied Health Science.

These days, you can even tend (at least in part) to your smoker via WiFi from the comfort of your couch while your food fumigates and your pellet grill feeds itself and changes temperature and smokiness at your command.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, there are barrel smokers, otherwise known as stick burners, which are traditionally cut out of 55-gallon steel drums. These require meticulous oversight and tending, over which many professional careers have been spent.</p><p>In between, there are charcoal, electric (sans pellets), and propane smokers.

It's also the heaviest-duty grill we've found for less than a thousand dollars.</p><p>One of the most important things about a smoker, or any barbecue grill that you're going to operate for hours at a time, is heat retention. If you can't keep steady heat, you're really going to struggle to time and cook your food to perfection. We've tried multiple pellet grills (see more below), and while they've all done their job swimmingly, the Traeger is built with the thickest steel and maintains a temperature within about five degrees of your target. Try and do that with a manual charcoal or wood-burning grill and you'll have your work cut out for you (you'll also learn quickly why Pitmasters earn their distinction).</p><p>Frankly, apart from the quality of the steel, all pellet grills follow the same design, more or less. Traeger might be the original, but there are plenty of other brands that come close, and if you want to save some money, Raichlen suggests looking to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fb%2Fgreen-mountain-grills%2F-%2FN-a2mur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored\">Green Mountain Grills' models</a>.&#160;</p><p>We had some trouble connecting to WiFi using this grill.

It requires almost no input from you beyond adding wood chips and igniting a burner. There's also plenty of surface area spread out between four roughly 200-square-inch porcelain-coated stainless steel racks, which is comparable to the cooking surface area of a medium-sized barrel grill. And because it runs on propane, you can load it into the back of a truck for car- or off-grid camping, should you be so inclined.</p><p>The size of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GFLYWVK?tag=biipgf_032219_best-bbq-smokers-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Cuisinart's 36-inch Propane Smoker</a> is also convenient for small spaces or those who prefer to store it in the garage.

Still, we do wish it had casters because it's a bit heavy for many people.</p><p>Even with an electric grill, this is as easy as smoking gets, and about as compact as well.

We looked at fittings, the quality of the seal between the lid and the grill, and the thickness of the steel.</p><p>We then spoke with several experts including chef Shola Olunloyo of <a href=\"https://www.studiokitchen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Studio Kitchen</a> and veteran author and Barbecue University TV host <a href=\"https://www.stevenraichlen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steven Raichlen</a> to find out what makes a good smoker.&#160;</p><h3>Here's what we looked for in our top picks:</h3><p><strong>Smoking method: </strong>While smoking over hardwood is probably the most fun experience, we all agreed, not everyone wants to spend the better part of a day hunched over a fire. And while pellet grills might not offer the same flavor charcoal and wood-burning grills do, they come mighty close and are almost entirely hands-off.</p><p><strong>Ease of use: </strong>Inextricably linked to the smoking method is the ease of use. The learning curve on wood-burning grills is stratospheric. Pellet grills offer a great balance between smokiness and user-friendliness, but some don't hold a steady temperature all that well, which presents another set of problems.</p><p><strong>Material quality: </strong>Most smokers have to live outside, and while a cover is a worthy investment, a grill is still going to have to withstand the elements. Flimsier metals and cheap wheels were immediately disqualified. Thicker steel and industrial-grade casters were positive points, especially on competitively priced smokers.</p><p><strong>Performance: </strong>Because heat retention and maintenance of a consistent temperature is so paramount to smoking, we chose grills that excelled in those areas with little oversight. In the case of charcoal or wood-burning, you are entirely on your own.</p><p><strong>Warranty: </strong>We considered warranty to a degree, and looked for at least two years, but in the case of some picks we made concessions. In the end, the grill is only so good as the quality of the materials and build, and it's hard to call in a warranty on something like a grill or smoker because \"normal wear and tear\" involves starting fires and spilling grease. Plus, it's going to live outdoors. We find that investing in a grill that's built to last is ultimately the better consideration.</p>\n\tWhat else we tested\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608847440da8f40018033bf5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best charcoal grill 2021 what we’re testing next\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010759GGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_032219_best-bbq-smokers-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B010759GGQ&#38;linkId=2d878a560fe21c008c41b51cb34df510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Dyna-Glo Wide Body Vertical Offset Charcoal Smoker</strong></a>: The Dyna-Glo is a fine grill in design, but we're not convinced that it will last more than a few seasons based on looking at the materials used.

This is because each of these smokers maintains temperature automatically, so as long as you have your fuel (wood chips, propane, or pellets, respectively), you don't have to do much of anything at all.</p><p>When it comes to charcoal and wood- or stick-burning smokers, you have your work cut out for you, and have to maintain the right amount of fuel to keep the temperature as close to your target as possible.</p><hr /><h3>What can I put on a smoker?</h3><p>You can put just about anything you'd eat on a smoker. Meat is what most of us associate with smokers, but vegetables, fruits, and all types of seafood can be extraordinary on the grill. Figuring out the endless options and recipes is part of the fun of taking up smoking as a hobby.</p><hr /><h3>How do I make a brine?</h3><p>When you want to smoke food, oftentimes a recipe will call for a marinade or brine. You can do this any number of ways, and arguments will abound until the end of time over how to make the perfect brine, but here's a basic recipe for preparing and smoking with a brine, start to finish:</p><p>Note: You'll want to start this process between about four and 24 hours ahead of starting your smoker.</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">Add a 1:1 ratio of salt and sugar into a gallon of water in a stock pot.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Heat up to a boil, or until the salt and pepper dissolve.&#160;</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Add any herbs or other seasonings.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Let it cool for at least an hour or two, then place it in the fridge.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Once cool, add food and let marinate for anywhere from a couple of hours (vegetables, lighter meats and seafoods) to 12 or even 24 hours (beef, pork).</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Remove food from the brine, pat dry, and light the grill.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Add any dry rub or glaze you want to put on.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Wipe or spray grill with a little cooking oil. You can use olive oil or any oil of your choice, and because you're cooking at low heat, you don't have to worry about smoke or burning points.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Apply food, checking regularly to make sure fuel and temperature remain consistent.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Remove when ready (a thermometer helps).</li></ul>\n\tCheck out our other grilling guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

Most SPAC vehicles only give the managers two years to locate and execute a deal, or else they are required to return investors money.

The March figure marked a swing from February&#39;s income decline of 7%. </p><p>The monthly income leap was the biggest on record in data that goes back to 1946. </p><p>&#34;Incomes soared as a result of the stimulus payments made under the March relief bill,&#34; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a Friday note, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-biden-signs-trillion-covid-relief-package-checks-direct-payments-2021-3\">$1.9 trillion stimulus package</a> that President Joe Biden signed into law, which unleashed $1,400 checks to most Americans. </p><p>Income readings &#34;will correct in both April and May, but income from employment will rise much more strongly over the next few months and, in any event, most of the payments have not yet been spent,&#34; wrote Shepherdson. </p><p>The Commerce Department&#39;s report also showed that spending, or personal consumption, leapt by 4.2% last month. &#34;The jump in March spending ... was clearly signaled by the retail sales numbers,&#34; Shepherdson said. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-retail-sales-march-stimulus-reopening-vaccination-economic-recovery-spending-2021-4\">Retail sales pushed higher by 9.8% in March</a> to a record $619.1 billion, the Census Bureau said earlier this month.  </p><p>Jason Furman, a Harvard economics professor and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to former President Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1388111321229561861\">wrote on Twitter</a> about the unique nature of the report. He noted that the real disposable personal income shooting up 23% was a one-time bump attributable to stimulus checks, and that it normally takes about two years for real personal consumption expenditures to shoot up by 3.6%.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/04/30/new-data-releases-show-the-importance-of-government-support-during-the-pandemic/\">White House commented</a> that the report shows the importance of government support during the pandemic. It said the largest contribution to income during the pandemic came from government benefits, which were up over $300 billion over the month (almost $4 trillion at an annualized rate). Americans&#39; saving rate of 28% was the second-highest on record, it noted, and much higher than the average pre-crisis saving rate of 7.5%. </p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote of the report <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1388165020656279553\">on Twitter</a> that &#34;We are BEGINNING to create an economy that works for all. But more must be done,&#34; and called for an increase of the minimum wage, universal healthcare, lower prescription drug costs, student-debt forgiveness, and higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-income-march-spending-stimulus-economy-covid-checks-americans-biden-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/LJtZYwiprTw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 19:33:26 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60494bf69942cf001865db71?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"06d539ac00fdad5191858a9e9d54fb45","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn54@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-20-972_15b907d9e5f92447.webp","destWidth":1885,"destHeight":1414,"sourceBytes":142558,"destBytes":142558,"author":"insider@insider.com (Carla Mozée)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/604a436bf196be0018beedb1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn47@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-22-525_11927d7efe5826f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn89@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-25-778_a0fc3deeebfa2e24.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn18@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-743_2efcdc6bb3713014.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=LJtZYwiprTw:Jh1hjtzdCkE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn67@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-25-774_fd3fb9229ddda6fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/LJtZYwiprTw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn62@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-23-217_ca0f4165d74a8663.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324316},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"Watch SpaceX's Crew-1 astronauts plummet to an ocean landing early Sunday, ending the longest human spaceflight in NASA history","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-spacex-nasa-crew2-astronaut-mission-splashdown-landing-ocean-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac5bbb98669500182b5820?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spacex nasa crew 1 mission 4x3\" height=\"1437\" width=\"1917\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Flying aboard SpaceX&#39;s Crew-1 mission for NASA are astronauts (from left) Mike Hopkins, Soichi Noguchi, Shannon Walker, and Victor Glover.\n<p class=\"copyright\">SpaceX;

Six-month spaceflights have been routine for NASA astronauts launching on Russian Soyuz spaceships, but until now, the US had never flown such long-term missions on its own.</p><p>Crew-1 is also SpaceX&#39;s first routine astronaut flight for NASA.

So on Saturday evening, the Crew-1 team is expected to climb back aboard the Crew Dragon Resilience for the journey home.</p><p>SpaceX has flown humans back to Earth from the ISS once before - on a crewed test flight called Demo-2. In May, that mission rocketed NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit. They stayed on the ISS for two months before splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>But during Behnken and Hurley&#39;s return to Earth, a crowd of onlooker boats <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-flag-boat-disrupts-live-nasa-astronaut-spacex-landing-2020-8\">got dangerously close</a> to the spaceship after it splashed down. To prevent that from happening again, SpaceX, NASA, and the Coast Guard plan to secure a 10-mile no-boat perimeter around the Crew-1 splashdown site.</p><p>The Crew-1 return trip was originally scheduled for Wednesday, then for Saturday morning, but NASA has <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-updates-live-coverage-of-agency-s-spacex-crew-1-return-to-earth\">delayed</a> it twice after forecasts predicted high winds in the splashdown zones.</p><h2>Watch live as Crew-1 returns to Earth</h2><p>NASA plans to broadcast the nearly nine-hour journey - including the fiery plunge to Earth and the splashdown at the end - via the livestream below, starting at 6 p.m. ET on Saturday.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/21X5lGlDOfg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>The entire descent and landing process is automated, but Hurley advised the Crew-1 astronauts to make sure they&#39;re &#34;staying ahead of the capsule,&#34; according to Hopkins, the mission commander.</p><p>&#34;Preparing for that landing is just going over our procedures and making sure, when we get into that sequence of events, that we&#39;re ready to go, and we&#39;re following right along with all of the automation as it takes us to, hopefully, a safe landing,&#34; Hopkins told reporters in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0doXND6lhQ\">a call from the ISS</a> on Monday.</p><p>Walker, Glover, Hopkins, and Noguchi are expected to board the Resilience capsule and close its hatch behind them at 6:20 p.m. ET on Saturday. After about two hours of checkouts, the hooks keeping Resilience attached to the space station should retract at 8:35 p.m. ET, undocking the spaceship from the ISS. The vehicle would then fire its thrusters to back away.</p><p>If all goes well, Resilience is expected to spend the night orbiting Earth and maneuvering into position. Then the capsule is designed to jettison its trunk - a lower section outfitted with fuel tanks, solar panels, and other hardware - which the astronauts would no longer need.</p><p>From there, the Crew-2 astronauts could be in for a bumpy ride.</p><p>&#34;The landing was - I would say it was more than what Doug and I expected,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-astronaut-describes-fiery-plunge-in-spacex-crew-dragon-2020-8\">Behnken told reporters</a> after he returned to Earth aboard the spaceship. &#34;I personally was surprised at just how quickly events all transpired.&#34;</p><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f29edf3f0f4196a6029e398?format=jpeg\" alt=\"crew dragon return reentry demo2 doug hurley bob behnken\" height=\"1345\" width=\"1794\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, aboard the Crew Dragon Endeavour spacecraft on August 2, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?id=tag%3Areuters.com%2C2020%3Anewsml_RC2T5I9KPSUY&#38;share=true\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/Handout via Reuters</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><p>&#34;It felt like we were inside of an animal,&#34; he added.</p><p>Behnken also said that pivotal moments of the landing process - such as when the capsule separated from its trunk and when the parachutes deployed - felt &#34;very much like getting hit in the back of the chair with a baseball bat.&#34;</p><h2>What to expect as the astronauts plummet to Earth</h2><p>As the Resilience spacecraft approaches Earth, it is expected to fire its thrusters continuously, pushing itself further into the atmosphere.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/541c987b69beddee191753ff?format=jpeg\" alt=\"dragon v2 reentry\" height=\"496\" width=\"902\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An animation of Crew Dragon plowing through the atmosphere.\n<p class=\"copyright\">SpaceX</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Soon, the spaceship should be plummeting through the atmosphere, superheating the material around it to a blistering 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. At that point in his flight, Behnken said, he could feel the capsule heating up, and the force of Earth&#39;s gravity pulling on him for the first time in two months. It felt like being in a centrifuge, he added.</p><p>The Crew Dragon&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-nasa-crew-dragon-heat-shield-erosion-2020-9\">heat shield</a> - a collection of heat-resistant tiles that line the spaceship&#39;s underbelly - must deflect that superheated material to protect the astronauts inside. After the Demo-2 landing, NASA and SpaceX found that one of those tiles had worn away more than expected. So SpaceX reinforced the heat shield with stronger materials.</p><p>Once it&#39;s about 18,000 feet above the ocean, Resilience should deploy four parachutes - which brings a &#34;pretty significant jolt,&#34; Behnken said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607f3c4544f4540019207d34?format=jpeg\" alt=\"demo-2 splashdown parachutes crew dragon spacex\" height=\"1440\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Crew Dragon Endeavour lands in the Gulf of Mexico, returning astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to Earth on August 2, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-NHQ202008020016\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Ingalls/NASA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>From there, Resilience should glide to a gentle splashdown in the ocean at 2:57 a.m. ET on Sunday.

This oyster I&#39;m about to eat could still be alive! So, why do we do this?&#34;</p><p>Most people think it&#39;s a food safety issue. Keep the oyster alive as long as possible, to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. And there is a little bit of truth to that. Oysters can carry a scary flesh-eating bacteria called vibrio vulnificus. You can get it from oysters or from swimming in warm brackish water. But let&#39;s put that into perspective. </p><p><strong>Julie Qiu:</strong> &#34;The risk of running into a bad oyster is lower than people think it is. My biggest pet peeve is that people go crazy over one bad oyster but they don&#39;t really care that hundreds of thousands of pounds of lettuce are contaminated with salmonella&#34;</p><p>About <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/index.html\">100 people die from vibrio infections</a> (including from vibrio vulnificus) each year, about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html\">450 die from salmonella. </a>Plus, the FDA requires that oyster farms have to test water quality before sending oysters out to markets and restaurants. And that&#39;s important, because oysters are filter feeders. They soak up basically anything that&#39;s in the water around them - including fecal matter which can come from rain runoff.</p><p>But there&#39;s a clever way to check if your oysters are good.</p><p><strong>Julie Qiu:</strong> &#34;one thing that you can ask for is a shellfish tag, which every retailer or restaurant is required to have for every bag of oysters that they purchase for up to 90 days after they make that purchase. So that tag, if they don&#39;t have it, don&#39;t eat those oysters.&#34;</p><p>This tag is a way for restaurants to track where and when their oysters were farmed. Qiu says that she looks<a href=\"https://www.santamonicaseafood.com/understanding-shellfish-tags\"> for the most recent dates</a> on the tag. Anything further out than two weeks won&#39;t taste as good and increases the risk of a bad oyster.</p><p>Some chefs may look at you funny for asking for the documentation, but it&#39;s a strategy that apparently works.</p><p><strong>Julie Qiu: </strong>&#34;I&#39;ve had thousands of oysters and never had a bad one&#34;</p><p>Ok great, so basically, oysters are safe, why on earth are they sometimes <em>alive </em>when we eat them??</p><p><strong>Julie Qiu: </strong>&#34;You really want your raw shellfish to be really fresh and the freshest you can get is something that is recently killed, so it goes back to not only the food safety but the actual taste and texture is going to be far superior when it&#39;s a fresh oyster.&#34; </p><p>So yeah, freshly killed oysters taste better. And it&#39;s hard to tell exactly when an oyster dies, because before it&#39;s served, it&#39;s shucked. It&#39;s not a gentle process. Shucking involves separating the oyster&#39;s abductor muscle from the shell. This muscle gives the oyster control over opening and closing its shell. Similar to how your spinal cord helps you move. So, severing the <em>their </em>abductor muscle is almost like severing <em>your</em> spine. Yikes.</p><p>Most restaurants in the US keep their oysters alive - on ice - up until this shucking process, which afterwards, either leaves the oyster dead, or immobile. Since they don&#39;t move around much in the first place, it&#39;s not easy to tell which.</p><p>So you&#39;re eating an oyster that was either just killed or is dying. And that seems pretty cruel, right? But considering that the oyster&#39;s biology is very primitive, it&#39;s possible they might not even feel pain at all.</p><p><strong>Julie Qiu: </strong>&#34;They don&#39;t have a brain, they&#39;re not really processing pain the same way the same way we are feeling so I don&#39;t think they&#39;re feeling pain the same way we are thinking of it.&#34;</p><p>So really, it&#39;s up to you. If you don&#39;t want to eat oysters, that&#39;s fine. If you do, you&#39;ll be far from the first.</p><p><strong>Julie Qiu: </strong>&#34;It&#39;s one of the few foods that have not changed for thousands and thousands of years so being able to appreciate that is something that&#39;s really special and remarkable and something that should be celebrated for what it is.&#34; </p><p><em>For more information about oysters from Qiu, check out her blog <a href=\"https://www.inahalfshell.com/\">In A Half Shell</a> or follow her on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/inahalfshellblog/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>.</em></p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in September 2018.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/oysters-still-alive-eaten-raw-vibrio-vulnificus-2018-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/G2iRB4kDHhU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 20:30:26 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5baa48bdea400291578b4567?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"fe1550ef3acbb0fee6f41cac18157ba0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn25@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-21-021_930fc62d199545cd.webp","destWidth":838,"destHeight":629,"sourceBytes":55794,"destBytes":55794,"author":"danderson@businessinsider.com (David Anderson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn6@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-26-105_51847549fc9836b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn65@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-343_aa259991fddfe365.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=G2iRB4kDHhU:826WImChiCY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn94@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-24-891_b8f293b4a9c88075.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/G2iRB4kDHhU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-24-244_33e0f7cd4563d5ae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324330},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"How a 26-year-old Harvard graduate and nonprofit cofounder spends his day","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/day-in-the-life-of-nonprofit-founder-activist-saad-amer-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608aecbf34af8d0018599f3d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Saad Amer Day in Life\" height=\"2634\" width=\"3513\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Saad Amer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Saad Amer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Saad Amer, 26, is the cofounder of the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.plus1campaign.org/\">Plus1Vote</a>. </li>\n<li>The nonprofit seeks to help people vote in elections. </li>\n<li>He is also a fellow at Yale and works with the United Nations. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>No two days are the same for Saad Amer, the 26-year-old cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.plus1campaign.org/\">Plus1Vote</a>. Some days he&#39;s creating Instagram filters to educate people on the climate crisis; the next, he&#39;s helping send a million text messages to get young people to vote. Launched in 2018, his nonprofit seeks to improve voter turnout in national elections using social media to create campaigns and engage with young people.</p><p>The organization often partners with leaders like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6tPLKkdgcg\">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> and former Vice President Al Gore to host seminars educating people on climate change and voting rights. During the 2018 midterm elections, Plus1Vote launched a campaign that was supported and shared on social media by Alyssa Milano and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/1059541633845223424\">Jimmy Kimmel</a>. Plus1Vote also teamed up with the Women&#39;s March to help amplify the voices of people of color. </p><p>&#34;Our core mission is to improve the representation of young people and people of color in our democracy, especially on issues such as climate change and social justice,&#34; Amer told Insider. &#34;I recognized there was a gap in terms of the connection between these major issues and young people. I saw a need to energize young people, especially young people of color, to come into the voting space.&#34; </p><p>Plus1Vote partnered with V magazine during the 2020 election for the <a href=\"https://vmagazine.com/v-is-for-vote/\">V is for Vote issue</a>, which featured Mariah Carey and Taylor Swift. For January&#39;s runoff elections in Georgia, Plus1Vote teamed up with Uber to provide free rides to the polls and sent more than 1 million text messages to potential voters. </p><p>And that&#39;s just Amer&#39;s day job. He also works on the UN&#39;s Framework Convention on Climate Change&#39;s Youth Constituency, is an advisor to the National Parks Conservation Association, and is an expert reviewer for an intergovernmental panel on climate change report. </p><p>A graduate of Harvard, he cocreated the university&#39;s inaugural <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/people/saad-amer\">Sustainability Plan</a> and is a fellow at Yale University&#39;s Public Voices Fellowship on the Climate Crisis. For Insider, Amer revealed how he spends a typical day, which includes multiple chai latte breaks and speaking at virtual seminars on the climate crisis. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c400d35c46f0018c0ba7d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Saad Amer Day in Life\" height=\"2643\" width=\"3525\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Saad Amer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Saad Amer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>He wakes up at 8 a.m.</strong></h2><p>After waking up, Amer brushes his teeth, drinks a glass of water, and gets dressed. Early-morning tea time is at 8:30, which is a &#34;personal ceremony&#34; to him, allowing Amer to reflect on the day ahead and the day before. </p><p>&#34;Now that the weather is warmer, I&#39;ll have my first cup of tea outside in the morning,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m not big on breakfast, but I&#39;ll usually have some kind of biscuit with my tea.&#34; Right now that means an Earl Grey in an &#34;overly fancy teapot&#34; with Dutch stroopwafel.</p><p>Amer has worked as an activist since the age of 13, when he began to do environmental work in his Long Island, New York, community, where he still lives today. In high school, he worked with the school&#39;s environmental organizations to help preserve land and went on to attend Harvard University, where he researched the impact of climate change on the Indian Himalayas with the United States Agency for International Development and helped discover a new <a href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/systematic-botany/volume-43/issue-2/036364418X697166/M[…]ae-a-New-Hybrid-Fern-from-French/10.1600/036364418X697166.short\">plant species</a> in French Polynesia. </p><p>He became heavily involved with voting after realizing many young people were not incentivized to vote, despite the way many issues like the climate emergency and social justice would be affecting them. &#34;It&#39;s all about young activists. It&#39;s about having our voice presenting and being able to elect policymakers,&#34; he said. &#34;That makes a grassroots effort more powerful.&#34; </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c3ff435c46f0018c0ba7c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Saad Amer Day in Life\" height=\"2643\" width=\"3525\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Amer&#39;s tea set.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Saad Amer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>His first call with his team is at 9 a.m. </strong></h2><p>Amer takes his first morning call with the Plus1Vote team in which he discusses plans on how to organize and mobilize voters for upcoming elections. The team is focused on the &#34;<a href=\"https://www.commoncause.org/our-work/constitution-courts-and-democracy-issues/for-the-people-act/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsqmEBhDiARIsANV8H3Yz-fOVYfaG0TDbfgzt1zsh0Xmx1ZA0J4mF-AJC9HWLT9ihfCDlWS8aAtwdEALw_wcBhttps://www.plus1campaign.org/forthepeople\">For the People</a>&#34; Act, or HR 1, which would expand voting rights. </p><p>Plus1Vote is planning social-media campaigns around the act and encouraging young people to write letters to their lawmakers to help push the bill through. &#34;Our democracy is at a crossroads,&#34; he said. &#34;The coup at the Capitol and the 360 voter-suppression bills across this country show how desperately we need to protect the right to vote.&#34; </p><p>In 2018, Plus1Vote made a video that highlighted the women of color who were running for public office across the country, including Ayanna Presley, who tweeted the video. &#34;Then, of course, she made history as the first Black woman elected to Congress from the state of Massachusetts,&#34; he said. </p><p>The organization depends heavily on the tools social media provides, such as Instagram filters, which help them further involve people in the spreading of social messages online. The celebrity endorsements, for the most part, are organic, he said. Much of Amer&#39;s time is spent conducting research and planning for events. &#34;Now that it&#39;s warmer I&#39;ll often work outside,&#34; Amer said.</p><h2><strong>Lunch is at noon</strong></h2><p>Today for lunch Amer is eating leftover Thai food, with some mango juice. &#34;There has been a rise in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/we-are-not-monolith-danger-of-single-asian-american-story-2021-3\">hate crimes against the AAPI community</a> and Asian-owned businesses have been struggling through the pandemic,&#34; he said. </p><p>Amer recalls the day the insurrection at the Capitol happened. He was drinking a chai latte and couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing on TV. But, if anything, it made him realize he has to work harder to get young people to vote and help elect lawmakers that better reflect their values. </p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the job of people of color to educate everybody on every single issue,&#34; he said. &#34;What we need is to see people brought to justice and for them to start educating themselves on the reality that we&#39;re in.&#34;  </p><h2><strong>Next, a speech for Earth Day </strong></h2><p>Last week the team was preparing for Earth Day. Amer said he made sure to read the announcements from the White House and Congress regarding the climate crisis in order to organize campaigns around it. </p><p>He also had to pay close attention to these statements because he is a member of the Youth Constituency to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. &#34;Staying plugged-in on the international developments of this week are crucial,&#34; he said. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608aec6735c46f0018c0b47e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Saad Amer Day in Life\" height=\"2852\" width=\"2036\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Amer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Saad Amer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Amer has spoken at the UN &#34;like a bazillion times,&#34; he said, mostly &#34;yelling at various ministers and ambassadors about the need to really treat climate change as a major priority.&#34; Last year the organization was going to plan an Earth Day and climate strike, but it was canceled due to the pandemic. </p><p>They had to digitize the entire campaign, creating a three-day livestream in which Amer interviewed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6tPLKkdgcg\">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. He had a similar virtual event this year with the same goal: making sure people understand being a climate activist is also being a voting activist. </p><p>&#34;Young people understand that we&#39;re seeing our futures being robbed from us,&#34; he said</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s a lot of gate-keeping in activism,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#39;s important to invite everybody into activism, especially into the voting space of our democracy, where everyone is supposed to be represented.&#34; </p><p>After lunch and a marathon Zoom call,  he takes a chai break around 3 p.m. &#34;I have multiple cups of chai per day and usually have one by my side while working and while on Zoom calls,&#34; he said. </p><h2><strong>Hosting rehearsal</strong></h2><p>At 5 p.m. he rushes to rehearsal for an event he&#39;s hosting on climate justice called Action for the Earth Symposium, which was later streamed on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NowthisEarth/posts/5585275784846889\">NowThis</a>. &#34;The event centers intersectional environmentalism and youth voices taking action on the climate crisis,&#34; he said. It also features the climate activist and writer Bill McKibben and Michigan Rep. Andy Levin.</p><p>A week earlier, he gave a guest lecture at the Harvard Graduate School for Education about youth civic engagement and spoke on a panel at Ohio State University on environmental justice.  And earlier this year, he hosted an event in which he spoke to the actor Mark Ruffalo, famed for his portrayal of Bruce Banner and the Hulk.</p><p>&#34;I was like, you&#39;re a climate activist - the Hulk is green because you are a climate activist, right?&#39;&#34; Amer joked and said Ruffalo confirmed, &#34;the Hulk is green because of climate change. &#34;</p><p>Aside from providing free Uber rides in Georgia, Plus1Vote also provided free rides to the polls during the presidential election in Florida, South Carolina, and Mississippi. &#34;It&#39;s really essential to use these different tools and platforms to give younger people access to the ballot,&#34; he said, adding the pandemic has only highlighted the issue more. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c405834af8d001859a4f1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Saad Amer\" height=\"2680\" width=\"3573\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Amer, center, at a climate-crisis march from September 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Saad Amer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Then he goes for an evening run </strong></h2><p>Around 6 p.m., after the bulk of his work is done and before the sun sets, he makes sure to catch some fresh air by going for a jog. </p><p>&#34;My favorite part about the spring is all the flower trees blooming,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ll stop and smell the flowers every chance I get. I&#39;ll visit a few PokéStops,&#34; a reference to the mobile game &#34;Pokémon Go,&#34; &#34;and head home for dinner.&#34;</p><p>Dinner is typically at 7 p.m. and recently, he&#39;s been cooking aloo mutter, a potato and pea dish topped with fresh cilantro and served with methi paratha - a flatbread made with spices and fenugreek leaves. &#34;One of the best parts of South Asian cooking is the array of vegan options,&#34; he said. Amer is of South Asian descent. &#34;About a quarter of India is vegetarian, so there are plenty of options.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c409735c46f0018c0ba85?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Saad Amer Day in Life\" height=\"2643\" width=\"3525\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Saad Amer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Saad Amer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Before bed, he writes </strong></h2><p>After dinner, he takes some time for writing as part of his Yale fellowship with The OpEd Project. &#34;I&#39;ve been working on a series of pieces on the climate crisis focused on environmental justice, civic engagement, and climate solutions,&#34; he said.</p><p>Afterward, he listens to music and audiobooks before retiring for the evening.

On Wednesday, the Microsoft-owned job platform published a list ranking &#34;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-companies-2021-50-best-workplaces-grow-your-career-us-/?published=t\">the 50 best workplaces to grow your career in the U.S.</a>&#34; in 2021.</p><p>According to LinkedIn&#39;s criteria, Amazon earned the top spot, which the company touted in its <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf\">earnings release</a> along with high marks on lists by Fortune and Boston Consulting Group.</p><p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on this story.</p><p>LinkedIn did a massive overhaul of its criteria for this year&#39;s list - which it explained in depth in an accompanying <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-built-all-new-linkedin-top-companies-laura-lorenzetti/?trackingId=p1Mg7cA%2FRF%2BKKHSK0pIZiw%3D%3D\">blog post</a> - eventually landing on what it said were seven &#34;pillars&#34; that researchers have shown lead to career progression: &#34;ability to advance; skills growth; company stability; external opportunity; company affinity; gender diversity and educational background.&#34;</p><p>While any list claiming to rank the &#34;top&#34; anything is ultimately based on subjectively chosen criteria, several seemingly important factors didn&#39;t make the cut, including salary data or any demographic data beyond gender.</p><p>LinkedIn confirmed salaries were not factored into the rankings but wouldn&#39;t comment further about salaries on the record.</p><p>&#34;In terms of the diversity pillars, we measure gender diversity, specifically, which looks at gender parity within a company, as well as educational background, analyzing the spread of educational attainment among employees. We are working on additional diversity criteria and hope to continue expanding this pillar in future years,&#34; LinkedIn spokesperson Maggie Boezi told Insider in an email.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employee-salary-pay-median-worker-compensation-compared-jeff-bezos-2021-4\">Amazon paid its median employee $29,007</a> last year, and the company said this week that it would <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-raise-pay-3-an-hour-for-500000-workers-2021-4\">raise pay by up to $3 per hour</a> for 500,000 employees. But despite lucrative salaries and benefits for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cloud-salaries-revealed-what-amazon-microsoft-google-and-more-pay-2020-9#cloud-architects-at-amazon-web-services-can-make-around-150000-3\">corporate employees</a>, research has shown for years that Amazon setting up new warehouses often <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/01/20/what-amazon-does-to-wages\">drives down wages in the area</a>.</p><p>Those salary disparities take on added significance when factoring in the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/our-workforce-data\">racial disparities between Amazon&#39;s warehouse and corporate employees</a>. In 2020, 32.1% of all Amazon employees were white, while 13.6% were Asian, 26.5% were Black, 22.8% were Latinx, 3.6% were multiracial, and 1.5% were Native American.</p><p>But the path upward is narrow for employees of color at Amazon.</p><p>Among corporate employees, 47% are white, while 34.8% were Asian, 7.2% were Black, 7.5% were Latinx, 3% were multiracial, and 0.5% were Native American. Among senior leadership, 70.7% were white, 20% were Asian, 3.8% were Black, 3.9% were Latinx, 1.4% were multiracial, and 0.2% were Native American.</p><p>LinkedIn&#39;s decision to rank Amazon as the best place to grow your career without accounting for racial diversity data may be especially surprising to some members of Amazon&#39;s diversity and inclusion teams, who told Recode that internal Amazon data showed that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/2/26/22297554/amazon-race-black-diversity-inclusion\">Black employees are promoted at a lower rate</a> and given worse performance reviews than white coworkers.</p><p>Insider&#39;s Allana Akhtar also reported that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-black-and-latino-senior-management-walmart-than-amazon-2021-4\">Amazon lags far behind competitors like Walmart</a> - ranked ninth on LinkedIn&#39;s list - when it comes to Black and Latino representation in upper management.</p><p>As for Amazon&#39;s warehouse workers, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/amazon-amzn-job-pay-rate-leaves-some-warehouse-employees-homeless\">Bloomberg</a> reported in December that Amazon is &#34;transforming the logistics industry from a career destination with the promise of middle-class wages into entry-level work that&#39;s just a notch above being a burger flipper or convenience store cashier,&#34; citing government data that showed more than 4,000 Amazon employees are on food stamps in just nine states.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/publication/amazons-disposable-workers-high-injury-turnover-rates-fulfillment-centers-california\">Turnover rates at Amazon warehouses are estimated to be as high as 100%</a>, according to the National Employment Law Project.</p><p>One possible explanation for why LinkedIn&#39;s list still ranked Amazon first despite the above data may be that its list appeared to focus on white-collar workers.</p><p>In her blog post explaining the methodology, LinkedIn senior managing editor Laura Lorenzetti, said that the list &#34;since its inception showed professionals where people like them were most eager to work.&#34;</p><p>Boezi, the LinkedIn spokesperson, told Insider that the list included all full-time and part-time employees regardless of job title - except freelancers and interns - and that LinkedIn &#34;regressed our findings against outside sources such as the World Bank and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and evaluated various scoring mechanisms for every pillar we selected.&#34;</p><p>While LinkedIn&#39;s list may not single-handedly change jobseekers&#39; minds, Amazon&#39;s case reveals how the underlying data that goes into such rankings is far from unbiased.<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/11/21/linkedin-for-the-working-class-how-jobcase-is-building-a-1-billion-social-network-for-blue-collar-employees/?sh=322db4c72105\"></a></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-top-companies-career-growth-2021-list-omits-pay-race-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/2aBPy2BVF3M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 01 May 2021 04:03:48 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608cb06634af8d001859a685?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"bbc01fc72b9cd370f91250eb97acddba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn58@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-21-086_eb358a743bc59e27.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":90982,"destBytes":90982,"author":"tsonnemaker@insider.com (Tyler Sonnemaker)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f5b9ebfe6ff30001d4e8538?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-073_573d324faa22f59e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-22-655_0f7b8e03f46fea18.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn28@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-22-822_17fd70c046cf1cc5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn15@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-23-338_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2aBPy2BVF3M:G1F_SvqNX0U:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-26-461_e80cc95fe937a8d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/2aBPy2BVF3M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn9@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-25-496_a139a7c684aafc88.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851324300},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:42:04","title":"10 pieces of orange accent furniture for your home","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/orange-furniture-amazon","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c6ffdf22c6b00185db167?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Lexicon bed frame\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The color orange is bright and denotes playfulness and comfort. </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Orange furniture is the perfect way to add some colorful pops to your space and create a warm, inviting feel.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We rounded up 10 pieces of orange furniture you can find on Amazon, with a range of shades and price points included.</li>\n</ul><p>If you&#39;ve landed on this article, chances are you&#39;re already looking for orange furniture.

All sample quotes listed below are for a 45-year old driver for a two-week trip, booking two months in advance, picking up the vehicle at the point of rental, and starting from and returning to New Orleans. Different models will incur different fuel costs depending on their size, the terrain, and whether they are gas or diesel engines.</p><p><strong>Inclusions</strong>:&#160;All rentals listed in our guide come with generators, are covered by the company's own insurance policies, and offer some kind of loyalty rewards program.</p><p><strong>COVID-19 procedures: </strong>They all offer robust cleaning policies in response to COVID-19 so you can feel at ease.</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\tPopular types of RVs and motor homes\n\t\n\t<p>There are different classes of RVs and motor homes, each with pros and cons, so it is best to decide which one best suits your plans before booking.&#160;&#160;</p><h3>Class A motor homes</h3><p>Class A motor homes are the largest and can sleep up to 10 people on the bigger side (up to 45 feet or so in length). They are, essentially, houses on wheels, usually part of a truck or bus chassis.</p><p>They tend to have the most luxurious amenities, often with master bedrooms and full kitchens with fridges, microwaves, and electrical or gas stovetops, as well as living rooms, dining rooms, and large bathrooms. They're ideal for large families or those looking for an experience similar to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-glamping-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">glamping</a>, more akin to staying in a hotel.</p><p>They are also typically the most expensive to rent and less fuel-efficient, usually only managing eight to 10 miles to the gallon. Bigger models can also find problems fitting into some smaller campsites, which can limit overnight options on the road. The large size also means these vehicles are best-suited to seasoned, experienced RV users and drivers. First-timers should probably try smaller models first to gain a feel for traveling this way.</p><h3>Class B motor homes</h3><p>Class B motor homes are the smallest category and are usually a good fit for two people, though even then they can feel somewhat cramped. The larger ones will have comfortable sleeping quarters but small kitchens and work well for those traveling in minimal style or on shorter vacations.</p><p>This class of RV is generally much more affordable with better fuel economy, delivering up to 25 miles per gallon. They also slip neatly into almost every campground.</p><p>However, expect limited amenities and storage space, and often with a 'wet bath' set up, meaning that the toilet and shower share the same space.</p><h3>Class C motor homes</h3><p>Class C motor homes are somewhere in between these two first categories. They are usually built onto a truck chassis with an overhang that fits over the driving cab, which is usually, but not always, used for sleeping space.</p><p>They sleep anywhere from two up to eight people at the large end, and most have toilet and shower facilities on board.</p><p>They come with better pricing, fuel economy (they typically manage up to 13 miles per gallon), and the ability to enter most campgrounds compared to Class A motor homes, however, they are not as efficient as Class B motor homes when it comes to parking, size, and fuel efficiency. They are usually acceptable for a short vacation, but not generally suggested as vehicles for extended trips.</p>\n\tImportant information and tips for first-time RV renters\n\t\n\t<p>First-time RV drivers should take time to familiarize themselves with the vehicle. \"There's no special training or license needed to drive an RV,\" says Jeff Cavins of fellow peer-to-peer rental company <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.outdoorsy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Outdoorsy</a>, based in Austin. \"However, our owners will do a test drive with you before you leave on your trip to make sure you feel really comfortable with the vehicle, how it drives and how all the features work.\"</p><p>For the trip itself, forward planning is key, especially as states begin to reopen to varying degrees. \"Research where you want to go before you depart,\" says Cavins. \"Each day, we're monitoring the news of campgrounds reopenings taking place in each state and updating our list of state park systems and their status.\" Cavins recommends checking websites such as <a href=\"http://www.harvesthosts.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Harvest Hosts</a>&#160;and <a href=\"http://www.campendium.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Campendium</a> to book suitable rest locations.&#160;</p><p>Check first that you may park your specific vehicle at your intended campground, as well as the facilities they provide. Booking ahead is especially crucial with the increased demand.</p><p>Overnight campsite and RV parks come with hookup fees to provide electricity, water, bathrooms, and/or sewage disposal, and typically range from $30 to $50 per night or more for the best quality grounds.</p><p>It's also possible to find places to park (usually for limited amounts of time) without any facilities, either in remote areas or at designated spots. This is called 'dry camping' or 'boondocking' and is usually free of charge. You can find these locations on the website for the <a href=\"http://www.www.fs.usda.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">United States Forest Service</a> or <a href=\"https://www.campendium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Campendium</a>.</p><p>Additionally, don't hit the road without a full complement of groceries and other essentials on board as it may be tricky to stop at some of the smaller, rural communities that drivers will likely pass through, especially for larger vehicles.&#160;</p>\n\tMore

data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\">This article is part of an ongoing series on Insider&#39;s research on The Human Impact of Business Transformation. </a></li>\n</ul><p>Historically, business transformation has been a top-down endeavor largely focused on technology, process, and operations. As savvy leaders know, there&#39;s another essential component to successful reinvention: People. By empowering their employees to be catalysts for change, and inviting them to help reshape their organizations from the bottom up, today&#39;s business leaders are finding that culture and purpose are key. </p><p>As head of global employee, leader &#38; culture communications at Microsoft, Letty Cherry&#39;s primary goal is to keep employees informed, engaged, and proud of their association with the company. With Microsoft currently employing more than 160,000 people worldwide, this is a significant task. Cherry and her team have managed to increase engagement and invite outside perspective via activities like employee town halls, company hackathons, and &#34;Outside in,&#34; a cross-company learning event wherein business leaders on book tours stop by the company to talk business philosophy, creativity, mindfulness, and more.</p><p>Reaching this point required that Microsoft get a drum beat on its mission.&#34;The mission of the company is everywhere,&#34; Cherry says. &#34;It&#39;s printed on our employee badges. We talk about it a lot in terms of empowering every person and every organization on the planet. But the culture needs to ladder up to it.&#34; </p><p>Company culture needs to evolve over time as you see gaps or as circumstances change, Cherry explains. As such, a central team monitors Microsoft&#39;s cultural attributes, ensures employees are familiar with them, and makes sure leaders are exhibiting them. Microsoft prioritizes diversity and inclusion, and works to teach its people how they can be &#34;good allies to each other,&#34; Cherry says. Providing employees with channels for different topics of conversation is critical, too, even if they don&#39;t always agree with each other.</p><p>Abiding by the company&#39;s values, which include respect, integrity, and accountability, helps employees in a number of ways; it creates a sense of security so they can be free to maximize their potential, but it also &#34;clears away the clutter&#34; so they can innovate. But Cherry notes that in order for companies to effectively convey these rules, their managers must learn to embrace them.&#34;</p><h3>Making culture and purpose real</h3><p>You can roll out whatever you want on culture. If the manager of your individual team isn&#39;t living by that culture, it causes problems,&#34; she says. Her advice to business leaders unsure of how to activate their workforce? &#34;Check your bias at the door.&#34; Empathy, vulnerability, and promoting two-way dialogue are all critical to removing barriers so you can develop both your talent and your brand. </p><p>At Accenture, Amy Fuller, chief marketing and communications officer, takes a similar approach. She manages everything from how the company markets to how it communicates to its talent brand, but the latter is increasingly important. As Fuller puts it, &#34;For anything to work at a professional services company, it really needs to work with the people because they are the brand.&#34; </p><p>There&#39;s a lot of focus on the concept of purpose at Accenture, which Fuller calls &#34;the topic of the moment.&#34; For purpose to endure, she says, it has to embody the value of your business: who you are, and what you do. </p><p>&#34;In the past couple of years, purpose has almost become a marketing cliché,&#34; Fuller says, adding that &#34;The value of a cliché is that everyone hears about it.&#34; Still, when the company surveyed its workforce of 500,000 global employees to find out how they defined Accenture&#39;s purpose, not everyone was on the same page.  Some employees were unable to communicate it, while others defaulted to citing the company&#39;s advertising tagline. &#34;It was an open door for us to articulate something that was important,&#34; Fuller says.</p><h3>&#34;Technology plus people&#34;</h3><p>Naturally, being purposeful as a business requires the help of your employees. &#34;What we hear from our clients is that it&#39;s all about people and technology. Not just one of those components - it&#39;s actually both,&#34; Fuller says. &#34;That is the moment we&#39;re in, in the world. It&#39;s technology, plus people, and how they coexist.&#34;</p><p>As Fuller notes, one thing many CEOs concern themselves with when it comes to their people is assessing how they collaborate. &#34;How our people operate is actually the core of Accenture,&#34; Fuller says. &#34;[They] are not simply those who work at Accenture; they are literally the product and our distribution channel, all at once.&#34;</p><p>In theory, that should make the task of empowering Accenture&#39;s people to help grow the company feel monumental, but Fuller has cracked the code. It&#39;s all about living those coveted values from the inside-out. </p><p>&#34;For our purpose to become real,&#34; Fuller says, &#34;the number one thing is that it cannot just be words. When we&#39;ve done additional research to ask people, clients, and our talent what would make this notion real, (the answer is), &#34;I need to see it in my daily life.

But in this case, the tiny rotorcraft soared above rocks, sand ripples, and small craters at record speed.</p><p>NASA hasn&#39;t released details of the flight yet, but the plan called for Ingenuity to climb 16 feet in the air and reach a maximum speed of 3.5 meters per second - a feat NASA engineers weren&#39;t certain it could achieve.</p><p>The helicopter has thus far proven so successful that NASA announced on Friday it will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-to-start-scouting-2021-4\">give Ingenuity an extended mission</a>. The original plan was to abandon the helicopter after its fifth flight. But now, NASA engineers plan to turn Ingenuity&#39;s photos into a 3D map of the uncharted terrain it covered on Friday. From that data, they&#39;ll pick a new airfield where the drone will try to land during its fifth flight, in about a week.</p><p>Once in that new airfield, Ingenuity is set to spend 30 more days testing out operations that NASA might want to conduct with future space helicopters.

NASA engineers expect that outcome in 15% of flight attempts.</p><p>If Ingenuity&#39;s Friday flight went as planned, it should have lifted off at 10:46 a.m. ET and flown for 117 seconds. Ingenuity was programmed to traveled south for around 436 feet, snapping photos of the Martian surface along the way. At that point, it was expected to hover and take images with its color camera, then turn around and land in its original spot.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608af7e235c46f0018c0b4be?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ingenuity helicopter mars fourth flight perseverance rover\" height=\"856\" width=\"1141\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Perseverance rover snapped this photo of Ingenuity on the Martian surface after its fourth flight on April 29, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/ZL0_0068_0672980800_937ECM_N0032208ZCAM05054_110085J\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In Ingenuity&#39;s first flight on April 19, the helicopter <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-flies-on-mars-2021-4\">made history</a> by rising 10 feet above Mars&#39; surface.

It aims to take dozens of rock samples and store them for a future spacecraft to retrieve and bring back to Earth. Those would be the first samples humanity has ever brought home from Mars.</p><p>Ingenuity&#39;s next flights, meanwhile, will gather data on new terrain that&#39;s too dangerous for the rover.</p><p>&#34;In doing these operational scenarios, we will naturally be pushing the limits of Ingenuity,&#34; MiMi Aung, project manager for Ingenuity, said in the Friday briefing. &#34;We hope we will be flying over unsurveyed terrains and, over time, continuing to transfer to airfields that are not well characterized. So there is a higher probability of bad landing.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607d633944f4540019207601?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ingenuity helicopter first photo shadow flight mars\" height=\"1001\" width=\"1333\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ingenuity snapped this photo of its shadow on the ground below as it flew on Mars for the first time, April 19, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Aung has previously said that a bad landing would end Ingenuity&#39;s flights.</p><h2>Flying on Mars isn&#39;t easy</h2><p>For Ingenuity to fly at all, several factors have to go just right. The helicopter flies autonomously, using its cameras to track surface features on Mars in order to navigate. So there can&#39;t be too much dust on its camera lenses, since that could interfere with the navigation. </p><p>Speeding up challenges the chopper&#39;s mechanics and navigation system as well.</p><p>&#34;We navigate by taking images of the ground below,&#34; Håvard Grip, Ingenuity&#39;s chief pilot, said in a recent briefing. &#34;And as we&#39;re traveling faster over the ground, the features in those images disappear from you faster.&#34;</p><p>During test flights, NASA engineers were able to prevent crashes by pressing an emergency land button. But on Mars, they can&#39;t exert that kind of control.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606b3ae0a7d803001963ebe2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mars ingenuity helicopter nasa perseverance rover\" height=\"960\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ingenuity on Mars, sitting where the Perseverance rover dropped it on April 5, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/NLF_0044_0670852159_569ECM_N0031416NCAM03044_01_295J\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL-Caltech</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Whatever happens after this, NASA engineers already consider Ingenuity&#39;s mission a success.</p><p>&#34;If Ingenuity would have crashed after the first flight, we still would have met a couple huge milestones including surviving launch, charging while en route, and surviving the entry, descent, and landing,&#34; Shannah Withrow-Maser, Ingenuity&#39;s vehicle systems lead, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/mz4duo/were_nasa_experts_working_on_the_marshelicopter/\">recently wrote on Reddit</a>.</p><p>&#34;Deploying from the rover and surviving the cold Martian night are no small tasks,&#34; she added. &#34;If the flight wouldn&#39;t have been successful, we would have a lot of data and lessons learned.
