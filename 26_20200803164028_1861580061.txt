And not only can they compete, but they are willing to go all-in to ensure that they succeed in these endeavors. Taiwan is not great at semiconductors because of a random constellation of factors, it’s great because it pushed its entire economy, education system, and government to prioritize its excellence <i>on top of</i> changes like the opening of the global economy and the rise of China.</p>\n<p>Intel and Boeing still have a chance of course, they are still massive companies with cash and talent.

The exact timing will depend on many factors, including the government&#8217;s willingness to open up, the experts&#8217; view of current conditions, business leadership&#8217;s tolerance for risk (or how reasonable it is to run the business remotely), where your business happens to be and the current conditions there.</p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean every business that can open will, but if and when they get a green light, they can at least begin bringing some percentage of employees back. But what that could look like is clouded in great uncertainty around commutes, office population density and distancing, the use of elevators, how much you can reasonably deep clean, what it could mean to have a mask on for eight hours a day, and many other factors.</p>\n<p>To get a sense of how tech companies are looking at this, we spoke to a number of executives to get their perspective. Most couldn&#8217;t see returning to the office beyond a small percentage of employees this year. But to get a more complete picture, we also spoke to a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a government official to get their perspectives on the matter.</p>\n<h2>Taking it slowly</h2>\n<p>While there are some guidelines out there to help companies, most of the executives we spoke to found that while they missed in-person interactions, they were happy to take things slow and were more worried about putting staff at risk than being in a hurry to return to normal operations.</p>\n<p>Iman Abuzeid, CEO and co-founder at Incredible Health, a startup that helps hospitals find and hire nurses, said her company was half-remote even before COVID-19 hit, but since then, the team is now completely remote. Whenever San Francisco&#8217;s mayor gives the go-ahead, she says she will reopen the office, but the company&#8217;s 30 employees will have the option to keep working remotely.</p>\n<p>She points out that for some employees, working at home has proven very challenging. &#8220;I do want to highlight two groups that are pretty important that need to be highlighted in this narrative. First, we have employees with very young kids, and the schools are closed so working at home forever or even for the rest of this year is not really an option, and then the second group is employees who are in smaller apartments, and they&#8217;ve got roommates and it&#8217;s not comfortable to work at home,&#8221; Abuzeid explained.</p>\n<p>Those folks will need to go to the office whenever that&#8217;s allowed, she said. For Lindsay Grenawalt, chief people officer at Cockroach Labs, an 80-person database startup in NYC, said there has to be a highly compelling reason to bring people back to the office at this point.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/l_TUdN4oVog\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 16:27:37 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1248900431.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"e4faf3037c8d118962926bf9d6fceaee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596472800101_ea33a189fee6cb16.webp","author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472797595_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799362_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799339_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472799313_11d149cda8c7ea98.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l_TUdN4oVog:FtFvR8zphKk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn10@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596472799546_33bec960e4dab0bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472799464_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/l_TUdN4oVog":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn94@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596472799317_ba2908ec43fdf5b1.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:53","title":"Virgin Orbit to fly 11 satellites for NASA on second orbital launch demo later this year","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026500","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-orbit\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"virgin-orbit\">Virgin Orbit&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> first attempt at an orbital launch demo may not have gone entirely to plan (the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/virgin-orbits-first-orbital-test-flight-cut-short-after-rocket-released-from-carrier-aircraft/\">LauncherOne rocket released as planned but its flight was cut short just after that</a>), but it has booked a payload for its next try – 11 science satellites selected by NASA and primarily designed and built by U.S. universities.

The company&#8217;s approach involves flying a rocket attached to a modified 747 carrier aircraft to an altitude around where large passenger jets fly, whereupon the rocket separates from the plane and ignites its own engine to carry small payloads the rest of the way to space.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/84p86-dl4qI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 16:11:32 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1aa775f917a43680131f3427be7ea9f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472797595_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472797595_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799362_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799339_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn54@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472799380_8aa7c3e766bf5416.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=84p86-dl4qI:z3DSrWn7FhA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472799476_e842de0d573c4905.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472799464_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/84p86-dl4qI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn90@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472799308_0594190033c82b80.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:53","title":"Is the 2020 SPAC boom an echo of the 2017 ICO craze?","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026412","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">I wanted to write an essay about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/equity-monday-could-satya-and-tiktok-make-bytedance-investors-happy-enough-to-dance/\">Microsoft and TikTok</a> today, because I was effectively a full-time reporter covering the software giant when it hired Satya Nadella in 2014.

The company announced today it will begin testing a new feature that lets Snapchat users set their Snaps to music, similar to TikTok&#8217;s app. The feature may allow Snapchat to capitalize on the fracturing of the TikTok audience, who have been exploring<a href=\"https://constine.substack.com/p/tiktok-replacements-ranked\"> alternative apps</a> as the Trump administration weighs a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/pompeo-says-u-s-may-take-action-against-tiktok-and-other-chinese-tech-companies-shortly/\">ban on Chinese tech companies</a> over data privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>Already, apps like Byte, Triller, Dubsmash, Likee, and others have climbed the app stores&#8217; charts as TikTok users hedged their bets. Instagram also launched a music-powered feature called Reels to cater to the TikTok crowd.</p>\n<p>In Snapchat&#8217;s case, users will be able to add music either pre or post capture from what the company promises will be a &#8220;robust&#8221; catalog of music. This is made possible by way of Snap&#8217;s deals with music industry partners, including Warner <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/music-11fc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"music-11fc\">Music <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Group, Warner Chappell, Universal Music Publishing Group, NMPA publisher members, Merlin and others, who have licensed their music for use in Snapchat&#8217;s app.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>When friends receive one of the new Snaps with music, they&#8217;ll be able to swipe up to view the album art, song title, and artist name. A &#8220;Play This Song&#8221; link will also be available. When clicked, it will open a webview to Linkfire that will allow users to listen to the full song &#8212; not a snippet &#8212; on their preferred music streaming platform, like Spotify, Apple Music or SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>This aspect differentiates Snapchat&#8217;s implementation from TikTok, where clicking on a video clip&#8217;s &#8220;sound&#8221; link only takes users to a page featuring other clips that have used the same sound. But even though TikTok today lacks a feature that fully connects a user to the artist behind a popular music clip, much less the full song, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/tiktok-say-so-doja-cat-nicki-minaj-billboard-number-1-1541d7be-f8b1-4a75-bf78-7099b036ee0a.html\">TikTok&#8217;s power</a> has <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9404479/tiktok-one-hit-wonders-career\">continued to launch breakout hits </a>as users hunted down their favorite TikTok artists across streaming services.</p>\n<p>Snapchat says its music feature, however, will allow fans to form deeper connections with artists and music. It also spoke to its strength in being a tool for close friends which gives it more influence &#8212; largely because of how its younger user base values friend-to-friend recommendations. Today, Snapchat reaches 90% of all 13-24 year-olds in the U.S., more than Facebook, Instagram and Messenger combined, the company says. It also reaches 75% of 13-34 year-olds. And though TikTok has a large international base, Snapchat claims it reaches more U.S. users than Twitter and TikTok combined, based on publicly available data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re constantly building on our relationships within the music industry, and making sure the entire music ecosystem &#8212; artists, labels, songwriters, publishers and streaming service &#8212; are seeing value in our partnerships,&#8221; a company spokesperson said, with regard to the new feature.</p>\n<p>Snapchat says it will roll out the new feature across English-language markets this fall.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TJZzVTB-JBg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:43:18 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/snap-headphones.png?w=711","linkMd5":"b847bd21ce1201aa138bc2619992c310","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn30@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472799432_1261a35e86e7a0d7.webp","author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472797595_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799362_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799339_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472799547_205c330fcb4e7d97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TJZzVTB-JBg:fSN4iytSJ9w:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596472799330_97606b8cf739f268.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472799464_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TJZzVTB-JBg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596472799323_1aaab361667dd4b3.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:53","title":"Boston Dynamics CEO Rob Playter is coming to Disrupt 2020 to talk robotics and automation","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023378","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Back in January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/boston-dynamics-appoints-its-first-ever-new-ceo/\">Robert Playter became the CEO of Boston Dynamics</a>.

href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/509911-dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-reporting-on\">compiled &#8220;-intelligence reports&#8221; on journalists who published leaked documents</a>, I’m concerned about all the <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/\">DHS</a> agents who might now be afraid of retaliation for being a whistleblower — perhaps one who legally leaks information such as, let’s say, unclassified information about government activities related to immigration. Not that you’re thinking of doing that, of course.</p>\n<p>Assuming the disclosure of the information to a journalist is legal (for which I would suggest it would be prudent to consult an attorney who is well-versed in national security law, freedom of speech constitutional claims and government accountability), there are several steps that someone — not you, of course, but someone — might want to take to avoid retaliation for this completely legal act.</p>\n<p>Assuming disclosure is legal and there are no criminal consequences that could be faced, one might also want to address whether the leak could result in employment-based discipline or retaliation. For this reason, seeking proper legal counsel and ensuring anonymity would probably be in the best interest of a would-be whistleblower, who is totally, definitely, not you or any of your colleagues.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>For the sake of argument, however, let’s say someone actually were to be interested in bringing to light an egregious misdeed ordered by the federal government that goes against the freedoms the United States was founded on. In that situation, someone — not me, of course, but someone — might point them toward organizations that exist for those considering taking whistleblowing action. Organizations like <a href=\"https://whistlebloweraid.org/\">Whistleblower Aid</a>, which offers free aid and alternatives to illicit leaks, and <a href=\"https://whistleblower.org/resources/#resources-about-whistleblowing\">Whistleblower.org</a>, which has been engaging in whistleblower advocacy, education and litigation since 1977. Not to say that YOU would use these resources, per se, but it might be fun to take a look at them in a hypothetical, “Haha what if I were to expose gross injustices being perpetuated by my department?” kind of way. Probably not on a work computer, though — not that it matters, of course! (I’m sure it’s of no interest to you, but one interested in understanding how the disclosure of information can come to light might be interested in checking out the information that can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/y3md3v/how-to-organize-your-workplace-without-getting-caught\">How to Organize Your Workplace Without Getting Caught</a>.)</p>\n<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: <em>Sophie, if there is such a need to protect whistleblowers with this sensitive information, doesn’t that suggest there are systemic issues at play? Would someone (who isn’t you) even recommend that a DHS employee (who isn’t me) partake in this historically necessary and honorable action?</em></p>\n<p>Such a person, if they were to read this article, might feel proud of the fact that since the leak, DHS has ceased compiling these “intelligence reports” and ordered an inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">UPDATE: After we published our story on DHS compiling intelligence reports about journalists&#8217; articles, the acting secretary, Chad Wolf, has halted the practice and ordered an inquiry.

The company currently charges a platform fee off of every inspection booked and Inspectify takes around 15 percent of the cost of the inspection.</p>\n<p>People spend on average between $380 and $450 on inspections and the Los Angeles-based company isn&#8217;t short on clients. Jensen said that the company is growing its revenue 60 percent on a monthly basis since its launch in August of last year.</p>\n<p>Jensen previously ran operations for the Andreessen Horowitz-backed company FlyHomes.

Co-founder Taylor Zwilser, a former executive at a startup called Vault (and a real estate agent in a past life), joined Jensen in launching the Inspectify business along with Denis Bellavance, the company&#8217;s chief technology officer and a former Amazon engineer and serial entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>Bellavance had previously founded Peach and was a longtime employee at Zillow, launching the company&#8217;s Canadian business.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;My wife and I have an interesting model on real estate investment,&#8221; said Jensen. &#8220;We’ll buy a house renovate it and live in it and then move. It’s been a big passion of ours… initially it was a side gig to bring in more capital.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Now poised to graduate from Y Combinator&#8217;s latest cohort, Inspectify is coming along at a good time for startups focused on real estate.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, investments in property technology and real estate management services for both the residential and commercial market have soared. In all, venture capital investment in property tech totaled $1.6 billion through May. That number is down dramatically, nearly 70 percent year-on-year, according to data from Keefe, Bruyette &#38; Woods, <a href=\"https://www.nreionline.com/technology/venture-capital-funding-proptech-firms-has-dropped-considerably-may-be-temporary\">cited by National Real Estate Investor</a>.

Electric automakers Nikola Motor and Fisker Inc. have also become public companies through a SPAC over the past two months. Shift Technologies, an online used car marketplace and sensor company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/\">Velodyne Lidar</a>, also went public via a SPAC, sidestepping the traditional IPO path.</p>\n<p>In this latest SPAC, the combined company will remain on the Nasdaq under a new ticker symbol RIDE. DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. was listed on exchange under the ticker DPHC.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The company said it was able to raise $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, including a $75 million investment by General Motors. Other institutional investors that joined included Fidelity Management &#38; Research Company, Wellington Management Company, Federated Hermes Kaufmann Small Cap Fund and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock.</p>\n<p>The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. The new combined company&#8217;s board will include Steve Burns, the founder and CEO of Lordstown, and David Hamamoto, Chairman and CEO of DiamondPeak.</p>\n<p>SPACs have been around for decades and have gone by different names, including “blind pools” and “clean shell companies and blank-check companies. A SPAC is a corporation that has no defined business plan or purpose other than to raise money from public markets to acquire a private company. The SPAC has seen a resurgence in 2020, particularly in the second and now third quarters.</p>\n<p>Lordstown has an interesting history for such a young company. Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of Burns’ other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also a publicly traded company.  Workhorse is a small company that was founded in 1998 and has struggled financially at various points. Its offshoot, Lordstown Motors, revealed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/lordstown-debuts-a-52500-electric-pickup-alongside-a-campaigning-mike-pence/\">prototype of an electric pickup truck</a> called Endurance that is aimed at contractors and other buyers in the commercial market.</p>\n<p>The plan is to produce 20,000 of these electric commercial trucks annually, starting in the second half of 2021, at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Lordstown Motors acquired in November the 6.2 million-square-foot factory from GM.</p>\n<p>The combined company plans to use about  $675 million of gross proceeds from the SPAC transaction to  fund production of the Endurance. Since the truck&#8217;s unveiling, the company has secured pre-orders valued at $1.4 billion (or about 27,000 total pre-orders), according to Burns.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/WKztDic0x2I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 16:27:26 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EnduranceMain07.jpg?w=605","linkMd5":"37d24e0e283697eb728db41c7cfa917a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn34@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799359_14df17db2c4c9570.webp","author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472797595_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799362_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596472799339_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596472799383_b122c814dedfdeef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WKztDic0x2I:D8z7JsUX3Rk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn98@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472799601_ce003b07c34757bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596472799464_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/WKztDic0x2I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn54@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596472825470_93b97be08244d090.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-04 00:39:57","feedId":26,"fetchDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 16:39:57 +0000","fetchMs":19,"handleMs":6385,"totalMs":36856,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"34.196.9.97","hostName":"dry-shelf-60780.herokuapp.com","requestId":"dea94cd78eb94af6b7f7804bbd012605_26","bgimgsTotal":9,"bgimgsGithubTotal":9,"articlesImgsTotal":33,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":33},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-07-05 03:11:12","id":26,"name":"TechCrunch","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cropped-cropped-favicon-gradient.png?w=180","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn7@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596472792933_0605cf8bffe277cf.webp","description":"TechCrunch is a group-edited blog that profiles the companies, products and events defining and transforming the new web.","weekly":null,"link":"https://techcrunch.com"},"extra4":{"start":1596472791111,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":23,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":6385,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":2544,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":27538,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":26171,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":33,"extra6":33,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[]}
