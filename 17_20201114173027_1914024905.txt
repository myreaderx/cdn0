Whitman himself considered it his &#8220;mystic and indirect chant of aspiration toward a noble life&#8221; and &#8220;a vehement demand to reach the very highest point that the human soul is capable of attaining.&#8221; </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64202\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/salut-au-monde_print?sku=s6-8967918p4a1v45?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass12.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of Margaret C.

It augurs his hard-earned wisdom on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/12/20/walt-whitman-specimen-days-meaning-of-life/\">what makes life worth living</a>, at which he would arrive half a lifetime later while recovering from a paralytic stroke. It echoes the famous prose-meditation on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/31/walt-whitman-leaves-of-grass-preface/\">the key to a vibrant and rewarding life</a>, with which he introduced <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as a young man. It hums, surefooted and sonorous, as a kind of blessing song for the road of life.  </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F928166752&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=680&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,<br />\nIt is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.</p>\n<p>Here a great personal deed has room,<br />\n(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,<br />\nIts effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.)</p>\n<p>Here is the test of wisdom,<br />\nWisdom is not finally tested in schools,<br />\nWisdom cannot be pass&#8217;d from one having it to another not having it,<br />\nWisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,<br />\nApplies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,<br />\nIs the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things;<br />\nSomething there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul.<br />\nNow I re-examine philosophies and religions,<br />\nThey may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.</p>\n<p>Here is realization,<br />\nHere is a man tallied &#8212; he realizes here what he has in him,<br />\nThe past, the future, majesty, love &#8212; if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Whitman on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/07/26/walt-whitman-specimen-days-democracy/\">optimism as a mighty force of resistance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/08/walt-whitman-to-a-pupil/\">what it takes to be an agent of change</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/01/03/whitman-emerson-criticism/\">how to keep criticism from sinking your soul</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/05/walt-whitman-women/\">women&#8217;s centrality to democracy</a>, then revisit a beautiful reading from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/26/crossing-brooklyn-ferry-janna-levin-walt-whitman/\">his furthest-seeing, deepest-feeling poem</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.
