The authors suggest their results may indicate that immunity to the virus within the general population also rapidly faded after the first wave of the pandemic.</p><p>Scientists at Imperial College London found that the share of people who tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19— part of the body's defense against re-infection — fell by 26.5% from June to September: from 6.0% of the population to 4.4%.</p><p>The exact relationship between antibody presence and immunity to the coronavirus remains unclear. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/long-term-coronavirus-immunity-t-cells-2020-8?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">Although the presence of antibodies suggests a person is likely immune to the virus, that's not the only indicator</a>, and a lack of antibodies in someone who was previously infected may not necessarily mean they've lost their protection.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31008-4?rss=yes\">an August study</a>, other layers of protection against reinfection, most notably T cells, are likely also critical in the body's long-term immunity.</p><p>Nonetheless, the authors of the Imperial report suggested that falling levels of antibody prevalence could indicate falling population immunity, given evidence from other human coronaviruses.</p><p>\"We can see the antibodies and we can see them declining and we know that antibodies on their own are quite protective,\" said Professor Wendy Barclay, an author of the report and the head of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London, in comments <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-antibody/uk-study-finds-evidence-of-waning-antibody-immunity-to-covid-19-over-time-idUKKBN27C009\">cited by Reuters</a>.</p><p>\"On the balance of evidence I would say, with what we know for other coronaviruses, it would look as if immunity declines away at the same rate as antibodies decline away, and that this is an indication of waning immunity at the population level.\"</p><p>Professor Helen Ward, another co-author of the report, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54696873\">told the BBC</a> that the study suggests \"immunity is waning quite rapidly, we're only three months after our first [round of tests] and we're already showing a 26% decline in antibodies.\"</p><p>Paul Elliott, professor of epidemiology and public health at Imperial College and another of the study's authors, said in a press release emailed to Business Insider:</p><p>\"Our study shows that over time there is reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab test if they have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required.\"</p><p>The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved a random selection of 365,000 people over three non-overlapping rounds, who tested themselves for coronavirus antibodies at home between June 20 and September 28 using a finger-prick method.&#160;</p><p>The tests are not full-proof on a person-to-person level. Imperial College says <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/200713/biggest-study-antibody-finger-prick-tests-identifies/\">the type of tests used</a> were found to \"correctly identify individuals with coronavirus antibodies over 80% of the time while correctly ruling out those who don't in more than 98% of tested individuals.\"</p><p>The smallest decline in antibody levels was observed among 18-24 year olds, where the proportion with antibodies fell by 14.9%. The largest was in those over 75, among whom the proportion fell by 39%.</p><p>For healthcare workers, the proportion of antibodies in the study group did not change over the observation period, which could either reflect they had greater initial exposure to the virus, or could be due to repeated infection, the authors suggested.</p><p>Commenting on the report in a press release emailed to Business Insider, UK Health Minister Lord Bethell said: \"It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them – this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-19.\"<br><br>\"Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a test if you have symptoms and always remember Hands, Face, Space.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-study-antibodies-fading-rapidly-after-covid-19-infection-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:01:34 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f980e9c4743a3001216bd49?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"87f0b2c6791f41c011e8c73b6592c40c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-10-961_54fe83a10ff28865.webp","destWidth":2127,"destHeight":1595,"sourceBytes":173788,"destBytes":173788,"author":"tcolson@businessinsider.com (Thomas Colson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f980ea5f21803001222c254?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn44@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-10-141_c9e272e4091376f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817626709},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","title":"Jack Ma's Ant Group is targeting a record $34 billion IPO.

But since my mom also happened to be Martha Lauber, a clinical psychologist in private practice on Chicago's North Shore, she invariably had advice to give.</p><p>Which is exactly how mirroring, a technique often employed by therapists, came into my life. During my turbulent teenage years, mirroring was a well-practiced conflict-resolution method in our household.</p><p>Also known as limbic synchrony, mirroring is the act of mimicking those around us. An ingrained social behavior that typically yields positive results, mirroring can help to establish a rapport between humans, with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840169/\">research</a> finding that it improves interpersonal skills in children.</p><p>When Harville Hendrix began marketing mirroring as a beneficial technique for dialoguing couples, it became more utilized by therapists. In his book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Couples-Companion-Meditations-Exercises-Workbook/dp/0671868837\">The Couples Companion: Meditations and Exercises for Getting the Love You Want</a>,\" Hendrix <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=GgVCqUwbmlMC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Mirroring+is+simply+a+matter+of+carefully+repeating+back+what+was+said+for+verification,+and+repeating+the+process+until+we+get+it+right&source=bl&ots=IyX6FihpW8&sig=ACfU3U2T5wqB7o64n03rbtzCUubonqsr_g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiotJ_C6r_nAhUXmnIEHbtEA5AQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=Mirroring%20is%20simply%20a%20matter%20of%20carefully%20repeating%20back%20what%20was%20said%20for%20verification%2C%20and%20repeating%20the%20process%20until%20we%20get%20it%20right&f=false%20until%20we%20get%20it%20right&#38;f=false\">writes</a>, \"Mirroring is simply a matter of carefully repeating back what was said for verification, and repeating the process until we get it right.\"</p><p>With two teenage daughters and many surly mornings, my mother wisely employed mirroring as a way to make her children feel heard. During a time in my life when I often felt misunderstood, listening to my mother reflect my feelings helped to defuse my anger. And when my sister and I fought, mirroring each other paved the way to a mutual understanding.</p><p>\"Mirroring is the best way for two people to resolve conflict,\" my mom would say, as I rolled my eyes in typical teenage fashion.</p><p>It wasn't until I was in a long-term partnership that I discovered she had been right all along.</p><p>Married for five years — and together for much longer — my husband and I are well matched. We make each other laugh, we enjoy the same activities, and we love each other very much. Despite all of this, we are far from perfect. Every relationship has its ups and downs, and during a recent down point, it seemed we were fighting way too often.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-leaders-track-manage-employee-performance-remotely\">How to best manage your employees' performance remotely — without coming off as a micromanager</a></em></p><p>One evening, a minor dispute morphed into a full-fledged argument. The initial disagreement — which was unbelievably stupid — was blown out of proportion. An hour into our altercation, with no truce in sight, my mom's voice echoed in my head. <em>Try mirroring</em>, the voice said. <em>It's the only way to resolve an argument.</em></p><p>Sitting on the couch opposite my husband, I explained how mirroring worked. Taking turns, each of us would speak in clear sentences, sharing our feelings. The other would listen with care and then repeat the words back verbatim, changing the personal pronouns as needed.</p><p>\"I feel hurt that you don't like our Christmas tree ornaments, because I feel they're an important symbol of our relationship.\" (I told you it was unbelievably stupid.)</p><p>\"You feel hurt that I don't like our Christmas tree ornaments, because you feel they're an important symbol of our relationship.\"</p><p>We continued this back-and-forth rhythm until I felt sufficiently heard, at which point it became my husband's turn to share. To my surprise, he articulated his emotions with a depth of feeling that was uncharacteristic of him.</p><p>Later, when I spoke to my mother about this incident, she wasn't surprised. \"It just takes one person to start mirroring, and if you're willing to <em>really</em> listen, all of a sudden it starts the process.\"</p><p>Her words rang with accuracy. During our argument, I was too invested in my wounded ego to listen to my husband. I had completely shut out his feelings in favor of my own. But mirroring had allowed him to speak and forced me to listen, and vice versa. The result was something truly wonderful: We finally understood each other. Our anger dissipated. The next weekend, we spent an entire day hand-crafting Christmas ornaments, so the tree could reflect more of my husband's taste. It ended up being one of the best days of the year.</p><p>To this day, my mom holds the firm belief that mirroring is the best way to resolve an argument.</p><p>\"Mirroring works because when a normal person is listening to someone else, they're already planning their rebuttal,\" she said. \"But if you have to repeat what the other person says, your brain can't do two things at once. That's the secret of mirroring — it cuts out the planning of your rebuttal so that you can finally hear your spouse.\"</p><p>Though it's a relatively simple concept, it's not as easy as it sounds. For one, it requires a true willingness to listen.</p><p>\"The whole point of mirroring is to listen to the other person, not to get your agenda across. If you want to get your agenda across, don't even do it,\" my mom said.</p><p>She also said that accountability is essential to squashing disagreements. \"Everyone thinks the other person is the problem. Mirroring helps you to understand you're only seeing half of the picture,\" she explained.</p><p>Another important tip? \"If you're in the middle of a big fight, don't mirror right away,\" she said. Heightened emotions may lead to blaming and more squabbling, which means mirroring won't help. After duking it out, make sure to take some time to cool off before starting the process of resolution.</p><p>Which is to say, if you're worried that fighting with your partner means your relationship is doomed, fear not. After working with married couples for 40 years, my mom believes spousal arguments are perfectly natural, healthy even. \"Arguing can be extremely helpful if the argument gets resolved. Personal attacks aren't good, but otherwise, arguments bring festering issues to the surface, which can help the relationship long term,\" she said.</p><p>Mirroring has changed my marriage. After rediscovering this therapy hack, my husband and I no longer quarrel like we used to. When we do find something to disagree on, we mirror each other and find a way to see eye to eye.</p><p>The entire process has revealed recurring patterns in our relationship and allowed us to understand the other's needs. It has taken sacrifices on both our parts, and it's not easy — but we're better off for it. My only regret is not taking my mother's advice sooner.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://jersey-griggs.github.io/\">Jersey Griggs</a> is a writer specializing in lifestyle topics.

We've included links to that information for the eight resorts we've listed below. Check Colorado's statewide <a href=\"https://covid19.colorado.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19 updates</a> for additional details on infection rates, testing sites, and the recently renewed mandatory <a href=\"https://covid19.colorado.gov/mask-guidance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mask-wearing requirement</a>.</p><p>Some of the common changes for the 2020-2021 ski season include requiring face coverings, physical distancing (including on chairlifts and in gondolas), advance reservations for lift tickets (often granting priority to pass holders), cashless transactions, limiting class size for lessons, and reducing restaurant seating. Many resorts are also limiting on-mountain capacity, especially for peak dates so it may pay off to plan and book early.&#160;</p><p>While outdoor recreation is relatively safe, it's important to consider the risks of&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel</a>&#160;in general, and of staying in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hotels</a>. Without a vaccine, there is no guarantee of safety, and we recommend following guidelines put forward by organizations like the CDC and WHO, such as always wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and practicing social distancing.</p><p>Additionally, just because an activity is outside doesn't mean it's safe and it's important to weigh the risk factors of skiing and snowboarding, such as potentially encountering crowded areas like lift lines and lodging areas. We will be following up on ski safety risks and precautions based on medical expert knowledge, so check back for updated info.&#160;&#160;</p><p>With that in mind, we rounded up eight of Colorado's best ski resorts and also chose recommendations for cozy hotels for each, based on the following criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>All hotels have excellent locations for accessing the mountains. Some are ski-in/ski-out while others require a short shuttle ride or easy drive, but all are within minutes of the lifts or base villages.</strong></li><li><strong>Every stay has attractive features that discerning travelers are looking for from distinctive architecture and decor to excellent dining options, and availability of other winter-friendly activities (like ice skating or spa treatments).</strong></li><li><strong>Many of the hotels listed include additional helpful amenities and extras including ski storage, ski valets, and shuttle service.&#160;</strong></li><li><strong>All lodgings are highly rated on trusted traveler sites such as <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Trip Advisor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Foking.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Booking.com</a>.</strong></li><li><strong>We focused on affordability since ski hotels can be notoriously expensive and found a range of stays that won't break the bank from a hip hostel to a Western ranch to traditional base village lodges. </strong></li><li><strong>Hotels are priced to suit a range of budgets and currently start from $155 to $309 per night.

The company announced in September that it would <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-adds-staff-fourth-major-us-hiring-spree-of-2020-2020-9\">100,000 new workers</a> to help manage a rise in online orders during the coronavirus pandemic.

She added that Citi sees a \"really compelling investment case here.\"</p><p>The study looked at investent in girls' eductation in a mixture of wealthier emerging nations such as India and Egypt, as well as more disadvantaged ones, such as Lao PDR, Bolivia, El Salvador, Egypt, Mali, Uganda and Ghana.</p><p>The report deduced a 2.8x return on investment in the time period up to and including 2030, a greater return than other alternative investments, like infrastructure, which according to Citi's model would only return 2.0x on investments.</p><p>With 130 million girls worldwide out of school and UNESCO reporting over 11 million girls may not go back to school after the COVID-19 crisis, the scale of the challenge is immense, the study said.<br><br>However, this also presents an opportunity. \"COVID-19 recovery plans that prioritise investment in girls' education and well-being will help communities and economies build back better and stronger,\" Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International, said in a press release.<br><br>The report calls for a \"multi-pronged investment approach\", with the private sector playing a role alongside governments and charity organizations.</p><p>\"Most analysis out there that has looked at the economic benefits of investing in girls have very much adopted a siloed approach, so just looking at one area (i.e. education or health), and in the report we make the case that a more comprehensive, multi-component intervention and investment approach can bring the best outcome for girls,\" Ying said.</p><p>The strategy will be of interest to ESG investors, Ying said, adding that there is increasing momentum behind \"gender-lens\" investing.</p><p>\"What we are seeing in the past couple of years is that gender-lens investments have grown significantly, so for example, from 2014-2018 publicly available gender-lens mandated investments grew from $100 million to $2.4 billion in assets under management,\" she added.</p><p>\"Investing in the development of girls is not only the right thing to do, but it's a key contributor to growth, delivering unparalleled impacts and returns across societies, and that

Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, will campaign in Texas, a bold move that is reflective of the Biden campaign's growing confidence in the state, especially with its legions of suburban voters.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-texas-ohio-political-fundraising-biden-trump-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:23:15 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f982a6af21803001222c2b7?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8c53b5e6539a209013f1a0a798630582","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn34@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-11-694_2a51ce40b1081567.webp","destWidth":3105,"destHeight":2329,"sourceBytes":76874,"destBytes":76874,"author":"insider@insider.com (John L.

voicemail.&#160;</li>\n<li>If none of these fixes work, you should reach out to your cellular service provider for assistance.&#160;</li>\n<li><a

straight to voicemail without ringing is a mundane — yet frustrating — issue. But there is an explanation and, more importantly, a way to fix it.&#160;</p><p>While there could be several possible causes, almost all of them involve your phone's settings, making it generally easy to troubleshoot. Among the handful of things that might automatically send your calls to voicemail is your phone's Do Not Disturb mode, blocked numbers, call forwarding, Bluetooth connections, and your phone's SIM card.&#160;</p><p>Whether you accidentally activated any of these phone features or forgot you turned them on, don't fret. Restoring your Android's default settings to receive calls again can be a quick process.&#160;&#160;</p><h2>How to troubleshoot your Android when incoming calls go straight to voicemail</h2><p>Here are five things to troubleshoot when your calls go straight to voicemail — and the one thing you should do when nothing else works.&#160;</p><h3><strong>Turn off your Android's Do Not Disturb mode</strong></h3><p>If your phone is set to \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/do-not-disturb-android\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Do Not Disturb</a>,\" most or all of your phone calls will go directly to voicemail. So it's worth checking to see if the phone has been accidentally put in that mode.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Pull down your phone's Control Center by swiping down from the top of the screen.&#160;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Check that the Do Not Disturb icon is not enabled.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9346d9f21803001222bbef?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_does_my_Android_go_straight_to_voicemail 1\" height=\"3040\" width=\"1440\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Make sure Do Not Disturb isn&#39;t enabled.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For more information, read our article \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/do-not-disturb-android\">How to turn on and customize Do Not Disturb settings on your Android phone</a>.\"</p><h3><strong>Remove a number from your blocked numbers list on Android</strong></h3><p>Are you using your phone's call blocking feature? It can come in handy to stop telemarketers and other unwanted calls, but you might be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-block-a-number-on-android\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accidentally blocking phone numbers</a> that you want to ring through. You can turn this off in your Android Phone app.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start the Phone app.&#160;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Tap the three dots at the top of the screen.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> In the drop-down menu, choose \"Settings.\"&#160;</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Select \"Block numbers.\"&#160;</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Remove any phone numbers from the list you don't want to send to voicemail immediately.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9346f54743a3001216b709?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why does my Android go straight to voicemail 2\" height=\"3040\" width=\"1440\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Blocked phone numbers go straight to voicemail.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For more details, read our article \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-block-a-number-on-android\">How to block a number on any Android phone to stop receiving unwanted calls</a>.\"</p><h3><strong>Disable any call forwarding features</strong></h3><p>Not all Android phones support call forwarding, and it depends on your cellular provider, but you may be forwarding your calls directly to your voicemail or another number. Disabling any of your Android device's call forwarding features may resolve the issue.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start the Phone app.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Tap the three dots in the top left of the screen.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Select \"Settings\" or \"Call Settings.\"</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Choose \"Calls.\"</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Tap \"Call forwarding.\"&#160;</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Turn off any of the four listed options: \"Always forward,\" \"Forward when busy,\" \"Forward when unanswered,\" and \"Forward when unreached.\"</p><h3><strong>Turn your Bluetooth connection off&#160;</strong></h3><p>Sometimes, your phone's Bluetooth connection can get confused and think it's connected to a device when, in fact, it's not. You might have experienced this when you turn off Bluetooth earbuds, and audio does not switch to the phone's speaker. Instead, all you hear is silence. Luckily, the remedy is simple.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Pull down the Control Center by swiping down from the top of the screen.&#160;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Tap the Bluetooth icon to turn it off completely.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Wait a moment and then tap it again to turn it back on.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9347104743a3001216b70a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_does_my_Android_go_straight_to_voicemail 3\" height=\"3040\" width=\"1440\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Toggle your Bluetooth connection to see if that solves the problem.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Replace your Android phone's SIM card</strong></h3><p>Sometimes, a faulty or damaged SIM card can cause weird problems, and it's more likely to be the culprit if you remove and replace the SIM card often. In other words, the more you handle it, the more likely it's a problem.&#160;</p><p>You can attempt to remove, reseat, and insert the SIM card to address the issue. But to be 100 percent sure it's the reason your calls are going straight to voicemail, you should contact your cellular provider and replace the card with a new version. You can request a new SIM card without changing your phone number or making any changes to your service.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f93484a4743a3001216b712?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A woman putting a SIM card in her phone\" height=\"1412\" width=\"1883\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A woman putting the sim card from her phone on a table.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AntonioGuillem/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Check your coverage and talk to your cellular provider</strong></h3><p>If none of those simple fixes solved your problem, it's more likely that the problem is not with your Android handset but with your cellular service.&#160;</p><p>Try looking at a coverage map from your provider to see if you have reliable service or test your service with another phone. If your coverage is very weak, incoming calls can go straight to voicemail. You can also try calling your cellular provider's customer service for additional troubleshooting support.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9347694743a3001216b70b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_does_my_Android_go_straight_to_voicemail 4\" height=\"1616\" width=\"2174\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Check a coverage map to see if your home or office is in a dead zone.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Related coverage from&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Tech Reference</a>:</h2><ul><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-wont-my-bluetooth-connect\">'Why won't my Bluetooth device connect?': How to fix common Bluetooth connection issues</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-block-a-number-on-android\">How to block a number on any Android phone to stop receiving unwanted calls</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/do-not-disturb-android\">How to turn on and customize Do Not Disturb settings on your Android phone</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-off-safe-mode-on-android\">How to turn off Safe Mode on your Android phone or tablet in 2 ways</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-free-up-space-on-android\">5 easy ways to free up storage space on an Android phone or tablet</a></h3></li></ul><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/why-does-my-android-go-straight-to-voicemail'>Business Insider</a></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:59:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f9344c0f21803001222bbdb?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5ab73e29773edee7dbd3f5ae2920989a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn98@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-59-989_a070f60eef675bc3.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":178342,"destBytes":178342,"author":"insider@insider.com (Dave Johnson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f9344984743a3001216b6f1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-09-720_c86b005d1058994a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f9346d9f21803001222bbef?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn24@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-08-284_41eb0e133e71ae52.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f9346f54743a3001216b709?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn18@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-00-195_2a7ea82c48965592.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f9347104743a3001216b70a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn45@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-02-440_7a23eb51662f3c99.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f93484a4743a3001216b712?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn89@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-03-042_12c404c088e64716.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f9347694743a3001216b70b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn46@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-06-866_6155052d6b7adb72.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817626699},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","title":"Navigating pre-election madness — The Fed's dark side — Trading a K-shaped recovery","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-investing-stories-business-insider-week-ended-october-27-2020-10","description":"<p>Dear Readers,</p><p>Judging by yesterday's drastic sell-off, pre-election market jitters are in full effect.

Larger, more expensive machines cook faster, while smaller, less expensive options will still get hot enough to heat most things. However, they probably won't cook as evenly. Size and wattage usually go hand in hand, but size is its own consideration based on where your microwave will fit.</li><li><strong>Location:&#160;</strong>Countertop microwaves to take up precious space, but when that's all you have to give up, it's your best and only option. Over-the-range models fit over your stove and take the place of a range hood. If you have space, they're great, but they're also usually more expensive. Built-in microwaves can be tucked into a cabinet, but they're probably best for large kitchens where drawer and cabinet space is not at a premium.</li><li><strong>Convection and inverter: </strong>Convection microwave ovens blow air into the microwave so that heat is distributed more evenly, making them the most consistent and reliable option. However, they're usually more expensive. Microwaves with inverters can run at partial power while maintaining an even temperature, while other microwaves just pulse on and off, allowing the temperature to vary. Like convection ovens, inverter microwaves are a little more expensive but worth the extra money if you tend to cook in your microwave a lot or draw butter or chocolate regularly enough.</li><li><strong>Presets and controls:</strong> Many microwaves come with presets, but those can be faulty and add confusion to the interface. I've often opened the microwave after using a preset and found either half-frozen mush or worse still, utter devastation. It's often in your best interest to choose your own time and power settings.

filled with eye-popping entertainment and attractions — and plenty of potential ways to drop a boatload of cash. But that doesn't always extend to your hotel. Sin City can be the perfect place to score truly luxurious lodging for a price so low it could seem like a typo.</p><p>Now, as travelers emerge from lockdowns in response to the novel coronavirus, those discount prices are also increasingly appearing in a bid to lure guests, coupled with stringent new cleaning policies, and flexible refund and cancelation policies.</p><p>And if you're wondering if<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> it's safe to travel</a>, it's important to understand the risks associated with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hotels specifically</a>. Remember, without a vaccine, there is no firm guarantee and it's crucial to follow guidelines from organizations such as the CDC and WHO, and wear a mask, wash your hands, and maintain social distancing. Additionally, consider your own level of risk, and whether you're traveling from or to a hotspot, so as not to increase the rate of infection.&#160;</p><p>As such, expect the entire travel experience to look different. In Las Vegas, in order to reopen, casinos were required to submit plans outlining social distancing and hygiene measures to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and casino floors <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/las-vegas-casinos-reopen-masks-shields-social-distancing-2020-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">now feature masked entertainers, handwashing stations, plexiglass barriers, and temperature checks</a>.</p><p>If you're considering spending the night, you'll want to be up to date on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-precautions-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new policies put in place from major hotels</a>, which we've outlined below. Expect temperature checks, social distancing, contactless check-in, thorough guest room and public space cleaning, and new rules around dining and leisure. As of right now, the state of Nevada also requires face coverings or masks to be worn in public areas. Because the pandemic situation is constantly evolving, you may want to read up on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-hotel-airbnb-cancellation-change-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hotel cancellation policies</a>, too.<br><br>Hopefully, these policies will help you sleep easier. The cheap prices will certainly aid that effort, too. Because Vegas resort operators make a huge chunk of their profits down on the casino floor, where the house <em>always</em> has the advantage, cheap room rates attract guests who then spend their money on slots and tables.</p><p>But cheap doesn't mean dismal. The city sets a high bar for accommodations at any price, even for a two-figure price tag — yes, well under $100, and in many cases under $50. Beware when booking though, as a resort fee could inflate that rate much higher. I've seen rooms for $50 per night with an $80 daily resort fee. Of course, in high season or during big events, all rates are subject to change and starting price points can soar.</p><p>We rounded up the best affordable hotels in Las Vegas based on the following criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>Hotels are rated four stars or higher, with a prime location on or near the Las Vegas Strip, and priced under $120 per night.</strong></li><li><strong>Hotels are beloved by guests with top reviews on <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8092&awinaffid=257137&clickref=biipf_010220_best-cheap-las-vegas-hotels&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FHotels-g45963-Las_Vegas_Nevada-Hotels.html-Hotels.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Trip Advisor</a>, excellent <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=biipf_010220_best-cheap-las-vegas-hotels&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Foking.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Booking.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipf_010220_best-cheap-las-vegas-hotels/https://www.hotels.com/search.do?resolved-location=CITY%3A1504033%3AUNKNOWN%3AUNKNOWN&destination-id=1504033&q-destination=Las%20Vegas,%20Nevada,%20United%20States%20of%20America&q-check-in=2020-07-26&q-check-out=2020-07-27&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=1&q-room-0-children=0&f-hotel-id=147594children=0&#38;f-hotel-id=147594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hotel.com</a> ratings — and based on our own past stays.

While national polls point to a clear Joe Biden win, many investors are looking back at 2016 and skeptical of polling. In addition, the surge of mail-in voting has increased the likelihood that the outcome of the election may be unknown for a while after November 3.</p><p>Business Insider spoke with Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, to discuss how investors should position their portfolios during this unpredictable election season.&#160;</p><p>Stovall cautioned investors against trying to \"guess\" who will win the election and making investment decisions based on that projection.</p><p>\"You're taking a big gamble being wrongly positioned should 2020 end up looking like 2016, in which the polls were wrong,\" the investment strategist said.&#160;</p><p>Instead, investors should stick with their strategy no matter who they think will win, or who actually ends up winning. CFRA is neutral on both stocks and bonds.</p><p>\"If you have a strategy, then stick to that strategy no matter who ends up becoming president or whom you think will become president,\" Stovall said. \"If you're a momentum player, stick with momentum.\"</p><p>The coronavirus has also complicated prediction models that typically provide investors with a clearer idea of who will win. Stovall referenced the Presidential Predictor model, which tracks the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500_500\">S&#38;P 500</a> price change from July 31 to October 31 before the election. Since 1944, the model has shown that if the price change was positive, the incumbent political party will remain in office.</p><p>This model has failed only twice, during years when the US faced what Stovall calls \"geopolitical disruptors\" — the Vietnam War and the Iranian Hostage crisis. He said coronavirus could be the 2020 \"disruptor\" that explains why Trump may not win reelection, even if the S&#38;P 500 price change is positive heading into the election.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-in-bull-market-volatility-elections-morgan-stanley-2020-10\" data-analytics-position=\"4\" data-analytics-module=\"\">MORGAN STANLEY: Stocks could fall another 9% as the new bull market faces a rising tide of risks — and these 2 cyclical sectors are the best long-term trades to take advantage of</a></em></p><p>If the election is contested and the outcome is uncertain for a few weeks, Stovall expects there to be a pullback in stocks. In 2000, the market fell 10% as it awaited the election decision, he said.</p><p>However, this pullback could provide an opportunity to buy at a discount stocks that have heated up recently, like alternative fuels and cannabis.</p><p>\"Look for those stocks that got away from you during the recent recouping of the prior bear market. And identify which ones you would like to own at lower prices,\" said the strategist. \"Then, once they hit your target price, act upon it because you're never really going to be able to capture the ultimate bottom.\"</p><p>Stovall also said an additional selloff is likely if Biden wins, as investors take some profits in anticipation of the former vice president's capital-gains tax hike.</p><p>Ultimately, investors should remember that the market is forward looking, and is more focused on economics than politics, he said.&#160;</p><p>Monday's stock selloff was likely due to the worry that the surge in coronavirus cases could lower fourth quarter gross domestic product and earnings, said Stovall. Thursday's reported third quarter GDP growth is estimated to be 31%, and the market may react negatively if the number is lower.</p><p>\"Because the estimate is so high, I actually think all things being equal, you have a greater chance of being disappointed than that you are being overly pleased,\" Stovall said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-how-invest-election-uncertain-advice-contested-stovall-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:34:31 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f80c93fea74820019ca65c8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"95e2f7fc06e96cf9a5ddd7475e4a6f56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn88@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-10-965_85028f8bec20b0e4.webp","destWidth":2246,"destHeight":1684,"sourceBytes":144850,"destBytes":144850,"author":"egraffeo@businessinsider.com (Emily Graffeo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f9845810c60aa00190d4858?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn53@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-04-777_651db421d45daf4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817626706},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","title":"Federal judge rejects Justice Department's effort to defend Trump in E.

Many people even negotiate their vacation days before accepting an offer for a new role.&#160;</p><p>Freelancers get none of these perks. Sure, we get to set our own rates and choose clients that align with our passions and expertise. But when it comes to getting away from it all and going off the grid for a few days, freelancers often struggle to mitigate stress. After all, a day away from work is a day bringing in zero earnings for freelancers who don't have passive income.</p><p>I'm all too familiar with the struggle of vacationing as a freelancer — especially as an independent travel journalist. It's nearly impossible for me to switch out of work mode when vacationing. I'm constantly searching for story angles, scribbling notes, chatting with locals, and snapping photos. Even when I'm not traveling on assignment, I act as if I am.</p><p>Two years ago I booked a week-long getaway on a Cambodian island with very little internet access. It was my first real vacation in years. I had zero obligation to write about the place where I was going. I expected to spend all day sunbathing at the beach, reading in a hammock swaying underneath palm trees, and enjoying all the cocktails my heart desired. Leading up to my trip I got all my assignments turned in on time and alerted my editors that I'd be offline.</p><h2>I was miserable in paradise.&#160;</h2><p>After a few hours of truly relaxing, I'd want to work. I love my job and the travel-centric lifestyle I've created for myself. Forcing myself to take a vacation didn't serve me. I was desperate to check my emails. I couldn't wait to return to the mainland and get back online. I was operating on the scarcity mindset and was afraid of all the opportunities I was missing by being offline.</p><p>I've since learned how to embrace a short holiday. Spending three to five days offline is my sweet spot. I can truly enjoy my experience without worrying too much about work. Even though I'm typically overseas, I tend to schedule my vacations around US bank holidays, since that's when most of my clients will also be offline. I know it's unlikely I'll have unexpected edits or assignments due over a long holiday weekend.</p><h2>To be able to enjoy your vacation, notify your clients as soon as possible about the dates you're taking off work and assure them you'll meet all deadlines before you jet off.&#160;</h2><p>As a journalist, I usually have a handle full of articles in various stages of editing. I email any and all editors who may email me with edits while I'm gone to let them know I'll be OOO.</p><p>If you get incoming work close to your scheduled vacation, be realistic with yourself about whether you can fulfill the duties before your holiday. I try not to accept new deadlines two weeks before my departure. Ask your clients if they have any wiggle room with the deadline and try to schedule it for a week after you return from vacation.&#160;</p><p>Don't take on too much extra work to make up for the \"lost time,\" or you'll be so burnt out on your vacation that you won't be able to enjoy your time off.&#160;</p><p>If your clients give you grief about taking off, it might be time to consider if you want to end your professional relationship with them. Freedom is one of the key reasons many take a freelance career path. Do you want to work with someone who makes you feel guilty about cultivating a healthy work-life balance?</p><p>I don't work for an intelligence agency. My work will not save the world from imploding. It can wait until I'm back. I try to truly log off during my vacations and not check my email. If I'm going away for a long weekend from Thursday to Monday I usually don't take my laptop with me.&#160;</p><h2>I always put up a vacation responder on my email.&#160;</h2><p>In the subject, I include what day I'll be back online. My biggest tip is to write that you'll be online a day after you're actually back in the office. That way you have a day to clean up your inbox (which will inevitably be filled with emails).</p><p>In my out of office message, I state if I'll have internet access and when folks can expect a response back from me. If I'll have access to email, I'll note that I'm checking emails once a day and that if the request is truly urgent to email me back with URGENT in the subject line so I know which emails need a quick response before I'm back on the clock.</p><p>If, like me, you have daily clients, try not to get too caught up in thinking about the money you're \"missing out on\" by taking a few days off. I know this is difficult. One of my gigs is as a trending news writer. Most days I earn between $120-$290. A week away from this work means I could lose up to $1,450.&#160;</p><p>But, when I come back from my holiday, I usually have crystalized a few ideas for features that could earn me double that amount. You'll be able to make up that lost income when you return from your holiday refreshed, and ready to jump back into work with a renewed energy.&#160;</p><h2>Your clients aren't going to forget you because you took a vacation.&#160;</h2><p>They'll benefit from the improvement in your work after you've rested. Your business will continue to thrive, and may even blossom after you unwind on vacation.</p><p>Adopting the abundance mentality has been tremendous in helping me feel confident that spending a few days away from my inbox won't be detrimental to my career. Yes, freelancers have zero job security, but I remain positive that money is always coming my way. There will always be more opportunities. Freelancing ebbs and flows — there are great months and awful months whether or not you're glued to your computer screen or spending a few days getting lost in the woods.</p><p><em>This Business Insider article was originally published on October 24, 2020.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-freelance-journalist-takes-vacation-without-losing-business-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 13:54:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f92e98b21211300187406a0?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"47d9df66f6e0e8aca6f02cad7900410f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn98@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-04-031_34565f99bb4bbce0.webp","destWidth":1066,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":103040,"destBytes":103040,"author":"insider@insider.com (Lola Méndez)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f32d3164dca68415d3618ae?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn94@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-08-426_5058b3a4c63eef5b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817626713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","title":"This $3,200 'scorpion' chair and workstation has 6 different positions for gaming, working from home, and even sleeping","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/scorpion-computer-cockpit-workstation-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f96f69d4743a3001216ba2a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cluvens_scorpion_3\" height=\"2856\" width=\"3807\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Scorpion gaming chair.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Cluvens</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>\"Computer cockpit\" company Cluvens is selling a \"Scorpion\" workstation for gaming or working.</li>\n<li>The chair is on sale for $2,000 from Alibaba or up to $3,200 from the manufacturer.</li>\n<li>Both the home office furniture industry and the video gaming industry continue to post gains during the pandemic as many are still spending much more time at home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>In 2020, it's possible to work remotely from a <a href=\"https://www.cluvens.net/scorpion\">Scorpion gaming chair</a>.</p><p>The insect-like piece of furniture comes from Cluvens, which says it is \"specialized in the design and production of highly innovative, ergonomic and affordable computer cockpits for the future home office environments.\" It was spotted by <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/this-giant-scorpion-is-really-a-zero-gravity-gaming-chair-and-computer-workstation/\">CNET</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435361/scorpion-chair-gaming-cockpit-office-wfh\">The Verge.</a></p><p>It's a good time to be in the home office furniture business.

and Infectious Disease co-authored a new JAMA viewpoint.</li>\n<li>They lay out why a combination of \"low-tech\" coronavirus-fighting measures, including masks, distancing, handwashing, and fast testing are all critical for controlling the pandemic.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The White House is calling it quits on fighting the coronavirus.&#160;</p><p>\"We are not going to control the pandemic,\" President Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-meadows-donald-trump-white-house-coronavirus-treatment-vaccine-2020-10\">told CNN on Sunday</a>.&#160;</p><p>But America's top infectious disease expert is still in it to win it.&#160;</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci says one of the most potent and \"low-tech\" things everyone can do right now to help control the spread of this virus is also extremely simple: keep on wearing that mask.</p><p>Fauci stressed the disease-fighting measure once again Monday in a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) viewpoint, authored with his colleagues Dr. Andrea Lerner and Dr. Gregory Folkers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p><p>The trio's science-backed mask up reminder comes just as the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-third-coronavirus-case-surge-outbreak-deadliest-largest-yet-2020-10\">US is dealing with its greatest surge of coronavirus</a> infections yet, and with a decent, widely-available coronavirus vaccine still many months away.&#160;</p><p>\"Ultimately, a safe and effective vaccine will be essential to control the pandemic and allow resumption of the many activities of normal life,\" Fauci and his colleagues wrote <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772459\">in their JAMA letter</a>.&#160;</p><p>But, in the meantime, we have a few \"low-tech\" tools which are going to be essential to controlling the spread of this new virus, the doctors said. And masks are a major one.&#160;</p><p>The others we already have include: \"physical distancing, hand hygiene, prompt testing (along with isolation and contact tracing), and limits on crowds and gatherings,\" Fauci and his colleagues said.</p><p>None of these interventions, taken on its own, will fully end the pandemic, but together they can work to dramatically cut down on the number of coronavirus infections and deaths we will see in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>\"Return to normalcy,\" Fauci and his colleagues said, \"will require the widespread acceptance and adoption of mask wearing and other inexpensive and effective interventions.\"</p><p>Here are the biggest reasons why Fauci and his colleagues are arguing it's really important to for everyone keep on donning a mask during the pandemic:&#160;</p><h2>Mask usage goes hand in hand with lower COVID-19 infection rates in the US, and around the world&#160;</h2><p>There is a clear pattern that has been established at this point in the pandemic, based on studies conducted in hospitals and homes around the world: wherever masks are worn, coronavirus transmission rates tumble.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/5/5/e002794.full\">study of 124 households in Beijing</a> conducted early-on in the pandemic, which Fauci and his co-authors cited, found that Chinese families who wore masks at home before anyone in the house ever knew they were sick with the virus saw lower odds of secondary infections (face mask use was \"79% effective in reducing transmission,\" the study said.)&#160;</p><p>And, <a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2020.12897\">in Massachussetts' largest hospital system</a>, after all health care workers and patients started wearing masks, virus \"positivity rate among health care workers declined from 14.65% to 11.46%, with a decline of 0.49% per day,\" Fauci's viewpoint said.&#160;</p><p>Modeling studies back up this same idea on population-wide level, suggesting that putting on a face covering not only prevents more disease, it also saves lives.&#160;</p><p>Mask mandates may have \"averted <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818\">more than 200,000 cases</a> of COVID-19 [the disease caused by the coronavirus] by May 22, 2020,\" according to another study Fauci that and his co-authors cited.&#160;</p><p>More recent modeling estimates likewise suggest that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/universal-masks-save-lives-mitigate-third-surge-model-2020-10\">if every American put on a mask now, more than 130,000 more US deaths</a> could be prevented, by March 2021.&#160;</p><p>\"Expanding mask use can be one of the 'easy wins' in the United States,\" Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), told reporters on Friday, as that new model was released.</p><h2>Masks also keep other people's germs closer to them</h2><figure>\n\t<img

infected people's germs closer to them, and as such are \"a logical strategy to curb transmission,\" Fauci and his colleagues said.</p><p>Even when people aren't <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-coronavirus-can-travel-6-feet-through-the-air-indoors-2020-10\">shouting, laughing, or singing</a> (activities we know can spread the virus well) \"masks can reduce respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath,\" which means not only are other people less likely to get sick from being around infected individuals wearing masks, they may, possibly, also get a milder case of the coronavirus, if indeed they do become infected.&#160;</p><h2>Keep your mask on, even when you're talking</h2><p>Indoors, in stuffy, stagnant spaces without good ventilation, coronavirus particles can more easily linger in the air.&#160;</p><p>That's why you should try to keep your mask on as much as possible.</p><p>\"With the onset of colder weather in the northern hemisphere, activities will increasingly occur inside, resulting in often-unavoidable congregating,\" Fauci and his colleagues said.&#160;</p><p>Knowing that such crowded, indoor spaces can be prone to a buildup of more virus in the air, \"the commonly observed practice of individuals removing their mask when speaking is not advisable,\" Fauci said.&#160;</p><h2>Some people might never realize

In May 1972, the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean when someone called the ship's company and threatened to blow it up unless a ransom was paid.</p><p>In response to the threat, four commandos, including two SBS operators, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/19/archives/front-page-1-no-title-bombs-are-hunted-on-queen-elizabeth-2.html\" target=\"_top\">parachuted</a> into the ocean and boarded the ship.</p><p>In the end, the call was a hoax, but the incident showcased<!-- I took the reference to the Munich hostage crisis out because that wasn't a maritime incident, unless there was something about Munich specifically that led to SBS' expansion? --><!-- The Munich massacre was a milestone in counterterrorism and essentially created the skill set. Delta Force and SEAL Team 6 were created because of event, and the SAS and SBS began specializing in CT because of it, which necessitated a minor expansion.   --> the need for a dedicated maritime counterterrorism unit that could respond to future contingencies. The hostage crisis at the 1972 Munich Olympics underscored the importance of the counterterrorism mission.</p><p>As a result, the SBS began to grow, and the unit's counterterrorism mandate expanded to include anything maritime-related, such as cruise ships, channel ferries, or oil rigs. The SBS works closely with oil companies, often leasing active or decommissioned oil rigs so SBS troops can hone their skills.</p><p>The SBS' maritime counterterrorism skills are so good that when the North Sea oil industry began to swell in the 1970s and 1980s, many operators were lured away by oil companies' luxurious paychecks for security work, which caused a manning crisis in the elite unit at the time.</p><p>But the SBS has proven it can do more than maritime counterterrorism.</p><h2>By strength and guile</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9835e1861cb70019936a3e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"British SBS Special Boat Service\" height=\"596\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>SBS and Delta Force operators during the Battle of Tora Bora.\n<p class=\"copyright\">CBS 60 Minutes/Defense Department</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Comprised of four assault squadrons (C, M, X, Z), the SBS specializes in direct action, special reconnaissance, counterterrorism, and hostage rescue.

But back-to-back deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have shown the unit's land-warfare capabilities.</p><p>In the initial days of the campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, SBS operators fought alongside US Delta Force commandos in the Battle of Tora Bora, where Osama bin Laden was almost killed or captured in November 2001.</p><p>They also helped quell the Taliban prisoner riot that killed CIA operative Mike Spann, the first American to die in the Global War on Terror.

Sure, we might make poor&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/rhett-power/5-keys-to-great-decision-making.html\">decisions</a>, but our being sleepy at the marketing meeting tomorrow is not going to get someone killed.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During WWII, though, the US military quickly got hip to the fact that if fighter pilots didn't get sleep, their poor decisions had dire consequences. Their mishaps included errors that resulted in their being shot down — or shooting down guys on their own side.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Helping combat pilots get good rest fast became a priority.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So the military brought in naval ensign Bud Winter to&#160;develop&#160;and test a scientifically designed&#160;method of \"teaching\" sleep. Winter was previously a successful college football coach&#160;who had collaborated&#160;with a psychology&#160;professor to form techniques to help athletes relax and excel under pressure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The relaxation hack Winter designed worked:&#160;After just six weeks of practice,&#160;<strong>96% of pilots could fall asleep within 120 seconds</strong>.&#160;Even with distractions like gunfire in the background. Even after drinking coffee. Even sitting up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If it works for combat pilots, it will work for you, regardless of how stressed you are about that meeting tomorrow. Here's how to do it.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Get comfy</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Obviously, if you're in your bed, this is a non-issue. But if you're out and about, get into the most comfortable position that's feasible (i.e., lean your seat back if you're in your car; find the most comfortable chair in the conference room if you're napping at work).</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Relax your face</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">This is key to the whole thing. You have 43 muscles in your face, and they're a big part of how your body knows whether you're stressed. When you fully relax your face, you send a physiological signal to your body that all is well. It's safe to sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So close your eyes and relax your whole face: forehead, cheeks, tongue, and jaw. You'll notice as you do this that your breathing naturally starts to deepen and slow.<iframe width=\"1\" height=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" data-google-container-id=\"2\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now make sure your eyes are fully relaxed. You have six muscles in your eye sockets; feel them all go limp.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Release tension, starting with your shoulders</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Let them get heavy, and then let them go completely, as if they were falling down toward your feet. Let the back of your neck relax. Take a deep breath and let it out slowly, releasing any remaining tension (most people store most tension in their shoulders, necks, and jaws).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now your arms: Feel them get heavy and relax, starting with your dominant side. If you're right-handed, start with your right bicep and feel it relax. If it's not, tense it fully and then let it go slack. Repeat the process with your hands.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Let your legs go limp. Feel your right quad sinking down, getting heavier and heavier. Next your right calf, ankle, and foot. Repeat on the other side.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Clear your mind for 10 seconds</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Now that you've fully relaxed your body, time to power down your thoughts. (This is like that moment after you switch your iPhone off when it takes another few seconds for it to fully turn off.)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What you really want to avoid are any thoughts that involve movement (\"I've got to pick up that dry cleaning tomorrow\"; \"Did I remember to put out the recycling?\"). These actually prompt involuntary movement. You don't realize it, but just thinking about something causes micro-contractions in certain muscles.</p><p><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0498025411/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_3905707922?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0498025411&ie=UTF8&imprToken=HRDlUsa.69hW4-aUFpYR7Q&linkCode=w61&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4&slotNum=0&tag=stucosuccess4&#38;slotNum=0&#38;tag=stucosuccess\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bud Winter</a>, author of \"Relax and Win: Championship Performance,\" has some tips for what to \"think\" of instead — and remember, you're holding this for 10 seconds straight:<br><br><em>First, we want you to fantasize that it is a warm spring day and you are lying in the bottom of a canoe on a very serene lake. You are looking up at a blue sky with lazy, floating clouds. Do not allow any other thought to creep in. Just concentrate on this picture and keep foreign thoughts out, particularly thoughts with any movement or motion involved. Hold this picture and enjoy it for 10 seconds.</em><br><br><em>In the second sleep-producing fantasy, imagine that you are in a big, black, velvet hammock and everywhere you look is black. You must also hold this picture for 10 seconds.</em><br><br><em>The third trick is to say the words \"don't think ... don't think ... don't think,\" etc. Hold this, blanking out other thoughts for at least 10 seconds.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>And that's it.&#160;When you have a fully relaxed body and a mind that's still for 10-plus seconds, you will fall asleep, period.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Within two minutes, you'll be out like a light. Remember 96% of combat pilots achieved success after six weeks of practice. These weeks of practice are a worthwhile investment, because once you have it down, you can nap and sleep anywhere, which will dramatically improve your quality of life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sweet dreams.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This Inc. story was originally published on Business Insider on May 2, 2019.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/military-pilots-sleep-trick-2-minutes-2019-5'>Business Insider</a></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:19:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5e53e466fee23d70d875e122?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f70377edc40ea9afc4fedfe9b34736db","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-58-162_e08b6cbf913338d6.webp","destWidth":3111,"destHeight":2333,"sourceBytes":374542,"destBytes":374542,"author":"insider@insider.com (Melanie Curtin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5e53e466fee23d70d875e122?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-58-162_e08b6cbf913338d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817626674},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:46","title":"Vote in person if you're young and healthy — it's relatively safe, and your vote is more likely to count","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/voting-in-person-low-risk-more-reliable-than-mail-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f85b8dcc255d800190b98fa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Georgia voting\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Heather King waits in line at State Farm Arena, Georgia&#39;s largest early-voting location, to cast her ballot on October 12, 2020 in Atlanta.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica McGowan/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>More than 66 million Americans have already voted in this year's general election.&#160;</li>\n<li>Mail-in ballots are more likely to be rejected than ballots cast in person.&#160;</li>\n<li>The chances of contracting the coronavirus from voting in person are low, so if you're young and healthy, consider voting in person.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>More than <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/25/politics/pre-election-voting-surpasses-2016-early-ballots/index.html\">66 million Americans have already voted</a>.

Cast a ballot in person instead.&#160;</p><p>Experts do not consider going to a polling place any more dangerous than <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/voting-during-pandemic-pretty-safe/616084/\">a trip to the grocery store</a>, as long as voters follow common-sense safety protocols like mask-wearing and social distancing. And voting in person means your vote is more likely to be counted: Historically, only about .01% of in-person ballots <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/22/904693468/more-than-550-000-primary-absentee-ballots-rejected-in-2020-far-outpacing-2016\">get rejected</a>, compared with around 1% of mail-in ballots, though rejection rates vary significantly by state.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f85cc74c255d800190b998d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Virginia voting\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A woman casts her ballot for the 2020 election at an early voting location in Alexandria, Virginia, on October 1, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This year, a greater percentage of ballots is likely to be rejected because more people are voting by mail in states that typically have higher rejection rates for mail-in ballots, like Georgia. According to a USA Today investigation, if 70 million voters cast ballots by mail in 2020,&#160;about 1 million ballots <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/08/rejected-mail-ballots-projected-major-factor-2020-election/3576714001/\">could be rejected</a> overall. That may be enough to affect the outcome of the presidential election or other races.</p><p>What's more, ballot rejection rates could easily be higher this year than in the past, since a record number of people will vote by mail for the first time and may be more likely to make mistakes on their ballots.</p><p>Earlier this month, Michael Herron, a professor of government at Dartmouth University, found that first-time mail-in voters in Florida were <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~herron/VBM_experience.pdf\">2.75 times more likely</a> to have their ballots rejected than people with vote-by-mail experience. That was primarily because the voters sent their ballots in late or didn't include signatures on envelopes.&#160;</p><p>Plus, states that haven't offered mail-in voting on such a wide scale before could have trouble tallying ballots speedily and accurately.</p><p>\"We've never had an election where mail voting is such a big deal,\"&#160;Herron&#160;told Business Insider. The importance of mail-in voting, he added, \"has focused attention on the issues\" with the current system – especially its high rejection rates.</p><p>Primary elections earlier this year offered a glimpse into how many mail-in ballots might get rejected come Election Day. More than <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/over-1-million-mail-in-ballots-could-be-rejected-in-the-us-election-and-the-rules-are-changing-by-the-day-148188\">550,000 mail-in primary ballots were rejected</a> out of a total of 26.6 million <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/13/mail-in-voting-became-much-more-common-in-2020-primaries-as-covid-19-spread/\">mail-in or absentee ballots</a>; that's nearly twice as many as in the 2016 November election, which had nearly 319,000 rejected ballots out of <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-does-vote-by-mail-work-and-does-it-increase-election-fraud/\">33 million mail-in or absentee votes</a>.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4e93fb7ed0ee001e25cc62?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mail ballot\" height=\"1331\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A woman holds up a mail-in ballot before dropping it off at Boston City Hall during the Massachusetts state primary election on September 1, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>If, say, 2020's rejection rate for mail-in ballots turns out to be around 2%, that could mean as many as 2.15 million uncounted ballots this November. For reference, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 by about 2.9 million votes.</p><h2><strong>Voting in person is a low-risk activity</strong></h2><p>During the 2020 primary elections, in-person voting didn't appear to sicken many people, a <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voting-in-primaries-didnt-worsen-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">FiveThirtyEight analysis found</a>. Most experts now don't consider it to be especially risky.&#160;</p><p>\"I actually equate it with takeout,\" Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona and leading expert on coronavirus transmission, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-vote-in-person-safely-november-election-2020-10\">previously told Business Insider</a>. \"There are so many safety protocols being put into place for safe voting that it is really a lower-risk activity.\"</p><p>That's because most polling places are taking extra precautions. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/voter-registration-elections/covid-19-safety-precautions\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"db9e054837f0360e845fc5451d043682\">in Dekalb County, Georgia</a>, poll workers will wear masks and face shields, and voting equipment will be cleaned at least once an hour. In <a href=\"https://recorder.maricopa.gov/pdf/Final%20November%202020%20General%20Election%20Day%20and%20Emergency%20Voting%20Plan%209-16-20.pdf\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"8b10d1a2ef3170ceab9db28b82a9ba26\">Maricopa County, Arizona</a>, all polling locations are expected to provide voters with gloves and masks, and to disinfect pens after each use.</p><p>\"Most polling stations are requiring masks, you're able to distance, and your time inside is very short,\" Popescu said.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Voting considerations don't affect everyone equally</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8eeeb69e9fe4001900a4d1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pennsylvania voting \" height=\"1334\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Long lines of voters wait to cast early ballots at the A.

Their risk of getting seriously ill with COVID-19 is relatively low compared to people in other age brackets, and their risk of getting a ballot rejected is relatively high. So it makes sense to head to the polls.</p><p>But for many voters of color, the decision isn't straightforward. Black, Native, and Hispanic Americans have been hospitalized with and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html\">died of COVID-19 at higher rates</a> than white Americans. But even Black voters who have plenty of experience mailing in their ballots are more likely to have them rejected than white voters, according to the analysis <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~herron/VBM_experience.pdf\">by Herron's team.</a></p><p>It's a tough choice: Vote by mail, knowing that ballot has a higher chance of getting rejected, or go to the polls but face a higher risk of a severe case if one is exposed to the coronavirus.</p><p>\"I think we would all agree that voters shouldn't be in that situation,\" Herron said.</p><h2><strong>How to reduce your coronavirus risk when voting</strong></h2><p>The deadline for requesting a mail-in ballot has <a href=\"https://time.com/5889969/how-to-vote-by-mail/\">already passed</a> in some states.

Put in your zip code and choose \"national retailer\" from the drop-down location menu. Depending on where you live, you'll get results like Walgreens, Winn-Dixie, and Staples. Keep in mind that these locations often only sell booklets, so you won't be able to purchase stamps individually.
