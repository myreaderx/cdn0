Today, we&#8217;re watching a montage of the evolution of the final girl.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Final girls are as essential to horror as slasher villains and jump scares. But <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/final-girl-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">their legacy is a complicated one</a>, to say the least. Final girls carry a lot of damage. And I don&#8217;t just mean a stray knife slash here and there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coined by Carol J. Clover in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Men-Women-Chain-Saws-Gender/dp/0691006202\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Men, Women, and Chainsaws</a>, </em>the &#8220;final girl&#8221; trope refers to the last woman standing at the end of a bloodbath who escapes and sometimes vanquishes her would-be killer. Even in the many incarnations since the trope&#8217;s first bonafide appearance in 1970s slashers, a number of troubling through-lines persist to this day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true that disproportionally women are vessels for much of the world&#8217;s violence. But the expectation that victimhood is a singularly feminine burden exposes a less empathetic angle. Namely, that audiences will not identify with men in similar peril. That a virginal man cowering in a closet fumbling tearfully with a defensive coat hanger just isn&#8217;t someone audiences can root for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is to say nothing of the fact that even the most subversive final girls are overwhelmingly white. That even when ostensibly metacritical films like <em><strong>Midsommar</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Scream 2</strong> </em>challenge traditional character structures, Black survival is not guaranteed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all of this sounds like a colossal bummer, as the video essay below emphasizes, knowing the history of the trope is important, and slowly but surely, things are changing. The movement of &#8220;social horror&#8221; is gaining more traction. And with that, the final girl is steadily shifting towards a more intersectional view of peril, victimhood, and what it takes to survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch &#8220;<strong>The Final Girl Trope, Explianed</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Final Girl Trope, Explained\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yPDXEacY8U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This video comes courtesy of <strong>The Take</strong> (formerly ScreenPrism), a channel dedicated to analyzing film, television, and pop culture.

This week, </em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/liz/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Liz Baessler</em></a><em> takes a look at the Amazon Prime series Truth Seekers.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my money, the horror-comedy to end all horror-comedies is <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/shaun-of-the-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Shaun of the Dead</em></a>. It’s required viewing every Halloween, as well as any non-spooky time of the year when you might need a little pick me up.</span></p>\n\n\n<p>So, by all logic, <em><strong>Truth Seekers</strong></em>, Amazon Prime’s new horror-comedy series written in part by <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> stars <strong>Nick Frost </strong>and <strong>Simon Pegg</strong>, ought to find itself in the same pantheon. Even if it doesn’t earn a quite as vaunted a position, it ought to be good, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Truth Seekers</em> has a fun enough premise. Gus (Frost) and Elton (<strong>Samson Kayo</strong>) are wifi installers for the not-at-all sinister-sounding internet provider Smyle. One wizened with experienced and one fresh on the job, they&#8217;re a professional odd couple with a dynamic as old as time. The cool new twist is that they use troubleshooting house calls to gain access to some of Britain&#8217;s spookiest old buildings and pursue Gus&#8217; real passion: the hunt for the paranormal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the paranormal, without fail, is always there to be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be good. Frost and Kayo are both likable, and the ensemble cast, which gradually expands to include <strong>Emma D&#8217;Arcy</strong>,<strong> Susan Wokoma</strong>, and <strong>Malcolm McDowell</strong>, shares a fun camaraderie in the face of the unknown. <em>The Mighty Boosh&#8217;s </em><strong>Julian Barratt</strong> is in his element as an enigmatic turtlenecked weirdo. And the ghosts are surprisingly scary. The series starts with a real bang in terms of creepiness, in fact, breaking out its top ghosts and setting the mood for a truly entertaining collision of the terrifying and the hilarious. The scene is a solid contender for the high point of the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that means it&#8217;s all downhill from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting as a monster-of-the-week show that gradually thickens its plot, Truth Seekers is comprised of many parts that are meant to be related but really just don&#8217;t hang well together. The side quests are too contrived &#8212; the wifi installation premise is flimsy, to begin with, and deteriorates rapidly. Often it&#8217;s abandoned altogether, and you find yourself wondering why it was even there to begin with. These contrivances lead to a huge number of coincidences that might look fine on paper, but when it comes to a quickfire series you can polish off in one or two sittings, they just stack up too high to remain believable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem is the show&#8217;s twists, of which there are several. This is a spoiler-free review, so of course, I won&#8217;t go into the nature of the twists. That&#8217;d be cruel. But I will say that they&#8217;re not dealt with very well. The twists themselves are fine, but clues to the truth are scattered around so liberally that it&#8217;s hard not to get wise to them long before they&#8217;re revealed. And by the time the big epiphany rolls around, it&#8217;s more or less old news. A tiresome playing out of the characters discovering what you’ve already suspected for some time. This happens on a number of occasions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of eight episodes, it all culminates in a finale that feels rushed, a payoff that deflates before it&#8217;s hardly even started and offers far too little catharsis given the joining of all those darn coincidences and converging plotlines. It becomes all too clear, as the last episode putters on, that it&#8217;s mostly setting the stage for future seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a bold move in a climate where competition for viewership is fierce and content comes and goes at the whim of an algorithm. Were the season able to stand up on its own, or were it to end on a legitimate cliff hanger, everything would be fine. It would be exciting, in fact. But I have a terrible feeling this will wind up as a single season with few questions asked and even fewer answered, a blip of Halloween-themed programming that had big dreams but just couldn&#8217;t back them up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it won&#8217;t. With enough heavy hitters in front of and behind the camera, <em>Truth Seekers</em> might very well get to keep telling its story. Here&#8217;s to hoping it pulls itself together if it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Truth Seekers</em> premieres on Amazon Prime on October 30th. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/k8QDUxFX4oE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 01:16:12 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1292d709a378359b0252db0ae749e7f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Liz Baessler","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/k8QDUxFX4oE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-33-809_03f2f8de2a1ff6e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129173979},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","title":"An Ode to B-Level B-Movie Monsters","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358784","description":"\n<p id=\"block-04637504-093d-4be3-a121-b1015ed34453\"><em>Welcome to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

Art is a response to real-world anxieties. And when the world&#8217;s anxieties change, art follows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1950s, genre mores mutated from romantic shamblers like the Mummy and Frankenstein to, well, mutants. Not just mutants, but a veritable menagerie of atomic age beasties. Mangled men and irradiated insects stalked the screen. Alien anxieties, fueled by the space race, heralded a batallion of murderers from beyond the stars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1950s genre films are easy to laugh at and even easier to dismiss. They&#8217;re hyperbolic, campy, and partial to dressing up their small budgets with a hefty dose of melodrama. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, this is what reckonings look like: they&#8217;re sloppy, scrappy, and scrambling to cash in on what ails the audience du-jour. And in that messiness, 1950s genre films are teeming with variety. This is an era full of monsters, if not particularly iconic ones. Most of these ghouls may have faded from public memory &#8212; some of them immediately. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that is, as the video below ultimately argues, part of the fun: the eagerness, the break with tradition, and the endearing excitement over new territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch &#8220;<strong>The B-Movie Monsters That Time Forgot!</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The B-Movie Monsters That Time Forgot!\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGLqcXPMhG4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This video comes courtesy of the fine folks over at <strong><em>Little White Lies</em></strong>, a film-obsessed magazine based in the United Kingdom.

Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article about the most memorable downer horror movie endings is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n<p>Horror is home to a higher percentage of bleakly depressing endings than any other genre, but that&#8217;s only to be expected, isn&#8217;t it? Romance films make your heart flutter, action raises your pulse, and horror aims to terrify, disturb, and obliterate hope. That&#8217;s why we love it. Sure, there are plenty of horror movies that test their protagonists only to see them come out on top in the end. Those aren&#8217;t the movies we&#8217;re here to celebrate, though.</p>\n<p>No, we&#8217;re here today to praise the horror movies that push both characters and viewers alike into an uncomfortable corner. The ones that secure our interest and emotion before teasing hope, survival, or redemption before grinding our hearts into the dirt. To be clear, we&#8217;re not talking cheap shot endings where the monster is defeated only to pop up in the final seconds and claim victory anyway. We are, however, talking about movies that thrill us, make us care, and then crush us right before the end credits roll.</p>\n<p>Now please join me and the crew (<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/coffel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chris Coffel</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Valerie Ettenhofer,</a> <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\">Jacob Trussell</a>) as we put on a brave face and relive the bleakest downer horror movie endings!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>10.

Any movie kind of has to end at that point because there’s nowhere to go from there. <strong>Ben Wheatley</strong>’s scuzzy and sadistic thriller is about two hitmen who get more than they bargained for when a series of jobs leads them down a dark path. How dark? Familicide, apparently.</p>\n<p>The end of <em>Kill List</em> is especially brutal and demoralizing because there’s absolutely no way to see it coming. Much of the film mixes the folk horror of pagan rituals with the clinical violence of mercenary killing; until the last moment, it’s impossible to tell what Wheatley has in store. Audiences’ stunned silence hits right as the credits roll, leaving us alone with our overwhelming sense of disgust and horror. (Valerie Ettenhofer)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>9. Pet Sematary (1989)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358900\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pet-sematary.jpg\" alt=\"Pet Sematary\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pet-sematary.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pet-sematary-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pet-sematary-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pet-sematary-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Stephen King&#8217;s bibliography is heavy on horror, obviously, but he doesn&#8217;t always succeed (or even make an effort) at being legitimately frightening. He tells great stories, but he doesn&#8217;t always aim for scares. <em>Pet Sematary</em> is one of the exceptions as it delivers some truly unsettling scenes and emotionally affecting horrors, and <strong>Mary Lambert</strong>&#8216;s adaptation follows suit for the screen.</p>\n<p>Grief is the order of the day, and the film captures the agony and pain well starting with the accidental death of young Gage and continuing through his father&#8217;s heartbreaking need to kill the boy again &#8212; the child returns from the grave, starts racking up a body count including his own mother and is finally downed by his father, Louis. The man is in clear distress as he injects his zombie son with an extra lethal dose, and it&#8217;s here where madness finally sets in.</p>\n<p>He then buries his murdered wife, the love of his life, in the cursed burial ground&#8230; and waits. She returns, shambling into their kitchen, and as the two of them embrace for a final heartbreaking kiss, she picks up a knife and slashes him to death. It&#8217;s one of the genre&#8217;s great downer endings and just one of the reasons why it&#8217;s a superior adaptation to the one from 2019. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8.

But when I first watched <em>The Mist</em> in theatres, I was literally on the edge of my seat, enough to lean over the back of the chair in front of me (call off your hounds, the theatre was empty.)</p>\n<p>As we hear Thomas Jane systemically shoot his family and allies, my jaw dropped. You don’t go to a horror movie expecting a happy ending, but you also don’t go to one anticipating nihilism of such an extreme degree. When he realizes he miscounted and he doesn&#8217;t have a final bullet for himself, the wind is knocked out of you. And then you see the mother who no one wanted to help from the beginning of the movie survive with her kids and you’re like, “Ok what in the actual fuck.”</p>\n<p>Famously this ending is not in Stephen King’s original novella, the survivors instead driving into an unknown future in the haze surrounding the interdimensional creatures, but <strong>Frank Darabont</strong>’s pitch black ending knocks a hole in you that King himself was hesitant to do. <em>The Mist</em> might be a B-movie blast, but that doesn’t rob it of having one of the most impactful downer endings in horror cinema history.

They watched on as their fellow researchers all died horribly brutal deaths, most of them being ripped to shreds in some way, and then they destroyed their research base.

Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article about the most harrowing horror movie pregnancies is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pregnancy: it’s the thing that made us, yet it’s also a topic that’s plagued by taboos, frequently politicized, and for roughly half the population, shrouded in unknowable mystery. It’s also, despite the pastel-hued Instagram posts that will try to convince you otherwise, bloody and gross and alien and primal.</p>\n<p>All of this makes pregnancy a theme that naturally fits well with horror movies. What happens when a parent doesn’t feel a connection to their child, or can&#8217;t keep their kid safe? What if outside forces take control of a woman&#8217;s body? The often-unspoken anxieties that go hand-in-hand with human reproduction have been channeled through the safely metaphorical conduit of horror for decades, resulting in films that expose tough truths and reveal deep-seated fears.</p>\n<p>Here are ten films that do an excellent job making the magic of giving life look horrific&#8230; it&#8217;s the harrowing horror movie pregnancies as voted on by <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/coffel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Coffel</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacob Trussell</a>, and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yours truly</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>10.

However, <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child</em> set out to address issues such as abortion and teen pregnancy, so it can’t be accused of being devoid of ideas or not confronting hot-button topics.</p>\n<p>In some ways, this is one of the more mature movies of the bunch. But the story is also a testament to Freddy Krueger’s never-die attitude, as he uses a pregnant woman’s baby’s dreams to continue his murderous rampage. Of course, it’s only a matter of time until Baby Freddy makes an appearance, and he’s as cute as a button. (Kieran Fisher)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>9.

A shlockbuster before the term was invented, <strong>Ovidio G. Assonitis</strong>’s <em>Beyond the Door</em> mashes up two of the finest horror films in such a way that it would almost become an incoherent mess if it wasn’t held together by Juliet Mills’ committed performance as a pregnant woman possessed by the spawn of Satan growing in her belly.</p>\n<p>The film veered so close to William Friedkin’s classic that Warner Brothers actually sued the producers of <em>Beyond the Door</em>, who eventually settled five years later. I’d like to believe that Assonitis was successful in mitigating the illegality of his movie by pointing out that the film is brazenly a parody of <em>The Exorcist</em>, featuring a twelve-year-old girl who doesn’t need Satan’s help to have the mouth of a sailor and her little brother who has a heavy addiction to slurping Campbell’s Pea Soup like it was a Coca-Cola.</p>\n<p>Nothing can accurately describe how fucking crazy this film is, but if you want a kaleidoscopic trip into the world of 1970s Italian knock-offs, then <em>Beyond the Door</em> is required viewing.

Eraserhead (1977)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357868\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eraserhead-1.jpg\" alt=\"Eraserhead\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eraserhead-1.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eraserhead-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eraserhead-1-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eraserhead-1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The pregnancy plot in David Lynch’s experimental debut feature would almost be absurdly funny if it wasn’t also a source of tremendous existential dread. In the film, a man named Henry (Jack Nance) has an unusual dinner with his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart), which ends with the revelation that Mary had a child&#8230; or&#8230; something child-like. This is unusual for many reasons, one of them being that traditional pregnancy was never mentioned, with a surreal and cosmic opening scene standing in for conception.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the couple moves in together to take care of the deformed being, which looks nothing like a human but a bit like an unformed alien fetus swaddled in bandages. At first, this all seems like a strange and detached artistic exercise on Lynch’s part, but when things begin to go grotesquely wrong with the creature, <em>Eraserhead</em> invokes a sense of inexplicable parental protectiveness mingled with disgust. Though pregnancy itself isn’t examined closely, <em>Eraserhead</em> is a fever dream that&#8217;s overwhelmed by palpable anxiety around the topic of accidental parenthood.

The Seventh Sign (1988)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-357869 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Seventh-Sign.jpg\" alt=\"The Seventh Sign horror movie pregnancy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Seventh-Sign.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Seventh-Sign-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Seventh-Sign-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Seventh-Sign-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>If you make a face at any film&#8217;s inclusion on this list it will probably be this underappreciated tale of horror on a biblically apocalyptic level. I&#8217;ve been a fan since its release in the late 80s, and while it&#8217;s never quite found the reappraisal it deserves &#8212; either from audiences or critics &#8212; it delivers when it comes to featuring a harrowing pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Demi Moore plays Abby, a young pregnant woman whose cynical view on life is shaken by a confluence of events including the arrival of a man (Jürgen Prochnow) who just might be Jesus Christ. Disasters, both natural and supernaturally ordained, ravage the planet and an undeserving human species, and only Abby holds the key to our salvation. It&#8217;s an appealingly emotional sentiment confirming that only we can save ourselves&#8230; from ourselves. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>6. The House of the Devil (2009)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357870\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-of-the-Devil.jpg\" alt=\"House Of The Devil\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-of-the-Devil.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-of-the-Devil-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-of-the-Devil-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-of-the-Devil-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ti West</strong>’s atmospheric, slow-burn chamber piece about a babysitter in the ‘80s doesn’t advertise itself as pregnancy horror, but the all-in third act takes it to some unexpected places with a final stop at motherhood. <em>The House of the Devil</em> follows Samantha (Jocelin Donahue), a college student who takes a babysitting job in a creepy mansion to make ends meet. By the end of the night, Sam has become pregnant by way of a forced cult ritual.</p>\n<p>On one level, West’s movie is a stylish, deftly-made throwback that offers homage to several genre classics. On another, it’s a harrowing film about a trusting young woman who’s manipulated into increasingly uncomfortable situations, culminating in an unwanted pregnancy. <em>The House of The Devil</em> might not be that deep on purpose, but by treading the hallowed ground of <em>Rosemary’s Baby,</em> it highlights horror’s long legacy of provocative takes on reproductive narratives.

In this entry, we look at what went down in The Mandalorian Chapter 9 — the first episode of Season 2 — and explain how its shocker ending compares to the original premiere reveal. Yes, there be spoilers here.</em></p> \n<hr /> \n<p>The task of topping <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong>‘s first season premiere surprise is difficult, if not impossible, but the Season 2 debut does its darndest and will surely ignite the enthusiasm of certain desperate fandom offshoots. The final shot re-introduces the most iconic character of the <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong> franchise who really never did much of anything. Is that as revelatory as a force-wielding cutie-pie Baby Yoda, or whatever their name is? Uh, let’s hold that thought for a second.</p> \n<p>Entitled “The Marshall,” <em>The Mandalorian </em>Chapter 9 begins relatively where the first season dumped our characters. Mando, or Din Djarin (<strong>Pedro Pascal</strong>), seeks answers regarding the Baby’s origins. The universe is an infinite landscape. He can’t simply start knocking on houses. He needs a game plan.</p> \n<p>As explained by The Armorer (<strong>Emily Swallow</strong>), the little creature displays gifts similar to those once honed by the Jedi Order. She knows not where Mando might find them, so he sets off to find other Mandalorians who might have a clue or two. After some aggressive negotiations with a one-eyed mob boss named Gor Koresh (<strong>John Leguizamo</strong>), Mando learns of a Mandalorian who calls Tatooine his home.</p> \n<p>We will never be rid of the desert planet. It may orbit the Outer Rim, described as the galaxy’s armpit, but movie after movie, episode after episode, we return to Tatooine. Be it by fate, nostalgia, or branding, there is no escaping <em>Star Wars’&nbsp;</em>first planetary environment.</p> \n<p>Chapter 9 is <em>The Mandalorian</em>‘s second visit to the backwater hive of scum and villainy. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/mandalorian-explained-chapter-five/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The show last skulked these sandy streets in Chapter 5</a>. At the end of that episode, we saw and heard a pair of jangly boots stroll upon the corpse of Fennec Shand&nbsp;and considered the possibility of Boba Fett’s return.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-mandalorian-explained-timothy-olyphant-boba-fett/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As speculated sometime later</a>, the spurs don’t belong to Kenner’s most popular action figure, but to those of Cobb Vanth (<strong>Timothy Olyphant</strong>). The character strolls right out of author Chuck Wendig’s <em>Aftermath</em> novels, written to bridge the gap between <em>Return of the Jedi</em> and <em>The Force Awakens</em>. In those books, we learn that Vanth was a former slave who rose to the rank of Mos Pelgo marshall after he liberated Boba Fett’s armor from a band of Jawas.</p> \n<p>The name Boba Fett never comes up in <em>Aftermath</em>, nor is it ever uttered in <em>The Mandalorian </em>Chapter 9. However, there is no mistaking the armor we see in this episode. The color, the blaster scoring, the forehead dent — these details are tattooed on every collector’s psyche.</p> \n<p>The story Vanth tells Mando of how he acquired the armor from the Jawas differs slightly from Wendig’s depiction. There’s no mention of Lorgan Movellan, the Red Key Raider whom Vanth gunned down while procuring the suit, or the fact that Vanth already negotiated with the Tusken Raiders to act as bodyguards against any Red Key goon seeking retaliation. Either Vanth wants to keep a few sins to himself, or these Expanded Universe (EU) novels are exactly what we’ve always known them to be: mere test runs for the authentic adventures of the live-action entertainment.</p> \n<p>Honestly, it doesn’t matter.</p> \n<p>Mando does not care how Vanth got the Mandalorian armor. He just wants it back. The two characters nearly draw on each other upon meeting, but their duel is interrupted when a gargantuan Krayt sand dragon rips down Mos Pelgo’s main street. We’ve never seen one of these beasties on screen before, but in <em>A New Hope</em>, Obi-Wan Kenobi did imitate its cacophonous roar to scare off the Tusken Raiders from making a meal out of Luke Skywalker’s body. At least, that’s what the EU would have you believe.</p> \n<p>Every frame of <em>The Mandalorian</em> is creator <strong>Jon Favreau</strong> validating his childhood action figure collection. The Tusken Raiders may have only nabbed a few moments of screentime in the original films, but Favreau, and many of those watching, built massive Tolkienian epics around those characters through their toy collections. <em>The Mandalorian</em> is his chance to realize those molded plastic fantasies.</p> \n<p>This effect occurred nowhere more powerfully than around Boba Fett. The <a href=\"https://www.bobafettfanclub.com/fettpedia/joe-johnston/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Joe Johnston</strong> design</a>, a sci-fi fetishization of The Man With No Name, tingled all the right parts of our brain. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Holiday_Special\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em></a>, we were already in love with the character before he ever shimmied into <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>. <strong>George Lucas</strong> barely gave us scraps when it came to Fett’s narrative, but EU writers would happily dump bounty hunter backstory whenever allowed.</p> \n<p>Then, Han Solo blindly bumped into Fett during the first few minutes of <em>Return of the Jedi</em> and sent our beloved galactic gunslinger into the belly of the Sarlacc Pit. Our most precious action figure left this universe like a chump. The sequence stung, and over the years, more and more EU writers attempted to bring new life to Boba Fett.</p> \n<p>Mando is another extension of that fannish desire. He’s the badass we always wanted Boba Fett to be. Over the course of the first season, whatever sore feelings still lingered as a result of <em>Return of the Jedi</em> faded. Fett, we don’t need you. We finally got The Mandalorian we always wanted.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358943\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Chapter 9 Season 2\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>Timothy Olyphant playing cowboy inside Boba Fett’s armor is all of us. We want to be cool. We want to give respect back to the dope who practically tripped into a monster’s mouth. We’re never gonna achieve this dream, though. It’s best to give up the armor and let Mando do something respectable with it.</p> \n<p>And that’s exactly what Cobb Vanth does. After Mando brings the Tusken Raiders and the people of Mos Pelgo together, and they successfully slay the Krayt dragon, Vanth relinquishes Fett’s clothing. Mando and the Child return to their Razor Crest and happily put Tatooine in their rearview.</p> \n<p>We’re free of Boba Fett! He’s dead and digested. His armor is back with the people whom his father Jango Fett clearly idolized.</p> \n<p>Oh wait, there’s that final shot. We’re not yet in the clear. As the Razor Crest zooms skyward and Tatooine’s twin suns set in the distance, we catch a silhouette in the foreground.</p> \n<p>A bald man with a Tusken Raider blaster rifle and gaffi stick slung over his back watches from a hilltop. How much of the Krayt conflict did he see? Did he get a good look at the two men in Mandalorian armor? Who cares? Oh, just everyone watching this program.</p> \n<p>The man turns, and we see the face <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">of </span><strong style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">Temuera Morrison</strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">. It’s the face of Jango Fett and every clone soldier who marched to the beat of the crumbling Republic’s drum. As a clone child of Jango, Boba Fett would sport the same face. So, yes, indeed, Boba Fett lives.</span></p> \n<p>We don’t know how, but at some point, Boba Fett dug his way out of the Sarlacc. He either sold his armor to the Jawas, or they picked up the parts after he cast them off. Having faced such a pathetic end, it appears the bounty hunter chose a life of exile as a Tatooine hermit. Hey, what worked for Obi-Wan Kenobi should work for him.</p> \n<p>Boba Fett was never a Mandalorian. He wore the armor cuz his dad wore the armor. Who knows what emotions seeing a real-deal Mandalorian square off against a Krayt dragon will spark in Fett? What’s for certain is that this will not be the last time we see the character this season.</p> \n<p>Favreau seems determined to bring respect back to Boba Fett. He wants to redeem that toy he clutched so tightly in his kiddie fist so many moons ago. Wish him luck. <em>The Mandalorian</em> had already cured me of such a desire, and it’s a little concerning to see Favreau drudge up these old fanboy feelings. Please, don’t hurt me again.</p> \n<p>The reveal of Boba Fett is not as catastrophic to the <em>Star Wars</em> universe as Baby Yoda’s first appearance. It’s more of a step backward than a game-changer, a secondary mystery to occupy our minds while the series delays its answers regarding the Child’s origins. The fact that Morrison takes the same spot Baby Yoda did in the first season’s premiere suggests a level of import that may not be.</p> \n<p>Baby Yoda directed where the second episode of the first season would go next. Boba Fett has zero impact on the plot of next week’s episode. <em>The Mandalorian </em>Chapter 9 behaves as its number suggests; one more episode in a much longer story.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/3XUC1jGIHKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 16:30:19 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9.jpg","linkMd5":"3d63a2849df1f99314bb933ae13ee395","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-14-255_554afa1f335f0059.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":143819,"destBytes":35846,"author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Mandalorian-Explained-Chapter-9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-14-255_554afa1f335f0059.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/3XUC1jGIHKE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-15-676_331bdfdad268965b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129173985},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","title":"The Deadly Do-Overs of Horror’s Staple Slashers","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358824","description":"<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcome to Carnage Classified, a monthly column where we break down the historical and social influence of all things horror, then rank the films of each month’s category accordingly. Franchises, movements, filmmakers, sub-genres, etc&#8230;It’s all here! This entry is about slasher remakes. Let’s get to the breakdown. </span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For horror fans, October is the best time of the year. We overindulge in our already indulgent horror movie watchlists. We add new flicks to the lineup, searching for new scares while reminiscing in old favorites. Somewhere on that recycled film list, there’s a group of names that are destined to make an appearance at least once: <strong>Leatherface</strong>, <strong>Michael</strong>, <strong>Jason</strong>, <strong>Freddy</strong>, <strong>Chucky</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly ties the horror fandom’s cult love for these films together aside from their habitation in, or proximity to, the golden age of slashers. While this era is technically bound within the years of 1978 (enter: <strong><em>Halloween</em></strong>) and 1984 (hello, <strong><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em></strong>), I find it equally important to look at the films that preceded and succeeded it. Every slasher we encounter is, even perhaps subconsciously, based on the icons previously mentioned, even though Chucky and Leatherface are excluded by these parameters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what is it about these slashers that lets them live rent-free in our minds decades after release? The plots themselves are all formulaic, but the killers are special. In slasher films, the genre is synonymous with the figurehead, not the plot — it’s the killers we root for. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like so many other horror films, these slashers aren’t victim-focused. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we spend more time with those characters who succumb to their slaughter, we’re far more interested in the person wielding the weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The killers don’t have a personal motive to victimize certain characters in particular — it’s simply misplaced anger, selfishness, latent repressed sexuality, or downright bloodthirst — and we’re along for the ride. We’re drawn to either end of the spectrum: relentless personality from Freddy and Chucky or unwavering coldness from Jason, Michael, and Leatherface. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thematically, this pinnacle era of slashers centered on teenagers, allowing the target audience to see themselves in the films. Yet the lack of adherence to logic and heightened suspension of disbelief permits enough separation from reality to make these films fun, not existential. This focus on youth allowed the plot’s set up to focus on what teens seem to love the most: sex and violence! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The youth-centricity of the 1970s and 1980s is clearly what defined the horror filmmaking of the era, but why did these classics later get remade? Save for <em><strong>Child’s Play</strong></em>, each of these franchises had concluded by the late 1990s or early 2000s. History tells us that nostalgia creeps around about every twenty years. When the 2000s hit, even with a vastly different culture and fashion, we had our eyes looking back to the &#8217;80s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite how visibly different the 2000s seem to be, they were equally youth-centric: think about any hit television show, like <em>My Super Sweet 16</em> or <em>The Hills</em>. Teens loved watching other teens live their dramatic lives, so why not also watch them lose those lives at the hands of brutal masked men? Of course, there was also the revival of teen horror spawned by 1996&#8217;s <strong><em>Scream</em></strong> that contributed to slasher nostalgia and prepped the stage for new additions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slasher films set themselves up for immortality because the killers don’t seem to die, and the victims can’t seem to escape. Given all these factors, it’s no surprise that we saw these iconic films rebooted in the 2000s and on. But can they stand on their own merit, or are they irredeemably subservient to their parent films?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week we’re looking at the following remakes: <strong><em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em></strong> (2003), <strong><em>Halloween</em></strong> (2007), <strong><em>Friday the 13th</em> </strong>(2009), <strong><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> </strong>(2010), and <strong><em>Child’s Play</em></strong> (2019). </span></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Onto the ranks!</h4>\n<p><em>You are hereby warned that the following may include <strong>spoilers</strong> and discussions of films that include mature content, including sexual assault, abuse, and suicide.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>5. Halloween (2007)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358826\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael.jpg\" alt=\"Halloween Young Michael\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Rob Zombie</strong>’s <em>Halloween</em> is promising in its narrative spin. However, it ends up unspooling its potential as soon as we get settled. Uniquely, it puts more focus on Michael Myers as a child, aiming to give context, reason, and background to one of slasher history’s most arcane figures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We spend nearly forty minutes watching Michael’s childhood play out: his unstable home life, his torment at school, and his own psychopathic tendencies. He is coddled by Dr. Loomis, his mother, and even the janitor at the institution. His obsession with masks is labeled as a desire to hide within, and from, himself. He is concretely humanized. We’re fed loads of emotional capital, so when Michael kills as an adult (Tyler Mane), the film posits it as chapters in his psychological survey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sensationalism is equally integral to the plot. It runs consistently parallel to the brutal murders: newsreels, documentary-style coverage of Michael, best-selling books, and dramatic seminars. Michael has editorialized: everyone wants a piece of his mind, even when it&#8217;s for sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s most horrific aspect, however, isn’t the reign of Michael Myers. It’s the copious amounts of misogynistic content that swarms the screen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slashers have always combined sex with violence, hence the whole “virgins always live” trope. The 2007 <em>Halloween</em> takes this to frustrating extents. With a completely unnecessary and graphic rape scene, prolonged, torturous deaths for female characters, and a heightened focus on full or partial nudity, the objectifying sexual violence is at a nauseating peak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The boldly stylized atmosphere of Zombie’s remake contains clever use of soundtrack with the iconic score, boosted brutality, and added characterization to slasher history’s (arguably) most famous icon. Where Michael was a mystery, he’s now been wholly unmasked (symbolically of course). I prefer the enigma. The transparency of every single character actually ends up making them far less interesting, the archetypal acting is a bother, and the misogyny surely doesn’t help <em>Halloween</em>’s case either.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>4. Friday the 13th (2009)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358827\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jason-voorhees-and-clay-fighting.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Voorhees And Clay Fighting\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jason-voorhees-and-clay-fighting.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jason-voorhees-and-clay-fighting-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jason-voorhees-and-clay-fighting-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jason-voorhees-and-clay-fighting-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <em>Friday the 13th</em> franchise has always delivered on the kills: they’re typically what makes these films. This franchise has never been my favorite of the classic slashers (it&#8217;s my least favorite, actually), mostly because I’ve never had any interest in Jason Voorhees. Where the 2010 <em>Friday the 13th</em> flexes is, expectantly, on the kills, but also in crafting a more compelling version of Jason than I’ve ever seen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The franchise is formulaic: enter teens, enter Jason, enter savage slayings. This film plays with that expectation, opening up with a first act that does exactly that&#8230; to completion. When we realize that this group of teens is being picked off way too quickly for the film to last its run time, we discover that this series of murders is only a set up to the actual story. It’s a clever way to poke fun at expectation, by delivering precisely what we’ve come to know, then subverting it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The true narrative is that Clay (Jared Padalecki) encounters a group of teens, and eventually Jason, in the Crystal Lake area while searching for his missing sister, Whitney (Amanda Righetti). Whitney was a survivor of that first act fake-out and is being held hostage by Jason because she resembles a younger version of his mother. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This dynamic is interesting because it emotionally pits the protagonist and the antagonist against each other. Both men are clinging to the memory and a hope for a loved family member, and neither is willing to let go. This tug-of-war also draws us into Whitney herself, as regardless of who her protector is  &#8212; Jason can feasibly be called a protector because he does not harm her, and he is protecting the image of her &#8212; she is cherished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an emotional winner-take-all mentality of this film, as every character on every side of this main conflict is deeply embedded in the heart of the narrative. Despite the underlying sentimentality, we aren’t feeling sappy for long because the gore in this movie still kicks ass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I said I’ve never been a fan of Jason, I gotta respect this man on his brawn alone. There were some really creative kills and “Jesus Christ!” moments, which is all you can ask for from a good slasher. The sentimentality of <em>Friday the 13th</em> is supplemental, but it’s what makes us care.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>3. Child&#8217;s Play (2019)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358828 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chucky-with-knife.jpg\" alt=\"Chucky With Knife slasher remakes\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chucky-with-knife.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chucky-with-knife-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chucky-with-knife-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chucky-with-knife-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this movie finds itself in the middle of this ranking, I don’t like it. I do, however, respect it. This remake is a reimagining of my favorite franchise from this list, and it completely disposes of everything that made Chucky&#8230; Chucky. There’s no real person, no humor, and no motive, just a red-headed doll in a familiar striped shirt and overalls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worth an accolade is how Chucky was reimagined to be relevant to the era we live in. The 2019 <em>Child’s Play</em> revives the franchise with a capitalist spin as AI technology becomes more popular in our day-to-day lives. Chucky’s new origin story is that a disgruntled factory employee disables all of the toy&#8217;s safety protocols after being fired for daydreaming. It almost feels like a political statement of proletariat revolt from the working hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Google’s Home and Amazon’s Alexa, Chucky is a hyperbolized version of the systems that we purchase to take some of our agency away: to complete tasks we could easily do ourselves. The value is in presenting the dangers of technological reliance and shows how shakily we straddle the line between control we give up and control we lose by consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Chucky was rigged from the start, <em>Child’s Play</em> makes a few suggestions that his murder spree is partially learned behavior, like when he mimics Andy stabbing the knife into a cutting board. Eerily, this calls upon the whole foundation of what constitutes AI: the ability to learn and then do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final set piece of the film combines technological fear with the film’s underlying capitalist themes. The toy store is transformed into a horror landscape, with a glitchy rendition of the Buddi commercial kicking it all off. Chucky uses Cloud-control to make use of the other toys as weapons and lower the store’s steel gates, both a literal and symbolic way of trapping people within a consumerist cage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Child&#8217;s Play</em> closes with Kaslan, the toy company, denying any culpability in Chucky’s terrorism, and we simultaneously see a new Buddi doll being stocked on a shelf. This blunt reminder solidifies the reason for the film’s new focus: the dangers of consumerism and the lack of corporate responsibility that drives it.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>2. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358830\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leatherface-wielding-chainsaw.jpg\" alt=\"Leatherface Wielding Chainsaw\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leatherface-wielding-chainsaw.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leatherface-wielding-chainsaw-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leatherface-wielding-chainsaw-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leatherface-wielding-chainsaw-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is first and foremost a slasher film. But, it’s deeply ingrained in the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/folk-horror-films/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">folk horror subgenre</a>, as well. Where the original film clothed its rural visuals in grainy ultra-warmth, the 2003 version of <em>The</em> </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is cold. This coldness isn’t detached, though; it&#8217;s thoroughly involved. The look of the film’s sequestered small town is dingy and disgusting as all hell, but the cinematography (by the original’s director of photography, Daniel Pearl) is beautiful and incredibly striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rendering of the Texas town is essential to establishing its horror. Wide observant shots of the landscapes and mills that comprise it set us into this piercing feeling of abandonment. It makes us curious as to how any sort of society functions here. The color palette is industrial, the texture is finger-prickling, and everything feels decrepit and musty. In all its grime, the film is flooded with contrasty tangibility. It&#8217;s simply, utterly gross.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the group finds themselves locked in the vise of bloodshed, there’s nowhere to escape. The sheriff is seemingly incompetent &#8212; until we find out that he’s a member of the Hewitt clan. There’s a civilian-authority mistrust that is fostered by the town’s disconnect. Tiny rural USA allows for self-governance to a shocking extent, and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas Chainsaw Massacre </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remake instills it to a deranged level. As the group cries to him about their friend&#8217;s murder, his attention is exclusive to the roach in their ashtray. It’d be hilarious if it wasn’t so horrifying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s tension is atmospherically sunken and inescapable. The characters’ fight-or-flight impulses seem hapless: fleeing never feels like an option. Everyone seems to be in on the carnage, and their status as by-chance interlopers in this community doesn’t have an exit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where the original film feels overtly goofy (namely, “The Hitchhiker” character drives me insane), the remake </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">balances subtle, brewing evil with burgeoning brutality. The character relationships are more developed and the horror feels more helpless, so the film’s capital of carnage — helmed by stunning visuals — feels more impactful.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>1. A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358829 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freddy-krueger-glove-in-bathtub.jpg\" alt=\"Freddy Krueger Glove In Bathtub slasher remakes\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freddy-krueger-glove-in-bathtub.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freddy-krueger-glove-in-bathtub-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freddy-krueger-glove-in-bathtub-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freddy-krueger-glove-in-bathtub-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trauma is a heavy hitter&#8230; obviously. It’s not easy to portray with nuance, especially within a slasher film. However, the remake of <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> does it well, fully committing to it in a way that the original does not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refresher: in the original, Freddy is retaliating against the parents by harming their children. In this film, the teens themselves suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Freddy (Jackie Earle Haley), and now he is targeting them for speaking up. This darker spin on the narrative allows for not just more thematic exploration, but a deeper, more inset horror.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teens’ repressed memories of their trauma bring a more visceral quality to the significance of their dreams. Dean’s (Kellan Lutz) nightmares don’t begin until he starts going to therapy. For everyone else, the curtain is slowly peeled back through the landscape of their dreams. Dreams are the spaces where our subconscious runs wild, and it’s where each of the characters begins to unravel and discover the buried story of Freddy Kreuger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even as they verbally deny the validity of their nightmares, they emotionally know them to be true. It becomes harder for them to keep the memories at bay. It’s haunting. Dean’s death scene is witnessed from a point-of-view outside of his dream. Where the original film portrayed the carnage manifesting from a phantom presence, this film shows Dean seemingly fighting against himself. With a knife in hand, he eventually succumbs and appears to kill himself. Bringing suicide to the table, the film is cataclysmically grounded by portraying the gruesomely real stakes at hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In opposition to the original, Freddy’s character has more direct interaction with the teens. He taunts them not simply with the threat of death, but with his own grip on their psyche, stating, “Your memories are what fuel me.” Freddy is no longer a simple supernatural villain but an embodiment of trauma. This makes the deaths more tragic, the horror more piercing, and the overall film more harrowing than its source material. The 2010 version of <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> isn’t just about constructing traps to cleverly beat the threat of nightmares but also diving deep into yourself to uncover and overcome your trauma. </span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remaking horror films, especially the cherished ones, is a tough sell to fanatics. The question is always “why, though?” Whether it’s a remake, a reboot, a reimaging, etc., it’s usually never needed. These new iterations can be only stylistically different from the originals or contribute new thematic content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes they’re overwhelmingly abhorred (Gus Van Sant’s <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/psycho-franchise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Psycho</em></a></strong>, anyone?) or widely well regarded (like 2013’s spectacular remake, <strong><em>Evil Dead</em></strong>). There are no true criteria for what works and what doesn’t; sometimes modernity just doesn’t work for these narratives. In the case of horror’s iconic quintet of slashing savages, whether you like the new editions or not, pitting the vulnerable and blameless against unforgiving evil is quite a timeless plight.</span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/5QL0beXJogE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 11:16:49 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael.jpg","linkMd5":"4a3fc9b206552729529df37e2c19ac00","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-14-138_618bb1146f00ea00.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":35845,"destBytes":22624,"author":"Peyton Robinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloween-young-michael.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-14-138_618bb1146f00ea00.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jason-voorhees-and-clay-fighting.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn76@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-15-853_fd24d04603bfdf9f.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chucky-with-knife.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-15-824_267dd2c9a338af52.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leatherface-wielding-chainsaw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn1@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-15-811_b2cfa5b391da4c57.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freddy-krueger-glove-in-bathtub.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-15-770_d290029ef5fe8c67.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/5QL0beXJogE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn36@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-34-331_0a8bc543c6fd56a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129173990},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","title":"10 Best Original Horror Scores","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=356822","description":"<p><em>October is defined in Webster’s Dictionary as “31 days of horror.” Don’t bother looking it up; it’s true. Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article about the best original horror scores is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Look, I appreciate a severed limb as much as the next girl, but when it comes to horror films, what really gets me in the mood is a t m o s p h e r e. And one of the main ingredients in a film&#8217;s atmosphere is its soundtrack. I guarantee it: if you swap out any given original horror score out for, oh I don’t know, the smash hit “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” you’re going to have a hard time getting in a spooky mood. While silence certainly has its place, original horror scores play a big part in why the genre gets under our skin the way it does. OSTs give voice to the subconscious terror rhythms of the genre: to the implacable sensations of mounting dread, suspicion, anxiety, and repulsion. Without them, horror just wouldn’t be as horrific.</p>\n<p>In celebration of all the marvelous original horror scores that keep us up at night, we put our ears together and came up with a definitive ranking of the top ten original horror scores of all time. Keep reading for a look at the top ten original horror scores as voted on by <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/coffel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Coffel</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacob Trussell</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a>, and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">myself</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>10. Jaws (1975) by John Williams</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Jaws (Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1QeYHaWTTPvgu2wqKCPlUc?si=T47gl9d_RA6--Zvu-DIBGw\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>John Williams</strong>&#8216; indelible <em>Jaws</em> score is a beloved part of soundtrack history for a reason. The Academy Award-winning original soundtrack pulls off an aural miracle by using just two musical notes to manufacture much of its off-the-charts suspense. Williams has called the score “instinctual, relentless, [and] unstoppable,” and it’s true that the sound itself, as much as the images on-screen, helped form our collective cultural image of sharks as deadly predators.</p>\n<p>Aside from the famous duh-duh, duh-duh’s of the main theme, the <em>Jaws</em> soundtrack also includes ten other tracks by Williams, including several that convey curiosity and adventure, calling to mind the composer’s work for <em>Jurassic Park,</em> <em>Indiana Jones</em>, and other action-packed films. (Valerie Ettenhofer)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">9. It Follows (2014) by Disasterpeace</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: It Follows (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5df4xBKQQdA8oAfbFmc3Vu?si=BJoxFQogQSiDpyqrlVw4_g\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Trying to hum along to <strong>Disasterpeace</strong>’s score for <em>It Follows</em> is like trying to sing-along to a dubstep song; ultimately, you’ll sound like an amalgamation of power tools and air raid sirens. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The alter ego of <strong>Richard Vreeland</strong>, Disasterpeace mixes strange nondiegetic noises into a brooding synth beat that sways back and forth between melodic and ominous to strike a perfectly suited tone for a movie about desperate teens trying to save themselves.</p>\n<p>The score in a way becomes a metaphor for the messy emotions of adolescence, a theme primary to the film. The music sounds incohesive, scattered even, but it’s a controlled chaos that is just constantly on the edge of spinning out like in the track “Old Maid.&#8221; Throughout this discordant soundscape, there are beautiful sections like “Jay” that get towards the innocence of youth, evoking the mood of a strange summer morning. The unparalleled score to <em>It Follows</em> literally pulsates with intensity, accomplishing something so few soundtracks do: actually scare us. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">8. Mandy (2018) by Jóhann Jóhannsson</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Mandy (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/60f6ypxsKLEemkp4216Ood?si=txNYCwK5TeK0AtiFue2Cmw\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Composer <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/remembering-johann-johannsson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Jóhann Jóhannsson</strong></a> turned in the <em>Mandy</em> OST one month before his death, which makes listening to it quite a sad experience. Especially considering that some of the compositions are quite downbeat, atmospheric, and sad. At other points, it’s strangely uplifting. Here, Jóhannsson&#8217;s ethereal soundscapes are complemented with a doom metal sheen that will make you throw up the horns and drink vodka in a toilet.</p>\n<p>“Children of the New Dawn” is the standout track; it’s a post-metal masterpiece that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Cult of Luna album. But it also makes you wonder why more filmmakers don’t turn to post-metal to add some oomph to their movies. “Chainsaw Fight,” on the other hand, is the musical equivalent of tearing your own hair out and throwing it down a sink. I mean that as a compliment. (Kieran Fisher).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">7. Psycho (1960) by Bernard Herrmann</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Psycho (Original Soundtrack Theme)\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7o37z78whARND3EwVjIYpO?si=k4NahLdqST-A_hoc-kIbiw\"></iframe></p>\n<p>There is perhaps no sound more formative and imitated in horror film music than the screeching alien strings of <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/bernard-herrmanns-remarkable-unnerving-gift-to-cinema/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Bernard Herrmann</strong></a>. While the majority of <em>Psycho</em>’s soundtrack is melancholic and calm (dare I say soothing), the tension eventually escalates to a piercing (haha) staccato. A sinister score for a sinister film, Hermann deftly wields his breadth of experience to make his limited string orchestra sound agitated, ugly, and violent. Mission accomplished, I’d say.</p>\n<p>Supposedly, even Alfred Hitchcock himself is said to have conceded that “33% of the effect of <em>Psycho</em> was due to the music.” A bold concession from the man who originally wanted his Freudian slasher to be set to jazz (no, really). Maybe Hermann is the real “Master of Suspense” in this seven-picture partnership. Oh, and look, <em>Re-Animator</em> fans, you didn’t make the list but if you just imagine there’s a kick drum during <em>Psycho’</em>s prelude, it’s quite literally the same thing. (Meg Shields)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">6. Suspiria (1977) by Goblin</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Suspiria (40th Anniversary) [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0yvW9oE4d270lA5paJ1umZ?si=UnZeKEE_SN2WatYVpbFRUw\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Few director-composer combos are able to match that of Dario Argento and progressive rockers <strong>Goblin</strong>. Their most famous collaboration came in 1977 with the release of Argento&#8217;s landmark <em>Suspiria</em>. It&#8217;s impossible to see a single shot from the film without the main theme kicking off in your head. Even those sad souls who have neglected to watch <em>Suspiria</em> are likely to be familiar with it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a staple at horror events everywhere, with my local cinema, The Hollywood Theatre, playing it before nearly every movie. The song even made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pitchfork_500\">The Pitchfork 500</a> and has been sampled by various artists and repurposed for other films. Goblin&#8217;s own Claudio Simonetti has dubbed the soundtrack as the band&#8217;s masterpiece and it&#8217;s not uncommon to catch him on the road (in pre-COVID times) with the most current incarnation of Goblin playing it in its entirety.

Released in 1987, the film marks the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/horror-director-debuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">directorial debut</a> of macabre renaissance man <strong>Clive Barker</strong>, whose dissatisfaction with prior cinematic adaptations of his work pushed him to finally take the reins himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <em>Hellraiser</em> begins, meek but loving Larry (Andrew Robinson) is moving his family into the derelict house of his brother Frank (Sean Chapman). The move, Larry hopes, will act as a fresh start. A new beginning, and maybe even an opportunity to re-light the spark with his cold, unloving wife, Julia (Clare Higgins). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frank, you see, is missing. Torn to shreds, quite literally, in his hedonistic quest to experience the full spectrum of pain and pleasure. As far as Larry is concerned, Frank&#8217;s mysterious disappearance is par for the course. But Frank&#8217;s absence haunts Julia. For this is, in fact, a tragic love triangle: a familial struggle between a pervert, his lover, and her husband. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lurching into memories of her affair with Frank, Julia&#8217;s longing for her lost passion inevitably releases something nasty. While she reminisces vividly, Larry slices his hand open on a stray nail. Dizzy at the sight of blood, Larry finds his wife, lost in thought, in the attic. In the very room where Frank unlocked the occult puzzle box that tore his soul (and his body) apart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Larry leaks profusely onto the floor, a disgruntled Julia accompanies her pitiful husband downstairs. And so, the couple inadvertently perform a sacrifice. Part blood, part divination: flesh to flesh, as it were. Something dormant awakens beneath the floorboards: something fleshy, stubborn, and determined to live again. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut.png\" alt=\"Hellraiser Larry Hand Cut\" data-id=\"358896\" data-full-url=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut.png\" data-link=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?attachment_id=358896\" class=\"wp-image-358896\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut.png 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut-768x576.png 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut-160x120.png 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut-320x240.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel.png\" alt=\"Hellraiser Frank Ressurection Brain Methycel\" data-id=\"358897\" data-full-url=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel.png\" data-link=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?attachment_id=358897\" class=\"wp-image-358897\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel.png 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel-768x576.png 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel-160x120.png 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel-320x240.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></li></ul><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption\">How it started // How it&#8217;s going</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christopher Young</strong>&#8216;s excellent, sadistic score kicks into high gear. And steadily, painfully, Frank pulls himself back together again. Liquid willfully materializes. A slimy spinal column reattaches to the base of a reconstituted brain. Veins and nerves form out of thick, cloudy puddles. Eyes push out and sockets snap open. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just one of the best special makeup effects in the film. This is one of the most memorable effects sequences in &#8217;80s horror, period. Iconic cenobites notwithstanding, this is <em>Hellraiser</em>&#8216;s greatest visual achievement: a startling transformation in which the germ of a man rips himself out of one world and back into ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-d-they-do-that\">How’d they do that?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-long-story-short\">Long story short:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With a false floor, lubed-up puppets, and reverse-photography of melting wax. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-long-story-long\">Long story long:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The great <strong>Bob Keen </strong>designed the special makeup effects for <em>Hellraiser</em>.<strong> </strong>While only in his mid-twenties, Keen had amassed an impressive list of credits that included the likes of the original <em>Star Wars </em>trilogy, multiple Jim Henson films, and a handful of projects under his mentor Nick Maley. It was through Maley (or rather, through Maley getting sick) that Keen was tasked with designing the makeup effects for <em>Highlander</em>, which put Keen on the radar of <em>Hellraiser</em> producer Christopher Figg. <em>Hellraiser </em>would be the first feature film of the upstart SFX studio <strong>Image Animation, </strong>which Keen co-founded with<em> Hellraiser</em>&#8216;s workshop supervisor, <strong>Geoff Portass</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Portass in the impressively long making-of documentary<em> <strong>Leviathan: The Story of Hellraiser and Hellbound: Hellraiser II</strong></em>, the &#8220;birth of Frank&#8221; sequence as we know it almost didn&#8217;t happen. The initial approach of the financiers was to treat the project like a cult object. One that, on the strength of Barker&#8217;s literary reputation, would prove a safe investment. However, after the backers obtained a post-production cut of the movie, they liked what they saw. And so they smartly threw more money at the film. Ultimately, a good chunk of that money went into the &#8220;birth of Frank&#8221; sequence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That original cut of the film went something like this: clumsy Larry slices his hand open, the camera cuts away, and <em>bam</em>: Julia finds skinless Frank in the attic. This extra dough allowed Keen and a small team to bring to life the nasty shit that took place during that cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-blood.gif\" alt=\"blood\" class=\"wp-image-358894\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-blood.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-blood-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the script, as written, the idea was that Frank, or what was left of Frank, had been splattered all over the walls and dried up over time. As scripted, the husk of Frank was supposed to materialize out of a wall and start talking. The original plan was to accomplish this with animatronics. The team even built a cable-controlled lip-synching puppet. However, according to makeup crew member <strong>Cliff Wallace</strong>, the puppet proved &#8220;too complicated for its own good.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instinctually, Keen knew something was missing from the birth sequence. Over the course of principal photography, &#8220;the film had become something else.&#8221; And the dry birth, as scripted, just &#8220;wasn&#8217;t visceral&#8221; enough. As a result, the team scrapped the idea of dusty Frank in favor of a&#8230; wetter approach. One that, according to Barker, Keen had conceptually wanted to do for a very long time: a living corpse reconstituting itself from the ground up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I found it interesting to start with the bare bones and work up to something quite skinny but definitely alive,&#8221; recalls Keen in <em>Fangoria </em>#66. &#8220;A total reversal to the usual effect where you&#8217;re making someone decompose.&#8221; (Speaking of &#8220;quite skinny but definitely alive,&#8221; wispy actor Oliver Smith was the one who embodied &#8220;Frank the Monster.&#8221;)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realized birthing sequence is an entirely in-camera effect, shot on a stage in South London well after principal photography had wrapped. The re-constituted attic was, in fact, the only part of the film shot in a studio. Where, helpfully, the crew had the luxury of a raised stage. This allowed for the effects team to operate the puppets and pumps from underneath the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shot of Larry&#8217;s blood seeping unnaturally through the floor was a simple reverse shot of a red fluid being pumped up through rigged nail holes in the floorboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-heart.gif\" alt=\"Hellraiser Frank Ressurection Heart\" class=\"wp-image-358895\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-heart.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-heart-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The false floor allowed for the establishing downward pan revealing the pulsing heart-like mass. This &#8220;embryo&#8221; was designed by <strong>John Cormican</strong>. And as Keen relays to Heather A. Wixton in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Squad-Celebrating-Memorable-Creatures/dp/1629332224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Monster Squad</a></em>, the effect was &#8220;made out of a condom, a piece of tubing, some glue, and some bits and pieces to pull the whole thing together to make it look like a real human organ.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the crew, the backbone of <em>Hellraiser</em>&#8216;s special effects was, in fact, lube and condoms. Which, given the erotic nature of the film, is quite fitting. The crew actively sought out condoms because they were made out of latex. And sheet latex was something constantly in need if you were doing SFX makeup in the &#8217;80s. Lube made things look wet (and stay wet) under the camera lights. According to the crew, they were mortified whenever they&#8217;d have to make a run to a shop to load up on what surely looked like a king&#8217;s ransom of orgy supplies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the birthing sequence, the SFX gang actually used a step up from lube. That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s the return of our good friend <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-blob-special-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">methylcellulose</a>, the food thickener/SFX mainstay. &#8220;We would pump up methylcellulose by the gallon&#8221; recalls Keen. You can see the pump in action early in the sequence, as pools of clear goop ooze up from the floorboards. The thick, snot-like strands coating Frank&#8217;s in-progress body are also likely methylcellulose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Frank&#8217;s &#8220;arm stumps&#8221; (what else to call them?) erupt from the pools of ooze, those are two animatronics. &#8220;We built lots and lots of puppet rigs,&#8221; stresses Keen. Watching the sequence, the puppetry is especially apparent when you know about the false floor. You can just imagine the operators, huddled below, pushing out fingers, and pulling on shuddering spinal stalks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-resurrection-goo-stalks.gif\" alt=\"Hellraiser Frank Resurrection Goo Stalks\" class=\"wp-image-358893\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-resurrection-goo-stalks.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-resurrection-goo-stalks-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The forming flesh effect itself &#8212; where bone, muscle, and tendons reconstitute Frank&#8217;s skinless body &#8212; was accomplished with wax and reverse photography. The team constructed models of body parts out of different waxes with different melting points, layering them as needed. Burned and filmed in reverse, the effect is that of re-forming flesh. This required a multitude of stages as well as close-up appliances to show the growth of Frank&#8217;s hands and organs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crew also used colored thread for Frank&#8217;s veins, which when pulled and played in reverse, looks like conscious, slime mold-like sinew. As mentioned above, puppet rigs also featured in the &#8220;<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/horror-movie-melts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reverse melt</a>&#8221; parts of the sequence. Wires were used to pull away pieces of Frank apart bit by bit, mimicking, in reverse, the in-film demise of the character himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The sequence involves a whole bunch of ideas merged into one, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s been done before,&#8221; emphasizes Keen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-ribs.gif\" alt=\"Hellraiser Frank Ressurection Ribs\" class=\"wp-image-358898\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-ribs.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-ribs-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-s-the-precedent\">What’s the precedent?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as reverse decompositions go, Keen is probably correct in saying that there is no precedent. Especially at this scale. However, I can think of at least two pieces of early &#8217;80s SFX that put some of <em>Hellraiser</em>&#8216;s ingenuity in context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is a melt. In fact, maybe one of the most famous melts of all time. And, like the Frank birth effect, it made use of heat and liquifying materials layered to give the impression of human flesh. That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re talking <em><strong>Raiders of the Lost Ark</strong></em>. In which, near the end of the film, Steven Spielberg treats us to the unforgettable image of two Nazis&#8217; faces melting off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-face-melt.jpg\" alt=\"Raiders Of The Lost Arc Face Melt\" class=\"wp-image-358899\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-face-melt.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-face-melt-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-face-melt-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-face-melt-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily for us, the good folks at <strong>Industrial Light &#38; Magic</strong> have spoken about the effect at length. Probably because traumatized kids who are now entertainment journalists won&#8217;t stop asking them to foot their therapy bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making molds of the actors&#8217; heads using alginate (a rubbery substance used in dental molds), the artists sculpted the heads and added eyes and skulls made out of a material that could withstand the face-melting heat. Instead of wax, ILM used different colored layers of a gelatin formula with a low melting point. Then it was just a matter of aiming the heat guns at the heads and speeding up the recorded footage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other effect I want to mention is from John Carpenter&#8217;s <strong><em>The Thing</em></strong>. We&#8217;ve covered <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-thing-chest-chomp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the Norris-Thing effect</a> on the column before (and at length). But I want to highlight one moment from the sequence in particular: when Norris-Thing&#8217;s fleeing head defensively sprouts legs and eyestalks. In terms of &#8220;pushing gross spindly shit up through a fake floor,&#8221; it&#8217;s the effect that springs to mind. So to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-thing-head-getaway-part-3.gif\" alt=\"The Thing Head Getaway Part\" class=\"wp-image-352126\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Norris-Thing&#8217;s transformation isn&#8217;t all that dissimilar from what Keen and co. did for Frank&#8217;s limbs in <em>Hellraiser</em>. To achieve the effect of the metamorphosing Norris head, <em>The Thing </em>SFX team, lead by wunderkind <strong>Rob Bottin</strong>,<strong> </strong>worked on an elevated set with a fake floor. This allowed the operators below to push everything up and out through Norris-Thing&#8217;s hollow head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of love out there for 1980s special makeup effects. And I&#8217;d venture a guess that a good part of that love is rooted in the period&#8217;s penchant for texture. Whether it&#8217;s a crab-head, a goopy corpse, or a melting Nazi head, these are effects with an endearing tactility. They certainly touched audiences. Whether audiences would have the guts to reach out and touch them back is another matter.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/atO1CY8HTfE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:16:31 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut.png","linkMd5":"0bb802757514b705e680ed60573910a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-14-220_c5e47663130a572c.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":250622,"destBytes":28400,"author":"Meg Shields","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Larry-hand-cut.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-14-220_c5e47663130a572c.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-brain-methycel.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn9@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-15-791_4e64737a66fd952a.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-blood.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-46-087_d209f2eb65986966.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-heart.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-21-384_00263b2760445c3b.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-resurrection-goo-stalks.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-40-346_d12a65b923aa0b40.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hellraiser-Frank-ressurection-ribs.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-19-386_0f00dedffc6b0441.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-face-melt.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-15-893_1c3cc10eb5719432.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-thing-head-getaway-part-3.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-19-937_f61dfb2071a13ec5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/atO1CY8HTfE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-15-678_c5bcd88d82e36f62.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129173984},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:13","title":"One of the Best ‘Mad Men’ Episodes is All About the Women","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358938","description":"<p><em>This essay is part of our series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/episodes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Episodes</strong></a>, a bi-weekly column in which senior contributor <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a> digs into the singular chapters of television that make the medium great. This entry revisits “The Other Woman,&#8221; a <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/mad-men/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mad Men</a> Season 5 episode in which Joan faces an impossible choice.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em></strong>, despite its title, has always been anchored by its women. There’s Betty (January Jones), whose dissatisfaction is sublimated into the confines of domesticity. There’s Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), hungry for recognition and a boys’ club type of freedom. There’s hopeful Megan (Jessica Paré), imprisoned in the glossy, simple image that Don (Jon Hamm) has created for her. There’s Sally (Kiernan Shipka), coming-of-age in a decade of painful change. And then there’s Joan.</p>\n<p>Joan Holloway Harris, played to perfection by <strong>Christina Hendricks</strong>, seems to be everything a man would want. She’s drop-dead gorgeous, with curvy measurements that boggle the mind, and she never has so much as a painted nail out of place. She’s also incredibly competent, excellent at both her surface-level job as an ad agency office manager and her unstated job, which she describes in the first season as “something between a mother and a waitress,” with an expectation of occasional sexual harassment. Joan is, above all else, practiced and unshakeable.</p>\n<p><em>Mad Men</em> is a subtextually rich series that&#8217;s ideal for academic interpretation, so it makes sense that when I think of Joan, I can’t help but think of the 1988 essay &#8220;<a href=\"https://mycourses.aalto.fi/pluginfile.php/198021/mod_page/content/8/Bartky129_HIAR11034.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foucault, Femininity and the Modernization of Patriarchal Power</a>&#8221; by feminist scholar Sandra Bartky. The author compares the patriarchy’s influence to philosopher Jeremy Bentham’s idea of a prison system called the Panopticon, in which fearful inmates are well-behaved because they always think they’re being watched. Bartky says: “The woman who checks her make-up half a dozen times a day to see if her foundation has caked or her mascara run, who worries that the wind or rain may spoil her hairdo&#8230;has become, just as surely as an inmate of the Panopticon, a self-policing subject, self committed to a relentless self-surveillance.”</p>\n<p>Joan endures much of the personal prison of 1960s womanhood with a tight but convincing smile on her face. Every choice she makes &#8212; especially early in the series &#8212; is an attempt to meet the paradoxical standards of what the men of the world want. And her social confines are never more poignantly rendered and subverted than in the Emmy-nominated <em>Mad Men </em>Season 5 episode “<strong>The Other Woman</strong>.”</p>\n<p>As the episode opens, the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce team is working on their pitch for the Jaguar account. Landing the car brand would be huge for the burgeoning business. The ad copy guys are stumped, stuck trying to figure out how to evoke the idea of a mistress with their presentation without actually saying the word “mistress.” As with the series’ best ad-related plots, the Jaguar pitch parallels the main characters’ episode trajectory, resulting in a climax that intertwines the personal and professional to profound effect.</p>\n<p>Early on in “The Other Woman,” Pete (Vincent Kartheiser) and Ken (Aaron Staton) go to dinner with Jaguar’s Herb Rennet (Gary Basaraba). He’s an off-putting bigwig who tells them that he’s hard to please and needs whoever lands his account to go the extra mile. His intentions soon become clear; Herb won’t give SCDP the Jaguar account unless Joan has sex with him. “She’s one of these free spirits, open to ideas?” he asks. Actually, Joan isn’t. Despite her romantic entanglement with Roger Sterling (John Slattery), she’s mostly been a traditionalist up until this point, sticking with her awful husband despite his violence against her and scoffing at Peggy’s public attempts to nudge up against prescribed gender roles.</p>\n<p>Still, morally flexible Pete isn’t about to let the Jaguar account get away. He approaches Joan in her office, putting the onus of the decision on her while framing the conversation like an apology. This exchange, like most in the episode, is spoken in a sort of coded language, moral depravity polished up with a thin coat of decency. Episode writers <strong>Semi Chellas</strong> and <strong>Matthew Weiner</strong> craft a fitting strain of dialogue for an episode that centers Joan, a character who measures nearly every word she speaks.</p>\n<p>Line for line, “The Other Woman” is as well-written as any other across <em>Mad Men</em>’s seven seasons, with exchanges that appear cool on the surface but are built to elicit audience gasps, cheers, or tears. One of the first great bits comes up when Pete compares Joan’s potential dip into prostitution to Cleopatra’s rise to power. “She was a queen,” he says. “What would it take to make you a queen?” “I don’t think you could afford it,” she snaps back.</p>\n<p>Pete takes Joan’s words about the right price rather seriously, telling the partners that she could be bought for the right offer. Each man’s reaction is telling. Mild-mannered Lane Pryce (Jared Harris), who harbors feelings for Joan, is appalled but unwilling to make waves. After the men&#8217;s meeting, he goes to Joan and discreetly advises her to ask for a permanent partnership rather than the partners’ proposed one-time payment of $50,000.</p>\n<p>Unflappable, Joan doesn’t bat an eye when Lane reveals the high number to her, though she later notes that it’s four times her annual salary. In the context of the season, “The Other Woman” is part of an emotional one-two punch with “Commissions and Fees,” as the next episode ends with Lane’s finance-related suicide. The exchange between the two here is especially meaningful when you realize it’s one of the last times they ever talk to one another.</p>\n<p>“The Other Woman” isn’t about whether or not Joan sleeps with Herb, though she ultimately does. It’s about the commodification of women, the sneaky hypocrisy of misogyny, and the varied ways in which women cope with that ever-present prison guard that is the male gaze. It’s about a woman whose learned wariness is as practiced as her perfect posture, a woman who is repaid for her relentless commitment to feminine composure by being valued in the same bracket as an impractical sports car.</p>\n<p>Despite the solemnity at its core, the whole episode is brimming with dynamic tension and unpredictability. Thus, the scene in which Joan chooses to meet Herb feels like a punch to the gut. It’s not that Joan should be judged for her choice; sex work itself isn&#8217;t shameful, although in this setting it was certainly taboo. No, the emotions come from a deeper place here, one that involves Joan&#8217;s carefully cultivated self-image. The scene is cleverly crosscut with Don’s pitch to Jaguar the next day, in which he describes the perfect woman as unattainable, “beyond our reach and a little out of our control.”</p>\n<p>In the next moment, Herb, with his slicked-back hair and deep-necked robe, crassly demands to see Joan’s breasts. She is under his control, no longer unattainable but now a thing that can be bought. It’s almost as if we can read Joan’s thoughts at this moment. It doesn’t matter how hard you work to maintain an image, the scene communicates; these men will always see you the way they want to. Clever, strong, fierce, loyal Joan is temporarily reduced to some soft body parts.</p>\n<p>Don is the only person at SCDP who tries to play hero and stop the arrangement. After he hears about Herb’s proposition, he scraps the mistress pitch idea, angrily calling it “vulgar.” When he later gets word that Joan is considering the offer, he rushes out of the office and to her apartment. But we’re shown via a series of trickily time-scrambled scenes that he arrived too late. He finds Joan in her bathrobe and tells her that Jaguar isn’t worth it.</p>\n<p>She blinks once, closing her eyes for a moment, and that careful batting of her eyelashes is the most emotion she allows herself throughout the episode. If she’d known that Don wanted better for her, maybe she wouldn’t have gone through with it. “You’re a good one, aren’t you?” she says and touches his face sweetly. She lets him leave believing that her honor is intact, while in fact, she’s already home from her visit to Herb’s hotel room.</p>\n<p>Don’s urgent crusade to stop Joan is a gesture that would be nobler if he didn’t also attempt to control Peggy and Megan earlier in the episode, angrily throwing a handful of money at the first and demanding that the other give up a job that would require her to travel. His hypocrisy contrasts sharply with the gentleness that we see at that moment with Joan, and he quickly and cynically abandons his role as the protector the next day when Joan walks into a partner’s meeting, making her decision the night before clear once and for all.</p>\n<p>By this point, the series has carefully unraveled Don’s psychology, so it’s easy to see that he’s not so much a true ally to Joan as he is a man with a perpetual soft spot for mothers and prostitutes. Hamm&#8217;s performance conveys these emotional contradictions with fantastic nuance, evoking deep feelings with a single sidelong glance.</p>\n<p>In “The Other Woman,” two of <em>Mad Men</em>’s central female characters &#8212; Megan and Joan &#8212; grow jaded through their experiences with men, while a third, Peggy, begins successfully navigating the men&#8217;s’ world in contrast. A scene in which she meets Ted Chaough and accepts a deal to leave SCDP crackles with live-wire energy. When she writes a proposed salary number on a piece of paper without hesitation, Ted assumes a man taught her that trick.</p>\n<p>Later, she momentarily balks at the idea of telling Don she’s quitting when he asks her to drink with him, a gesture of approval that she’s always sought from him as a mentor. When she finally goes, she offers him a handshake, but instead, he softly kisses her hand. That moment alone warrants an essay all its own, but in the simplest sense, it’s a reminder that she’s a woman, and he’s a man, and that he more than anyone else realizes how much she’s given up &#8212; namely, a secret child &#8212; to get to this point.</p>\n<p>By the episode’s end, Peggy has a new job, Joan has a partnership position, and Megan has Don’s support in her career path. They’ve moved up in the world, so why do we feel like crying? Perhaps it all goes back to Jaguar. The tagline Don finally goes with is a great one: “At last, something beautiful you can truly own.” It’s obviously targeted at men alone. The women of <em>Mad Men</em> will always be entrenched in the quicksand of patriarchy no matter how far up the social ladder they climb. In the eyes of almost every man they meet, they’re little more than beautiful things.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/I3S1LTm0Vgo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"
