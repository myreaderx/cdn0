The image is nicknamed the \"Cosmic Reef,\" because NGC 2014 resembles part of a coral reef floating in a vast sea of stars.</p> <p>Some of the stars in NGC 2014 are monsters. The nebula's sparkling centerpiece is a grouping of bright, hefty stars, each 10 to 20 times more massive than our Sun. The seemingly isolated blue nebula at lower left (NGC 2020) has been created by a solitary mammoth star 200,000 times brighter than our Sun. The blue gas was ejected by the star through a series of eruptive events during which it lost part of its outer envelope of material.</p> </br></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":17949,"bgimg":"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/32062/STSCI-H-p2016a-f-17043x11710.tif","linkMd5":"a567eb3ee84d70c65c75f0a9247ab4f2","author":"outreach@stsci.edu (Space Telescope Science Institute)","enclosureType":"image/tiff","enclosureUrl":"//imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/32062/STSCI-H-p2016a-f-17043x11710.tif","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/story/display_image/1351/low_STSCI-H-p2016a-k-1340x520.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-42-08-266_0f2296a133fef2da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603212127579}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:42:07","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:42:07","feedId":17949,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:42:07 +0000","fetchMs":1392,"handleMs":365,"totalMs":161293,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":1213,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d74ee4cd41d209f5fd2464bcfd300583","hostName":"europe67*","requestId":"e85e79b02023451191065875b38a1968_17949","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":21830,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx24":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:16:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:48:47","id":17949,"name":"Hubble - News feed","url":"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newscenter_rss.php","subscriber":185,"website":null,"icon":"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/collection/image_attachment/2/RSS_image_news.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/06/18-48-45-631_3a7d6e7bc0a840c8.jpg","description":"This news collection compiles news releases and supporting materials published by the Officeof Public Outreach of the Space Telescope Science Institute, to further your knowledge of astronomy.
