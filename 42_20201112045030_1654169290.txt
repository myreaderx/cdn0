The treatment exploits “nanobodies” – tiny antibody fragments – that are harvested from llama blood. The new nanobody therapy can be used in an inhalable form that may deactivate the virus within the lungs.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wally-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501483\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wally-1.jpg 333w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wally-1-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nature is our best inventor,&#8221; said Yi Shi, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;The technology we developed surveys SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies at an unprecedented scale, which allowed us to quickly discover thousands of nanobodies with unrivaled affinity and specificity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the therapeutic, the researchers immunized a llama called Wally with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A couple of months later, they were able to isolate nanobodies against the spike protein from a sample of the llama blood and used a mass spectrometry technique to identify which nanobodies bound to the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fraction of a nanogram of the purified nanobodies is sufficient to prevent the virus from infecting 1 million cells, suggesting that the new therapeutic could be a potent treatment for those suffering from an infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nanobodies also seem to be highly stable, and can survive at room temperature for at least six weeks while also surviving a process to turn them into an inhalable therapeutic, which could be a useful treatment for those experiencing acute respiratory symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/breathing-nanobodies-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501487\" width=\"317\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/breathing-nanobodies-1.png 422w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/breathing-nanobodies-1-300x275.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Targeting the treatment directly to the lungs could also help to reduce costs as it will mean smaller overall doses. With traditional antibody therapeutics, the antibody is delivered intravenously, requiring a large quantity to achieve the correct concentration in the target organs, which in this case is the lungs. This leads to incredibly high costs. For instance, a treatment with conventional SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can cost as much as $100,000 per patient. &#8220;Nanobodies could potentially cost much less,&#8221; said Shi. &#8220;They&#8217;re ideal for addressing the urgency and magnitude of the current crisis.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Science</em>: <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/04/science.abe4747\">Versatile and multivalent nanobodies efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.upmc.com/media/news/110520-shi-llama-nanobody\">University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_zt35mTaRt8:GEd0faTmvLs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_zt35mTaRt8:GEd0faTmvLs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_zt35mTaRt8:GEd0faTmvLs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_zt35mTaRt8:GEd0faTmvLs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/_zt35mTaRt8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 15:33:24 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nanobodies.png","linkMd5":"31412487a66be2189647ceb11840bee7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-49-53-422_821a11571e6b6281.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":601,"sourceBytes":415946,"destBytes":19550,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nanobodies.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-49-53-422_821a11571e6b6281.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wally-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn84@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-28-728_440377b957cbd1d6.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/breathing-nanobodies-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-28-676_bab0fef117a28514.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-481_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_zt35mTaRt8:GEd0faTmvLs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn69@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-28-528_597c1e5ace22ef3d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/_zt35mTaRt8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn47@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-28-473_3625e18050ebee37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156590960},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","title":"Earwax Sampling Device for Easy Cortisol Measurement","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1501412","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trears.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501423\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trears.jpg 720w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trears-300x188.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at University College London and King&#8217;s College London have developed a device that allows for easy earwax sampling, with the goal that the wax could be a convenient and reliable way to measure cortisol levels. The device can be used by a patient at home to obtain a sample of earwax and is less invasive and unpleasant than existing methods, such as syringing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cortisol levels change in patients with conditions such as depression, Addison&#8217;s disease, and Cushing syndrome, and so measuring someone’s cortisol levels could be useful in diagnosing and monitoring these diseases. However, cortisol levels are difficult to reliably measure in the blood as they can fluctuate a great deal. Hair can also reflect cortisol levels, but not everyone has enough to provide a sample, and it can also be prone to cortisol fluctuations along with being time-consuming and expensive to analyze. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Cortisol sampling is notoriously difficult, as levels of the hormone can fluctuate, so a sample might not be an accurate reflection of a person&#8217;s chronic cortisol levels. Moreover, sampling methods themselves can induce stress and influence the results,” explained Andres Herane-Vives, a researcher involved in the study. Another option is earwax, which sounds unappealing, but may provide a stable source of cortisol. “Cortisol levels in earwax appear to be more stable, and with our new device, it&#8217;s easy to take a sample and get it tested quickly, cheaply and effectively,&#8221; added Andres Herane-Vives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current standard techniques to obtain earwax samples include syringing, which is messy, can be uncomfortable, and typically occurs in a doctor’s clinic. This new approach is intended to be easy and rapid, and a user could conceivably perform the procedure themselves in their own home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new device resembles a colorful cotton swab, but unlike a conventional swab its design does not permit a user to advance it too far into the ear canal, thereby preventing inadvertent damage to the ear. The tip of the device is covered in a cellulose sponge soaked in a mineral oil solution containing magnesium chloride, which is intended to maximize sample uptake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested the device in a pilot study with human volunteers and found that it was simple and quick to use, and the resulting earwax samples provided a robust and reliable source of cortisol. &#8220;After this successful pilot study, if our device holds up to further scrutiny in larger trials, we hope to transform diagnostics and care for millions of people with depression or cortisol-related conditions such as Addison&#8217;s disease and Cushing syndrome, and potentially numerous other conditions,&#8221; said Herane-Vives. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Heliyon</em><em>:</em> <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(20)31967-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2405844020319678%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">Measuring Earwax Cortisol Concentration using a non-stressful sampling method</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/nov/earwax-sampling-could-measure-stress-hormone\">University College London</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=2-I2_TqFEos:9BXv8hAo-94:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=2-I2_TqFEos:9BXv8hAo-94:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=2-I2_TqFEos:9BXv8hAo-94:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=2-I2_TqFEos:9BXv8hAo-94:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/2-I2_TqFEos\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 17:27:41 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trears.jpg","linkMd5":"1337b777f1b4efeb87780928e87cdf46","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-25-956_5625a89616063e55.webp","destWidth":720,"destHeight":451,"sourceBytes":58171,"destBytes":10758,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trears.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-25-956_5625a89616063e55.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-481_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=2-I2_TqFEos:9BXv8hAo-94:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn24@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-29-311_51453542d4982348.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/2-I2_TqFEos":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn49@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-475_97b9eebc3afacbc8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156590959},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","title":"Implantable Biodegradable Sensor Measures Gases Inside The Body","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1501521","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gas-array-sensor-device.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501538\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gas-array-sensor-device.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gas-array-sensor-device-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gas-array-sensor-device-768x545.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Penn State have developed an implantable sensor that can measure levels of NO and NO<sub>2</sub> gases in the body, both of which are medically relevant. Consisting of silicon and magnesium, the sensor is flexible and completely biodegradable, and so does not need to be removed after implantation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring levels of NO and NO<sub>2</sub> gas in the body can provide useful information for clinicians. NO is involved in vasodilation, and is important in cardiovascular diseases, whereas NO<sub>2</sub> is a pollutant that can play a role in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The gases are also linked, whereby reactive NO can be converted to NO<sub>2</sub> when it encounters oxygen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current technologies to measure such gases are not optimal – these include bulky sensors that are typically used outside the body that do not provide the most accurate or physiologically relevant readings. Using an implantable sensor could help to provide more appropriate readings from within the body, but could potentially require two surgeries – one to implant it and another to remove it. These issues inspired the Penn State researchers to develop an implantable, biodegradable sensor that will not need to be removed later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Let&#8217;s say you have a cardiac surgical operation, the monitor outside of the body might not be sufficient to detect the gas,” said Huanyu Cheng, a researcher involved in the study, in a press release. “It might be much more beneficial to monitor the gas levels from the heart surface, or from those internal organs. This gas sensor is implantable, and biodegradable as well, which is another research direction we&#8217;ve been working on. If the patient fully recovers from a surgical operation, they don&#8217;t need the device any longer, which makes biodegradable devices useful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NO-NO.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501539\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NO-NO.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NO-NO-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NO-NO-768x521.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sensor consists of silicon, which is flexible and sensitive to NO, and magnesium components to conduct electricity within the device. “Silicon is unique – it&#8217;s the building block for modern electronics and people consider it to be super-stable,” said Cheng. “Silicon has been shown to be biodegradable, as well. It can dissolve in a really slow manner, at about one to two nanometers a day, depending on the environment.” &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested the device <em>in vitro</em> and have shown that it can detect the gases and break down slowly over time. It may be possible to use the technology to measure other medical parameters, without the need to remove the sensor later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>NPG Asia Materials</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-020-00253-0\">Biodegradable, flexible silicon nanomembrane-based NO<sub>x</sub> gas sensor system with record-high performance for transient environmental monitors and medical implants</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.psu.edu/story/633781/2020/11/06/research/implantable-sensor-could-measure-bodily-functions-and-then-safely\">Penn State</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=jjeI5PePNCg:TRkOtA8jKJI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=jjeI5PePNCg:TRkOtA8jKJI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=jjeI5PePNCg:TRkOtA8jKJI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=jjeI5PePNCg:TRkOtA8jKJI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/jjeI5PePNCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 15:47:23 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gas-array-sensor-device.jpg","linkMd5":"cafe30dcbb1b589bee7f04c085875d74","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn9@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-53-482_c6b9dbb73e847987.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":546,"sourceBytes":340114,"destBytes":60550,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gas-array-sensor-device.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn9@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-53-482_c6b9dbb73e847987.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NO-NO.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn55@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-28-729_3d57b8b3f20fd3ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-481_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=jjeI5PePNCg:TRkOtA8jKJI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn53@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-28-587_e36e678e9319c303.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/jjeI5PePNCg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn35@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-491_9c91320b70089e92.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156590960},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","title":"Microneedle Bandage Detects Malaria in Minutes","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1501334","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-device.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501347\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-device.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-device-300x223.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-device-768x571.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Rice University have developed a microneedle patch that can rapidly detect the presence of malaria in interstitial fluid.

I would say it feels like putting tape on your skin and then peeling it off.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the bandage may also be useful in detecting other diseases, including COVID-19. &#8220;In this paper, we focus on malaria detection because this project was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and it&#8217;s a big priority for them,&#8221; said Lillehoj. &#8220;But we can adapt this technology to detect other diseases for which biomarkers appear in interstitial fluid.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers estimate that the device may cost as little as $1 if manufactured in bulk, suggesting that it may be useful in low resource regions. Its appearance as a bandage helps to make it more relatable and less daunting for non-clinical users and not scary for the patients getting screened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t intend for it to look like a bandage,&#8221; said Lillehoj. &#8220;We started with a rectangular shape and then just rounded the edges to make it a little more presentable. We didn&#8217;t plan for that, but perhaps it makes the patch more relatable to the general public.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>Microsystems and Nanoengineering</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-020-00206-1\">Microneedle-based skin patch for blood-free rapid diagnostic testing</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.rice.edu/2020/11/02/malaria-test-as-simple-as-a-bandage/\">Rice</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hUxVHrhNFFQ:u6mIn-drBao:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hUxVHrhNFFQ:u6mIn-drBao:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hUxVHrhNFFQ:u6mIn-drBao:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=hUxVHrhNFFQ:u6mIn-drBao:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/hUxVHrhNFFQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 16:03:50 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-device.jpg","linkMd5":"02b9b0bcdfb883e89b07223ff51dd941","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-59-455_3cd2249ef3a22705.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":392438,"destBytes":68628,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-device.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-59-455_3cd2249ef3a22705.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/needle-more.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-481_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=hUxVHrhNFFQ:u6mIn-drBao:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn44@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-28-648_f95718d65e58429e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/hUxVHrhNFFQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-28-478_d80003317a70adf6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156590959},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","title":"Elastomeric Respirator Mask Senses Fit and Filter Saturation","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1501593","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/N95-Alternative-TEAL-Respirator.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501599\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/N95-Alternative-TEAL-Respirator.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/N95-Alternative-TEAL-Respirator-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/N95-Alternative-TEAL-Respirator-768x433.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology have designed a new respirator, conceived as an improvement on standard N95 masks. The transparent respirator contains sensors that allow users to know if the mask is fitting snugly and alerts them when the filters need to be replaced. The mask, called the transparent, elastomeric, adaptable, long-lasting (TEAL) respirator, can be sterilized repeatedly, helping to reduce waste and avoid respirator shortages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for respirators and masks has been urgent. Our team has worked to develop a respirator platform that not only fits comfortably and snugly but can also be sterilized and re-sterilized,&#8221; said Giovanni Traverso, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;In this study, we looked at up to 100 re-sterilization cycles and found that the TEAL respirator we&#8217;ve designed can withstand that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested a variety of sterilization procedures with the respirator, including bleaching, UV sterilization, autoclaving, microwaving, and exposure to isopropyl alcohol.

Part of the problem lies in the time it takes clinicians to diagnose an antibiotic-resistant infection. Current techniques involve lab technicians culturing a bacterial sample until it can be analyzed for drug resistance. The whole process takes days, and by the time the test provides an answer, a patient could be dead from sepsis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, clinicians typically administer broad-spectrum antibiotics in an effort to bring an infection under control. However, this does not always work if the bacteria present are resistant, and can result in further drug resistance.

Antibiotic resistance causes at least 700,000 global deaths annually. By 2050, this figure is expected to grow to 10 million—more than deaths due to cancer—if current trends continue. Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more dangerous for patients and more difficult and expensive to treat. They often require extended hospital stays, additional follow-up doctor visits, more costly and toxic alternative treatments, and have an increased risk of mortality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the rising prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms has dramatically increased the risks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which already affect 4-5% of hospitalized patients in the U.S. and result in 99,000 patient deaths per year. As drug resistant bacteria become more and more common, so will deaths from life-threatening infections like sepsis, which is the body’s unregulated immune response to a severe bloodstream infection. Recent studies show that 20% of deaths globally are already associated with sepsis. In the United States, sepsis is estimated to be responsible for one third of hospital deaths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, preventing septic shock relies on treating patients with broad-spectrum antibiotics because the risk of death from sepsis increases by almost 8% for each hour an infection goes without appropriate treatment. This practice can make subsequent culture-based diagnostics less sensitive and can also contribute to the growth of antibiotic-resistant organisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>How are antibiotic-resistant infections currently diagnosed and what problems do such approaches cause?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jong Lee:</strong> Early and effective treatment of antibiotic resistant infections has been proven to save lives. However, current technologies cannot provide actionable information quickly enough to enable early, targeted antibiotic treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, when a patient goes to the hospital with signs of an infection, samples are collected and sent to the lab, where they are cultured on various media to see if they grow. Only <em>after</em> the bacteria has been given time to grow (usually 1-2 days) can they be identified and tested for drug resistance. This outdated process can take 2-5 days to return a result when it works, but culture can also fail to grow in 30-50% of severe infection cases. In the meantime, every hour that a patient remains inadequately treated increases their risk of complications or death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With little to no information to go on, physicians are forced to treat with empiric therapy: powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotics that are expensive, can have significant toxicity, and are increasingly less effective due to the spread of multidrug resistant pathogens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>Do you think that rapid diagnosis will be a key factor in fighting antibiotic-resistant infections and reducing the manifestation of further drug resistance?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jong Lee:</strong> The world is in desperate need of a rapid diagnostics that can perform comprehensive antibiotic resistance profiling without the need for time-consuming cultures. Broad spectrum antibiotics are critical tools for fighting life-threatening bacterial infections and the best way to ensure they continue to be effective when needed is to avoid their overuse as a first line treatment. But without rapid diagnostics that can provide a comprehensive antibiotic resistance profile straight from a clinical sample like blood, it is nearly impossible for physicians to choose targeted antibiotic therapy. Instead, they must “carpet bomb” the infection using broad spectrum antibiotics that encourage the development of even more resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>Please give us an overview of the technology developed by Day Zero Diagnostics. What does it do and how does it work?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jong Lee:</strong> Day Zero is pioneering a new class of infectious disease diagnostics using whole genome sequencing and machine learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We aim to change the way infectious diseases are diagnosed and treated by developing a sequencing-based rapid diagnostic that identifies, within hours, both the species and the antibiotic resistance profile of a bacterial pathogen. Our diagnostic technologies are focused on three major areas that work in tandem with commercially available whole genome sequencing technology: sample preparation, machine learning algorithms, and big data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day Zero’s system is designed to extract bacterial DNA directly from a patient sample, such as blood, for whole genome sequencing with unprecedented sensitivity. Day Zero’s proprietary machine-learning algorithm then analyzes the genomic data to rapidly identify the pathogen and determine its antibiotic susceptibility and resistance profile, allowing physicians to confidently and quickly prescribe the most effective antibiotic. Unlike current molecular diagnostic approaches that test just a handful of species and provide little to no information on antibiotic resistance, the new system would allow for the simultaneous testing of a broad range of bacterial species and their antibiotic susceptibility, along with the ability to identify novel resistance determinants as they emerge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DZD’s system is poised to help patients with severe infections receive the most effective antibiotic treatment on the first day they are admitted to the hospital—day zero—rather than being treated with multiple days of toxic broad-spectrum antibiotics. The system is intended to help physicians quickly and accurately diagnose and treat life-threatening superbug infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>Please give us an overview of the results of the recent trial of the technology at the Boston Medical Center and the Blood2Bac validation study.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jong Lee:</strong> Interim results from the Boston Medical Center Rapid Bacterial Identification Trial (BRABIT) and results from a separate validation study of Blood2Bac were recently presented at IDWeek 2020. Both studies demonstrate the promise of our new technology to quickly and accurately diagnose superbug infections. They suggest that our approach could improve the way physicians diagnose and treat life-threatening bacterial infections and most importantly, save lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interim analysis of BRABIT included samples from the first cohort of patients enrolled in the study and evaluated our rapid, culture-free sequencing-based bacterial identification assay in patients with suspected bloodstream infections (BSIs). The assay is powered by Blood2Bac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, a proprietary sample preparation technology for ultra-high enrichment of bacterial DNA from clinical blood samples and Keynome<sup>®</sup>, our machine learning algorithm for species identification and antibiotic resistance profiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results showed that our culture-free assay for determining the presence of a bacterial infection and its species were concordant with clinical blood cultures in 96% of samples. They also suggest the assay is potentially more sensitive than culture-based diagnostics, with the ability to confirm an infection even when same-day blood cultures failed to grow. In addition, there have been no false-positive results to date. False positives occur when a diagnostic detects an infection that is not truly present. This type of error is often made by other sequencing and molecular diagnostics and makes relying on them for clinical decision making particularly challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of a separate validation study of Blood2Bac evaluated the technology’s ability to recover the whole genomes of pathogens and tested it across 50 bacterial species spiked into whole blood at concentrations as low as 1 CFU/mL (colony-forming unit per milliliter).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results demonstrated that Blood2Bac, when paired with Keynome, was able to achieve an average of 95% whole-genome coverage and correctly identify all 50 species with 100% accuracy even at single-digit bacterial concentrations. The ability to test for a broad range of infections and recover almost the entirety of the pathogen’s genome directly from whole blood represents a significant advancement over current molecular diagnostic approaches that are limited to testing just a handful of species and only recover a very small portion of the pathogen&#8217;s genetic code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>When do you anticipate that such technology will be available and widely adopted?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jong Lee:</strong> We already offer services to hospitals today that make use of certain elements of our technology. For example, our epiXact service for investigating suspected hospital-acquired infection outbreaks using whole genome sequencing is already available commercially. We are exploring making other elements of our technology available for clinical use in the near future. But designing, building and testing our fully integrated in vitro diagnostic will be the focus of our company for the next few years now that we have completed development of our core technologies. We will ultimately plan to pursue FDA clearance to introduce the system in the United States, as well as a CE Mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will continue to collaborate with leading institutions to test our diagnostic approach in clinical studies over the next several years. Those studies will allow us to demonstrate how our diagnostic could impact clinical decision making and educate clinicians about our potential performance so the use case is well understood by the time our system is introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we anticipate doing some pilots with leading academic medical centers on the use of sequencing to provide a big data view of the flow of pathogens through the microbiology lab. These pilots are designed to start articulating a vision for the future of hospital microbiology that we think will be transformative.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/divider-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501605\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"DZD - A New Diagnostic for Combating Antibiotic Resistance\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DKy3P_4MM8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.dayzerodiagnostics.com/\">Day Zero Diagnostics</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=6OXluNnDZO4:xh1v1AuuO4Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=6OXluNnDZO4:xh1v1AuuO4Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=6OXluNnDZO4:xh1v1AuuO4Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=6OXluNnDZO4:xh1v1AuuO4Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/6OXluNnDZO4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:32:38 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/zero-day.png","linkMd5":"1dc8ae5f93c34a1ab5b502f96cc995b3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-51-366_1291f81aef0879ce.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":243,"sourceBytes":108157,"destBytes":19304,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/zero-day.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-51-366_1291f81aef0879ce.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Jong.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn77@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-608_f4decb6ec7cd9994.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn73@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-28-531_5ae013c0eecc399e.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/divider-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-28-941_66906ae83e0f86be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-28-481_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=6OXluNnDZO4:xh1v1AuuO4Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-28-572_968f17fcfe7c2c41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/6OXluNnDZO4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn31@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-28-493_4560661710c9ccbd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156590959},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:50","title":"Flexible Patch Monitors and Treats the Beating Heart","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1501383","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/heart-patch-device-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501409\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/heart-patch-device-1.png 720w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/heart-patch-device-1-300x225.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the University of Houston and colleagues have developed a flexible epicardial patch which can monitor heart function and even administer treatments, such as thermal ablation and heart pacing. The device can harvest power directly from the movement of the beating heart and its flexibility means that it conforms well with the epicardial surface, allowing it to monitor the heart at various locations simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, implantable devices that are used to monitor and treat the heart, such as pacemakers, largely consist of rigid components, meaning that they do not blend well with moving heart muscle. Soft alternatives have been developed, but to date they haven’t been sophisticated enough to collect numerous types of cardiac data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest development aims to change this. “The device marks the first time bioelectronics have been developed based on fully rubbery electronic materials that are compatible with heart tissue, allowing the device to solve the limitations of previous cardiac implants, which are mainly made out of rigid electronic materials,” said Cunjiang Yu, a researcher involved in the study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the device is flexible, it is less likely to damage the heart muscle as it beats, and it can make close contact with the epicardial surface over a wide area, allowing for more accurate and comprehensive data collection. The patch can collect a wide variety of medically relevant data, including electrophysiological activity, temperature, and strain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strikingly, it can also make therapeutic interventions in the form of thermal ablation and heart pacing, and can harvest energy from the movement of the heart, potentially meaning it may not need an external power source. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unlike bioelectronics primarily based on rigid materials with mechanical structures that are stretchable on the macroscopic level, constructing bioelectronics out of materials with moduli matching those of the biological tissues suggests a promising route towards next-generational bioelectronics and biosensors that do not have a hard-soft interface for the heart and other organs,&#8221; said Yu. &#8220;Our rubbery epicardial patch is capable of multiplexed ECG mapping, strain and temperature sensing, electrical pacing, thermal ablation and energy harvesting functions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Electronics</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-00493-6\">An epicardial bioelectronic patch made from soft rubbery materials
