manager, many influencers expand their digital businesses by selling consumer products or securing lucrative brand partnerships.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With multichannel networks (or MCNs) that once dominated the YouTube talent space experiencing a decline and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202131/matpat-defy-media-youtube-ally-bank-ryland-adams-multi-channel-network\">shutting down,</a> the industry is shifting toward firms with a small-scale roster of clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These new power players have developed expertise in the many facets of the influencer world, like negotiating

People like wine, but most of us don't know what we're talking about or what we're actually sipping. It's easier when someone just tells us what's good.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Firstleaf</a> is an algorithm-based wine subscription service that learns more about your tastes and preferences as you try different wines and curates a personalized experience for you over time.&#160;</p><h2>How Firstleaf works</h2><p>As with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vinebox-wine-club-review-2018-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most personalized services</a>, you start off by taking a short online quiz, which asks about your white vs. red vs. rosé vs. sparkling preferences, what region you prefer your wine to come from, and how much wine you drink per month. The quiz also includes food tastes and dislikes to further understand your palate.&#160;</p><p>You'll immediately get a recommendation of six wines. For newcomers, Firstleaf gives an introductory offer of these six wines for only $40, plus tax.&#160;</p><p>This welcome-to-the-club offer also serves as a kind of diagnostic test (that's infinitely more fun than the SAT one you took in high school) for the rest of your <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Firstleaf</a> experience. If you decide to continue the subscription, it costs around $90 for six wines including shipping, which comes out to $15 a bottle.&#160;</p><h2>Review of Firstleaf</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b578d6b3b49fc2a008b469c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"my firstleaf box\" height=\"550\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The wines I received when I tried Firstleaf for myself.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>At the time of my initial review, Firstleaf had a three for $15 deal (which, unfortunately, is no longer available), so I took advantage of that offer.</p><p>Three full-sized bottles of red and white wine were securely packed in a cardboard crate and each came with its own informational card explaining the origins of the wine and region, tasting notes, and food pairings. All this information can also be found online when you log in to your account and click on your past orders.&#160;</p><p>My first box included a Chardonnay from Paso Robles, a Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina, and a Zinfandel from Sonoma County. All were international wine competition winners, but despite their prestige, I didn't love them all, which was completely fine and not unexpected. I would have the opportunity to rate the picks and explain my specific thoughts later on.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b577ed97d4dc732008b463d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"firstleaf rate wines\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You&#39;ll rate each wine you taste so Firstleaf&#39;s algorithm can get a better idea of your preferences and provide better wine recommendations.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Firstleaf</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>Once you log back into your account, you can give each wine a \"Thumbs Up\" (I'd drink this wine again and <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Firstleaf</a> will send more like it), a \"Thumbs Down\" (not for me), or leave the thumb icons blank if you have no opinion and don't feel strongly either way. There is a section below each wine where you can write additional comments and notes for <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Firstleaf</a> or just for personal reference. You can also reorder six bottles of the wine you loved for $90.</p><p>After this initial box, every future shipment will consist of six different wines curated around your preferences for $90 including shipping and be delivered automatically every one, two, or three months. However, you can choose any other delivery date or cancel your subscription at any time.&#160;</p><p>By design, <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Firstleaf</a> works better the longer you use it. The more wines you rate, the better its system can match future shipments to your taste and adjust picks if your tastes evolve from the initial quiz.&#160;</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>Using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3861930/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Firstleaf</a> isn't only about convenience, education, or personalization, though these are all strong reasons why you should try it. With each bottle coming out to about $7 in the intro offer and $15 for future ones, it's also a much more affordable way to enjoy quality wines from top vineyards around the world.&#160;</p><h3><a

stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p><strong>Narrator: </strong>Stubbing your toe hurts. It's right up there with paper cuts and chapped lips. Annoying, minor injuries that hurt way more than they have any right to. But it turns out, there's a good reason why stubbing your toe hurts so much.</p><p>When you stub your toe, you're slamming it with a force equal to 2-3 times your body weight. That's about the same force as a karate punch! And since your toe has a tiny surface area, that force can't spread out. So the pain stays concentrated at the point of impact.</p><p>It's the same reason it hurts more to step on the tiny, pointy end of a thumbtack than the wider, blunt end. But you don't just feel an immediate shock like when you step on a thumbtack. There's that aching throb that comes after. That's because when you stub your toe, you're actually hitting a bundle of special nerve endings called nociceptors. They all fire at once, blaring a danger signal.</p><p>But some signals travel faster than others. The faster, A-delta nociceptors fire the first wave of signal, which races at 20 m/s up thousands of densely-bundled nerve fibers and ultimately to your brain. That causes the sharp, sudden pain you feel at the moment of impact. But some nerve fibers called C nociceptors send a slower signal at only 2 m/s. So after a moment's delay, a second wave of pain signals reach your brain. That's the dull throbbing that lingers on.</p><p>You can find nociceptors all over your body, from your eyes to your bladder. But they're concentrated at the highest densities in parts of your body you use to explore your environment, like your fingertips, and lips. That's why accidents like paper cuts and chapped lips can also hurt more than they seem like they should. Now, your toe isn't packed with as many nociceptors as your fingertips. But since there's not much in the way of fat padding to cushion the blow it's easy to set those unprotected nociceptors off. And that's no coincidence.</p><p>Researchers suspect the pain we feel from mishaps like a stubbed toe might've saved our ancestors' lives. Back before antibiotics, even the tiniest cut could mean a deadly infection. And feet, which were constantly in contact with dirty, bacteria-infested surfaces were particularly vulnerable. So people who had extra- sensitive feet might've been more careful about where they stepped. As a result, they'd be less likely to get infections and would live to pass on their genes.</p><p>So the next time you collapse to the floor, cradling your aching toe you can thank your great great great great great great grandpa for the privilege.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published in March 2019.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/why-stubbing-your-toe-hurts-so-much-2019-3'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/s84V7iWZkrY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 19:30:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5c8a59b9f73f5c2e1155246f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5d19cc3eec047bd15752ef3163204095","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn50@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-49-00-670_227d5b05991b59df.webp","destWidth":2073,"destHeight":1555,"sourceBytes":96202,"destBytes":96202,"author":"usharma@businessinsider.com (Uma Sharma,Shira Polan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-49-00-176_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn92@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-54-968_7ef03817ee079f0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn11@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-49-02-658_6d96250c417a6bd7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-007_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s84V7iWZkrY:cwzFuQ9ClUA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-54-440_bbfde86644ef0ee5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/s84V7iWZkrY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn100@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-55-287_65e0fc64acde5a9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963710029},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","title":"More than half of the money from the Paycheck Protection Program went to just 5% of recipients","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/5-percent-recipients-got-over-half-pay-paycheck-program-funds-2020-12","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f0c3a244dca6855ca5408b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump signs the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act financial response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. April 24, 2020.

Well, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it definitely saved my Shark Week. Shark Week is a huge deal in my house. My partner and I dedicate our whole week to observing these majestic creatures in their natural habitats and cheering on the brave and dedicated scientists, researchers, and divers who make it all possible. Last year was to be no different. But we'd recently moved apartments and switched cable providers, so when I went to turn on Discovery moments before the first episode of Shark Week 2019 was set to begin, I was stunned to learn the channel didn't come with our cable package. It always had before, so I didn't think to check beforehand. Now Shark Week was moments away, the popcorn was already popped, and I was at a loss.</p><p>I needed something that would get me access to the Discovery Channel and my beautiful breaching apex predators instantly. I thought about finding an illegal stream online, but those were unreliable … and illegal, so I thought better of it. I thought about calling my cable provider and upgrading to a package that included Discovery, but that would've made my cable bill skyrocket. And then I remembered Hulu has a Live TV add-on, and I was thrilled to see the Discovery logo prominently displayed on their channel list. I already had a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-premium-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hulu Premium subscription</a> and the app was installed on my smart TV, so all I had to do was click into my account settings and toggle on the Hulu + Live TV option. Within seconds, we were blissfully watching great whites hunt robo-seals. It was that easy.</p><p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=42392&u1=biipf_090619_hulu-live-tv&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tvom%2Flive-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Hulu + Live TV</a> is a great option if you're looking into cord-cutting thanks to the sheer volume of content you gain access to. Plus you can record TV to watch later, DVR-style, so you don't have to worry about catching your shows as they air live. We used this option to make sure we didn't miss a single sharky moment.</p><p><em>Updated on 12/2/2020 by Steven Cohen: Added details about the upcoming price increase for Hulu + Live TV.</em></p><h2><strong>How much does Hulu + Live TV cost?</strong></h2><p>With Hulu + Live TV, you first and foremost gain access to Hulu's entire streaming catalog — all the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-shows-on-hulu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-movies-on-hulu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">movies</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hulu-orignals-to-stream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hulu originals</a> that you get with a normal Hulu subscription are yours to enjoy.

You can also rewind shows that have already started back to the beginning so you don't have to worry about rushing home to catch the first five minutes of the new episode of \"The Bachelor.\" If 50 hours doesn't seem like enough, because you want to horde the entire new season of \"Real Housewives\" and your roommate wants to record every Crimson Tide football game, you can upgrade to 200 hours of DVR storage for an additional $9.99 a month.</p><p>You can also add on premium channels like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hbo-max-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HBO Max</a> ($14.99 per month), Showtime ($10.99 per month), Cinemax ($9.99 per month), and Starz ($8.99 per month) for additional monthly charges. <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=42392&u1=biipf_090619_hulu-live-tv&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tvom%2Flive-tv\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Hulu + Live TV</a> also offers add-on packages that include additional entertainment channels ($7.99 per month), and Spanish-language channels ($4.99 per month).</p><h2><strong>What channels come with Hulu + Live TV?</strong></h2><p>Discovery is just one of the more than 65&#160;channels that come with <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=42392&u1=biipf_090619_hulu-live-tv&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tvom%2Flive-tv\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Hulu + Live TV</a>.</p><p>You'll gain access to networks like ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, so you can keep up with your favorite sitcoms and news programs.

Instead of being backed by something like gold, bitcoin has code behind it. Its main advantage is there's no primary owner (like a bank), but instead a network that anyone can join, which powers the currency.</p><p>Bitcoin is powered by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blockchain-2016-3\">blockchain</a> technology, and every bitcoin transaction is permanently recorded. Its famous \"miners\" process all new transactions, and then use cryptography to add them to the database. Its creator, the mysterious \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-history-cryptocurrency-satoshi-nakamoto-2017-12#but-satoshi-nakamoto-didnt-work-entirely-alone-3\">is still unknown</a>. It's a buzzy alternative investment for the internet generation, but it's also famously volatile — and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/economist-nouriel-roubini-trashes-bitcoin-manipulation-retail-investor-fomo-2020-11-1029844248\">has its fair share of skeptics</a>.</p><p>Back in 2017, bitcoin had what <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-in-2017-review-2017-12\">Business Insider described as a \"wild run,</a>\" rising by over 1,300% and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-ico-mania-going-mainstream-2017-8?curator=TechREDEF\">going mainstream</a> with Times Square ads and celebrity endorsements including Floyd Mayweather. But bitcoin took a mighty tumble the next year, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-surges-past-15000-hits-highest-level-in-two-years-2020-11-1029772298\">falling 80% from its peak</a>, while other <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrencies-ether-litecoin-bitcoin-cash-2018-9\">cryptocurrencies also slumped</a>. Still, it's the world's best-known (and most popular) cryptocurrency, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/\">and is seen as a standard-setter</a>.</p><p>The hype now is back close to — or even beyond — 2017 levels, with millennial celebrities especially curious.</p><p>For instance, \"Game of Thrones\" actor Maisie Williams asked her millions of Twitter followers if she should go long on it, and billionaire Mike Novogratz responded with a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/billionaire-mike-novogratz-bitcoin-65k-game-of-thrones-maisie-williams-2020-11-1029814531\">buy recommendation</a>, saying he expected the price to hit $65,000.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Maisie Williams  (@Maisie_Williams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1328428879334297600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>Williams isn't the only one contemplating bitcoin: Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, Bernstein Research's co-head of portfolio strategy, wrote in a note to clients that <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/stock-market-outlook-bitcoin-portfolio-crypto-skeptic-investing-bernstein-2020-12-1029854263\">he had changed his mind about the cryptocurrency</a>. He believes that bitcoin now has a place in investor portfolios.</p><h2>So what's changed?</h2><p>For Fraser-Jenkins, the difference is the economic fallout from the pandemic — such as higher taxes and inflation — coupled with bitcoin's declining volatility over the past three years.</p><p>But there's no one clear reason why the cryptocurrency has rallied so tremendously — it's probably a confluence of factors. The <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/world-biggest-crypto-fund-manager-michael-sonnenshein-bitcoin-money-evolution-2020-11-1029826836\">pandemic is a big one</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/dbs-bitcoin-crypto-pandemic\">more investors looking to bitcoin</a> as a steady alternative that won't be impacted by potential inflation.</p><p>It's also now more widely available to use and trade. Prospective bitcoin users can now actually buy and sell it on services including <a href=\"https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency\">PayPal</a> and <a href=\"https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin\">Square</a>. Starting in 2021, PayPal users will even be able to use it in exchange for goods and services. Fidelity Investments even started <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/fidelity-launches-inaugural-bitcoin-fund-for-wealthy-investors\">its own bitcoin fund</a> in August.</p><p>There's <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-surges-past-15000-hits-highest-level-in-two-years-2020-11-1029772298\">substantial millennial interest in it</a>, and Novogratz told Bloomberg that it's like \"<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/fidelity-launches-inaugural-bitcoin-fund-for-wealthy-investors\">digital gold</a>.\"</p><p>The cryptocurrency could also have a government ally on Wall Street. President-elect Joe Biden has appointed to his transition team Gary Gensler, a figure with deep knowledge and experience about cryptocurrencies, who's also seen as <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-explodes-above-18k-market-cap-all-time-high-2020-11-1029815353\">friendly toward</a> the alternative asset class.</p><p>So it certainly seems possible that bitcoin <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-outlook-here-to-stay-millennial-demand-blackrock-rieder-2020-11-1029827265\">will stick around for the long haul</a>, despite its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-30/bitcoin-jumps-to-record-as-advocates-say-this-time-is-different\">continued volatility</a>.&#160;</p><p>But, much like its creator and its origins, when it comes to bitcoin's value, there's always considerable mystery.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article

We kind of expected it because they visit a lot of people in assisted-living facilities and nursing homes, so we figured they were waiting for the shoe to drop.&#160;</p><p>It was very sobering for us as a family. They ended up getting a mild form, which was lucky for us. They have a couple of other preexisting conditions that put them at higher risk for a more serious outcome.</p><h2><strong>Since we were exposed in January, I've always viewed the pandemic as a once-in-a-century pandemic.</strong></h2><p>I'd been thinking about what I could do to help, even though I'm basically a walking high-risk category for COVID-19.&#160; I have asthma and Hashimoto's, an autoimmune condition.</p><p>I was actively seeking to become part of this. First and foremost, it's a monumental opportunity to be able to help your fellow citizens and be able to be in a position to further a therapeutic or vaccine that will keep people from dying. I really didn't think twice about it. It was something I sought after, and I did it mainly because my family members are nurses.</p><p>They didn't make it easy. I looked for information on where the trials were being conducted and waited for details to come out on how I could sign up for a trial. I had heard other people signed up to participate, and I wanted to know where they were getting that information.&#160;</p><p>There are three facilities in the Atlanta area that are doing the study. I'm part of the one by the Clinical Research Atlanta in Stockbridge, Georgia.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-pfizer-biontech-historic-coronavirus-vaccine-program-2020-11\">How the pharma giant Pfizer teamed up with a little-known biotech to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine in record time</a></em></p><p>I finally went to their website and filled out a small survey. I was called the next day.</p><h2>I was finally accepted into the trial in mid-August.&#160;</h2><p>I'm taking part in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-pfizer-biontech-historic-coronavirus-vaccine-program-2020-11\">Pfizer trial</a>, where we get two doses.</p><p>They asked me a bunch of questions and tested me for COVID-19 as part of the test. They drew blood and they gave me the first injection. At that point, I didn't know if I was getting the placebo or vaccine, but that night, I started getting really tired. The next day I was really exhausted, and then I started having a fever. My temperature was 99, almost 100 degrees for two and a half to three days. (Editor's note: Hamilton was not told whether she got a working shot or the placebo. She said she thinks she got the vaccine, because of her body's reaction to the injections.)&#160;</p><p>After the first injection, I waited three weeks and got another injection in the beginning of September. It was the same scenario — I was <em>really</em> tired the next day. It was a little more severe, where I didn't even feel like getting up to fix something to eat. I just laid in bed and slept most of the day and still had a low-grade fever for two or three days as well.</p><p>After that, I'm fine. I'm in the third phase of the study. I got the blood draw a month after I did the last injection and will get another blood draw in March to determine if I have antibodies — or different responses with platelets and white blood cells — and what my body's response is.</p><h2><strong>They request for you to fill out a diary.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Every time you get an injection, you're supposed to detail in your responses of what your side effects are for seven days: what your temperature is, aches, pains, and, on a scale, how severe they are.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pharma-executives-selling-company-stock-amid-covid-19-pandemic-2020-10\">Biotech execs hunting for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments have raked in more than $1 billion by selling company stock this year. Here are the 27 leaders who've cashed in the most.</a></em></p><section></section><p>If you got more than moderate on any of the questions you have, a study coordinator would reach out.&#160;</p><p>For example, one of my questions was about tiredness. When I put \"severe\" on tiredness, the study coordinator texted me soon after and wanted to get an idea of how I was doing. The same thing happened when my temperature was elevated for a longer period of time after the second injection.&#160;</p><p>She basically said the side effects for this particular vaccine were usually more severe with the second injection than the first, so this was normal.&#160;</p><h2>They're very good about following up with you.</h2><p>It'll prompt you with certain entries in your diary to call your study coordinator. She calls right away, wants to make sure you're OK, and determines how severe your reactions are.</p><p>Those are the kinds of things I found comforting.&#160;</p><p>Other than that, they don't really talk to you. They just say if you feel bad, you can call at any time. Or if you feel like you want to withdraw from the study, you can call immediately and they'll talk you through that. They try to mitigate situations where someone is feeling scared or anxious.</p><p>I've never felt any of that because this situation was like having a slight cold.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-antibody-treatments-eli-lilly-regeneron-gsk-amgen-2020-4\">Here's how 9 leading drugmakers are racing to develop a new kind of coronavirus treatment despite an early setback</a></em></p><h2><strong>Even though I'm in the last phase, the study is going to last for 2 years.&#160;</strong></h2><p>I'll have to fill out a diary once a week at least for two years. They want you to fill out a diary to see if you have any symptoms or feel like you've gotten COVID-19. If you do, they give you a test to do a nasal swab and pick it up.&#160;</p><p>The way they were explaining to me, the last blood draw they'll do is in March.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-of-when-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-available-2020-11\">Read a timeline of when Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine could reach ordinary people — a process likely to take months</a>.)&#160;</em></p><p>Even though it feels like I have another layer of protection, I still wear my mask. I'm actually careful. I have gone out to eat occasionally, but since the whole pandemic, it's made my perception change. I look down on restaurants that don't enforce mask-wearing and social distancing. I make sure I'm socially distancing myself in places.</p><p>It's wonderful that it looks like the trial is getting close to producing a successful candidate for the vaccine. I'm excited that others will be able to have some protection.</p><p><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">The thoughts expressed are those of the subject's.

His creation, the Gymnasticon, predated even the earliest riding bicycles by several decades. By the end of the 19th century, as bicycles took their modern form, stationary bikes used for exercise became a more common sight in homes and gymnasiums.</p><p>For much of the 20th century, exercise bikes and treadmills were essentially the only stationary devices suitable for cardiovascular exercise. In the 1990s, equipment such as the NordicTrack, the elliptical trainer, and stair machine gained in popularity. Exercise bikes almost seemed passé, used more for hanging laundry than for fitness in the home.</p><p>Then the spin class craze hit and exercise bikes surged into style once again. Led by familiar faces in NordicTrack and newcomers like Peloton, the current wave of exercise bikes have become an incredibly popular part of anyone's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-home-gym\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at-home fitness setup</a>.

With a design reminiscent of premium competitors like Peloton and NordicTrack, Stryde offers a few unique features that let it stand out on its own &#8212; including the fact it costs some hundreds of dollars cheaper at just $1,550.</p><p>First is its content strategy. Like almost any connected bike, <a href=\"https://www.strydebike.com/the-bike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stryde</a> comes with an 22-inch on-board touchscreen tablet that's able to stream workouts via a companion smartphone application. After signing up for a $30 per month membership, you're able to stream any of its hundreds of on-demand classes filmed at spin studios across the country. Though the production value may not be on par with what Peloton offers, the classes are still impressive and deliver tough workouts.&#160;</p><p>But the Stryde app and its workouts aren't the only thing you're able to access on the tablet &#8212; it also allows for complete internet access. This means you're able to check your email, listen to music, and (perhaps most enticing) stream video services like Netflix or Hulu. Need to catch up on season 3 of <em>Ozark</em>?

An LCD screen set into the compact unit tracks metrics including RPMs, speed, distance, and approximate calories burned.</p><p>But perhaps the best thing about this unique pedal machine is that it doesn't have to be used only as an under-desk leg exerciser; the VIVE Pedal Exerciser can also be set up on your desk or table for an arm workout.

On those days when it's too cold for a run or when there's no time for a trip to the gym, a home exercise bike is <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/benefits-of-cycling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a great way to get your heart rate up</a> and your leg muscles pumping. When you utilize its various seated and standing positions, as well as the interval training approach of a spin class, you can even get what amounts to a total body workout.</p><p>Compared to larger cardio machines like an elliptical trainer or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-treadmill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">treadmill</a>, many exercise bikes are relatively affordable and compact. Some even fold away to stash in a closet or under the bed.</p><p>When shopping for an exercise bike, you'll want to keep in mind a few important features. First, consider the bike's&#160;<strong>size</strong>. Whether you have a dedicated workout room or want to slide the bike into your living room/kitchen (i.e. you live in a studio apartment), size matters. Thankfully, most exercise bikes are much smaller than treadmills, so there likely won't be as much of a logistics headache with these.&#160;</p><p>You'll also want to decide whether you want a <strong>connected bike</strong> outfit with a suite of on-demand, streamable classes, or something a little more basic that's just a seat, some handlebars, and a pair of pedals attached to a resistance wheel. Connected bikes do tend to run quite a bit more in terms of price, but offer a deep library of workout classes and fitness tracking.&#160;</p><p>Finally, don't forget about <strong>budget</strong>. The connected bikes mentioned above often come with price tags in the thousands of dollars while the more basic, non-digital options may run you a few hundred (and still do well to deliver a worthy session of cardio exercise).&#160;</p><p>Our guide includes exercise bikes to fit every budget and every home. Some are small enough to tuck under a desk, while others require a few square feet of real estate. But all of the stationary cycles included will help you hit those cardio fitness and weight management goals.</p>\n\tSee more great fitness guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

It also agreed to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98% and limit uranium enrichment to 3.67%.</p><p>In other words, Tehran agreed to restrictions that would allow it to have enough enriched uranium to maintain the country's energy needs, without having the ability to build a nuclear bomb.&#160;</p><p>On top of this, Iran agreed to give access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog agency, to its nuclear facilities, among other facilities. Prior to Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal and for a long period after, the IAEA repeatedly found Iran to be complying with the terms of the pact.&#160;</p><p>In January 2016, when the IAEA declared Iran was living up to its end of the bargain, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/world/middleeast/iran-sanctions-lifted-nuclear-deal.html\">all nuclear-related international sanctions against Iran were lifted</a>.</p><h2>The controversy surrounding the Iran deal, explained</h2><p>Iran and the US have been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-us-iran-have-been-adversaries-roughly-four-decades-2020-1\">enemies for decades</a>. The two countries have an extremely complex history that involved a CIA-orchestrated coup in the 1950s, a pro-American puppet monarch who was overthrown in 1979 via the Islamic revolution, and the infamous hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran that followed the uprising.</p><p>The constant threats from Iranian leaders against Israel, America's top ally in the Middle East, and chants of \"death to America\" in Iranian streets have also not helped matters.&#160;</p><p>In this context, there is a massive distrust for Iran in the US (and vice versa), and Washington has long feared what might happen if the Iranian regime developed a nuclear weapon. Iran made great strides in this regard by the 2010s, hence the Obama administration's efforts to orchestrate the nuclear deal. When the pact was finally settled in 2015, it was widely celebrated as a major diplomatic achievement.&#160;</p><p>But many (primarily conservative) leaders in Washington still felt the Iran nuclear deal didn't go far enough to limit the country's ability to develop nuclear weapons.&#160;</p><p>This is because the Iran deal contains <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/25/trump-doesnt-like-the-iran-deals-sunset-provisions-heres-how-to-fix-that/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ea57d961a93ea93e\">sunset clauses</a>, or parts of the agreement that will ultimately expire. Under the deal, the restrictions on Iran's centrifuges go away after 10 years (in 2025) and the limitations on uranium enrichment disappear five years after that (2030). Hence, there are fears that once these restrictions expire, Iran could rapidly develop a nuclear weapon.&#160;</p><p>\"It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-speech-iran-deal.html\">Trump said</a> in May 2018. \"The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing we know exactly what will happen.\"</p><p>More broadly, Trump, among others, has argued the deal didn't do enough to address Iran's regional behavior or its missile program. Accordingly, the president wants to negotiate a new deal with Tehran.&#160;</p><h2>Iran withdrew from the nuclear deal amid fears of war with the US in early 2020</h2><p>Trump's unilateral decision to withdraw the US from the JCPOA in May 2018 was promptly condemned by US allies, who have scrambled to find a diplomatic solution ever since. On January 5, Iran announced it's withdrawing from the JCPOA.&#160;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Emmanuel Macron  (@EmmanuelMacron) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/993920765060878336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>For roughly a year after Trump's controversial announcement, Iran remained in compliance with the JCPOA. But the Iranian government in early June 2019 announced it would break from a key component of the JCPOA by ramping up its enrichment of low-grade uranium and increasing its stockpile beyond the limitations outlined in the deal.&#160;</p><p>Making good on this threat, Iran in July 2019 announced it had surpassed the deal's cap on how much low-grade uranium it could stockpile — <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-breaches-uranium-stockpile-limit-jcpoa-sunset-clause-2030-2019-7\">300 kg or about 660 pounds.</a> It also announced it had breached the deal's limitation on uranium enrichment — 3.67% — but has <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/19/07/govinf2019-9.pdf\">only enriched up to 4.5%</a> and far below weapons-grade levels.&#160;</p><p>In September 2019, Iran <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-taking-big-step-allows-faster-development-of-nuclear-weapons-2019-9\">took yet another big step away</a> from the deal when it announced it would begin developing more advanced centrifuges that allow for more rapid uranium enrichment. Iran also said it was lifting all limits on research and development. Wendy Sherman, who served as the Obama administration's lead negotiator on the JCPOA, described this move to Insider as of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-defiance-trump-maximum-pressure-failing-2019-9\">\"serious concern.\"</a></p><p>\"It's all concerning, because it's moving away from a framework that ensured Iran would not get a nuclear weapon,\" Sherman said. \"Iran is not just being emboldened but is being left in some ways to take actions that say they will not be pushed back. We are at a very, very difficult place.\"</p><p>Iran in early November 2019 announced it was taking a fourth step away from the 2015 nuclear deal — injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges that had been kept empty under the terms of the agreement.</p><h2>2020 has dealt serious blows to the JCPOA</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ee102d35af6cc51f03a31a2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Soleimani stock photo 1800px Tehran after assassination Qassem\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An Iranian holds a photograph of Qassem Soleimani in Tehran after his assassination.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The 2015 deal virtually collapsed entirely following Trump's decision to order a deadly strike on Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in early January.&#160;</p><p>In the days that followed the strike, the Iranian government said it will no longer comply with any of the limits of the deal, including restrictions on uranium enrichment, its amount of stockpiled uranium, and research and development.&#160;</p><p>But Iran also said it will continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, and would return to the nuclear agreement if sanctions against it were lifted,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/world/middleeast/Iran-us-trump.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimesimes\">according to the New York Times.</a>&#160;</p><p>In early November, the UN's nuclear watchdog reported that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium was more than 12 times the limit set under the JCPOA. The IAEA said Iran's stockpile was up to 2,443 kilograms, but under the 2015 deal the cap was set at 203 kilograms. Iran's uranium was enriched up to 4.5%, which is far below weapons-grade levels of roughly 90%, but <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-iran-united-nations-de8772e3b88bdcbacbe98d1062d25c15\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"f2718dcfffc713f9aa019ef62754aad5\">above</a> the 3.67% limit set by the JCPOA.</p><p>Subsequently, Trump reportedly asked top advisers for options to strike Iran's primary nuclear facility, but was urged against taking an action that could spark a broader conflict with his time in the White House waning.&#160;</p><p>The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian nuclear scientist, in late November has ramped up tensions between the US and Iran once again.</p><p>Iran has blamed Fakhrizadeh's killing on Israel, which is America's closest ally in the Middle East.

Top experts have said Israel was likely behind the assassination, and a former US diplomat told Insider there are \"ample\" reasons to suspect US involvement — including Trump's desire to derail the JCPOA.&#160;</p><p>Fakhrizadeh was widely regarded as the \"father\" of Iran's nuclear program. In the days following his assassination, Iranian lawmakers took steps to further distance the country from the 2015 deal, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-law/iran-watchdog-passes-law-on-hardening-nuclear-stance-halting-u-n-inspections-idUSKBN28C2F7\">including moving toward halting UN inspections of nuclear sites.</a></p><h2>Biden wants to restore the deal, but has admitted it won't be easy</h2><p>The president-elect has consistently expressed a desire to return to the 2015 nuclear deal.&#160;</p><p>\"If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations,\" Biden said in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/13/opinions/smarter-way-to-be-tough-on-iran-joe-biden/index.html\">a September op-ed</a> for CNN.</p><p>More recently, he told the New York Times that he knows it will be \"hard\" to restore the deal, but that he still believes rescuing the pact and restricting Iran's nuclear program is \"the best way to achieve getting some stability in the region.\"</p><p>\"The last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/opinion/biden-interview-mcconnell-china-iran.html\">Biden said.</a></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-explained'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Y2C5RvCaF-o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:15:09 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5af32d7a640c8b28008b47c0?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"1d161603d8a5a0172732ec33231cfd32","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-49-09-436_f73f46f27a6a20df.webp","destWidth":1956,"destHeight":1467,"sourceBytes":110926,"destBytes":110926,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5af32cb760883622008b47ff?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-54-245_3cb3c74d5f389ce7.webp","https://i.insider.com/5af32ccc4e868818008b47b7?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn100@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-51-130_878a0feae821cb93.webp","https://i.insider.com/5ee102d35af6cc51f03a31a2?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn27@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-49-03-556_db39d7271ec6d7d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-49-00-176_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-49-01-031_4e8aa44c0c55d797.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn31@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-333_029209201fa6b1ac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-007_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Y2C5RvCaF-o:E44w68y_UOs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn88@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-49-02-655_3d30d0374a34bbcf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Y2C5RvCaF-o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn64@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-49-02-955_40dacc583fbc420b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963710044},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","title":"Trump retweeted a Nevada doctor's selfie to push the false claim that COVID-19 is a hoax.

flux right now, and while it's not impossible to fetch a cut of beef or a pork shoulder online, many of us are looking to different sources of protein. One solution you might consider is adding more seafood to your diet.</p><p>The fisheries in the United States <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2020/05/06/covid-19-amerian-seafood-commercial-fishing-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are in rough shape</a> right now too, but some companies are still making a go of it — especially on the direct-to-consumer side — and <a href=\"https://www.seafoodwatch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more sustainable options</a> are in good supply.&#160;</p><p>But you don't want to buy just anything. If fish isn't handled correctly, it tends to taste, well, fishy. As a former commercial and charter fisherman, as well as a raw-bar tender, I know good — and bad — fish when I see it. So, after eight months of testing some of the most popular places to buy seafood online, I've rounded up my favorites (and highlighted some particularly excellent selections from each).&#160;</p><p>Whether you're shopping in bulk for the family or looking for the freshest, highest-quality sushi-grade salmon money can buy, you'll find all the best options here, including ones for vegetarians and vegans. Yes, seaweed, also known as sea greens, is widely available, and full of flavor, vitamins, and protein. Plus, it's an up-and-coming superfood, don't you know.&#160;</p><p><em>*Note that some brands are currently experiencing delays, but they tend to be on a daily or weekly basis, so we won't note them here as things are rapidly changing. The good news from purveyors is that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meat-beef-industry-coronavirus-pandemic-small-scale-farms-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unlike meat</a>, there's no shortage of fish.</em></p><h2><strong>Where to buy seafood online</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tSitka Salmon Shares\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eeb7bfc3f737004e8750d33?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sitkasalmon\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Sitka Salmon Shares works like a community-supported agricultural (CSA) co-op, only with fish, otherwise known as a community-supported fishery (CSF). Members can enroll at three-, six-, and nine-month intervals and receive their monthly share (with no-contact delivery). Depending on the size of the box you decide upon, prices per pound will range from $18 to $28, and monthly shares start at $119 per month.</p><p>That's just shy of what you'll pay in most markets for fresh black cod, and a good deal less than what you'd pay for fresh, wild halibut or salmon (which is often frozen and thawed). The benefit for you is that Sitka Salmon Shares' fish is blast-frozen at -50 degrees Fahrenheit and expertly vacuum-sealed, so you can confidently load everything into your freezer and expect it to stay free of freezer burn and oxidation, which happen when there's water or air trapped inside the bag.</p><p>The benefit for the fishermen is that by working within the cooperative, they're getting paid more than they would if they were selling their fish to processing plants &#8212; Sitka Salmon Shares has its own processing plant, and a strict set of handling processes, leaving you with higher quality fish than you might get at a large-scale processing plant.</p><p>You also get what's in season, and won't be receiving last year's salmon just because that's the number one Alaskan fish everyone knows and loves. Throughout the course of a year, you'll receive salmon, yes, but also black cod, lingcod, halibut, prawns, and Dungeness crab.</p><p>We tried Sitka Salmon Shares in early June and received a box of halibut, black cod, and lingcod, which were the species running at the time. Halibut is a coveted fish that often goes for $40 a pound in New York, so the two roughly one-pound fillets we received already made up for over half of the cost of a box. The rest, which amounted to six half-pound-or-more fillets of black cod and lingcod &#8212; less sought-after fish &#8212; would probably fall more on the $18-a-pound side of the spectrum, but between all of the species overall, you're getting more and higher quality Alaskan seafood than you'd get at your typical grocery store fish counter for that price.</p><p>Lastly, Sitka Salmon Shares ships in some of the most sustainable packaging around, using corn-starch-based foam as opposed to styrofoam, which is wrapped in recycled #4 plastic bags and filled with dry ice. Everything arrived still solidly frozen and was immaculately sealed. We will hang on to a few of these until next year to see how they fare, but by the looks of the packaging, we're confident they'll last that long.</p><h3><a href=\"https://sitkasalmonshares.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shop Sitka Salmon Shares</a></h3>\n\tCitarella\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f120a23f34d055dea5e85e8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"citarella\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If you want fresh &#8212; not frozen &#8212; seafood delivered to your door no more than a few days out of the water, Citarella is your go-to. Sure, you'll pay for it, but everything comes fresh and expertly wrapped in wax paper, ready to eat. It's even patted dry and packaged with drying cloths so that when your fillets, prawns, or scallops arrive, they are ready to cook, or eat right away (we wasted no time with the scallops at my house, and had them raw, which is my definitive quality test for fresh seafood purveyors).</p><p>Apart from your run-of-the-mill snapper, flounder, grouper, clams, and striped bass, you'll find deep-sea and far-flung treasures such as tilefish and the organic Madagascar shrimp you see above. I'm usually not sold on fish farming for a number of reasons, but this is the first organic shrimp farm to get any attention out of Madagascar, Citarella owner and CEO Joe Gurrera assured me. \"I try to be as modern as I can be,\" he said. \"I'm the first person in this country to have these shrimp fresh. People sell them frozen, and not organic... I got my second shipment just before Covid-19.\"</p><p>I had to try them. They arrived with the fresh, glassy sheen I am accustomed to finding on shrimp I purchase from friends dockside, not the opaque, desiccated appearance of frozen, or once-frozen shrimp you find in the freezer aisles of megalithic supermarkets. Citarella's Madagascar shrimp are sweet, they offer a firm crunch (provided you cook them well), and the heads, if you're into that sort of thing, are divine. Also, there's no deveining necessary.</p><p>The bottom line with Citarella is that, yes, it's expensive, but if you don't want to leave your house, or if you happen to live hundreds or thousands of miles from the nearest coast, it is the best you're going to do across the board, hands down. You might find smaller purveyors with better prices for live lobster, or crabs, and in that case, go with them. There are a couple of those on this list. But if you want a little of everything, or a fillet of deep-sea fish as fresh as fresh can possibly be short of buying it off the dock (or catching it yourself) call upon Citarella and pay up. This sort of thing is a special-occasion purchase for most of us. Why risk botching it?</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.citarella.com/shop/shellfish-seafood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Shop Citarella seafood</a></h3>\n\tCrowd Cow\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eeb888619182410dd04df15?format=jpeg\" alt=\"crowdcow\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chloe Seytre/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>You might not think to look to a brand called \"Crowd Cow\" for seafood, but lo and behold, we tested halibut, Maine lobster tails, and Icelandic-farmed Arctic Char (a healthy and far more sustainable alternative to farmed salmon), and everything was in spectacular shape.</p><p>And while Crowd Cow does not offer a large selection of seafood, we find that to be more comforting. Oftentimes, the more on a menu, the more likely it is that something isn't up to snuff.</p><p>The halibut was a little on the expensive side at over $16 for a 6-ounce fillet, but the two Arctic char fillets at $18 were a steal. The lobster tails, though on the smaller size (maybe about 4-5 ounces each) for $22 is an absolutely fair price, and while you can do better, you might not find better packaging. It's not the most eco-friendly stuff, with a thick plastic tray, but it seems to work better than the standard vacuum-sealed bag, for the most part.</p><p>Crowd Cow, like Sitka Salmon Shares, does use corn-starch-based foam and recycled plastic, as well as dry ice, to deliver your goods, though, which we appreciate far better than the run-of-the-mill styrofoam box, which needs to go.</p><p>Crowd Cow is also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-buy-meat-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">one of our favorite places to buy beef</a>, which is organically raised.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/crowd-cow-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our review of Crowd Cow</a></h3><h3><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&#38;u=1088116&#38;m=69866&#38;urllink=www.crowdcow.com%2Fseafood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Shop Crowd Cow</a></h3>\n\tPeter's Florida Seafood\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc7da2450e71a001155874a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"peters florida seafood\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If it's Caribbean- or Florida-based seafood you're after, you'll have a tough time finding yellowtail snapper, gulf shrimp, or stone crab claws any fresher.

The black grouper and butterflied yellowtail snapper hardly even needed a patting from a paper towel before going into the oven, and the shrimp were sweet and plump and clearly not previously frozen.</p><p>You can find plenty of frozen fish around, and there is any number of mongers willing and able to send your fresh (and not previously frozen) seafood at the tip of a hat. They will all cost you, of course, but where Peter's Florida Seafood shines is in its attention to the advantage of its locality. And while the purveyor does offer options from Alaska (and we imagine they're plenty fine), options like the yellowtail, the Florida Royal Red Shrimp (which are deep-dwelling cool-water crustaceans from off the coast of the Sunshine State), the stone crab claws, and the black grouper are specialties that attract us.</p><p>In short, save your live Maine lobster for a Maine-based purveyor, but when it comes to ordering tropical and subtropical species as fresh as fresh gets, look to Peter's.</p><h3><a href=\"https://petersfloridaseafood.com/collections/shellfish/products/florida-royal-red-shrimp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Shop Peter's Florida Seafood</a></h3>\n\tSea to Table\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebc27c8fc593d11c96baf23?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sea to table\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Sea to Table leaves you with the most information about your catch right on the label.

You'll find delicately-handled fillets and scallops, with nothing broken, nothing mangled, and no unsavory bits like oxidized meat or bloodline, which tend to be offensively pungent upon thawing (and don't do your health any favors either).</p><p>Sea to Table isn't just among the most accountable brand we found, it offers some of the more sustainability-minded catches. Think skate (an oft-overlooked finfish in the US; a delicacy across the Atlantic), Gulf of Maine redfish, and West Coast Dover sole. Try it all.</p><p>Of course, you can order all the salmon you want through the brand, but our favorite option is the Fish Lover's Box, which will get you two types of salmon, Pacific cod, Gulf of Maine Redfish, Skate, and West Coast Dover sole (12 six-ounce servings in all) for less than $90.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.sea2table.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Shop Sea to Table</a></h3>\n\tGet Maine Lobster\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebc489c3dac9a0fb56cc295?format=jpeg\" alt=\"getmainelobster\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Get Maine Lobster deals in the freshest available seafood from Maine.

Salmon (silver, king, or sockeye), white-fleshed fish (usually halibut or cod), or a combination of both will arrive in six-ounce, flash-frozen, individually-wrapped pieces.</p><p>Our favorite is the Wild White Fish Box. The fillets are perfectly packaged and vacuum-sealed, and as far as frozen seafood goes, it is top-notch.</p><p>The salmon, which is skin-on, has been a little hit and miss for us, and we've had several pieces arrive with the vacuum-sealed bag broken, resulting in brown and oxidized meat. This wasn't a reason to discard the fish or discount the brand &#8212; it happens from time to time, as vacuum-sealed bags can break in transit &#8212; but we encountered the same problem twice. However, other pieces of salmon from the same boxes turned out to be some of the best we tried.</p><p>Still, our favorite option is the Wild White Fish Box.

I did a little digging to find that Blue Circle is <a href=\"https://www.msc.org/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)</a>-certified, and most of the brand's offerings are considered \"good alternatives\" (as opposed to best choices) by the <a href=\"https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/act-for-the-ocean/sustainable-seafood?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_JnHt5XV6gIVjLbICh1OoAsaEAAYASAAEgKBafD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch Program</a>, which I prefer to go by. (MSC is a pay-to-play certification given to individual companies, rather than species, fishing practices, and locations, so you might not find the same objective ratings you'll find on <a href=\"https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations/groups/tuna?o=1744679325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Seafood Watch</a>.)</p><p>I chose to try Indian Ocean-caught yellowfin tuna steaks from Blue Circle, and Seafood Watch has the following to say about the species: \"Yellowfin tuna are depleted, and overfishing is still occurring. Trolling lines have minimal bycatch and habitat impacts.\"&#160;</p><p>The brand's tuna is purportedly pole-caught using traceable and sustainable methods and then injected with beetroot for coloring, but when it comes to wild seafood catches taking place thousands of miles away and passing through multiple ports and nations, things can get mixed up. That's often the price you pay for buying curiously inexpensive fish.&#160;</p><p>I was able to sear and slice the yellowfin steaks, and there was no off, \"fishy\" taste. Tuna, when it starts to turn, has an unbearably gamey flavor, and it's something that I personally have never been able to put up with. Note that the above photo is not mine; I forgot to snap a shot of this particular shipment, but the size and coloration compared with what I received is spot on.</p><p>If you prefer salmon, Blue Circle's is farm-raised, and the brand's salmon nets are only filled to 2% capacity, to minimize the burden on their farming grounds.&#160;Blue Circle also sells ready-to-cook meals and \"Happy Fish,\" which are fish-shaped fish sticks for the little ones.&#160;</p><p>The bottom line is, Blue Circle offers very serviceable frozen fish from decent &#8212; although far from perfect&#8212; fishing practices at prices most of us can agree on.&#160;</p><h3><a href=\"https://bluecirclefoods.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Shop Blue Circle Foods</a></h3>\n\tThe Crab Place\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebc270557853207bf112bf4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"crabplace\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If you're after Maryland blue crab in all of its delectable forms, ginormous U-10 (10-count to a pound) sea scallops, or shrimp the size of your palm, Crab Place has been <em>the</em> place for online seafood supply since its inception in 1997.

She couldn't seem to get the hang of breastfeeding, so I pumped in the hospital during her stay and continued to try to nurse her at home without much success.&#160;</p><p>Every day and night soon became an exhausting blur of trying to nurse her, then pumping, then feeding her the expressed breast milk. After about a week of this, I broke down and spent $500 on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G375DHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010820_elvie-double-breast-pump-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07G375DHR&linkId=9e2f3255aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Elvie Pump Double</a>&#160;— the first wearable, hands-free breast pump I've ever owned.&#160;</p><p>Fortunately, it's exactly what I needed.&#160;</p><p>I went from spending hours pumping, tied to a wall while, to being able to pump and hold my baby at the same time, or pump and make breakfast for my other kids, or pump and drive them to school.&#160;</p><p>My daughter is turning 5 months this week, and I've been using the Elvie successfully for the past four months.

Pressing the power button on the front of the Hub powers it on and illuminates the other manual controls, which include the play/pause button, two smaller intensity buttons at the top, and a left/right side selector should you wish to use a single pump for both breasts. Alternatively, after manually powering it on, you can use the app to control pump settings.</p><h2><strong>What it's like to use</strong></h2><p>When I started pumping, it felt too good to be true. I had come to dread uncomfortable pumping sessions, but compared to the traditional plug-in-the-wall pump I'd been using, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G375DHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010820_elvie-double-breast-pump-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07G375DHR&linkId=9e2f3255aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Elvie</a> felt downright invisible.&#160;&#160;</p><p>For me, it's an incredibly effective <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-breast-pump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breast pump</a>. I immediately went from pumping for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours to pumping a full feeding of 5 ounces on each breast in around five minutes. I'm not entirely sure why it's worked so well for me, but it seems to be a combination of the stimulation mode, suction seal, and the fact that I'm more relaxed using a hands-free pump.</p><p>While I prefer to use the manual controls on the Hub, the app is particularly handy if you need to switch back and forth between stimulation and expression modes — this cannot be controlled manually.</p><p>One of the most clever features is the IR energy sensor that automatically pauses pumping when the milk container is full — a big plus when you don't have a free hand. Knowing I can just pop the pump in and let it do the rest has been invaluable.&#160;</p><p>It's easy to switch out the milk container when pumping is paused. After removing the valve, the easy-pour spout makes pouring your milk into a storage bag or container simple and mess-free. I also like that you can easily see the milk container on the Elvie (unlike the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/product/willow-reg-generation-3-hands-free-wearable-double-electric-breast-pump/5468500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Willow Wearable Pump</a>), so I can peek to make sure the milk is actually flowing and readjust the pump or settings to ensure milk flow.</p><p>The battery charge lasts me through almost a whole day of pumping, which is typically four times a day.&#160;</p><h3><strong>How to clean the Elvie</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G375DHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010820_elvie-double-breast-pump-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07G375DHR&linkId=9e2f3255aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e1603edb2e66a18bb0dbd05?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Elvie Double Pump cleaning\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Aside from the Hub apparatus, I can conveniently wash all parts in the dishwasher.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chaunie Brusie/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></a></p><p>Aside from the Hub, everything is dishwasher safe on the top rack or can be cleaned and sterilized in boiling water or a microwave sterilizer. However, it's incredibly important to make sure all of the parts are completely dry before using them again — I've found that if the breast shield seals are even slightly wet, it will affect the suction.&#160;</p><p>The Hub itself should only be wiped clean with a damp cloth. I occasionally have some milk splash up onto the Hub and into its crevices but have found a soft toothbrush works to gently remove any dried milk.</p><h2><strong>Notes on milk overflow</strong></h2><p>Initially, I had some issues with milk overflow. Milk would back up into the plastic on the Hub, making it difficult to clean. After reaching out to customer service via email, I discovered I'd been using the wrong size breast shield. My output increased as soon as I switched shields, and my overflow practically disappeared.&#160;</p><p>The customer service representative also told me that after hearing from other users who experienced overflow, they released a firmware upgrade (1.7.0) in October 2019 to improve the milk volume algorithm and increase the accuracy of the overflow sensor. Since upgrading my firmware through the app, my overflow issue has completely resolved.</p><p>If users experience overflow, aside from getting in touch with customer service, the representative suggested wearing a dark-colored bra or shirt, as the color contrast helps the auto-sensor detect the lighter-colored milk.</p><h2><strong>Data privacy</strong></h2><p>I reached out to Elvie via email to ask about data privacy, and a company representative said all data is kept totally private and not shared with third parties. Their <a href=\"https://www.elvie.com/en-us/support/elvie-pump/legal-and-warranty-information/is-my-data-stored-securely-and-kept-confidential\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a> provides full details on how the data is stored anonymously. If you choose to operate the pumps manually without the app, be sure to open it periodically to check for software updates.</p><h2><strong>The cons</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G375DHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010820_elvie-double-breast-pump-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07G375DHR&linkId=9e2f3255aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e16032b24fe1216055351e7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Elvie Double Pump cons\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Elvie isn&#39;t completely discreet, a minor con for me.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chaunie Brusie/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></a></p><p>The downsides are very small in relation to how much I love this pump. First, I wish it came with a sturdy carrying case instead of two small velvet-like drawstring bags that aren't at all practical for carrying the pumps.</p><p>Second, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G375DHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010820_elvie-double-breast-pump-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07G375DHR&linkId=9e2f3255aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Elvie</a> isn't completely discreet. The pumping sound and the lights on the hub — which can't be turned off — are definitely noticeable. The lights shine through most of my shirts, and while it's a lot quieter than any other pump I've used, if you've ever pumped before and happen to be sitting near me, you'll definitely know what's going on. I'd feel comfortable using it in a noisier location where the sound would be masked, but not in a quiet setting.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>If you'll be pumping for any regular amount of time, the Elvie wearable breast pump is worth the investment. It truly gave me my life back, taking the hour-long feeding process with my baby down to minutes and giving me the freedom to pump on the go. I can enjoy the extra time I have with my baby <em>and</em> provide her with breast milk with confidence — a win-win.</p><p>If it's within your budget, I recommend getting the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G375DHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010820_elvie-double-breast-pump-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07G375DHR&linkId=9e2f3255aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2aeb79c80bd77052800c833c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Elvie Pump Double</a>, for convenience's sake.

If it's not possible to procure a second test after traveling, the CDC recommends increasing the period of essential-only outings to 10 days.&#160;</p><p>Throughout all of this, travelers should monitor themselves for common <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-coronavirus-symptoms-flu-allergies-common-cold-chart-2020-9\">symptoms of the virus</a> (fever, cough, fatigue, body aches). They also need to wear a mask and be vigilant about handwashing, social distancing, and ventilation when indoors.</p><p>People traveling who've tested negative for the virus should still assume they could catch or carry it.

Even a small percentage of travelers who may be sick, but without symptoms, could easily seed \"hundreds of thousands of additional infections, moving from one community to another,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>Besides, some of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moncef-slaoui-100-million-americans-vaccinated-by-march-2021-2020-12\">first coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for emergency use in the US in the coming weeks</a>, and as temperatures warm up in the spring, people will be able to gather together more safely outside again.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the US, said last month at the White House that vaccines should be available to the most high-priority groups, like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/healthcare-workers-long-term-care-residents-recommended-to-get-vaccines-first-2020-12\">healthcare workers and people in nursing homes</a>, beginning in late December.&#160;</p><p>\"Help is on the way,\" Fauci said.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-postpone-holiday-travel-or-else-get-2-tests-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1vu1lCMPTPA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 19:48:22 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fc7d25f037cbd00186135bd?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8461ce0999e126887e21657a28b36eb4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn72@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-48-849_82c794373755c879.webp","destWidth":1955,"destHeight":1466,"sourceBytes":165058,"destBytes":165058,"author":"hbrueck@businessinsider.com (Hilary Brueck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fbe746850e71a001155753d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-49-01-253_b709b8a0d3311611.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fbe746432f2170011f71220?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-58-777_8f3319b368deda4c.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fc7dcbc50e71a0011558755?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-57-851_a863a7e88eff9d77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-49-00-176_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn67@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-53-603_229fb75e68a62543.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-49-916_4808b59e163964a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-007_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1vu1lCMPTPA:4huVzenXI5g:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn71@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-59-959_82c917f4639650fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1vu1lCMPTPA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn51@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-51-733_3f9b2493d2261966.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963710037},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","title":"Republican Sen.

David Perdue has occasionally made at least 20 stock transactions in just one day, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/us/politics/david-perdue-stock-trades.html\">New York Times analysis</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>The report revealed that during his six years in office, Perdue carried out 2,596 trades, which makes up almost a third of all trades by senators over the same time period. Sometimes, that meant Perdue made 20 or more transactions in the span of a day, The Times noted.</p><p>The data comes as Perdue has faced public scrutiny over the past several months for potential conflicts of interest while stock trading as a member of Congress. He drew criticism in the spring after the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-david-perdue-bought-stock-company-producing-ppe-after-briefing-2020-4\">he bought stock</a> in a personal protective equipment company on January 24 — the same day he received a classified Senate briefing on the coronavirus. (The Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/politics/david-perdue-cardlytics.html\">reported last week</a> that the Justice Department had been investigating the senator's stock activity around the start of the pandemic; that case was dropped without charges.)</p><p>The Times details many other transactions Perdue made in his first term. While serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee's cybersecurity panel, Perdue bought and sold shares of a cybersecurity firm called FireEye, the newspaper found. He also bought and sold shares of companies such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Regions Financial, while a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which oversees those firms, the report noted.</p><p>One huge transaction in his portfolio, which the Justice Department reportedly looked into, involved a sale worth over $1 million in stocks of Cardlytics, a finance-advertising platform.&#160;</p><p>Perdue's office denied that the senator's stock transactions break any conflicts of interests and said that he doesn't directly manage his investments, according to The Times.</p><p>\"Senator Perdue doesn't handle the day-to-day decisions of his portfolio — all of his holdings are managed by outside financial advisers who make recommendations, set strategy, and manage trades and personal finances,\" John Burke, his campaign's communications director, told The Times.&#160;</p><p>When asked for comment, Burke referred Insider to his statement in The Times and added that Perdue's \"stock activity was reviewed by the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee, DOJ, and the SEC, all of whom independently cleared Senator Perdue of any and all wrongdoing.\"</p><p>Several other lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-republican-senator-dumped-shares-ahead-of-market-crash-2020-3\">similarly have gained national attention</a> for their <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-drops-probe-3-senators-dumped-stock-before-crash-2020-5\">trading activity</a> around the onset of the public health crisis, including fellow Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who also faces a runoff election on Jan. 5.</p><p>Perdue is also fighting to keep his seat in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-jon-ossoff-david-perdue-warnock-loeffler-2020-11\">the upcoming special election</a> in Georgia. His Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, has blasted the senator's stock trading on the campaign trail and labeled him a \"crook.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, Ossoff repeated the attacks in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ossoff/status/1334221527760375813\">retweet</a> of a CNN report highlighting The Times investigation.</p><p>\"Like I said: he's a crook,\" he wrote.&#160;</p><p>Perdue's spokesperson Burke pushed back on Ossoff's attacks, calling them \"entirely baseless.\"</p><p>The results of the two Georgia races will determine which party controls the Senate next year. President Donald Trump, who has refused to concede the 2020 presidential election, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-politics-georgia-david-perdue-adf4fe5b05bbcd0bc92968665303ba4a\">plans to travel</a> to the state on Saturday to campaign for both Perdue and

With phenomenal scriptwriting and acting, a 72-episode show like \"Un Village Fran&#231;ais\" will also give you the regular exposure you need to approach fluency. Best of all?

France Inter is a phenomenal resource with cultural, news, and even humor programs. Browse your favorite topics from history to politics to current events, and let the radio waves do the rest. And since these programs are available online, you can stop, rewind, and replay as many times as you need to ensure you've mastered what you've heard.&#160;</p>\n</div><div

government's Operation Warp Speed coronavirus vaccine initiative on Wednesday outlined the most ambitious timeline yet for vaccinating the most vulnerable Americans against COVID-19.</p><p>Moncef Slaoui, Warp Speed's chief advisor, predicted that 100 million Americans would be immunized by the end of February.</p><p>Twenty million Americans should be vaccinated in December, followed by 30 million more in January and 50 million more in February, the former pharmaceutical executive said in a press briefing.</p><p>By then, \"we will have potentially immunized 100 million people, which is really more or less the size of the significant at-risk population: the elderly, the healthcare workers, the first-line workers, people with comorbidities,\" Slaoui said.</p><p>His prediction is based on anticipated vaccine supplies from Pfizer and Moderna, the two vaccine frontrunners. Neither vaccine has yet received an emergency OK from US regulators, but both companies have submitted their shots to the US Food and Drug Administration for evaluation.&#160;</p><p>A former pharmaceutical industry executive, Slaoui was picked by the Trump administration in mid-May to guide the US effort to quickly develop coronavirus vaccines and treatments. He spent 30 years working at the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, where he developed 14 vaccines, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/health/2020/12/01/operation-warp-speeds-moncef-slaoui-guided-covid-19-vaccine-creation/6375043002/\">according to USA Today</a>. More recently, he served on the board at Moderna, but stepped down from that role when he signed on with Operation Warp Speed.</p><p>Slaoui, who's a registered Democrat, has taken pains to distance the Warp Speed program from political pressure. He has repeatedly said he would resign if he felt interference from political operatives.</p><p>Results from late-stage studies that enrolled tens of thousands of volunteers indicated that both vaccines <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-works-to-prevent-covid-19-company-says-2020-11\">were highly effective</a> — about 95% — at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 compared with a placebo. Questions remain about how durable that protection is and whether the vaccines <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vaccine-experts-pitch-asymptomatic-covid-19-vaccine-trials-2020-11\">also reduce transmission and prevent asymptomatic infections</a>.</p><p>The FDA is now reviewing both vaccine applications and is expected to issue decisions on emergency authorizations before the year's end. British health authorities <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-and-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-approved-by-uk-regulator-2020-11\">authorized Pfizer's vaccine</a> on Wednesday, making the UK the first Western country to approve a coronavirus vaccine.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-pfizer-biontech-historic-coronavirus-vaccine-program-2020-11\">How the pharma giant Pfizer teamed up with a little-known biotech to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine in record time</a></em></p><p>Warp Speed is prepared to start shipping doses to states within a day or two of an authorization decision, officials said.

But during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, its popularity has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/day-trading-boom-reduced-market-volatility-veteran-trader-says-2020-8-1029461086\">reached new heights</a>.&#160;</p><p>Many traders have become online celebrities. Perhaps you even know someone personally who's jumped on the trading train and you're wondering if you should climb aboard as well — as opposed to just feeding your 401(k) with each paycheck, or investing in the occasional mutual fund.</p><p>But it's important to understand that the words \"active\" and \"investor\" rarely belong next to each other.&#160;</p><p>Trading and investing are two different ways of approaching the stock market. With trading, you're hoping to earn quick returns based on short-term fluctuations in the market. Long-term investors, in contrast, tend to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-diversify-portfolio\">build diversified portfolios</a> of assets and stay in them through the ups and downs of the market.</p><p>Due to the high-stakes nature of trading and its inherent risks, many investors — especially individuals — may want to avoid it altogether. However, others may want to allocate some of their available funds towards trading and the rest towards long-term investing. Let's take a closer look at the basics of each strategy and their pros and cons.&#160;&#160;</p><h2>Investing basics</h2><p>Investing involves putting money into a financial asset (stocks, bonds, mutual or exchange-traded fund, etc). that you expect will rise in value over time. Investors generally have a long time horizon and predominantly look to build wealth through gradual appreciation and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-compound-interest\">compound interest</a> rather than short-term gains.</p><p>The shorter the time horizon, the higher the risk that you could lose money on an investment. That's why the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s<a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/sites/investorgov/files/2019-02/Saving-and-Investing.pdf\"> Office of Investor Education and Advocacy recommends</a> putting money in a savings account if you'll need to access it within three years. For all other goals, investing could yield much better returns. Some investors may even plan to hold onto their investments for multiple decades.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-diversification\">Diversification</a> (owning a mix of investments) is important for investors as it can reduce their risk — mainly by mitigating the effects of volatility (rapid, violent, or unexpected changes in values or price). Today, investors can achieve instant diversification through <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-mutual-funds-step-by-step-guide\">mutual funds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-etf-exchange-traded-fund\">ETFs</a> — single investment vehicles that hold a variety of or a large number of assets. It's also important to consider your risk tolerance and estimated withdrawal date when selecting your portfolio's asset allocation.</p><p>If investors do choose individual stocks or bonds, they'll typically look at fundamental indicators — that is, elements intrinsic to the issuing company, like its earnings, history, or creditworthiness. These factors help locate stocks that are undervalued (i.e. value investing) or have a chance to enjoy significant capital appreciation (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\">growth investing</a>).</p><h2>Trading basics</h2><p>Trading involves buying and selling stocks or other securities in a short period of time with the goal of making quick profits. While investors typically measure their time horizon in years, traders think in terms of weeks, days, or even minutes.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Two of the most common forms of trading are day trading and swing trading. Day traders buy and sell a security within the same trading day; positions are never held overnight. Swing traders, on the other hand, buy assets that they expect will rise in value over a matter of days or weeks.</p><p>In the world of trading, a stock's fundamentals are fairly irrelevant. Even if a stock's value is expected to go up over the long-term, that doesn't necessarily mean it will do so over the next few minutes, or even days. That's why traders tend to rely more heavily on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/category/technical-analysis\">technical analysis</a> of market movements and news reports to inform their trade decisions.</p><p>Trading can be a risky enterprise. If a trade goes against you, you can lose a lot of money in a short period of time. And traders often increase their risk by using leverage — that is, borrowing money or buying assets with money they don't yet have. Options, trading on margin, or short selling are all ways of leveraging.</p><p>Famous traders often appear more skilled and knowledgeable than the \"little guy\" (or gal). And while it's true that some traders are more proficient at reading charts and performing technical analysis than others, no one can accurately predict every trade. Celebrity traders can (and do) lose big on trades too.</p><p>If you're interested in trying your hand at trading, taking small position sizes (that is, not spending a big amount) can reduce your risk of losing big on any one trade. Other tips include setting a stop-loss order that will automatically execute if the asset drops below a certain price (thereby limiting your losses).</p><h2>Is one better than the other?</h2><p>Although they both involve the financial markets and assets, trading and investing are really two different activities, with different aims. So comparisons and generalizations are tricky.</p><p>Overall, though, trading is riskier for two reasons:&#160;</p><ul><li>It involves a lot of speculation — that is, quick decisions, educated guesses and just plain gambles.</li><li>It demands minimal (or no) diversification since it's difficult to monitor more than a few trades at the same time. Also, diversification by its \"evens-out\" nature mitigates both the ups and the downs — and traders want the maximum highs they can get.</li></ul><p>However, it should be noted that trading can also mean higher returns. Investors may hope to earn 8% to 10% on their portfolio per year. But a trader may hope to earn that much or more per <em>month</em>. Even traders who earned \"just\" 5% per month would end up with an uncompounded annual return of 60%.</p><p>For these reasons, it's difficult to crown either strategy as the \"best\" way to approach the stock market. If you have a low <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/category/risk-tolerance\">risk tolerance</a> and want to avoid volatility, investing will be the way to go. But if you're more of a risk-taker and would like the chance to earn big returns fast, trading could be appealing.</p><p>It's important to understand that trading and investing don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive. For example, you may choose to invest 90% of your money in a diversified portfolio that you'll hold onto for the long haul and earmark the other 10% — your play money, in effect —for short-term, speculative trading.</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>Trading can be a thrilling way to earn quick cash. However, like with gambling, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/day-trader-made-million-lost-it-all-cautionary-tale-investing-2020-7-1029383192\">it can also quickly lead to big losses</a>. Investing usually means smaller short-term wins, but also fewer severe losses.</p><p>If you're comfortable with the risks, trading with a portion of your money can be enjoyable and could lead to profits. If reducing risk and exposure to volatility are your main goals, then you'll want to stick with long-term investing. But if you're saving for a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/financial-goals-guide-2017-6\">financial goal</a> that you hope to reach by a specific time, a slow-and-steady investing approach is usually best.</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-common-stock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">What is common stock?

new for the organization</a>, though it surprised experts and contracts some research.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The WHO said the updated guidelines, which include tightened mask-wearing advice in situations other than exercise, are based on the latest research, though more is needed. Masks, it reiterated, aren't a silver bullet but need to be used as a part of a comprehensive plan to defeat the novel coronavirus.&#160;</p><h2>You don't need to wear a mask to the gym, the WHO said, but ventilation and distancing are key&#160;&#160;</h2><p>There's not a lot of research on the pros and cons of wearing masks during exercise. But the WHO pointed out that some studies have shown wearing them during mild to moderate physical activity can lead to significant negative cardiovascular and pulmonary effects in both healthy people and those with underlying respiratory diseases.&#160;</p><p>People who wear <a href=\"https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2019/06/picking-a-respirator/\">respirators</a> while exercising, as well as those who have diseases like asthma and COPD and wear any mask while working out, seem to fare worst.&#160;</p><p>As such, WHO said \"people should not wear masks during vigorous intensity physical activity because masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably.\" <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters?gclid=Cj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhpthNY14yzhplJc5NsW1_lACiWKcsmU5Gm3OsY4Dfkk6Ofl4-k8joiQaAh8JEALw_wcB#exercising\">On the \"mythbusters\" section of its website</a>,the organization adds \"sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.\"&#160;</p><p>The organization says in the new report that good ventilation and physical distancing of at least three feet during workouts is paramount. If gyms can't guarantee distancing, ventilation, and proper disinfection, they should consider closing temporarily, the WHO said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc7dec950e71a0011558763?format=jpeg\" alt=\"WHO says don&#39;t wear masks while exercising\" height=\"512\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">World Health Organization</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>The advice contradicts other research and expert input&#160;</h2><p>A gym in Virginia exemplifies how aspects of WHO's strategy can work. <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/how-gym-prevented-outbreak-after-coach-got-covid-19-2020-11\">The facility worked with member Dr. Linsey Marr</a>, an airborne viral transmission expert, to ensure stellar ventilation, which included opening all its warehouse doors. They also distanced exercisers and didn't require masks.&#160;</p><p>When one trainer became infected with COVID-19, theoretically exposing 50 gym-goers, none got sick.</p><p>But one of the reasons the gym is a success story is likely its distance between exercisers: 10 feet, as opposed to the WHO's recommended three.&#160;</p><p>When people are breathing heavily, expelling potentially contagious particles into the air, even six feet might not be safe, Marr previously told Insider's Gabby Landsverk.</p><p>\"It's likely that higher intensity exercise is riskier because people produce more aerosols when they're breathing faster and harder,\" Marr said. She recommended trying to visit the gym when it's least crowded and to wear a mask if it doesn't seem to have good ventilation.&#160;</p><p>Another expert, Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency-medicine physician at Brown University, told Insider the WHO's new guidance is \"terrifying.\"&#160;</p><p>\"That just makes no sense,\" she said. \"There have been studies showing that face masks don't actually inhibit breathing or [oxygen levels] during exercise.\" <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201105112934.htm\">One small study</a>, for instance, showed that healthy exercisers' blood and muscle oxygen levels weren't affected when performing the same fitness test with a cloth mask, medical mask, and no mask.&#160;</p><p>\"Our findings are of importance because they indicate that people can wear face masks during intense exercise with no detrimental effects on performance and minimal impact on blood and muscle oxygenation,\" the researchers wrote in a press release.&#160;</p><p>Meantime, <a href=\"https://wgme.com/news/local/this-is-a-common-sense-measure-maine-cdc-addresses-questions-about-mask-mandate\">some jurisdictions</a> in the US have mandated masks in gyms, and <a href=\"https://www.planetfitness.com/newsroom/press-release/planet-fitness-require-face-masks-all-locations-effective-august-1\">many gym chains</a> have done the same.&#160;</p><h2>The WHO tightened its mask-wearing guidance in other areas&#160; &#160;</h2><p>In non-exercise situations, the WHO tightened its stance on masks.</p><p>In healthcare settings in areas with community transmission, everyone should wear them, including outpatients and visitors, the WHO said. Inpatients should wear them when leaving their area or when physical distance can't be maintained.&#160;</p><p>The organization still recommends that healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients wear N95-type masks when performing procedures that could generate aerosols. They should wear medical masks otherwise.&#160;</p><p>In places with \"known or sporadic\" transmission, healthcare workers should wear medical masks when patients are present, the WHO said.&#160;The organization also said healthcare workers shouldn't wear respirators with valves, since those allow exhaled air to bypass the filtration system.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f19c82a3f737059fc2686d1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"medical coronavirus flu virus nyc street face mask gloves covid19 stores shut down closed restaurants social distancing delivery cox 233\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The WHO said the general public should also wear non-medical masks both inside public places and outside when physical distancing isn't possible. Even if it is possible indoors, masks should be worn unless there's sufficient ventilation.&#160;</p><p>If you're having visitors, WHO said wear a mask if you can't maintain distance or ensure good ventilation.&#160;</p><p>WHO also recommended people at higher risk for serious COVID-19 complications, like those over 60 and those with conditions like heart disease, chronic lung disease, or cancer, wear medical masks when they can't maintain physical distance. Caregivers or housemates of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should also wear medical masks when in the same room.&#160;</p><h2>Kids over 12 should follow adult mask-wearing guidance&#160;</h2><p>WHO also addressed mask-wearing in kids, saying that kids over 12 should follow the same advice given to adults. Younger kids should wear a mask on a more case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors like whether they live with vulnerable people or are able to wear one appropriately.&#160;</p><p>Kids 5 and younger don't need to wear masks as \"source control,\" or in an effort to block COVID-19 transmission at its source, WHO said. Evidence suggests young kids' risks of spreading the virus to other kids and adults is low.&#160;</p><p>Finally, the updated guidance touches on the best homemade mask materials: An inner layer that absorbs, and middle and outer layers that repel moisture. The WHO discourages masks with valves.&#160;</p><p><em>Business Insider Senior Science Reporter <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/author/aria-bendix\">Aria Bendix</a> contributed to the

News</a>.</p><p>The companies received over 25 Paycheck Protection Program loans worth more than $3.65 million, the report said.</p><p>The newly released data from the Small Business Administration comes after NBC News and 10 other news companies sued the agency for the release of information on more than 5 million loans that were given out. Congress and the Trump administration earlier this year dedicated nearly $700 billion to PPP loans, which were intended to help small businesses stay afloat and retain workers during the economic disruption caused by COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>But since the Treasury Department's rollout in the spring, the program has drawn criticism over risks of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/banks-report-record-amount-of-suspected-business-fraud-during-ppp-2020-9\">fraud</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ppp-loans-high-risk-fraud-waste-abuse-coronavirus-economic-stimulus-2020-9\">abuse,</a> and there were several instances of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/large-companies-returning-small-business-paycheck-protection-program-loans-2020-4#lawmakers-demanded-that-five-public-companies-return-paycheck-protection-loans-on-may-8-just-one-biopharmaceuticals-company-mimedx-complied-immediately-the-other-four-include-quantum-evo-transportation-and-energy-services-gulf-island-fabrication-and-universal-stainless-and-alloy-products-1\">large companies</a> applying for and benefiting from the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nursing-homes-poor-quality-ratings-millions-ppp-loans-coronavirus-2020-8\">emergency funds</a>.&#160;</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/01/ppp-sba-data/\">Washington Post analysis</a> on Tuesday showed that more than half of the relief money went to just 5% of recipients. National food chains such as Uno Pizzeria &#38; Grill, Boston Market, and Cava Mezze Grill, as well as law firms and churches, were among the hundreds of larger businesses that received the maximum amount of $10 million allowed under the program, The Post reported.</p><p>Fifteen of the Trump Organization- and Kushner Cos.-owned properties reported that they kept either one employee or no employees, or did not report at all how many workers were kept on their payrolls, according to NBC News.</p><p>Two tenants at Trump Tower in New York received a PPP loan of over $100,000, NBC News reported. Still, they kept only three jobs. Similarly, four tenants at 666 5th Avenue, which is helmed by Kushner Cos., got more than $204,000 but held on to only half a dozen jobs, NBC News said.</p><p>The Triomphe Restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City got a $2,164,543 loan, according to NBC News. The business didn't retain any workers and subsequently shut down.</p><p>Meanwhile, LB City Inc., a company at the Kushner family's New Jersey Bungalow Hotel, retained 155 jobs after acquiring a loan of over $505,500, NBC News reported.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The notion that Kushner Companies somehow improperly benefited from CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans is completely untrue and amounts to nothing more than politically motivated nonsense,\" Christopher Smith, the company's general counsel, told Insider in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added: \"Exactly two Kushner Companies' hotel operations affiliates received PPP loans. Every provision of the PPP program has been comprehensively abided with respect to each of the two loans — and every penny of the funds received from the program was utilized to fund employee payroll and benefits costs to maintain jobs imperiled by the COVID pandemic and associated lockdown measures.\"</p><p>The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-organization-kushner-companies-3-million-ppp-loans-pandemic-report-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oXW_sqKHY-M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:17:35 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fc7e983037cbd0018613673?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"6518b458a1e1d370777263aa8f53c82c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-49-795_38fc3b078cafd45e.webp","destWidth":4432,"destHeight":3324,"sourceBytes":1261968,"destBytes":1261968,"author":"oseddiq@insider.com (Oma Seddiq)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fc7e993037cbd0018613674?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn75@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-49-03-088_b802ca0dc8771d3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-49-00-176_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-49-03-027_c86ce4d9c77eb2d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn79@2020_1/2020/12/03/02-48-54-759_841ef7a0b65972aa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-007_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oXW_sqKHY-M:ZMx9I_n8dGU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-48-50-763_5bf94dab4b4bed11.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oXW_sqKHY-M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_5/2020/12/03/02-49-00-342_ca749d83604108a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963709988},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","title":"The US will give Americans paper cards to remind them of their second COVID-19 vaccine dose, but will leave further messaging to states and pharmacies","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-paper-reminders-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-2020-12","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc7e062037cbd001861361e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Trump Gustave Perna Warp Speed\" height=\"1662\" width=\"2217\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Donald Trump and US Army Gen.

The designs were once common on<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/arts/08iht-sckutch08.html\"> ceremonial clothing and bed covers throughout India</a>.&#160;</p><p>Today, the Khatri family says they are the only artisans left in the world practicing this traditional craft.</p><p>The base of the paint is castor oil, and it's what gives the art its name — Rogan means oil in Farsi.&#160;The oil is heated over a fire for two days until it becomes a honey-like texture. Then, it's combined with crushed pigment to create the paint.&#160;</p><p>The painting process involves just two tools: a metal stylus and a hand. Abdul Gaffur Khatri, the eldest of the family business, swirls the paint in his hand to create heat and thin it out. He then floats the threat of paint over the fabric using the metal stylus.&#160;</p><p>While he has an idea of the final design in his mind, the painting process is completely freehand.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"The perfect thread out of this color, which can run on cloth, is in the mind of the artist,\" Khatri told Business Insider. \"It is all God's gift. It cannot be done by everyone or by any machine.\"</p><p>Khatri can finish some pieces in five days, while more complex designs can take him up to two years. Larger wall art pieces can cost over $1,000.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc8115f037cbd0018613788?format=jpeg\" alt=\"BIT_Rogan_Art_Youtube_CMS_Yahoo_FB_V1.00_00_28_08.Still006\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A metal stylus and one&#39;s hand are the only things needed to create Rogan art.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Prakhar Jain for Business Insider Today</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The Khatri family normally sell their pieces to tourists in the town of Bhuj, about 25 miles from the small village of Nirona, where they work. This year, the pandemic put a strain on their peak season.&#160;</p><p>\"I can tell you that we have incurred losses because tourists didn't come, and this business depends on them. There's no other source. So what do we do?\" Khatri told Business Insider, \"Now we are just waiting and watching to see what will happen next.\"</p><p>The struggle feels familiar — the rise of mass produced textiles in the 1980s forced many artisans to drop their crafts and look for more lucrative work. Khatri made the hard decision to leave the family business and search for opportunities in Mumbai.&#160;</p><p>\"In 1980 I decided that I will not waste my life on this art,\" Khatri told Business Insider, \"And there were some arguments in the family due to that because at that time sending a kid from a village to Mumbai was a big deal.\"</p><p>Khatri returned to his village just a few years later after his family plead with him to carry on the tradition.&#160;</p><p>\"I remember at that time I promised him that I'll dedicate my whole life to this art,\" Khatri told Business Insider. \"And now I can say that promise is complete.\"</p><p>Since then, the Khatri family has brought rogan art to the international level. They've earned over 10 awards for their work, and India's Prime Minister even gifted one of their pieces to President Barack Obama in 2014.</p><p>Now, the family uses social media and education to spread awareness about this rare art form. Since starting a program in 2010 to grow and diversify the village's Rogan artists, they've trained around 300 women, 20 of whom went on to work for the family.&#160;</p><p>Though they've since had to lay off those employees due to the pandemic, they plan to hire them back when business returns to normal.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

six months to confront the economic and health crises. The overall spending in the latest rescue package, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-908-billion-munchin-romney-collins-2020-12\">introduced on Tuesday</a>, is less than a third of the $3.4 trillion plan they sought in May.</p><p>Sen.

They've gotten reasonable, and I think that could help us get to a solution.\"</p><p>Congress has increasingly faced pressure to act as coronavirus cases rise nationwide and several emergency rescue programs to aid unemployed people are set to expire in just over three weeks.</p><p>President-elect Joe Biden has also recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-democratic-stimulus-plan-congress-republicans-negotiations-2020-11\">urged lawmakers</a> to pass another aid package before they adjourn on December 11.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-908-billion-munchin-romney-collins-2020-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"7726b1e9a60ba2187bf80f59e4d93e25\">Lawmakers just unveiled a $908 billion coronavirus stimulus deal that would boost unemployment payments and help small businesses. Here's what's in the package</a></em></p><p>The measures in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-908-billion-munchin-romney-collins-2020-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short-term plan introduced on Tuesday</a> include:</p><ul><li>$300 federal weekly unemployment benefits retroactive from December 1 until at least March</li><li>$240 billion in new Paycheck Protection Program assistance for small businesses</li><li>$160 billion in funding for state and local governments</li><li>$51 billion in new healthcare and vaccine-related funds</li><li>A temporary liability shield for businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits</li></ul><p>The plan was introduced by Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia; Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.</p><p>The proposal was sparse on details other than overall spending levels, though lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-908-billion-munchin-romney-collins-2020-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">took questions from reporters</a> about the deal on Tuesday. Manchin, one of its key negotiators, told reporters on Wednesday that the formal text of the interim rescue package was expected to be ready as early as Monday.</p><p>\"I don't think there's anything else out there that can give us the relief the country needs,\" Manchin said.</p><p>The plan left out a second round of $1,200 direct payments for taxpayers, likely in an effort to keep its price tag below $1 trillion. Many GOP senators have been reluctant to support an expensive plan, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/deficit-stimulus-republicans-biden-senate-budget-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">citing the rising budget deficit</a>. A round of checks like the ones distributed earlier this year would cost about $300 billion.</p><p>The plan didn't address a range of federal programs set to expire this month, including the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for gig workers and a moratorium on evictions. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millions-could-lose-unemployment-aid-by-december-without-coronavirus-stimulus-2020-11\">12 million Americans</a> are at risk of losing their jobless aid this month.</p><p>McConnell dismissed the plan on Tuesday and pressed for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-coronavirus-senate-mcconnell-500-billion-vote-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lower spending</a> similar to a relief measure unveiled twice, in September and October.</p><p>The Kentucky Republican <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-republicans-stimulus-plan-extra-federal-unemployment-benefits-2020-12\">circulated a new version</a> of the $500 billion package among Republicans on Wednesday. It didn't include any additional funding for federal unemployment benefits, and it would extend aid programs for gig workers and state benefits for a month beyond December 31. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonFSchneider/status/1334178894338023430?s=20\">bulk of the funding</a> would be directed to small businesses, then to schools.</p><p>Many economists and Federal Reserve officials have urged Congress to pass a new relief bill.

Its engine cut off several meters above the surface, allowing it to make a slow, gentle landing.</p><h2>The first time collecting moon rocks since 1976</h2><p>The lander's robotic arm is programmed to drill about 6 feet into the lunar surface to collect 4.4 pounds of lunar rock and dust from a previously unexplored region: a volcanic plain called Mons Rümker. The material could provide new information about the moon's past volcanic activity.</p><p>The robotic arm should then transfer the sample to an ascent module sitting on top of the lander. With the sample secure, that module should lift off to rendezvous with the mission's orbiter, which is currently circling the moon with its Earth-reentry module in tow.

But there was a catch: a $299 \"deposit\" they had to pay up front.</p><p>That deposit should have been a red flag, six influencer industry experts told Business Insider.

When we started asking questions, it shut down.</a></strong></p><p>With a cautionary tale like this, the first red flag was the deposit. But industry experts said there are other things influencers looking for representation should watch out for.</p><h3>Here are a few things influencers should consider before signing with any manager, according to industry insiders:</h3><ul><li><strong>Carefully consider if you are really ready for a manager. </strong>Signing with management, especially if an influencer is not yet a full-time creator, doesn't always make sense financially. \"We tell people all the time: You need to be working pretty heavily before, or at least significant enough to warrant an agent or a manager,\" said Lynsey Eaton, a cofounder of the talent management agency Estate Five.&#160;</li><li><strong>The manager-influencer relationship is supposed to be mutually beneficial.</strong> \"It's not a transactional process,\" said James Nord, the founder and CEO of Fohr, an influencer-marketing platform that connects brands and creators. \"It's a courtship. This person is essentially becoming part of your team.\"&#160;</li><li><strong>Ask questions about their process and how they work with influencers. </strong>When first considering signing with a talent management agency, influencers should ask questions like \"How quickly do you respond to emails?\" or \"What kind of transparency can I get into what you're doing?\" Nord said.&#160;&#160;</li><li><strong>Request references and case studies. </strong>Asking for references is an important first step, according to Nord. But go beyond the references they provide, since they're likely to recommend the most flattering reference, he added. Most agencies will also have a roster of influencers, either as a document or included on a website, that prospective influencers can reach out to. Case studies that demonstrate past partnerships are also helpful, said content creator and influencer coach Lissette Calveiro.</li><li><strong>Check out the agency's website and social-media presence.&#160;</strong>Do they have an active, authentic social-media presence? Do they have any articles written about them or their work (that weren't paid for)? These are a few things that Calveiro also suggested influencers look at before signing anything.</li><li><strong>Be wary of mass emails that feel generic.</strong> Managers don't typically send out mass emails to influencers looking for new talent, according to Neon Rose's Cutler. \"If it's not personalized, that's a big red flag,\" said Calveiro, who had been reached out to herself by IQ Advantage.</li><li><strong>Never pay a deposit and avoid cash apps like PayPal, CashApp, Zelle, or Venmo. </strong>Not only are deposits a red flag, according to experts, but the AIC's Smith Bruneteau also advises that influencers get as much banking information as possible so that if needed, they can pursue legal action, such as through small-claims court.</li></ul><h1><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/influencers-say-talent-management-firm-iq-advantage-failed-on-promises-2020-11\">Subscribe to Business Insider to read the full story.</a></h1><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-influencers-should-know-before-signing-with-a-talent-manager-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/s-qIM5ryGrg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 20:39:03 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8f19c59e9fe4001900a620?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"c55ef533ce62c985b824ad9a78d5b44e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-37-481_0670af6613047a9c.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":100724,"destBytes":100724,"author":"sbradley@businessinsider.com (Sydney Bradley)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8f19c59e9fe4001900a620?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/03/02-48-37-481_0670af6613047a9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-49-00-176_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-56-098_5391ae3ea5f4d86a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_2/2020/12/03/02-48-52-054_d4b830f47594d047.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-007_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=s-qIM5ryGrg:zEu02erpIqQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_6/2020/12/03/02-48-53-111_c920769d6c62e1ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/s-qIM5ryGrg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_3/2020/12/03/02-48-56-930_f078cf79aef61c49.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606963710044},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 10:48:30","title":"Billionaires Steven Cohen and Dan Sundheim just struck a $700 million deal to take a collectibles company private — and it could be a brilliant move into an increasingly popular niche market","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-cohen-collectors-universe-collectables-dan-sundehim-nat-turner-2020-12","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb42c7f402d49001924f604?format=jpeg\" alt=\"steve cohen\" height=\"2332\" width=\"3110\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>FILE PHOTO: Hedge fund manager Steven A.

Nat Turner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.&#160;</p><h2>This deal has the potential to legitimize sports and trading cards as an investment asset, according to an expert&#160;</h2><p>Robb Petrozzo, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rally-prive-porter-to-sell-stock-in-hermes-birkin-bags-2020-2\">cofounder and chief product officer of the investment platform Rally</a>, told Business Insider that buying memorabilia, specifically within the sports category, has been on the rise in the past few years, and the overall toy category has proven to be a class that is both better yielding and more \"interesting\" than standard investment funds.&#160;</p><p>\"There is this emotional connection and passionate investment from something that you recognized from childhood or from a good moment in your life,\" Petrozzo told Business Insider.</p><p>This latest deal, Petrozzo said, speaks to the potential of the sports card and memorabilia space, \"not just in terms of collecting, but in terms of legitimizing the data associated with the asset class, the investment-worthiness of memorabilia, and the potential mass-market opportunity for hobbyists and institutions alike.\"</p><p>With this deal, Petrozzo said Collectors Universe has the potential to expand from primarily grading and cataloging into a \"full-service platform\" that can support the entire collecting journey, \"from the data that validates the creation of new products all the way through the sale in the primary and secondary market.\"</p><p>\"The big-name, low-population early cards in mint condition are still where the big money goes,\" he said, citing such names as Kobe Bryant, Mickey Mantle, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan. In a volatile market, he said, prices tend to stabilize faster for those names, even when they see corrections, as collectors quickly buy them on the way down, or on the dip. Original Pokemon sets and Michael Jordan Rookie cards are continuing to see strength, with 300%-plus returns since the start of 2020, Petrozzo said.&#160;</p><p>Over time, many childhood items become hard to find, which also increases their investment value, he said, pointing to wrestling memorabilia as an example:&#160;</p><p>\"What you'll see is that a Hulk Hogan mint-condition rookie card from his WWF days will skyrocket in value,\" Petrozzo said. \"What's happened is that all the figures and elements, all those ancillary items from his rise to fame in sealed condition are extremely hard to find.\"&#160;</p><p>\"The same collectors who are buying mint-condition cards might now be sitting on a $20,000 or $30,000 Hulk Hogan card,\" he continued.&#160;</p><p>And though collecting toys and memorabilia as an asset class is still in its \"first inning,\" Petrozzo said he expects the investment value of this asset class to only rise. It seems Steven A. Cohen is betting on that, too.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

On Wednesday, NASA confirmed that the object, formerly known as 2020 SO, is the booster of a Centaur rocket that launched in 1966.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc7f9aa037cbd0018613705?format=jpeg\" alt=\"centaur rocket second stage\" height=\"1536\" width=\"2048\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A researcher prepares a Centaur 6A second-stage rocket for a series of tests in the Space Power Chambers&#39; vacuum tank at NASA&#39;s Lewis Research Center in 1964.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-GRC-1964-C-71099\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The rocket carried the Surveyor 2 mission, which was set to land on the moon, but went into a death spiral when one of its thrusters failed to fire with the others. Surveyor 2 crashed into the lunar surface, but the rocket booster had separated from the spacecraft shortly after pushing it towards its lunar destination. The booster then drifted, unseen, into the abyss of space.</p><p>Now Earth's gravity has briefly captured the rocket booster once again, like a tiny moon orbiting our planet. It's set to loop Earth twice before escaping the planet's pull in March 2021. Then it will continue on a new orbit around the sun.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc7ec9b037cbd001861369a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2020 so rocket booster orbit\" height=\"670\" width=\"1168\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The orbit of 2020 SO, sped up a million times faster than real time.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7783\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL-Caltech</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Its Tuesday flyby was the dead booster's closest approach to our planet.</p><p>A telescope on the Hawaiian island Maui first spotted the new space object in September. Its orbit seemed unnatural, following unusually close to Earth and remaining within the same plane as our planet. Most asteroids have tilted orbits, dipping above or below Earth as they journey around the sun.</p><p>\"I was suspicious immediately,\" Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/science/nasa-rocket-orbit.html\">told the New York Times</a>.</p><p>Like Chodas, many scientists had suspected that this object was the Surveyor 2 booster, since reverse simulations of its orbit placed it so close to Earth in September 1966 that it could have easily come from our planet.</p><p>To test the theory, scientists used a NASA telescope on Hawaii's Maunakea to watch 2020 SO as it flew past Earth. They logged the object's spectrum data — wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that act like fingerprints for objects in space. Different wavelengths represent different chemical compounds.</p><p>Scientists then compared the 2020 SO spectra to that of a known Centaur rocket booster, which has been orbiting Earth since it launched a satellite in 1971. The fingerprints matched.</p><p>\"This conclusion was the result of a tremendous team effort,\" Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who led the study, said in a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-data-confirm-2020-so-to-be-the-upper-centaur-rocket-booster-from-the-1960-s\">press release</a>. \"We were finally able to solve this mystery.\"</p><div

Whereas equity investors can buy a \"basket of stocks,\" it's harder for crypto investors to load up on multiple coins.
