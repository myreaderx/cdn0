(I have a couple reports from readers that suggest this is not true, so I am remaining skeptical at the moment.)</p>\n<p>I have not received this email, but several readers have. I have included a copy at the end of this post. If you are a regular B&#38;N customer, I strongly urge you to ask your credit card company place security checks on your cards just in case.</p>\n<p>On a related note, B&#38;N is still getting their systems back up and running again. In fact, the Nook servers are still down as of late Wednesday night.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Barnes &#38; Noble Customer,</p>\n<p>It is with the greatest regret we inform you that we were made aware on October 10, 2020 that Barnes &#38; Noble had been the victim of a cybersecurity attack, which resulted in unauthorized and unlawful access to certain Barnes &#38; Noble corporate systems.</p>\n<p>We write now out of the greatest caution to let you know how this may have exposed some of the information we hold of your personal details.</p>\n<p>Firstly, to reassure you, there has been no compromise of payment card or other such financial data. These are encrypted and tokenized and not accessible. The systems impacted, however, did contain your email address and, if supplied by you, your billing and shipping address and telephone number. We currently have no evidence of the exposure of any of this data, but we cannot at this stage rule out the possibility. We give below answers to some frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>We take the security of our IT systems extremely seriously and regret sincerely that this incident has occurred. We know also that it is concerning and inconvenient to receive notices such as this. We greatly appreciate your understanding and thank you for being a Barnes &#38; Noble customer.</p>\n<p>Barnes &#38; Noble<br />\nFAQ</p>\n<p>1. Have my payment details been exposed?<br />\nNo, your payment details have not been exposed. Barnes &#38; Noble uses technology that encrypts all credit cards and at no time is there any unencrypted payment information in any Barnes &#38; Noble system.</p>\n<p>2. Could a transaction be made without my authorization?<br />\nNo, no financial information was accessible. It is always encrypted and tokenized.</p>\n<p>3. Was my email compromised?<br />\nNo. Your email was not compromised as a result of this attack. However, it is possible that your email address was exposed and, as a result, you may receive unsolicited emails.</p>\n<p>4. Was any personal information exposed due to the attack?<br />\nWhile we do not know if any personal information was exposed as a result of the attack, we do retain in the impacted systems your billing and shipping addresses, your email address and your telephone number if you have supplied these.</p>\n<p>5. Do you retain any other information in the impacted systems?<br />\nYes, we also retain your transaction history, meaning purchase information related to the books and other products that you have bought from us.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/10542402@N06/\">MikeKalasnik</a> via <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/10542402@N06/7259367826/\">Flickr </a></p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/14/barnes-noble-is-now-informing-customers-about-data-stolen-during-saturdays-hack/\">Barnes &#038; Noble is Now Informing Customers About Data Stolen During Saturday&#8217;s Hack</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=2knJpKJ7luI:Lx9b9M_WCH0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=2knJpKJ7luI:Lx9b9M_WCH0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=2knJpKJ7luI:Lx9b9M_WCH0:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/2knJpKJ7luI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 03:22:53 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7259367826_8370e07d31_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1","linkMd5":"6ff80662d4495d7e7bda6145459bae54","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-32-625_6e5b2384840771f7.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":15816,"destBytes":15816,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7259367826_8370e07d31_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-32-625_6e5b2384840771f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn60@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-38-599_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn32@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-50-515_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-44-39-060_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/2knJpKJ7luI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn78@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-48-712_f688434b0c395d38.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866672325},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:32","title":"How to Set Up a Bookstore on an Author Website: The Beginner’s Guide","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=141281","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-141286\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?zoom=2&#38;resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 1240w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?zoom=3&#38;resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I launched my <a href=\"http://authorwebsiteinabox.com/\">Author Website in a Box</a> project last June, one of the first questions that came across my inbox was how to build a bookstore on the AWinaBox site. My answer at the time was to recommend using a third-party service such as Payhip to handle payment processing and ebook delivery.</p>\n<p>That was sound advice, albeit lacking in detail, but I knew I can do better.</p>\n<p>When I launch AWinaBox 2.0, my answer will be to tell authors to use the template that will come bundled with the project. That launch is still a couple months away, so in the mean time I thought it might be useful to lay out the basic steps for setting up that bookstore so that everyone could use the info.</p>\n<p>I am just going to lay out the broad strokes here, and later come back and add the finer details.</p>\n<p>The following project is moderately difficult and requires a modicum of skill, but if you can build a page on your and you can embed a FB Pixel, you can set up a bookstore on an author website.</p>\n<p>The first step is to set up an account at Payhip.</p>\n<h2>Payhip</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://Payhip.com\">Payhip</a> is not the only company that will handle payments and content delivery, but their platform is relatively easy to learn, they&#8217;re not too expensive, and they cover all the basics. If you&#8217;ve never done this before, Payhip is a good place to start.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up your account, including your payment info.</li>\n<li>Create a listing for each title you want to sell. Upload the cover, title, blurb, and the relevant ebook files.</li>\n<li>Proof all of your listings to make sure there are no errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be sure to save the cover and the blurbs because you will need them later when you build the bookstore on your site.</p>\n<p>Oh, and BTW, I feel I should point out that you can sell ebooks by sending people to Payhip to buy them. I do not think that&#8217;s a good idea; IMO the Payhip pages have a terrible design which hurt my eyes, and I don&#8217;t think that they sell very many ebooks.</p>\n<p>Instead, I think you should sell ebooks on your author website itself using the buy buttons and other code provided by Payhip.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you will make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Your Site</h2>\n<p>Before I tell you to build anything, I should probably point out that if you have a page with all your books in rows, you can add the Payhip buy buttons to the existing page (and save yourself a lot of work).</p>\n<p>Also, if you have each of your books on its own page, you could also add the Payhip buy buttons to each book&#8217;s page. This i not my preference, however; I want all the books on one page.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have those pages, here&#8217;s how you set up a bookstore page.</p>\n<p>Start by creating a new page on your site. Give it the name of &#8220;My Bookstore&#8221;, and add a subtitle which gently reminds visitors that you make more money when they buy direct.</p>\n<p>Below that you will need to make a row for each of your books. You&#8217;ll need to add the cover, the book blurb, and buy buttons so that they look something like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-141285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?resize=620%2C333&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?resize=620%2C333&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?resize=250%2C134&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?resize=150%2C81&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?resize=768%2C413&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?w=1077&#38;ssl=1 1077w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>That first button is going to be the Payhip button (it uses Payhip&#8217;s ocde), and the other buttons lead to other retailers.</p>\n<p>BTW, you do not have to use buttons (I just have a preference for them). In fact, it might be easier for you to instead use text links. I am finding that getting all the buttons to play nice requires finicky CSS, where text links are much less complicated.</p>\n<p>In any case, you will need to add a row for each book to the bookstore page. You&#8217;ll need to make sure the covers match the blurbs, and that the buttons link to the right retail pages.</p>\n<p>Does this make sense? Does it help?</p>\n<p>Any questions?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/shelbychicago/\">greencandy8888</a> via  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/shelbychicago/3617890489/\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/16/how-to-set-up-a-bookstore-on-an-author-website-the-beginners-guide/\">How to Set Up a Bookstore on an Author Website: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=5FolKKITKKY:hf8fPeFIsD4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=5FolKKITKKY:hf8fPeFIsD4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=5FolKKITKKY:hf8fPeFIsD4:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/5FolKKITKKY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 04:29:53 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1","linkMd5":"86d9574b79cf22f27039f886b1f74105","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn7@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-32-703_a691eecfcf684333.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":42902,"destBytes":42902,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3617890489_e0a4794a48_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn7@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-32-703_a691eecfcf684333.webp","https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bookstore-row.jpg?resize=620%2C333&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn24@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-44-38-551_68c49c901ceaef4b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn60@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-38-599_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn32@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-50-515_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-44-39-060_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/5FolKKITKKY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-38-522_b7bc8e6399abb672.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866672325},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:32","title":"How to Set Up Daily Website Backups – the Right Way","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=141243","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-141257\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?resize=620%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?resize=620%2C465&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?resize=250%2C188&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?resize=150%2C113&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?resize=768%2C576&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/46716405932_fcab236794_k.jpg?w=2048&#38;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Daily backups are one of the fundamental tools every website owner should have in their toolbox. Not only will it let you fix your mistakes by letting you restore a backup copy of the site, and gives you a quick way to rescue your site when it gets hacked, but it also gives you a way to repair a site should some piece of code spontaneously decide to crash your site.</p>\n<p>All this is true, and yet Hopper only knows why daily backups are not de rigueur with most WordPress hosting companies. Sure, a few companies such as WP Engine and SiteGround do offer daily backups as a standard feature, but most do not.</p>\n<p>I handle daily backups for all the sites I <a href=\"http://writesitehosting.com/\">host</a> and for all the clients I work with.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to take care of your site for you, but in the meantime why don&#8217;t I share the back up tool I use with WordPress sites, and explain how you can install it.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This post only applies to self-hosted WordPress sites, and not sites hosted on WordPressDotCom. If your site is on WordPressDotCom, you don&#8217;t really have any backup options (that should worry you, yes).</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please let me know if any of this is unclear so I can explain and then fix the post.</p>\n<p>My preferred backup tool is called <a href=\"https://ManageWP.com\">ManageWP</a>. It&#8217;s a Godaddy product that is designed to let techs like me manage multiple WordPress sites from a single dashboard. It has dozens of features, most of which I don&#8217;t use. I really just use it for backing up and updating WP sites.</p>\n<p>I use ManageWP over other backup plugins because the backups are stored elsewhere. The last month&#8217;s worth of backups are kept, giving me many options should I need to restore a site.</p>\n<p>It will cost you $2 per month to have ManageWP run daily backups of your site. (Unless your site is hosted by Godaddy, in which case this is free.) I think it&#8217;s worth the money for two reasons: you don&#8217;t have to remember to do it and the backups are stored elsewhere (they don&#8217;t take space on your hosting account, and are beyond the reach of any hacker that gains control of your site).</p>\n<p><strong>The first step</strong> to setting up backups is to create an account on <a href=\"https://managewp.com/\">ManageWP.com</a>. You will need to provide your email, and you should go ahead and give them your billing info so that when you do activate backups, you can simply click the green button and get started right away.</p>\n<p>Once you have your ManageWP account set up, open a second browser tab, and visit your site&#8217;s admin pages.</p>\n<p><strong>The second step</strong> involves installing the ManageWP plugin on your WordPress site. Navigate to the Install Plugin menu on your WordPress site, and enter &#8220;ManageWP&#8221; into the search box. Find the ManageWP plugin in the search results, and click the &#8220;Install plugin&#8221; button.
