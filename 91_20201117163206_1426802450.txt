Perfectly in line with a prediction from <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/lcd-led-oled-tvs/tv-trends-to-watch-for/\">Consumer Reports</a> at the end of 2019, Black Friday 2020 brings an influx of affordable 65-inch, 75-inch, and sometimes over 80-inch TVs on sale for even less. People are growing out of their mid-sized TVs and looking to upgrade to something bigger and better. On the other end, factories have been optimized to make larger LCD sheets. When something becomes easy for the manufacturer to make, it gets cheaper. Finding a 65-inch 4K TV for less than $500 is weirdly common.

And what's come of that split is the first MacBook Air to feature the company's very own in-house chip: <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/what-m1-chip-means-for-you-apple/?utm_campaign&#38;utm_context=textlink&#38;utm_medium=rss&#38;utm_source\">the M1</a>.&#160;</p>\n<p>Now, I know what you may be thinking &#8212; didn't Apple <em>just </em>come out with a MacBook Air? <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/macbook-air-2020-review/?utm_campaign&#38;utm_context=textlink&#38;utm_medium=rss&#38;utm_source\">Yes, yes it did</a>. Consider that one Intel's swan song for Mac.</p>\n<p>Even though Apple hardware like the iMac and iMac Pro have always been praised for their processing power, Intel's chips have come with their own set of challenges, including production delays, limited software customizability, and higher power consumption. Now, not only can Apple operate on its own schedule, but it also has the freedom to push the envelope on its own computers &#8212; be it for features, availability, or performance.&#160; <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/macbook-air-m1-chip-2020-review/\">Read more...</a></p>More about <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/apple/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&#38;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/macbook-air/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&#38;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Macbook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/tech/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&#38;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Tech</a>, and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/consumer-tech/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&#38;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Consumer Tech</a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Mashable/~4/P8ImrEZs7yg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-macbook-air-m1-chip-2020-review.jpg","linkMd5":"81101c65aad26437836a726c523c18ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-39-642_0cc85fe57fda6697.webp","destWidth":950,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":42180,"destBytes":29792,"author":"Brenda Stolyar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-macbook-air-m1-chip-2020-review.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-39-642_0cc85fe57fda6697.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Mashable/~4/P8ImrEZs7yg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-49-810_1b1bfbdab41f183f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630699285}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:39","feedId":91,"fetchDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:31:39 +0000","fetchMs":55,"handleMs":608,"totalMs":27288,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":30,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"f42b8cb4d741106f4ab03176c69fdc97","hostName":"us-032*","requestId":"9d38a3b1e0c84fde98d2d5853f746eeb_91","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":1037318,"bgimgsTotal":22,"bgimgsGithubTotal":22,"articlesImgsTotal":54,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":54,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx8":2,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx7":2,"myreaderx16":2,"myreaderx6":2,"myreaderx32":2,"myreaderx10":2,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx33":2,"myreaderx3":2,"myreaderx11":2,"myreaderx12":2,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx13":2,"myreaderx30":2,"myreaderx31":2,"myreaderx18":2,"myreaderx19":2,"myreaderx":2,"myreaderx25":2,"myreaderx27":2,"myreaderx21":2,"myreaderx22":2,"myreaderx23":2,"myreaderx24":2,"myreaderx5oss":2,"myreaderx29":2},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:24:47","id":91,"name":"Mashable","url":"http://feeds.mashable.com/Mashable","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://mashable.com/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn4@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-24-42-014_fe8a4585ea9fe76b.jpg","description":"Mashable is a leading source for news, information & resources for the Connected Generation.
