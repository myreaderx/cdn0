His name is Bryan Doerries and he’s the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949729/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0307949729&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Theater of War</em></a>, as well as the artistic director of <a href=\"https://theaterofwar.com/about/core-team\">an organization of the same name</a> that performs dramatic readings of ancient tragedies for the military and other communities. Bryan and I begin our conversation with what tragedies are, what this civic, religious, and artistic form of storytelling was supposed to do, how it was created by war veterans for war veterans, and how a civilian classicist ended up putting on these plays for current and former members of our modern military. We discuss how the ancient Greek tragedies depicted the depth and spectrum of human suffering, the intersection of fate and personal responsibility, characters who belatedly discover their mistakes, and the fleeting chance of changing behavior in the light of such realizations. Bryan also explains how the tragedies may have been a form of training for young people on how to grapple with the moral ambiguities that mark adulthood. And throughout the show, we dig into how tragedies, by showing people they’re not alone, getting them to confront uncomfortable realities together, and bridging divides, can serve as a transformative technology for collective healing, not only for military veterans, but anyone who’s dealt with trauma, loss, and the general confusions and hardships of the human experience. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Athens’ 3 great writers of tragedy </li>\n<li>The difference between what’s happening on stage and what’s going on in the audience </li>\n<li>How tragedy helps us process grief and shared trauma </li>\n<li>The intersection of fate and responsibility </li>\n<li>Childhood, the sins of the father, and the shaping of our lives</li>\n<li>The healing power of tragedies </li>\n<li>Do these plays offer more than just catharsis?</li>\n<li>How these tragedies can help us navigate discomfort </li>\n<li>The powerful tale of Ajax </li>\n<li>The way that tragedies can touch people from every walk of life </li>\n<li>Where do we find the answers to the questions these plays ask?</li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed_Army_Medical_Center_neglect_scandal\">Walter Reed neglect scandal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/great-conversation-the-great-books/\">Why You Need to Join the Great Conversation About the Great Books</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/leaders-reading-list/\">The Leader’s Bookshelf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-217-the-importance-of-having-a-tribe/\">The Importance of Having a Tribe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/grief-pandemic-david-kessler/\">How the Stages of Grief Can Explain What You’re Feeling in the Pandemic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486268772/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0486268772&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Oedipus Rex</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/male-spirituality-richard-rohr/\">Father Wounds and Male Spirituality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-299-manly-according-ancient-greeks-romans/\">What the Ancient Greeks and Romans Thought About Manliness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-primer-on-greek-mythology-part-i-the-gods-and-goddesses/\">A Primer on Greek Mythology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-189-the-classical-education-you-never-had/\">The Classical Education You Never Had</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-every-man-should-study-the-ancient-classics/\">Why Every Man Should Study Classical Culture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U4UXSKK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B00U4UXSKK&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">All That You See Here Is God</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130341\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/theaterwar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/theaterwar.jpg 357w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/theaterwar-320x493.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Bryan and Theater of War</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://theaterofwar.com/about/core-team\">Theater of War website</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

The men of Easy Company, 506 PIR, 101 Airborne, had been tasked with holding the line in the most difficult situation imaginable. With thinned ranks, those who were still alive waited for the order to liberate the town of Foy the next day. But they’d already reached the breaking point.</p>\n<p>For weeks they’d been shellacked by enemy artillery and machine gun fire. Two days earlier they’d lost Sergeant Muck and Private Penkala when a shell landed directly on their foxhole. A week prior, Sergeants Toye and Guarnere had each lost a leg in an intense attack. Those were only the latest losses in the company’s third major campaign since D-Day. </p>\n<p>At the first foxhole, Lipton crouched low and discovered a soldier sitting in the snow, massaging his foot, trying to keep blood flowing so it wouldn’t freeze. Lipton lit a match and checked the foot’s color. Waxy yellow and mottled. Not good, but okay for now. </p>\n<p>The man’s boots had been sent out for repair when the company had last been on reserve in Mourmelon. But new orders had arrived before the boots were finished. Hitler was launching a massive last-ditch offensive, later known as the Battle of the Bulge. So the men of the 101st had rushed toward the town of Bastogne to join the defense. The soldier had no choice but to wrap burlap bags around his feet for the fight. Lipton brushed snow from the man’s shoulder and moved on. </p>\n<p>At the next foxhole, Lipton arrived just as two soldiers were spooning up mouthfuls of thin bean soup from their canteen cups. The soup was cold. Maggots wriggled at the bottom. Food was always in short supply on the line. Lipton grinned and remarked that the additional protein would help keep them strong. They chuckled and offered him the last wormy bite. </p>\n<p>At the next foxhole, Lipton found three soldiers muttering among themselves about a new replacement officer. Lieutenant Norman Dike had little frontline combat experience, yet he’d been ordered to lead the company. Whenever shelling started, Dike disappeared. </p>\n<p>Lipton challenged the men to imagine themselves in Dike’s shoes and see what a hard job the new lieutenant faced. Besides, they had no choice but to keep going under Dike’s command. Complaining wouldn’t help. </p>\n<p>That was only one evening out of many. Fortunately, Lipton survived the attack on Foy and the Battle of the Bulge and went on to live a full life, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/24/us/c-carwood-lipton-81-figure-in-band-of-brothers-dies.html\">dying in 2001 at age 81</a>. </p>\n<p>In 2009, while working on a book about the Band of Brothers, I interviewed several veterans who’d fought with Lipton. They said Lipton’s dependability and positive outlook helped keep hope alive. I interviewed Lipton’s son, Mike, who described his father as a fortress of stability and peace. I poured through unpublished journals that Lipton had written about his wartime years, which only confirmed what I heard. </p>\n<p>Lipton had indeed encountered great difficulties as a leader, yet his life was marked by an ability to stay positive and encouraging. His example can inspire us today, as this past year has borne witness to much discouragement and loss for so many. In any weighted and weary season, it’s tempting to act out, complain, or succumb to dismay. Yet the people who remain steady — either by personality or choice — find themselves a welcomed refuge for others. </p>\n<p>In the spirit of Carwood Lipton, these leaders slip from foxhole to foxhole within their sphere of influence, always encouraging people as they go. They listen and help keep people focused. They point people toward empathy and work to become peacemakers. They refuse to heap up criticisms by adding their own. They focus on solutions and help people walk through hard times with dignity and strength.</p>\n<p>Lipton’s unflappability didn’t go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of WWII, in the cross-river fight at the city of Haguenau, Lipton was wounded in his neck and cheek by a mortar shell. He hiked to the aid station to get patched up then rejoined his unit the same day. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-way-of-the-monastic-warrior-lessons-from-major-dick-winters/\">Captain Dick Winters</a> (who’d soon be a major) awarded Lipton a battlefield commission to second lieutenant. </p>\n<p>This commission — and the steadfastness of character it recognized — came to define much of Lipton’s life, although he never seemed to see the greatness of his own assets. A scene in the HBO miniseries <em>Band of Brothers</em> reflects the strong cool-headed humility that Lipton had exhibited in real life. </p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-130325\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/movie-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/movie-1.jpg 400w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/movie-1-320x181.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></img></p>\n<p>During the battle of Foy, the capable Lieutenant Ron Speirs had been ordered to remove the ineffectual Lieutenant Dike from command and take over as the new company commander of Easy. The miniseries shows Lipton talking with Speirs afterward about the change of leadership. </p>\n<p>“These men are glad to have you as our C.O.,” Lipton said. “They’re happy to have a good leader again.” </p>\n<p>“From what I’ve heard, they’ve always had one,” Speirs answered. “There’s always been one man they could count on. He led them into the Bois Jacques. Held them together while they had the crap shelled out of them. Every day he kept their spirits up, kept the men focused, and gave them direction — all the things a good leader does.” Spiers paused, looked at Lipton, and added, “You don’t have any idea who I’m talking about, do you?”</p>\n<p>“No sir.” Lipton shook his head. </p>\n<p>“Hell,” Speirs said. “It was you.”</p>\n<p>_____________________________</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.marcusbrotherton.com/\">Marcus Brotherton</a> has written four books about the Band of Brothers: </em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/38qxx13\">Shifty’s War</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JNN7tr\">A Company of Heroes</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Ii8KRW\">We Who Are Alive &#38; Remain</a><em>, and </em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/32uTTuD\">Call of Duty</a><em> with Lt.

Morgan kicks off our conversation by explaining how doing well with money is less about what you know and more about how you behave, and illustrates this point by comparing the true stories of a janitor who saved millions and a prominent Wall Streeter who went bankrupt. He then explains how the seemingly crazy decisions people make around money actually make a kind of sense. From there we get into why you need to know the financial game you’re playing and not play someone else’s. We then turn to why it’s hard to be satisfied with your position in life when your expectations keep rising and why not continually moving your goalposts is the most important skill in personal finance. We discuss how getting off the never-ending treadmill of wanting more requires seeing money not just as a way to buy stuff but to gain greater autonomy, keeping the “man in the car paradox” in mind, and understanding the distinction between being rich and being wealthy. We then talk about the underappreciated, mind-boggling power of compound interest, using the example of Warren Buffet, who made 99% of his wealth after the age of 50. We then discuss why you should view volatility in the stock market as a fee rather than a fine, why pessimistic financial opinions are strangely more appealing than optimistic ones, and why it’s best to split the difference and approach your money like a realistic optimist.

The push-up works multiple muscles in a single movement: chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. It requires no special equipment and can be done anywhere, anytime. But while most people have been doing push-ups since their first P.E. class, mastering the subtleties of correct technique can help you get the most out of this exercise. In this illustrated guide, we walk you through those subtleties from beginning to end. Pay attention to the details and push your way through to a stronger upper body.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve mastered the standard push-up, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/4-tips-for-getting-more-out-of-your-push-ups/\">here’s what to do when the muscle-gaining results you get from them plateau</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/push-ups-exercises/\">35+ variations to work into your routine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Like this illustrated guide?

At first, the term felt a little cringey and self-indulgent, something used largely amongst women-focused lifestyle blogs to rationalize booking a spa day and by the wellness industry to sell pampering products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if self-care has sometimes been overused as a buzzword, its fundamental premise is still quite sound. In any time, the frustrating, stressful, anxiety-ridden, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sources-of-existential-angst/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">existential-angst-generating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nature of modernity can wear a person down, and the past year has only highlighted this fact all the more acutely. Consequently, folks have come around to the idea that to stand a chance of keeping your head above water, practicing self-care is vital — for both women and men alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, despite the penetration of self-care into the cultural zeitgeist, you still struggle with feeling like it’s sissified, indulgent, or simply not something for which you have time, it’s helpful to realize that men with arguably the most pressure-filled job on earth — serving as leader of the free world — made time for self-care. While they wouldn’t have called it that, many American presidents pursued habits, pastimes, and hobbies that were intentionally designed to ameliorate their stress and rejuvenate their mental and physical faculties. They didn’t do so </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">despite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the taxing nature of their work, so much as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of it; rather than being selfish, these practices allowed presidents to “</span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-sharpen-the-saw/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sharpen the saw</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” restoring their ability to function in their demanding duties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below we highlight five examples of the way past POTUS-es did self-care, as inspiration for prioritizing your own.</span></p>\n<h3>Abraham Lincoln — Theater</h3>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had never seen Shakespeare performed on the stage until he became President. After that he rarely missed an opportunity. In February and March 1864, at one of the most dangerous periods of the war, he took time off from his duties to see the great tragedian Edwin Booth perform in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard III, Julius Caesar, The Merchant of Venice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamlet</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. —David Herbert Donald, </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/068482535X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=068482535X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lincoln</span></i></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Abraham Lincoln became a fan of literary drama, especially Shakespeare, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-libraries-of-famous-men-abraham-lincoln/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amidst the dogged self-education he undertook as a youth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, opportunities to see these works performed on the stage were virtually non-existent for him before arriving in Washington to serve as president. From then on, however, theatergoing became a regular source of escape and entertainment — even when, in fact especially when, the turmoil of the Civil War deepened. It’s estimated that Lincoln attended over 100 plays during his time as president, or, on average, about once every other week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lincoln always went to the theater with a friend or adviser, eschewing his security detail’s near-constant warnings against being in crowds of any sort. These outings weren’t slyly about politics or strategy; they were about socializing and Lincoln getting the chance to remove his thoughts from the war. As </span><a href=\"https://www.fords.org/blog/post/big-dresses-and-wilder-crowds-theatregoing-in-lincoln-s-time/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the Ford’s Theatre Foundation notes: “Theatres were places people could forget their everyday lives and concerns.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about how immersive the experience of going to a theater is — the darkness, combined with the stage lighting, focus your attention almost like blinders on a horse. At the end of a long show, you come out of the theater almost in daze, wondering what time it is and how the hours passed so quickly — and, hopefully, enjoyably. One can picture the lanky president coming out of the theater with a smile on his face, having relieved his stresses, even if just for a few hours. It is, of course, the saddest of ironies that his life was taken from him in a theater — a place he so loved — right when he was first able to appreciate the closing of the war years. </span></p>\n<h3>Rutherford B. Hayes — Genealogy</h3>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have an attack of genealogical mania. It came on about ten days ago, superinduced by reading a family tree which a friend sent me. It is in a violent form but I trust it will soon abate. —Rutherford B. Hayes, in a letter to a relative</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll be forgiven for doing a double take at the name of our 19th president. In most polls, he’s actually among the least recognized of our country’s 44 chief executives. He served a single term — by his own choosing — in the midst of Reconstruction, from 1877 to 1881. His election was one of the most contested and corrupt in history; until 2000, Hayes was the only candidate to lose the popular vote but win the electoral college. The nation was still trying to heal itself from the Civil War, and the Gilded Age of full-throttled industrialism was just beginning to gain steam (literally, in the form of the steam engine). Hayes had plenty to concern himself with, and yet found time to pursue his lifelong passion: genealogy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, it’s easy to think of genealogy as a mostly sedentary pursuit; just head to ancestry.com and let the internet do most of the work for you. In the 19th century, it wasn’t nearly so passive. From a young age, when he first met his extended relatives, Hayes developed his passion for exploring his own ancestry, which later in life expanded to include an interest in his wife Lucy’s family tree as well. This involved writing a flood of letters addressed to unknown people in far-flung places, as well as a lot of traveling to visit libraries and genealogical societies. Hayes’ research wasn’t just about gathering names and filling in lines on his family tree, either; he wanted to actually meet and converse with the relatives he came to identify. It was a pastime that filled his soul to the brim, especially when he could get away to take part in reunions and various heritage festivals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his pre-political life and retirement were the most fruitful periods for his hobby, he did find entire days at a time during his governorship of Ohio and as president to roam the countrysides and find more genealogical branches. Though he wasn’t a great president, perhaps Hayes’ knowledge of his family’s past contributed to both his optimistic nature and largely corruption-free tenure in the White House. </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/memory-moral-every-man-genealogy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Brett and Kate wrote regarding the practice of genealogy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “It makes you think more about the choices you’re making now and how they might affect your posterity.”</span></p>\n<h3>Herbert Hoover — Fishing</h3>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herbert Hoover was never more at peace than he was standing in an Oregon stream in search of rainbow trout or trolling off the coast of Florida for fighting fish. Public service was his vocation, but fishing was his respite from a hectic world. —Senator Mark Hatfield </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the presidents, perhaps none were as committed to and enamored with their pastimes as Herbert Hoover was with fishing. The love affair started early in Hoover’s life, when he roamed the Iowan prairies and streams he grew up on, sometimes hauling in over 100 fish in a single outing. Those experiences cemented a passion that was truly lifelong, lasting up until his death in his late eighties. No mere hobbyist, Hoover became an expert fisherman who, as one biographer observed, “mastered nearly every kind of freshwater and saltwater fishing,” and even wrote a book on the subject, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006AYN8E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0006AYN8E&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Fishing For Fun — And to Wash Your Soul</a>.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his time as president is often ridiculed, before that Hoover was a superb businessman and one of the true administrative heroes of World War I. His level-headedness and optimism — which served him well before his presidency, but rather poorly during the Great Depression — can be attributed to his time spent in the great outdoors. He said it himself, “This civilization is not going to depend upon what we do when we work so much as what we do in our [own] time.” How we spend the latter feeds and informs the quality of the former. As regards fishing, Hoover truly believed that the qualities cultivated by the master angler mirrored those that were needed in broader society: patience, optimism, realism, humility, and respect.</span></p>\n<h3>Franklin D. Roosevelt — Nightly Cocktail Hour</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serving for over 13 years and in the midst of two of America’s most monumental crises — the Great Depression and World War II — meant that Franklin Roosevelt needed a lot of recuperation time, especially given his already poor health. He took frequent one- and two-week fishing vacations, read mystery novels at night, and most memorably, hosted a nightly cocktail hour in which all talk of war and politics was barred. Franklin often whipped up the drinks himself (even during Prohibition), making them strong and experimenting with different liquors and mixers rather than sticking to a single favorite. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These gatherings allowed FDR to, as one researcher put it, “cast aside the burdens of his office and socialize with friends and associates.” Eleanor, owing to both a childhood steeped in alcoholism and her more dour personality, wasn’t a fan of her husband’s cocktail hours, as she felt the time could be better used to discuss important policies and plans for the nation. But Franklin found them beneficial enough to his mental health to continue hosting them up until his death in office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As could only be expected, the rule that banned any political or strategic conversation was not strictly followed every day. You get enough political people in a room together, and the subject will naturally come up. Nonetheless, the very idea of it kept the heavy topics from dominating; more idle subjects of interest included the latest books/movies, DC social gossip, and whether the local Senators baseball team had a chance at the pennant (the answer, in those years, being a confident “no”). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doris Kearns Goodwin was such a fan of FDR’s practice, which she discovered while writing a biography of him, that she adopted it herself; one of the ways the historian and author escapes the anxieties of work is by planning social events with friends and family on an almost nightly basis, with the same rules applied: for a few hours each evening, talk of work or politics is banished.</span></p>\n<h3>Dwight D. Eisenhower — Golf </h3>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without golf, he’d be like a caged lion, with all those tensions building up inside him. If this fellow couldn’t play golf, I’d have a nut case on my hands. —Major General Howard Snyder, Eisenhower’s personal physician </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While William Howard Taft wasn’t the first president to golf, he was the first to be open about it, bringing the game to the masses where it had previously been known only as a sport for aristocrats. Since then, only two presidents — Truman and Carter — have stayed off the links. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As common as the prevalence of golfing amongst presidents, is the criticism they receive for it. Disparagement of a president for golfing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too much</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to a degree that, observers argue, must surely detract from his official duties, has become more common in the last 12 years, but Ike certainly wasn’t immune to it during his tenure as POTUS more than a half century ago. On an annual basis, he did in fact golf more than President Trump (and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">far</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more than President Obama,</span> <a href=\"https://presidentialgolftracker.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for those keeping score</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). He hit the course twice every week, and most afternoons found him literally puttering around the White House lawn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Democrats used this image of a golf-happy Eisenhower to condemn him as a “do-nothing president.” Yet Harry Truman, who himself had criticized what he perceived to be Ike’s lackadaisical approach to leadership, defended his successor on this score: “To criticize the President . . . because he plays a game of golf is unfair and picayunish. He has the same right to relax from the heavy burdens of office as any other man.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, golf provided an essential release valve for one of Ike’s weaknesses: <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/leadership-lessons-from-dwight-d-eisenhower-2-how-to-not-let-anger-and-criticism-get-the-best-of-you/\">a famously fierce temper</a>. His stress and anger would often build up so strongly that his psychic turmoil would manifest itself in a number of physical maladies, from frequent gastrointestinal problems to multiple heart attacks later on in his public career. The guy clearly needed to take a load off, and golf helped him do that; as Jean Edward Smith notes, the game was “as necessary to [Eisenhower’s] mental health as a good night’s sleep.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it wasn’t a solo hobby for him; joining Ike on the links for over 20 years was his “Gang.” They were an intimate group of friends who knew of his health and temper problems and sought to make those few hours out of doors as enjoyable and leisurely as possible. Though political talk wasn’t entirely escapable, it cannot be denied that the game of golf improved his mood, his decision making, and his physical health, which ultimately allowed him to cement a place among the top 10 American presidents. </span></p>\n<h3>Some Concluding Thoughts  </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my research of these men I found that their self-care practices shared some notable characteristics that can offer a few lessons applicable to us all:</span></p>\n<p><b>1) Do things that offer a change of pace from your typical work.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For these presidents, their self-care practices offered a pivot from the work they had to do as POTUS to a different stripe of activity. From orchestrating the real-life drama of war, to spectating the fictional drama of theater. From sitting in an office, to sitting along a river bank. From talking politics to talking baseball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leisure time isn’t as rejuvenating when it’s too similar to work time: going from staring at a screen to edit spreadsheets, to staring at a screen to scroll through social media, doesn’t provide a sufficiently refreshing change of pace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note too that these presidents’ pastimes weren’t entirely passive pursuits; they necessitated effort (even Lincoln’s theater habit required going out instead of staying in), skill, and/or attention. The goal of a self-care practice is not necessarily physical or mental loafing, but to ease the burden of whatever is causing you anxiety — to get your mind off of one thing and onto another. As an old saying goes, “A change is as good as a rest.”</span></p>\n<p><b>2) Make socialization part of your self-care.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most of these pastimes were done socially, and in a number of cases, that was part of the entire point. For Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Eisenhower, the pastime itself was nice, but not complete without the social and conversational aspect. Social connections help lighten our burdens. So while hobbies, and self-care in general, are often thought of as solo pursuits, and certainly sometimes should be, don’t discount the power of doing them with others too.</span></p>\n<p><b>3) Pursue multiple outlets for self-care. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While people often have one activity they’re most passionate about, living a well-rounded and psychologically resilient life requires developing a rich and varied “portfolio” of interests. Though I featured just a single pastime for each of the above men, there were others that could have been mentioned: Eisenhower enjoyed painting and playing bridge; Lincoln read voraciously and loved telling stories/jokes (especially bawdy ones!); and as mentioned above, Roosevelt enjoyed frequent fishing vacations. The presidents also invested in their relationships with family and friends. </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-build-your-life-upon-multiple-pillars-of-support/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their lives were constructed on multiple pillars of support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>4) Create your own personal self-care routine. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of these men’s pastimes were different, as each of their personalities was different. Don’t copy the specific activities of these routines (unless you’re also interested in those things), rather, adopt the general insight that every man needs time — often quite a bit of time, or at least more than you’d perhaps expect — to rejuvenate his spirit. Find a few things you personally like and pursue them, knowing and appreciating that they’re for your unique mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My own self-care includes walking and hiking, baking, and reading (a lot!) and writing my newsletter (though I also read and write a lot for my job, reading and writing for pleasure instead of work offers a satisfying change of pace). Each of those pastimes include individual and social elements: I often walk around the neighborhood alone, but hike the local mountain trails with my wife, kids, and other friends and family; the time I spend with books is nearly always done alone, but I share what I’ve been reading in </span><a href=\"https://bookdude.substack.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my weekly newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and discuss it in a book club with local friends; and even though baking is most often just me in the kitchen with a beer and a podcast, the goods that come out of the oven are always distributed far and wide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though pursuing my hobbies and interests can sometimes feel selfish and frivolous in the moment, and like there isn’t enough time to do something just for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, those are invariably the most refreshing and rejuvenating moments of my days and weeks. When I ignore them on a regular basis, I get tense, anxious, and cranky, and my family notices it. Those “selfish” self-care routines are as crucial to your well-being, and your family’s, as everything else you do. <br></br>\n_________________</span></p>\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/068482535X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=068482535X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Lincoln</em></a>, by David Herbert Donald</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JD0XD02/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B00JD0XD02&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Rutherford B.

This is true on both an institutional and individual level: it’s more exciting to build a new road than to maintain it; more exciting to lose weight than to keep it off. There’s plenty of short-term pleasure and intrinsic motivation when it comes to pursuing something novel, but the effort to keep up unsexy maintenance on what we’ve already got takes real intent. </p>\n<p>My guest today says we’ve lost that intent and need to revive it. His name is <a href=\"http://leevinsel.com/about\">Lee Vinsel</a> and he’s a professor of science, technology, and society, the co-founder of The Maintainers, a research network dedicated to the study of maintenance, repair, upkeep, and ordinary work, and the co-author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525575685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0525575685&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Innovation Delusion: How Our Obsession With the New Has Disrupted the Work That Matters Most</em></a>. Lee and I begin our conversation with how our cultural focus on innovation has come at the expense of attention paid to maintenance and repair, and yet how talking more about innovation hasn’t really led to greater progress. We then get into the way the necessity of maintenance, repair, and caretaking has been neglected in business and government, creating a situation where we keep on building new things without investing in the upkeep of our current infrastructure. From there we turn to the way our all too common neglect of maintenance applies not only to big institutions, but also our personal lives, as in the areas of home ownership and health. We discuss how there’s less incentive these days to repair things in our disposable society where everything is cheap, and stuff is harder to fix, even when we want to. We end our conversation with how we can revive a maintenance mindset in our culture and individual lives. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Why does innovation get the focus, to the detriment of maintenance?</li>\n<li>Innovation vs. innovation-speak </li>\n<li>The difference between progress and innovation </li>\n<li>The ways in which life hasn’t changed much in the last handful of decades </li>\n<li>Why is maintenance neglected?</li>\n<li>The incentivization of short-term gains</li>\n<li>What happened to the higher status of maintenance jobs? </li>\n<li>Why is it so hard to keep our nation’s roads maintained?</li>\n<li>Ownership, right to repair, and the breakability of things</li>\n<li>Getting to a maintenance mindset</li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476708703/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1476708703&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Innovators</em></a> by Walter Isaacson</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-630-the-strategy-paradox/\">The Strategy Paradox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google Ngram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/decadent-society-douthat/\">The Boring Decadence of Modern Society</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-649-thinking-for-yourself-in-an-age-of-outsourced-expertise/\">Thinking for Yourself in an Age of Outsourced Expertise</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/blue-collar-trades-career/\">Finding Money and Meaning in the Blue Collar Trades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/reviving-blue-collar-4-myths-about-the-skilled-trades/\">AoM series on reviving blue collar work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.strongtowns.org/staff\">Chuck Marohn and Strong Towns</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-i-finally-made-flossing-a-habit/\">How I Finally Made Flossing a Habit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/4-reasons-you-should-learn-how-to-repair-your-own-furniture/\">4 Reasons You Should Learn to Repair Your Own Furniture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/climate/right-to-repair.html\">Right to Repair Movement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/mike-rowe-interview/\">My interview with Mike Rowe</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130206\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/innovation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/innovation.jpg 331w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/innovation-320x483.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Lee</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://themaintainers.org/\">TheMaintainers.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://leevinsel.com/about\">Lee’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/STS_News\">Lee on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

If you just know the basics of how to use one to find direction, they can be useful for finding your way; <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/orienting-with-a-map-compass/\">if you know how to orient yourself by pairing a map with your compass</a>, you can do a lot more. </p>\n<p>Even when someone does know how to use a compass, however, they don’t always understand how this device actually works.</p>\n<p>All magnets have two sides, a north pole and a south pole. Each side emits a magnetic field that pulls at opposing poles. When magnets stick together, it’s because of the attraction between north and south poles. When magnets push away from each other, it’s because two like poles (north to north or south to south) are being forced toward each other. As they say, it’s opposites that attract.</p>\n<p>The earth itself is a giant magnet. Think of the North and South Poles. Essentially, any magnet on earth is drawn to align itself with the earth’s magnetic field. Compasses work by taking advantage of the earth’s magnetic field. The problem is, that force is fairly weak. So, a magnet sitting on a table will keep sitting on the table instead of flying through the wall to see Santa.</p>\n<p>But, when weak magnets are placed in environments where they aren’t impeded by friction, the force of the earth’s magnetic field is strong enough to move them. And when they do move, they’ll align with the earth’s magnetic poles.</p>\n<p>When you look at a compass needle, the part that points north is actually the south pole of the compass’ magnet being attracted to the earth’s North pole, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Once you understand the principles of how compasses work, you’ll understand the principles of how to make your own: create a magnet and place it in a low-friction environment. Creating your own compass is a fun science craft to do with your kids, and a nice way to practice a survival skill. With the basic mechanics down, you can use whatever materials you might have on hand in a pinch; for example, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-men-love-the-story-of-the-great-escape/\">the prisoners who participated in WWII’s “Great Escape” manufactured hundreds of compasses by magnetizing slivers of razor blades and making cases from melted and repurposed phonograph records</a>. If outdoors, a compass can be made by laying a magnetized nail, paperclip, or safety pin on a leaf floating in water.</p>\n<p>One classic, simple way to create a DIY compass is by using just an old cork, a sewing needle, and a dish of water; it’s a design that mimics the first compasses used in China during the Song dynasty, over a thousand years ago. Here’s how to do it.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Make a Compass</span></h3>\n<h3>Step 1: Make a Cork Disk</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129699\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-6.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-6-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-6-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img></p>\n<p>Cut the end off a cork, about 1/4-inch thick, so that you end up with a disk.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Magnetize the Needle</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129698\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-5.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-5-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-5-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img></p>\n<p>Rub the tip of a sewing needle against a magnet, making all your strokes in the same direction. Any magnet will do, but the stronger it is, the better. With a strong magnet, you may only need to make a few strokes with the needle. If all you’ve got is a standard refrigerator magnet, rub the tip of the needle against it up to 50 times. Your needle is now magnetized. </p>\n<h3>Step 3: Push the Needle Through the Cork</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129697\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-3.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-3-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-3-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img></p>\n<p>Push the needle through the edge of your cork disk and through the other side. You may want to use a pair of pliers for this part.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Place in Water and Verify</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129696\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-2.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-2-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img></p>\n<p>Fill a small bowl with water and set your compass in it. The cork will allow the needle to float and the water will ensure a low-friction environment for the needle to spin and align with the earth’s magnetic field. The magnetized end will point either north or south, depending on which of the earth’s poles you live closest to. Use another compass to verify which end of your needle is pointing north.</p>\n<p>If you’re making a compass because you don’t have a compass, you can orient it by noting where the sun sets (or rises). Once you know east or west, you’ll know which end of the needle is pointing north. If possible, mark this end with a Sharpie, for future reference. To avoid these steps, it’s better to use a needle with distinct ends (one end is an eye; the other a point). </p>\n<h3>Step 5: Finish by Labeling</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129695\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-1.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-1-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img></p>\n<p>Finally, label your compass. Keep in mind that your homemade magnet is only temporary. Whenever you want to use it, you’ll need to rub it against a magnet again.</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"
