In that post, you could see me talking about the role: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html\">pg_monitor</a> that can be granted to monitoring users. The <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_monitor</pre> role restricts a monitoring user from accessing user data but only grants access to statistic views needed for monitoring. The following are the simple steps to create a monitoring user for using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a> (PMM).</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">CREATE USER pmm_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secret'; \nGRANT pg_monitor to pmm_user;</pre><p>However, this feature is only available from PostgreSQL 10. So, let&#8217;s discuss how to deal with the previous releases such as PostgreSQL 9.6 or earlier.</p>\n<p>One of the easiest methods is to grant <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SUPERUSER</pre> role to the monitoring user. But, granting the SUPERUSER access may not work in all the environments as it has the privileges to access, modify, and alter the database objects. For that reason, we could use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-createfunction.html\"><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SECURITY DEFINER</pre></a> to safely grant access to selected statistics views. Let us first understand the difference between a <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">security invoker</pre> and a <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">security definer</pre> in PostgreSQL functions.</p>\n<h2>Security Invoker vs Security Definer in PostgreSQL</h2>\n<h3>Security Invoker</h3>\n<p>When you execute a function in PostgreSQL, it is executed using the privileges of the <strong>user calling it</strong>. So, if the calling user does not have access to select a specific table, then, the SQL statements on that table may fail, so the execution of the function fails.</p>\n<h3>Security Definer</h3>\n<p>When you execute a function in PostgreSQL using SECURITY DEFINER, it is executed by the privileges of the <strong>user who created it</strong>. Even if the calling user does not have access to the database objects being queried in the function, the function execution succeeds when the user who created the function has the required privileges on those database objects.</p>\n<h4>Statistic views accessed by PMM that need access using a security definer:</h4>\n<p>To enable PostgreSQL monitoring using PMM, you should be granting access to some of the views being accessed by PMM as of today.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>pg_stat_activity</li>\n<li>pg_stat_statements</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We shall now see the steps involved in creating a monitoring user (<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm_user</pre>) who should be given indirect access to the above-mentioned views.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create the monitoring user and the schema in which the functions and views can be created.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">CREATE USER pmm_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secret';\nCREATE SCHEMA pmm AUTHORIZATION pmm_user;\nALTER USER pmm_user SET SEARCH_PATH TO pmm, pg_catalog;</pre><p><strong><br />\nStep 2: </strong>Create the functions to access the views being accessed by PMM, as a SUPERUSER. Make sure to specify <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SECURITY DEFINER</pre> so that the user calling this function can use the superuser role to access the data from the views: <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_stat_activity</pre> and <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_stat_statements</pre>.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pmm.get_pg_stat_activity() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_activity AS\n$$ SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity; $$\nLANGUAGE sql\nVOLATILE\nSECURITY DEFINER;\n\nGRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pmm.get_pg_stat_activity() TO pmm_user;\n\n-- The Following function needs to be created when you need QAN (Query Analytics) with PMM. \n\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pmm.get_pg_stat_statements() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_statements AS\n$$ SELECT * FROM public.pg_stat_statements; $$\nLANGUAGE sql\nVOLATILE\nSECURITY DEFINER;\n\nGRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pmm.get_pg_stat_statements() TO pmm_user;</pre><p>While creating the last function <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm.get_pg_stat_statements()</pre>, it assumes that the extension <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_stat_statements</pre> has been created in the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">public</pre> schema. If you have specified another schema while creating this extension, please specify the appropriate schema prefix instead of <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">public</pre>.</p>\n<p><strong><br />\nStep 3:</strong> Create views with the same name as the original views in the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm</pre> schema. Then, grant the SELECT access on the newly created view to the monitoring user.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">CREATE VIEW pmm.pg_stat_activity AS\nSELECT * FROM pmm.get_pg_stat_activity();\n\nCREATE VIEW pmm.pg_stat_statements AS\nSELECT * FROM pmm.get_pg_stat_statements();\n\nGRANT SELECT ON pmm.pg_stat_activity TO pmm_user;\nGRANT SELECT ON pmm.pg_stat_statements TO pmm_user;</pre><p>So, when you connect to postgres using the monitoring user <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm_user</pre>, you would automatically query the view <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_stat_activity</pre> in the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm</pre> schema, that is calling the function <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm.get_pg_stat_activity()</pre> using <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SUPERUSER</pre> privileges but not the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity</pre>  view. This is because we have set the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">search_path</pre> of the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm_user</pre> to <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm, pg_catalog</pre> in Step 1. If the view it is trying to access is not present in the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm</pre> schema, it looks for that view in the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pg_catalog</pre> schema.</p>\n<p>Your monitoring user for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a> is successfully created once the above three steps are completed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Our white paper &#8220;Why Choose PostgreSQL?&#8221; looks at the features and benefits of PostgreSQL and presents some practical usage examples.

You can run PMM in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. The biggest strength of PMM is that it is highly customizable, which we will see later in this blog.</span></p>\n<p><span>The PMM 2 release introduces a number of enhancements and additional features. Here are some improvements and features which I think are cool!</span></p>\n<h2><b>1. New Security Threat Tool</b></h2>\n<p><span>The new Security Threat tool has the goal to advise PMM users on security-related database problems they might have on their databases. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>As PMM already has a reach into databases for performance monitoring, it makes sense for it to monitor database security as well. This tool will notify about any users without a password on the servers, MongoDB authentication disabled, MySQL/Mongo new versions available, and more.</span></li>\n<li><span>For enabling this feature, go over the <code>Failed security checks</code> panel on PMM Homepage and click on Security Threat tool, enable it, and &#8216;Apply changes&#8217;.</span></li>\n<li><span>Once enabled, the box shows a count of the number of failed checks.

Labeling</b></h2>\n<p><span>Labeling helps to easily group instances and review these groups together.  You do this by tagging the servers with Standard or Custom labels.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Some of the standard labels available are Environments, Clusters, Replication Sets, Region.</span></li>\n<li><span>This can be configured while adding the server under monitoring with pmm-admin using flags <code>--environment=''</code>,<code>--cluster=''</code>, <code>replication_set=''</code> and so on.</span></li>\n<li><span>You can also have custom labels by specifying a Key-Value pair using the flag  &#8211;custom-labels=&#8217;Key=Value&#8217;.  For example, custom labels can be set as &#8216;DC=Asia&#8217; or &#8216;Role=Reporting&#8217;, &#8216;Role=OLTP&#8217; or anything as per your topology.</span></li>\n<li><span>These labels can be used in filtering in QAN as well.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71358 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-1024x161.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"142\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-1024x161.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-300x47.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-200x31.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-1536x241.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-2048x321.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-12-at-4.58.35-PM-367x58.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Important events related to the application can now be marked with <code>Annotations</code>. Some events in the application like upgrades, patches, may impact the database. Annotations visualize these events on each dashboard of the PMM Server so that you can correlate any performance changes on the database with these events.</span></li>\n<li><span>Annotations can be added with <code>pmm-admin annotate &#60;--tags&#62;</code> command on PMM Client, and passing it text which explains what event the annotation should represent.

Query Analytics (QAN)</b></h2>\n<p><span>QAN helps to ensure database queries are executed as expected, in the shortest time possible. You can identify queries causing problems and review detailed metrics related to those queries here.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>With the new and improved QAN dashboard, you can now add multiple columns to the Query Analytics table with the <code>Add column</code> button, which will also show you the list of columns available. These are tagged with Service names &#8211; MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL. Columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order.</span></li>\n<li><span>Some of the examples for additional columns are &#8211; Query Count with errors, InnoDB IO read ops, No Index Used(MySQL), Docs Scanned, Returned (MongoDB), Shared Blocks Read, Written, Dirtied (PostgreSQL).</span></li>\n<li><span>The query activity can now be visualized from multiple dimensions, not just the query pattern. As shown in the image, query count and load can also be viewed for Database, User, Client Hosts, etc. This will help to identify an increase in traffic from a particular user or a host, for example.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71402 size-full\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qanff-min.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"726\" height=\"318\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the new release of PMM 2.10, you now have a <code>Search by</code> bar beside the dimensions as seen in the above image. It gives you the flexibility to limit the view of queries containing only the specified keywords entered in the search bar. The <code>Search by</code> can be used for other dimensions as well, like database, username.</li>\n<li><span>Hovering over the sparkline now shows the load and timestamp for that particular time under the cursor.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71401 size-full\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/load1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"270\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>The improvements will help to look for users causing the most activity, busiest schema, most active incoming client hosts, and of course problematic queries.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>4. New Filter Panel for QAN</b></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-71399 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/filter1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"161\" height=\"332\" /></p>\n<p><span>The new Filter Panel for the QAN dashboard allows you to see all your labels and gives the capability to select multiple items for filtering.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>The Filter Panel helps filtering servers with standard or custom labels like  Environment, Clusters, individual nodes for faster troubleshooting.</span></li>\n<li><span>Filters are listed as per category in the Filter panel &#8211; Service type, Cluster, Replication Set, database, and even users.</span></li>\n<li><span>Selecting one reduces the overview list to those items matching the filter.</span></li>\n<li><span>Together with the QAN improvements mentioned before and this filter panel, you can identify users, servers that are experiencing unexpected traffic or load across a logical grouping of servers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h5></h5>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><b>5. Easily Remove Services or Nodes From the PMM Inventory Dashboard</b></h2>\n<p><span>The PMM Inventory dashboard lists all Nodes, Agents, and Services that are registered against the PMM Server.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Now, you can easily remove a service, node, or agent from this dashboard directly, unlike older versions.

Percona software products are now listed on four online software directories, but our listings are too new to have accumulated many user reviews. We need reviews!</p> \n<p>So our offer is simple. You write one review, you pick one Percona swag item. You write two reviews, you pick two. Seven reviews, pick seven pieces of swag, our limit. But you must post your reviews by November 15, 2020!</p> \n<p>Any meaningful review earns swag, be it positive, negative, or mixed. Write whatever you believe; only write something! There’s no swag for a review that gives a rating but says nothing at all or nothing meaningful, so make those reviews count!</p> \n<p>Here’s where to post reviews:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><b><i>Product</i></b></td> \n   <td><b><i>Capterra&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></td> \n   <td><b><i>G2&nbsp;

This is my first blog post so let me introduce myself. My name is Vasyl Yurkovych. I am a QA Automation Engineer at Percona and I have solid experience in software testing. </span></p>\n<p><span>Software quality is one of the main focuses of Percona so we put a lot of energy into it (hopefully so you don’t have to!). Our biggest challenge in testing isn’t necessarily running the routines against the current version, but the fact that users can decide to upgrade at any time, from pretty much any supported version.  So I’d like to share with you our upgrade testing approach for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a> (PMM) in hopes that this might be useful to others who create software that users install!</span></p>\n<p><span>PMM is released every month and our users do not reinstall each new version &#8211; they just perform the upgrade operation when there’s a compelling feature or fix. Also, these PMM instances are not “empty”; they are full of various settings, monitored DBs, etc.,  all of which need to be preserved.</span></p>\n<p><span>Taking into account all of that, we want to make sure that: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>the user will not suffer after the upgrade and will enjoy the new version of PMM</span></li>\n<li><span>user’s instances will still be under monitoring without missing vital data during the upgrade</span></li>\n<li><span>settings will be preserved</span></li>\n<li><span>new features will work as expected</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We decided to automate this process and select critical automation scenarios to execute. They were split into 3 stages: Pre Upgrade, Upgrade, and Post Upgrade.</span></p>\n<h2>Pre Upgrade (UI and API Scenarios)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span>“Fill” PMM with monitored instances. We add each supported DB type for monitoring. Along with this, we ensure that the monitoring status of each added instance is ”RUNNING”. For these scenarios, we use corresponding PMM API endpoints.</span></li>\n<li><span>Apply custom Settings.</span></li>\n<li><span>Check that the Upgrade widget at the Home Dashboard is present and contains an Update button, the available version of PMM is correct and What’s new link is there.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Upgrade</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span>To fully simulate a user&#8217;s behavior we use the UI upgrade option.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Post Upgrade (UI Scenarios Only)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span>After the upgrade itself was successful we check that the Upgrade widget at the Home Dashboard indicates that the PMM has the latest version.</span></li>\n<li><span>Also, we check the PMM Inventory to confirm that all the previously monitored DB instances exist and have “RUNNING” statuses.</span></li>\n<li><span>We check that Query Analytics Dashboard has corresponding DB filters (filters only exist when the DB specific queries exist).</span></li>\n<li><span>We confirm that all our custom Settings were properly upgraded and remain intact.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-71699 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/job-e1601647562137-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/job-e1601647562137-168x300.png 168w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/job-e1601647562137-84x150.png 84w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/job-e1601647562137-367x655.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/job-e1601647562137.png 533w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" /></p>\n<p><span>Also, we test upgrades from the older PMM versions, so we created a CI job that runs on the weekends and during the release testing phase. This gives us the ability to check the upgrade from any available version to the latest one. All we have to do is to specify the version we want to upgrade from. Check out this screenshot as an example of a failed upgrade.</span></p>\n<p><span>Currently, we use this approach for testing Docker-based PMM Server upgrade, because PMM docker images are most commonly used. </span><span>But we plan to implement the same upgrad</span><span>e job for OVF and AMI based PMM-Server soon. </span></p>\n<p><span>This is the final piece of our upgrade testing approach which alerts us immediately if some version has a problem upgrading to the latest one and allows us to react at the same time.</span></p>\n<p><span>While this may seem an obvious tactic to ensure software quality, it’s amazing how often we’ll discover something that only impacts a single version.  </span></p>\n<p><span>You are now safe to upgrade your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a> version, as PMM CI is watching your back!</span></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:46:08 +0000","feedId":11,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"20ce31feec65a119e40ff052d6654c36","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Vasyl Yurkovych","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-Upgrade-200x112.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-32-33-424_6e0c04d60fc31ed3.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-Upgrade-300x168.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-03-385_14efe46568db2730.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/job-e1601647562137-168x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn75@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-32-50-368_d5a38fafb59ac314.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214352580},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","title":"3 Features I Love in Percona Monitoring and Management 2.10","link":"https://www.percona.com/blog/?p=71532","description":"<img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-2.10-features-200x112.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Percona Monitoring and Management 2.10 features\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-2.10-features-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-2.10-features-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-2.10-features-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-2.10-features-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-2.10-features.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management 2.10</a> shipped a few days ago and while it is a minor release, it introduces some features which I absolutely love. In this blog post, I will talk about those features &#8211; what they are and why they are worth loving. 🙂</p>\n<h2>1. Query Search</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71551 size-full\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1910\" height=\"930\" /></p>\n<p>This is a great feature if you have many queries and you want to find a particular query or set of queries quickly.  Want to find which <strong>DELETE</strong> queries cause the most load on the database?  Or maybe queries which access a particular table or column? You got it!</p>\n<h2>2. Crosshair in Query Analytics</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71538 size-full\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2.gif\" alt=\"PMM Crosshair in Query Analytics\" width=\"1910\" height=\"930\" /></p>\n<p>While Grafana has had the Crosshair feature for ages, it was not available in Query Analytics until now.  When looking at multiple time series, this is a super helpful feature to visually align multiple data points corresponding to the same point in time.</p>\n<p>Crosshair does not only work in the query view, but also in the metrics view, where it is especially helpful.

It&#8217;s also lately one of the most popular conversations around the community.</p>\n<p>But what is it? In plain words: holding up queries for a while, giving air to the replicas to breath and catch up. Something similar to the Galera’s Flow Control mechanism, although flow control, when it kicks in, stops all the writes while the nodes catch up. With a throttle no write is stopped, just delayed.</p>\n<p>There are several ways to do this. A popular tool is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/github/freno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freno</a> but this is also something that can be achieved with ProxySQL. Let’s see how.</p>\n<h2>Delay</h2>\n<p>ProxySQL has a variable called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/wiki/Global-variables#mysql-default_query_delay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“mysql-default_query_delay”</a>  that is pretty self-explanatory. It will add a delay, in milliseconds, to all the queries passing through ProxySQL.</p>\n<p>Now, the trick is to monitor the replica lag and apply the delay. Something that in this case is solved with a small bash script:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">#/bin/bash\n\nset -o pipefail\n\nproxysqlhost=127.0.0.1\nproxysqladmport=6032\nproxysqluser=admin\nproxysqlpass=admin\n\nreplicahost=mysql2\nreplicauser=pmm\nreplicapass=pmm\n\nlagThreshold=3\n\n\nfunction check_lag() {\n         lag=$(mysql -h$replicahost -u$replicauser -p$replicapass -e \"SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\" | grep  \"Seconds_Behind_Master\" | awk -F\\: '{print $2}' 2&#62;&#38;1)\n}\n\nfunction modifyProxysqlVariable () {\n        out=$(mysql -u$proxysqluser -p$proxysqlpass -h$proxysqlhost -P6032 -e\"set mysql-default_query_delay = $delay ; LOAD MYSQL VARIABLES TO RUNTIME;\" 2&#62;&#38;1)\n        echo $out\n}\n\nfunction destructor () {\n        delay=0\n        modifyProxysqlVariable\n        echo \"bye\"\n}\n\ntrap destructor EXIT INT TERM\n\nwhile true; do\n\n        check_lag\n        echo $lag\n        if [ $lag -ge $lagThreshold ]; then\n                delay=1\n                modifyProxysqlVariable\n        elif [ $lag -eq 0 ]; then\n                delay=0\n                modifyProxysqlVariable\n        fi\n        sleep 0.001\ndone</pre><p>Replica lag will be monitored on a loop, and when it&#8217;s bigger than the threshold, 1mS of delay will be added overall. And after lag is under control, the delay is removed.</p>\n<p>For testing purposes, I have set up a basic Primary/Replica environment, running with sysbench on high concurrency setup to make the replica lag on purpose. I collected some graphs with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a>,  and here’s how it looks:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71679 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-1024x159.png\" alt=\"Rate Limit MySQL\" width=\"900\" height=\"140\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-1024x159.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-300x47.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-200x31.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-1536x238.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-2048x318.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.49.54-367x57.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>The above graph shows the lag constantly growing until the script starts to run and the replica eventually catches up.

Once the lag is under control, traffic is back but not at 100% since the throttle script continues to run. So it maintains the replica up to date at a cost of rate-limiting the writes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-71677\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-1024x314.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-1024x314.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-300x92.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-200x61.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-1536x471.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-2048x628.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-14.50.27-367x113.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>And the above graph shows the same (questions) but from the ProxySQL dashboard perspective.</p>\n<p>Now, what’s the alternative?</p>\n<h2>Delay on Rules</h2>\n<p>ProxySQL query rules can be set with delays per rule. Since the idea is to add less overhead, a good approach is to check which query rule is the least used and see if by adding a delay to it we can control the lag.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Admin&#62; SELECT hits, mysql_query_rules.rule_id, match_digest, match_pattern, replace_pattern, cache_ttl, apply, delay FROM mysql_query_rules NATURAL JOIN stats.stats_mysql_query_rules ORDER BY mysql_query_rules.rule_id;\n+-----------+---------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------------+-----------+-------+-------+\n| hits      | rule_id | match_digest | match_pattern         | replace_pattern | cache_ttl | apply | delay |\n+-----------+---------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------------+-----------+-------+-------+\n| 0         | 1       | NULL         | ^SELECT .* FOR UPDATE | NULL            | NULL      | 0     | NULL  |\n| 609897074 | 2       | NULL         | ^SELECT .*            | NULL            | NULL      | 0     | NULL  |\n| 87128148  | 3       | NULL         | ^UPDATE .*            | NULL            | NULL      | 0     | 0     |\n| 43561905  | 4       | NULL         | ^INSERT .*            | NULL            | NULL      | 0     | 0     |\n| 43562935  | 5       | NULL         | ^DELETE .*            | NULL            | NULL      | 0     | 0     |\n| 0         | 6       | NULL         | ^REPLACE .*           | NULL            | NULL      | 0     | NULL  |\n+-----------+---------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------------+-----------+-------+-------+\n6 rows in set (0.01 sec)</pre><p>From that query, we can see that the rule with id 5, the one that routes the DELETEs, is the least used from all the rules that hit the Primary.</p>\n<p>We just need to make a small adjustment to the script to modify the mysql_query_rules table, by adding a proper function. The full script with the modification looks like this:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">#/bin/bash\n\nset -o pipefail\n\nproxysqlhost=127.0.0.1\nproxysqladmport=6032\nproxysqluser=admin\nproxysqlpass=admin\n\nreplicahost=mysql2\nreplicauser=pmm\nreplicapass=pmm\n\nlagThreshold=3\n\nruleId=5\n\nfunction destructor () {\n        delay=0\n        modifyRuleDelay\n        echo \"bye\"\n}\n\nfunction check_lag() {\n         lag=$(mysql -h$replicahost -u$replicauser -p$replicapass -e \"SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\" | grep  \"Seconds_Behind_Master\" | awk -F\\: '{print $2}' 2&#62;&#38;1)\n}\n\nfunction modifyRuleDelay () {\n        out=$(mysql -u$proxysqluser -p$proxysqlpass -h$proxysqlhost -P6032 -e\"update mysql_query_rules set delay = $delay where rule_id = $ruleId ; LOAD MYSQL QUERY RULES TO RUNTIME;\" 2&#62;&#38;1)\n}\n\ntrap destructor EXIT INT TERM\n\nwhile true; do\n\n        check_lag\n        echo $lag\n        if [ $lag -ge $lagThreshold ]; then\n                delay=1\n                modifyRuleDelay\n        elif [ $lag -eq 0 ]; then\n                delay=0\n                modifyRuleDelay\n        fi\n        sleep 0.001\ndone</pre><p>Now, running the script we can see that the same behavior happens.

Adding memory to a server where MySQL is running is common practice when scaling resources.</p>\n<h3>First, Some Context</h3>\n<p>Scaling resources is just adding more resources to your environment, and this can be split in two main ways: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.</p>\n<p>Vertical scaling is increasing hardware capacity for a given instance, thus having a more powerful server, while horizontal scaling is adding more servers, a pretty standard approach for load balancing and sharding.</p>\n<p>As traffic grows, working datasets are getting bigger, and thus we start to suffer because the data that doesn&#8217;t fit into memory has to be retrieved from disk. This is a costly operation, even with modern NVME drives, so at some point, we will need to deal with either of the scaling solutions we mentioned.</p>\n<p>In this case, we will discuss adding more RAM, which is usually the fastest and easiest way to scale hardware vertically, and also having more memory is probably the main benefit for MySQL.</p>\n<h3>How to Calculate Memory Utilization</h3>\n<p>First of all, we need to be clear about what variables allocate memory during MySQL operations, and we will cover only commons ones as there are a bunch of them. Also, we need to know that some variables will allocate memory globally, and others will do a per-thread allocation.</p>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will cover this topic considering the usage of the standard storage engine: <strong>InnoDB</strong>.</p>\n<p>We have globally allocated variables:</p>\n<p><strong><em>key_buffer_size</em></strong>: MyISAM setting should be set to 8-16M, and anything above that is just wrong because we shouldn&#8217;t use MyISAM tables unless for a particular reason. A typical scenario is MyISAM being used by system tables only, which are small (this is valid for versions up to 5.7), and in MySQL 8 system tables were migrated to the InnoDB engine. So the impact of this variable is negligible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>query_cache_size</em></strong>: 0 is default and removed in 8.0, so we won&#8217;t consider it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>innodb_buffer_pool_size</em></strong>: which is the cache where InnoDB places pages to perform operations. The bigger, the better. 🙂</p>\n<p>Of course, there are others, but their impact is minimal when running with defaults.</p>\n<p>Also, there are other variables that are allocated on each thread (or open connection):<br />\n<em>read_buffer_size</em>, <em>read_rnd_buffer_size</em>, <em>sort_buffer_size</em>, <em>join_buffer_size</em> and <em>tmp_table_size</em>, and few others. All of them, by default, work very well as allocation is small and efficient. Hence, the main potential issue becomes where we allocate many connections that can hold these buffers for some time and add extra memory pressure. The ideal situation is to control how many connections are being opened (and used) and try to reduce that number to a sufficient number that doesn&#8217;t hurt the application.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s not lose the focus, we have more memory, and we need to know how to tune it properly to make the best usage.</p>\n<p>The most memory-impacting setting we need to focus on is <em>innodb_buffer_pool_size,</em> as this is where almost all magic happens and is usually the more significant memory consumer. There is an old rule of thumb that says, &#8220;size of this setting should be set around 75% of available memory&#8221;, and some cloud vendors setup this value to <em>total_memory*0.75</em>.</p>\n<p>I said &#8220;old&#8221; because that rule was good when running instances with 8G or 16G of RAM was common, so allocating roughly 6G out of 8G or 13G out of 16G used to be logical.</p>\n<p>But what if we run into an instance with 100G or even 200G? It&#8217;s not uncommon to see this type of hardware nowadays, so we will use 80G out of 100G or 160G out of 200G? Meaning, will we avoid allocating something between 20G to 40G of memory and leave that for filesystem cache operations? While these filesystem operations are not useless, I don&#8217;t see OS needing more than 4G-8G for this purpose on a dedicated DB. Also, it is recommended to use the O_DIRECT flushing method for InnoDB to bypass the filesystem cache.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>Now that we understand the primary variables allocating memory let&#8217;s check a good use case I&#8217;m currently working on. Assuming this system:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">$ free -m\n      total      used     free    shared    buff/cache    available\nMem: 385625    307295    40921         4         37408        74865</pre><p>So roughly 380G of RAM, a nice amount of memory. Now let&#8217;s check what is the maximum potential allocation considering max used connections.<br />\n<em><br />\n*A little disclaimer here, while this query is not entirely accurate and thus it can diverge from real results, we can have a sense of what is potentially going to be allocated, and we can take advantage of performance_schema database, but this may require enabling some instruments disabled by default:</em></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysql &#62; show global status like 'max_used_connections';\n+----------------------+-------+\n| Variable_name        | Value |\n+----------------------+-------+\n| Max_used_connections |    67 |\n+----------------------+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)</pre><p>So with a maximum of 67 connections used, we can get:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysql &#62; SELECT ( @@key_buffer_size\n-&#62; + @@innodb_buffer_pool_size\n-&#62; + 67 * (@@read_buffer_size\n-&#62; + @@read_rnd_buffer_size\n-&#62; + @@sort_buffer_size\n-&#62; + @@join_buffer_size\n-&#62; + @@tmp_table_size )) / (1024*1024*1024) AS MAX_MEMORY_GB;\n+---------------+\n| MAX_MEMORY_GB |\n+---------------+\n| 316.4434      |\n+---------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)</pre><p>So far, so good, we are within memory ranges, now let&#8217;s see how big the <em>innodb_buffer_pool_size</em> is and if it is well sized:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysql &#62; SELECT (@@innodb_buffer_pool_size) / (1024*1024*1024) AS BUFFER_POOL_SIZE;\n+------------------+\n| BUFFER_POOL_SIZE |\n+------------------+\n| 310.0000         |\n+------------------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)</pre><p>So the buffer pool is 310G, roughly 82% of total memory, and total usage so far was around 84% which leaves us around 60G of memory not being used. Well, being used by filesystem cache, which, in the end, is not used by InnoDB.</p>\n<p>Ok now, let&#8217;s get to the point, how to properly configure memory to be used effectively by MySQL. From pt-mysql-summary we know that the buffer pool is fully filled:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Buffer Pool Size | 310.0G\nBuffer Pool Fill | 100%</pre><p>Does this mean we need more memory? Maybe, so let&#8217;s check how many disk operations we have in an instance we know with a working dataset that doesn&#8217;t fit in memory (the very reason why we increased memory size) using with this command:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysqladmin -r -i 1 -c 60 extended-status | egrep \"Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests|Innodb_buffer_pool_reads\"\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 99857480858|\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 598600690  |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 274985     |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 1602       |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 267139     |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 1562       |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 270779     |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 1731       |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 287594     |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 1567       |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 282786     |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 1754       |</pre><p><em>Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests</em>: page reads satisfied from memory (good)<br />\n<em>Innodb_buffer_pool_reads</em>: page reads from disk (bad)</p>\n<p>As you may notice, we still get some reads from the disk, and we want to avoid them, so let&#8217;s increase the buffer pool size to 340G (90% of total memory) and check again:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysqladmin -r -i 1 -c 60 extended-status | egrep \"Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests|Innodb_buffer_pool_reads\"\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 99937722883 |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 599056712   |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 293642      |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 1           |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 296248      |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 0           |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 294409      |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 0           |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 296394      |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 6           |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | 303379      |\n| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | 0           |</pre><p>Now we are barely going to disk, and IO pressure was released; this makes us happy &#8211;  right?</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>If you increase the memory size of a server, you mostly need to focus on <em>innodb_buffer_pool_size,</em> as this is the most critical variable to tune. Allocating 90% to 95% of total available memory on big systems is not bad at all, as OS requires only a few GB to run correctly, and a few more for memory swap should be enough to run without problems.</p>\n<p>Also, check your maximum connections required (and used,) as this is a common mistake causing memory issues, and if you need to run with 1000 connections opened, then allocating 90% of the memory of the buffer pool may not be possible, and some additional actions may be required (i.e., adding a proxy layer or a connection pool).</p>\n<p>From MySQL 8, we have a new variable called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-dedicated-server.html\">innodb_dedicated_server</a>, which will auto-calculate the memory allocation. While this variable is really useful for an initial approach, it may under-allocate some memory in systems with more than 4G of RAM as it sets the buffer pool size = (detected server memory * 0.75), so in a 200G server, we have only 150 for the buffer pool.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Vertical scaling is the easiest and fastest way to improve performance, and it is also cheaper &#8211; but not magical. Tuning variables properly requires analysis and understanding of how memory is being used. This post focused on the essential variables to consider when tuning memory allocation, specifically innodb_buffer_pool_size and max_connections.

In addition, we’ll be joined by technical experts Vijay Karumajji and Aditya Samant, MySQL Specialist Solutions Architects from AWS, who’ll touch base on the many benefits of Aurora.</p>\n<p>Please join <strong>Ananias Tsalouchidis</strong>, <strong>Richard Chart</strong>, <b> Vijay Karumajji, </b>and<b> Aditya Samant </b>on <strong>Wednesday, October 14, 2020, at 1:00 pm EDT</strong> for the webinar <strong>&#8220;Percona, AWS, &#38; ScienceLogic &#8211; Converting DBaaS to a Fully Managed Solution</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7369967477138385163?source=blog\">Register for Webinar</a></p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t attend, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7369967477138385163?source=blog\">sign up anyway</a> and we&#8217;ll send you the slides and recording afterward.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 13:40:15 +0000","feedId":11,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"59cf142d1bc9013419d273b2f0b5d977","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"David Quilty","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Converting-DBaaS-to-a-Fully-Managed-Solution-200x112.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-32-47-009_7f2996b3dba7dbdf.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Converting-DBaaS-to-a-Fully-Managed-Solution-300x168.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-32-47-801_2c3a90c9895ad51f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214352584},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","title":"How to Find Query Slowdowns Using Percona Monitoring and Management","link":"https://www.percona.com/blog/?p=71807","description":"<img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query-Slowdowns-Using-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-200x112.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Query Slowdowns Using Percona Monitoring and Management\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query-Slowdowns-Using-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query-Slowdowns-Using-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query-Slowdowns-Using-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query-Slowdowns-Using-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query-Slowdowns-Using-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /><p>Visibility is a blessing, and with databases, visibility is a must. That’s true not only for metrics but for the queries themselves. Having info on all the stats around query execution is priceless, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a> (PMM) offers that in the form of the Query Analytics dashboard (QAN).</p>\n<p>But where to start? QAN helps you with that by calculating the query profile. What is the profile? It&#8217;s a rank of queries, ordered by Load, so it is easy to spot the heaviest queries hitting your database. The Load is defined as the “Average Active Queries” but can also be defined as a mix of Query Execution Time Plus Query count. In other words, all the time the query was alive and kicking.</p>\n<p>The Profile in PMM 2.10.0 looks like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71808 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-1024x334.png\" alt=\"percona monitoring and management\" width=\"900\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-1024x334.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-300x98.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-200x65.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-1536x502.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-2048x669.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-05-at-10.46.16-367x120.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>The purpose of this profile is to facilitate the task of finding the queries that are worth improving, or at least the ones that will have a bigger impact on the performance when optimized.</p>\n<p>However, how do you know that a slow query has been always slow or it has come down the road from good performance to painfully slow? That’s where the graph on the “Load” column comes handy.</p>\n<p>There’s a method for doing this. The first step is to have a wide view. That means: check a time range long enough so you can see patterns. Personally, I like to check the last 7 days.</p>\n<p>The second step is to find irregularities like spikes or increasing patterns. For example, in the above profile, we can see that the “SHOW BINARY LOGS” command is the top #4 of queries adding more load to the database. In this case, it&#8217;s because the binlogs are not being purged, so every day there are more and more binlog files to read and that adds to the executing time. But the amount of times that the “SHOW BINARY LOGS” query is executed remains the same.</p>\n<p>Another query with an “anomaly” in the load graph is the top #3 one. Let’s isolate it and see what happened:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71809 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-1024x572.png\" alt=\"Query Analytics dashboard percona\" width=\"900\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-1536x858.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-2048x1144.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-09-30-at-21.23.08-367x205.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>The third step will be to reduce the time to a range involving the event so we can isolate it even more:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71833 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-1024x488.png\" alt=\"Query Analytics dashboard percona monitoring and management\" width=\"900\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-1024x488.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-300x143.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-200x95.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-1536x732.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-2048x975.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-8.29.21-367x175.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>The event happened between 8 AM and 9 AM.

It is a complete rewrite from scratch with a totally new approach to collect and expose metrics from MongoDB diagnostic commands.</p>\n<p>The MongoDB exporter in the 0.11.x branch exposes only a static list of handpicked metrics with custom names and labels. The new exporter uses a totally different approach: it exposes ALL available metrics returned by MongoDB internal diagnostic commands and the metric naming (or renaming) follows concrete rules that apply the same for all metrics.</p>\n<p>For example, if we run <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand({\"getDiagnosticData\": 1});</pre> the command returns a structure that looks like this:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{\n     \"data\" : {\n         \"start\" : ISODate(\"2020-08-23T22:25:26Z\"),\n         \"serverStatus\" : {\n             \"start\" : ISODate(\"2020-08-23T22:25:26Z\"),\n             \"host\" : \"f9cd25606ada\",\n             \"version\" : \"4.2.8\",\n             \"process\" : \"mongod\",\n             \"pid\" : NumberLong(1),\n             \"uptime\" : 186327,\n             \"uptimeMillis\" : NumberLong(186327655),\n             \"uptimeEstimate\" : NumberLong(186327),\n             \"localTime\" : ISODate(\"2020-08-23T22:25:26Z\"),\n             \"asserts\" : {\n                 \"regular\" : 0,\n                 \"warning\" : 0,\n                 \"msg\" : 0,\n                 \"user\" : 62,\n                 \"rollovers\" : 0\n             },\n             \"connections\" : {\n                 \"current\" : 25,\n                 \"available\" : 838835,\n                 \"totalCreated\" : 231,\n                 \"active\" : 1\n             },\n             \"electionMetrics\" : {\n                 \"stepUpCmd\" : {\n                     \"called\" : NumberLong(0),\n                     \"successful\" : NumberLong(0)\n                 },\n                 \"priorityTakeover\" : {\n                     \"called\" : NumberLong(0),\n                     \"successful\" : NumberLong(0)\n                 },\n                 \"catchUpTakeover\" : {\n                     \"called\" : NumberLong(0),\n                     \"successful\" : NumberLong(0)\n                 },</pre><p>In the new exporter, the approach to expose all metrics is to traverse the result of the diagnostic commands like <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">getDiagnosticData</pre>looking for values to expose. In this case, we have <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">serverStatus</pre>, inside it we found <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">asserts</pre> and inside asserts there are metrics to expose (because they are numbers): <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">regular</pre>, <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">warning</pre>, <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">msg</pre>, <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">user</pre>, and <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">rollovers</pre>. In this method of metric gathering, the metric name is the composition of the metrics keys we had to follow, for example, it will produce a metric like this: <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">serverStatus_asserts_user</pre>:<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">62</pre>.</p>\n<p>If we open the web interface for the exporter at http://localhost:9216, we won&#8217;t find that metric I just mentioned. Why? Because to make the metric names shorter and to be able to group some metrics under the same name, the new exporter implements a metric name prefix rename and we are converting some metric suffixes to labels.</p>\n<h2>Prefix Renaming Table</h2>\n<p>The string <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mongodb_</pre> is prepended to all metrics as the Prometheus job name. Unlike &#60; v2.0 mongodb_exporter, there won&#8217;t be <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mongod</pre> vs. <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mongos</pre> in the job name.</p>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; float: left;\" width=\"80%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric Prefix</th>\n<th>New Prefix</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.wiredTiger.transaction</td>\n<td>ss_wt_txn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.wiredTiger</td>\n<td>ss_wt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus</td>\n<td>ss</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>replSetGetStatus</td>\n<td>rs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>systemMetrics</td>\n<td>sys</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>local.oplog.rs.stats.wiredTiger</td>\n<td>oplog_stats_wt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>local.oplog.rs.stats</td>\n<td>oplog_stats</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>collstats_storage.wiredTiger</td>\n<td>collstats_storage_wt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>collstats_storage.indexDetails</td>\n<td>collstats_storage_idx</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>collStats.storageStats</td>\n<td>collstats_storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>collStats.latencyStats</td>\n<td>collstats_latency</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Prefix labeling table:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\">\n<th>Metric Prefix</th>\n<th>New Prefix</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>collStats.storageStats.indexDetails.</td>\n<td>index_name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>globalLock.activeQueue.</td>\n<td>count_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>globalLock.locks.</td>\n<td>lock_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.asserts.</td>\n<td>assert_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.connections.</td>\n<td>conn_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.</td>\n<td>count_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.metrics.commands.</td>\n<td>cmd_name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.</td>\n<td>csr_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.metrics.document.</td>\n<td>doc_op_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.opLatencies.</td>\n<td>op_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.opReadConcernCounters.</td>\n<td>concern_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.opcounters.</td>\n<td>legacy_op_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.opcountersRepl.</td>\n<td>legacy_op_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.transactions.commitTypes.</td>\n<td>commit_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.wiredTiger.concurrentTransactions.</td>\n<td>txn_rw_type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>serverStatus.wiredTiger.perf.</td>\n<td>perf_bucket</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>systemMetrics.disks.</td>\n<td>device_name</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Because of the metric renaming and labeling, we will find that the metric <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">serverStatus.asserts</pre> .<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">&#60;<strong>metric</strong>&#62;</pre>  will become <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">ss_asserts</pre>  and the metric name will be used as a label:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"># HELP mongodb_ss_asserts serverStatus.asserts.\n# TYPE mongodb_ss_asserts untyped\nmongodb_ss_asserts{assert_type=\"msg\"} 0\nmongodb_ss_asserts{assert_type=\"regular\"} 0\nmongodb_ss_asserts{assert_type=\"rollovers\"} 0\nmongodb_ss_asserts{assert_type=\"user\"} 62\nmongodb_ss_asserts{assert_type=\"warning\"} 0</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Advantages Of The New Exporter</h2>\n<p>Since the new exporter will automatically collect all available metrics, it is now possible to collect new metrics in the PMM dashboards and as new MongoDB versions expose new metrics, they will automatically become available without the need to manually add metrics and upgrade the exporter. Also, since there are clear rules for metric renaming and how labels are created, metric names are more consistent even when new metrics are added.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>As mentioned previously, this new exporter exposes all metrics by traversing the JSON output of each MongoDB diagnostic command.<br />\nThose commands are:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{\"getDiagnosticData\": 1}</pre> which includes:<br />\nserverStatus<br />\nreplSetGetStatus (will be fetched separately if MongoDB &#60;= v3.6)<br />\nOplog collection stats<br />\nOS system metrics:<br />\nMemory<br />\nCPU<br />\nDisk usage<br />\nnetstat<br />\nvmstat</p>\n<p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{\"replSetGetStatus\": 1}</pre><br />\n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{\"serverStatus\": 1}</pre></p>\n<p>and it is possible also to specify database.collections pairs lists to get stats for collections usage and indexes by running these commands for each collection:<br />\n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{\"$collStats\": {\"latencyStats\": {\"histograms\": true}}}</pre><br />\n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{\"indexStats\"}</pre></p>\n<h2>Enabling Compatibility Mode</h2>\n<p>The new exporter has a parameter, <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">--compatible-mode</pre> , which enables a special compatibility mode. In this mode, the old exporter metrics are also exposed along with the new metrics. This way, existing dashboards should work without requiring any change, and it is the default mode in PMM 2.10.0.</p>\n<p>Example: in compatibility mode, all metrics having the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mongodb_ss_wt_txn_transaction_checkpoint</pre>  prefix and the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">min_time_msecs</pre>  or <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">max_time_msecs</pre>  suffix like</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"># HELP mongodb_ss_wt_txn_transaction_checkpoint_min_time_msecs serverStatus.wiredTiger.transaction.\n# TYPE mongodb_ss_wt_txn_transaction_checkpoint_min_time_msecs untyped\nmongodb_ss_wt_txn_transaction_checkpoint_min_time_msecs 14</pre><p>will be also exposed using the old naming convention as</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"># HELP mongodb_mongod_wiredtiger_transactions_checkpoint_milliseconds mongodb_mongod_wiredtiger_transactions_checkpoint_milliseconds\n# TYPE mongodb_mongod_wiredtiger_transactions_checkpoint_milliseconds untyped\nmongodb_mongod_wiredtiger_transactions_checkpoint_milliseconds{type=\"max\"} 71\nmongodb_mongod_wiredtiger_transactions_checkpoint_milliseconds{type=\"min\"} 14</pre><p>and the suffix is used as a label.</p>\n<h2>Debugging</h2>\n<p>When starting the exporter with <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">--debug</pre>, it will output the result of each diagnostic command to the standard error. This makes it easier to check the values returned by each command to verify the metric renaming and values.</p>\n<h2>Releases</h2>\n<p>This exporter is going to be released as part of PMM starting with version 2.10.0 and will also be released as an independent exporter in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter/releases\">repo&#8217;s release page</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, the exporter resides in the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">v0.20.0</pre>  branch and the old exporter is in the master branch but, exporter <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">v0.11</pre>  will be moved to the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">main</pre> branch and <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">master</pre> branch will be used for the new exporter code.</p>\n<h2>How to Contribute</h2>\n<h3>Using the Makefile</h3>\n<p>In the main directory, there is a <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Makefile</pre> to help you with development and testing tasks.

We deprecated only a few metrics that were already meaningless because they are only valid and exposed for old MongoDB versions like mongodb_mongod_global_lock_ratio and mongodb_version_info.</p>\n<p>At Percona, we built this new MongoDB exporter with the idea in mind of having an exporter capable of exposing all available metrics, with no hard-coded metrics and not tied to any particular MongoDB version. We would like to encourage users to help us by using this version and providing feedback. We also accept (and encourage) code fixes and improvements.</p>\n<p><em>Also, learn more about the new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/09/16/percona-customer-portal-and-your-new-free-user-account/\">Percona Customer Portal</a> rolling out s<span>tarting with the 2.10.0 release of Percona Monitoring and Management.</span></em></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:40:16 +0000","feedId":11,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d3fedc1703eb28c323a30acf393250e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Carlos Salguero","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MongoDB-Exporter-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-200x105.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-32-48-648_7494eaa0f10042f9.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MongoDB-Exporter-Percona-Monitoring-and-Management-300x157.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn96@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-32-43-518_eaba24ab429019b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214352616},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","title":"The Criticality of a Kubernetes Operator for Databases","link":"https://www.percona.com/blog/?p=71009","description":"<img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-200x112.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Importance of Kubernetes Operators for Databases\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-71959\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-300x168.png\" alt=\"Importance of Kubernetes Operators for Databases\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Importance-of-Kubernetes-Operators-for-Databases.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />As a Solutions Engineer at Percona, one of my responsibilities is to support our customers as they investigate new and emerging technologies. This affords me the opportunity to speak to many current and new customers who partner with Percona. The topic of Kubernetes is becoming more popular as companies are investigating and adopting this technology. The issue most companies are encountering is architecting a stateful database that doesn’t fall victim to an environment tuned for ephemeral workloads. This obviously introduces a level of complexity as to how to run a stateful database in an inherently stateless world, as databases are not natively designed for that.</p>\n<p>To make your life easier, as a part of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/percona-kubernetes-operators\">Percona Cloud-Native Autonomous Database Initiative</a>, our engineering teams have built two Kubernetes Operators:<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/index.html\"> Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster</a> and<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-psmongodb/index.html\"> Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona Server for MongoDB</a>, which allows for Kubernetes Pods to be destroyed, moved, or created with no impact to the application. To see an overview of Kubernetes, you can read this previous blog of mine <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/05/07/introduction-to-percona-kubernetes-operator-for-percona-xtradb-cluster/\">Introduction to Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster</a> that covers this topic. It&#8217;s common for companies new to Kubernetes to attempt to run their databases in Kubernetes the same way they would in a traditional environment. But, this is not advised as it introduces the possibility of data loss and it is not recommended for production workloads. Why is this dangerous and how has Percona solved this?</p>\n<h2>Appropriate Workloads for Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes is <strong>not</strong> the answer for everyone. It&#8217;s even not the answer for most people. Do not be misled into thinking that moving a database into Kubernetes is going to solve any of your problems. Before you consider moving your database into Kubernetes, ensure the rest of your application is cloud-native and can be used with Kubernetes. Moving your database to Kubernetes should happen <strong>after</strong> you have started both elastic vertical and horizontal scale and need to orchestrate it to control costs.</p>\n<p>As more companies are moving to Kubernetes something has to happen to the legacy workloads. Oftentimes we see a lift and shift mentality into Kubernetes, which can be dangerous or cause more work than expected. We have seen two primary ideal use cases for moving database workloads to Kubernetes: Microservices and Unified Abstraction Layer.</p>\n<p>Monolithic, large datasets can prohibit some of Kubernetes&#8217; strong points: self-healing and availability. This can be an issue due to the time it takes to physically transmit data to a new Pod instance as it joins the database cluster. If your dataset is too large, this process is slow due to physical limitations and prohibits performance and the availability of your database. Microservices are a great fit due to the relatively smaller datasets, which allows Kubernetes automation to work well with the dataset size. <span><br />\n</span><span><br />\n</span>Companies looking to take full advantage of cloud-native applications and databases can be a really good fit for Kubernetes as well. If you truly want the ability to deploy and run your databases anywhere utilizing the concept of a Unified Abstraction Layer, Kubernetes is a great option. You can move your databases to anywhere that is running Kubernetes and know it will work.</p>\n<p>We talked about large unsharded datasets and the limitations Kubernetes presents when handling them, but we should mention a few more workloads better suited for traditional platforms. Applications with a throughput sensitivity may not do well on Kubernetes, or they may not be cost-effective to do so. Kubernetes is fundamentally designed for container orchestration and is not designed to handle highly performant databases that require low latency. This may be possible to achieve, but at what cost? This applies to highly performant distributed applications as well. Lowest latency across all nodes is not a core tenant of Kubernetes, so ensure you have planned and tested against this before you move everything over to Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2>Pods Are Cattle, Not Pets</h2>\n<p>If you’re not familiar with Pets vs Cattle, it’s a DevOps concept that differentiates deployment methodologies of unique servers that require attention when issues arise (pets) versus the ability to replace a server with a copy if issues arise (cattle). Due to the nature of how Kubernetes operates, Pods can be destroyed, spun up, and moved at any time due to factors outside of the application’s control, much like how cattle are treated. Kubernetes uses a<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/\"> scheduler</a>, which by design, can destroy and recreate Pods to meet the configuration needs of your Kubernetes Cluster. This is great for stateless applications as any failure in the application will result in a Pod containing the application being destroyed and recreated, eliminating the need for human interaction, and greatly speeding up the process to a resolution. This isn’t ideal for databases as you don’t want your database to suddenly stop working, halt the application, and introduce the potential for lost or corrupted data. One of the tools Kubernetes can utilize to help combat this is called Stateful Sets. These help by keeping a Pod&#8217;s identity assigned to it as it is destroyed and re-created. This helps facilitate stateful workloads, but how does this come into play with high availability and utilizing the automation aspects of Kubernetes?</p>\n<h2>Databases Are Pets, Not Cattle</h2>\n<p>Databases by design need to keep their identity, information, and most importantly their data safe and accessible at all times. They are the backbones of the application as they are the source of truth an application relies on for normal processing. Any errors in their operations will quickly stop an application from functioning. <em>They are important,</em> to say the least. How can we safely run databases in Kubernetes and still ensure we have highly available database deployments? By using Stateful Sets and Persistent Volumes we can maintain data integrity, but we need an additional set of hands to take on database administrator tasks such as ensuring failover happens, database members are recovered, and re-join the highly available architecture, along with other technology-specific functions. Fortunately, Kubernetes is extensible and has Operators, which aims to automate the key task of a human operator who is managing a service or set of services.</p>\n<h2>Automation, Automation, Automation</h2>\n<p>We know the complexities of running a database (safely) in Kubernetes and some of the concepts used to help bridge the gaps between automation and traditional human functions. With the help of Percona&#8217;s Kubernetes Operators, we can safely run databases the way they were intended to run. Percona&#8217;s Kubernetes Operators are able to automate tasks that are usually done by a database administrator such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully automated deployments with strict consistency and no single point of failure</li>\n<li>Automated scaling with the ability to change the size parameter to add or remove members of a Cluster or Replica-Set</li>\n<li>Fully automated backups and restores</li>\n<li>Fully automated self-healing by automatically recovering from the failure of a single Cluster or Replica-Set member.</li>\n<li>Automatically manage system users on password rotation</li>\n<li>Simplified updates</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Always Use a Kubernetes Operator</h2>\n<p>With the complexities of running a highly available database environment and the inherent dangers introduced by using the dynamic Kubernetes environment, an Operator should always be used when deploying databases in Kubernetes.

Here&#8217;s an example of what you can see when you run a utility, such as <strong>netstat</strong>,  that reports the network connections:</p>\n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">$netstat -tlnp\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address   Foreign Address  State     PID/Program name\ntcp     0      0    127.0.0.1:5432  0.0.0.0:*        LISTEN     27929/postgres</pre>\n<p>The first thing is to look at is the &#8220;Local Address&#8221;. Notice how it says <strong>127.0.0.1:5432</strong>. Okay, so that means that the server is currently listening on the localhost on port 5432. But you want <strong>0.0.0.0:5432</strong> otherwise remote connections cannot be accepted. With an editor, open up file pg_hba.conf and look at the &#8220;default&#8221; rules. Keep in mind that the configuration file can be located in one of several locations, we&#8217;ll cover that later.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">ATTENTION: Setting the Address (CIDR) to 0.0.0.0 is for connectivity purposes only. As soon as you know everything works you should restrict this to as few permitted connections as possible. This is not something you should do on a production machine.</span></p>\n<p>The actual &#8220;rules&#8221; per line can vary from one type of postgres installation to another. The good news is that RedHat/Centos look alike and all Debian/Ubuntu have their own similar styles too. The relevant settings are at the bottom of the file as all else above is commented documentation.</p>\n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"># TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD\n# \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only\nlocal   all             all                                     peer\n# IPv4 local connections:\nhost    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5\n# IPv6 local connections:\nhost    all             all             ::1/128                 peer\n# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the\n# replication privilege.\nlocal   replication     all                                     peer\nhost    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            md5\nhost    replication     all             ::1/128                 md5</pre>\n<p>Look at the first line, where TYPE is &#8220;local&#8221;.

Along with these enhancements, there are some security-related enhancements that require some explanation. There are two major ones: one is related to libpq and the other is related to postgres_fdw. As it is known that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/postgres-fdw.html\">postgres_fdw</a>  is considered to be a “reference implementation” for other foreign data wrappers, all other foreign data wrappers follow their footsteps in development.  This is a community-supported foreign-data wrapper. The blog will explain the security changes in postgresq_fdw.</p>\n<h3>1 &#8211; The superuser can permit the non-superusers to establish a password-less connection on postgres_fdw</h3>\n<p>Previously, only the superuser can establish a password-less connection with PostgreSQL using postgres_fdw. No other password-less authentication method was allowed. It had been observed that in some cases there is no password required, so it does not make sense to have that limitation. Therefore, PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new option (password_required) where superusers can give permission to non-superusers to use a password-less connection on postgres_fdw.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;\nCREATE EXTENSION\n\npostgres=# CREATE SERVER postgres_svr FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (dbname 'postgres');\nCREATE SERVER\n\npostgres=# CREATE FORIENG TABLE foo_for(a INT) SERVER postgres_svr OPTIONS(table_name 'foo');\nCREATE FOREIGN TABLE\n\npostgres=# create user MAPPING FOR vagrant SERVER postgres_svr;\nCREATE USER MAPPING\npostgres=# SELECT * FROM foo_for;\n a \n---\n 1\n 2\n 3\n(3 rows)</pre><p>When we perform the same query from a non-superuser, then we will get this error message:</p>\n<p><strong>ERROR:  password is required</strong><br />\n<strong>DETAIL:  Non-superusers must provide a password in the user mapping</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">postgres=# CREATE USER nonsup;\nCREATE ROLE\n\npostgres=# create user MAPPING FOR nonsup SERVER postgres_svr;\nCREATE USER MAPPING\n\npostgres=# grant ALL ON foo_for TO nonsup;\nGRANT\n\nvagrant@vagrant:/work/data$ psql postgres -U nonsup;\npsql (13.0)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=&#62; SELECT * FROM foo_for;\n2020-09-28 13:00:02.798 UTC [16702] ERROR:  password is required\n2020-09-28 13:00:02.798 UTC [16702] DETAIL:  Non-superusers must provide a password in the user mapping.\n2020-09-28 13:00:02.798 UTC [16702] STATEMENT:  SELECT * FROM foo_for;\nERROR:  password is required\nDETAIL:  Non-superusers must provide a password in the user mapping.</pre><p>Now perform the same query from non-superuser after setting the new parameter password_required &#8216;false&#8217; while creating the user mapping.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">vagrant@vagrant:/work/data$ psql postgres\npsql (13.0)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=# DROP USER MAPPING FOR nonsup SERVER postgres_svr;\nDROP USER MAPPING\n\npostgres=# CREATE USER MAPPING FOR nonsup SERVER postgres_svr OPTIONS(password_required 'false');\nCREATE USER MAPPING\n\nvagrant@vagrant:/work/data$ psql postgres -U nonsup;\npsql (13.0)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=&#62; SELECT * FROM foo_for;\n a \n---\n 1\n 2\n 3\n(3 rows)</pre><p></p>\n<h3>2 &#8211; Authentication via an SSL certificate</h3>\n<p>A new option is provided to use an SSL certificate for authentication in postgres_fdw.

Most of the cases when the error occurs are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/gone-away.html\">described in MySQL documentation</a></span><span>, but it can get tricky. And here, I&#8217;d like to talk about &#8220;tricky&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are only a few major cases when this happens:</span></p>\n<h3>1. MySQL Thread Was Killed by an Administrator or a Utility Such as pt-kill</h3>\n<p><span>The manual intervention is likely to be intermittent and, as it is a one-time thing in certain situations (e.g., a bad long-running query), probably would be known to a DBA. Pt-kill might be less noticeable, as it is often left running as a workaround to prevent those bad long queries from taxing system </span><span>resources. Checking the system processlist should bring the commands to the surface:</span></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">$ ps xauf | grep pt-kill\ntaras 6069 0.1 0.1 111416 29452 pts/29 S+ 10:57 0:00 | | \\_ perl /usr/bin/pt-kill --interval 1s --busy-time 5s --match-info (SELECT) h=127.0.0.1 --print --kill\ntaras 6913 0.0 0.0 21532 1112 pts/30 S+ 11:00 0:00 | \\_ grep --color=auto pt-kill</pre><p><span>A very convenient way is to use the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/management/audit_log_plugin.html\">audit plugin</a> available for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server\">Percona Server for MySQL </a></span><span>to determine where the kill command came from:</span></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">&#60;AUDIT_RECORD&#62;\n  &#60;NAME&#62;Query&#60;/NAME&#62;\n  &#60;RECORD&#62;624484743_2020-06-30T17:38:14&#60;/RECORD&#62;\n  &#60;TIMESTAMP&#62;2020-06-30T17:57:35 UTC&#60;/TIMESTAMP&#62;\n  &#60;COMMAND_CLASS&#62;kill&#60;/COMMAND_CLASS&#62;\n  &#60;CONNECTION_ID&#62;17&#60;/CONNECTION_ID&#62;\n  &#60;STATUS&#62;0&#60;/STATUS&#62;\n  &#60;SQLTEXT&#62;KILL QUERY 16&#60;/SQLTEXT&#62;\n  &#60;USER&#62;taras[taras] @ localhost []&lt;/USER&#62;\n  &#60;HOST&#62;localhost&#60;/HOST&#62;\n  &#60;OS_USER&#62;&#60;/OS_USER&#62;\n  &#60;IP&#62;&#60;/IP&#62;\n  &#60;DB&#62;&#60;/DB&#62;\n&#60;/AUDIT_RECORD&#62;</pre><p><span>It shows the hostname, user, and time when the connection got killed.</span></p>\n<h3>2. Big Data Chunk Transfer</h3>\n<p><span>For example, when using BLOB fields to store binary data in a table or there is an INSERT statement containing a lot of rows. It may happen when using the MySQL CLI client (one of the cases being loading an SQL dump), or it can happen within an application when it tries to store the BLOB data (for example, from a file upload).</span></p>\n<p><span>There is a limit MySQL imposes on the amount of data that can be transmitted per query, and the <em>max_allowed_packet</em> variable defines it.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, in both cases, we need to determine which table the data is being written to, for instance, grepping the SQL file for INSERT INTO statements and implementing logging on the application end. This way, the statement will be stored along with the error that prevented it from completing. A partial statement can be captured (as BLOBs could be a burden to log), but as long as there is a table name, it is possible to check the table structure and see if it does contain binary data.</span></p>\n<p><span>Example of an INSERT statement with binary data (truncated):</span></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, x'89504....82’)</pre><p><span>To allow for a larger query execution, the variable needs to be adjusted:</span></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet = 128M ;</pre><p><span>The variable can be set per session or globally, depending on the use case.</span></p>\n<h3>3. The Connection Was Closed by Timeout</h3>\n<p><span>It is trivial, but applications can be reusing already-established connections. During the time of inactivity or lower traffic, it is possible some connections will not be used for a while and closed on the MySQL end. It is traced best with the application logging; if there is an event that happened in the evening followed by a period of inactivity and then the error in the morning, it is very likely that MySQL closed the connection.</span></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysql&#62; SET SESSION wait_timeout = 5 ;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</pre><p>Wait for 5 seconds:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysql&#62; select 1 ;\nERROR 2006 (HY000): MySQL server has gone away\nNo connection. Trying to reconnect...\nConnection id: 16\nCurrent database: *** NONE ***\n\n+---+\n| 1 |\n+---+\n| 1 |\n+---+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)</pre><p><span>Usually, the connection is re-established, and the application continues normal operations; yet it is always possible to extend the timeout in MySQL configuration:</span></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SET GLOBAL wait_timeout = 57600 ;</pre><p><span>The default value for the variable is 28800 seconds (8 hours), which is enough in most cases.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, closing connections cleanly from an application end, after a period of inactivity, eliminates this problem.</span></p>\n<h3>4. MySQL Server Has Actually Gone Away</h3>\n<p><span>This one is probably the worst possible scenario when MySQL crashes on a query or due to some other reason, e.g., the OOM killer killed the process. However, it can be caused by a clean restart, too.</span></p>\n<p><span>In this case, one should check MySQL uptime and the logs, MySQL error log, and syslog. Those should indicate whether the server restart occurred and if there was an error leading to the restart.</span></p>\n<p><span>In case the server did crash, it is time to find the actual cause. Check the bug tracker, as the issue might have been reported and possibly fixed already; upgrade MySQL if needed. In case it was a clean restart, check if auto-updates are enabled or if someone else restarted the service interactively (yes, lack of communication is a thing too).</span></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:13:51 +0000","feedId":11,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"92e7770edc3d27a875cd72f5b96812a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Taras Onishchuk","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MySQL-Server-Has-Gone-Away-200x105.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn51@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-32-40-523_2477d083d14e246c.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MySQL-Server-Has-Gone-Away-300x157.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn15@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-32-32-977_39dc760957840223.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214352603},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:32","title":"Exciting and New Features in MariaDB 10.5","link":"https://www.percona.com/blog/?p=71688","description":"<img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-200x112.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"New Features in MariaDB 10.5\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /><p><span><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-71709\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-300x168.png\" alt=\"New Features in MariaDB 10.5\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Features-in-MariaDB-10.5.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform/\">MariaDB 10.5</a> was released in June 2020 and it will be supported until June 2025.

(There are also other “meta” properties, but they are out of the scope of this article.)</span></p>\n<h3>Force Check</h3>\n<p><span>Clicking on “Run DB checks” will trigger an API call to the PMM server, which will execute the checks workflow on the PMM back end (you can read more about it </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/06/29/security-threat-tool-design-in-percona-monitoring-and-management/\"><span>here</span></a><span>). At the end of that workflow, alerts are sent to Alertmanager through a </span><span>POST</span><span> call to the same endpoint used to retrieve active alerts. The call payload has the same structure as shown above.</span></p>\n<p><span>Note that while you could create alerts manually this way, that</span><span>’s highly discouraged, since it could negatively impact STT alerts.

Alertmanager helps us a lot in simplifying the final stage of delivering security checks to you in a reliable way. It allows us to focus more on the checks we deliver and the way you can interact with them.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly improving our Security Threat Tool, adding more checks and features to help you protect your organization&#8217;s valuable data. While we&#8217;ll try to make our checks as comprehensive as possible, we know that you might have very specific needs. That&#8217;s why for the future we plan to make STT even more flexible, adding scheduling of checks (since some need to run more/less frequently than others), disabling of checks, and even the ability to let you add your own checks! Keep following the latest releases as we continue to iterate on STT.</p>\n<p>For now, let us know in the comments: what other checks or features would you like to see in STT?

The constraint could return an error if the result of a search condition is FALSE for any row of the table (but not if the result is UNKNOWN or TRUE).</p>\n<p>This feature starts working on MySQL 8.0.16, and in previous versions, we could create it, but it doesn&#8217;t work, meaning the syntax is supported but it is not working,</p>\n<p><strong>There are some rules to keep in mind&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>&#8211; AUTO_INCREMENT columns are not permitted<br />\n&#8211; Refer to another column in another table is not permitted<br />\n&#8211; Stored functions and user-defined functions are not permitted (you can not call a function or any user-defined functions)<br />\n&#8211; Stored procedure and function parameters are not permitted (you cannot call a procedure and function parameters)<br />\n&#8211; Subqueries are not permitted<br />\n&#8211; Columns used in foreign key for the next actions (ON UPDATE, ON DELETE) are not permitted<br />\n&#8211; This CHECK is evaluated for the next statements INSERT, UPDATE, REPLACE, LOAD DATA, and LOAD XML. Also, CHECK constraint is evaluated for INSERT IGNORE, UPDATE IGNORE, LOAD DATA &#8230; IGNORE, and LOAD XML &#8230; IGNORE. For those statements, a warning occurs if a constraint evaluates to FALSE. The insert or update is skipped.</p>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s See Some Examples</h2>\n<p>I created the next table to test this functionality. This is super easy as you can see in examples:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">CREATE TABLE users (\nid int not null auto_increment,\nfirstname varchar(50) not null,\nlastname varchar(50) not null,\nage TINYINT unsigned not null CONSTRAINT `check_1` CHECK (age &#62; 15),\ngender ENUM('M', 'F') not null,\nprimary key (id)\n) engine = innodb;</pre><p>In this simple test, we can write or update rows only if the &#8220;age&#8221; column value is more than 15.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see an example trying to INSERT rows with the &#8220;age&#8221; column less than 15:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mysql&#62; INSERT INTO users SET firstname = 'Name1', lastname = 'LastName1', age = 10, gender = 'M';\nERROR 3819 (HY000): Check constraint 'check_1' is violated.</pre><p>To DROP, use the next example:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">ALTER TABLE users DROP CHECK check_1;</pre><p>Let&#8217;s see another example adding more logic into it. I altered the table with the next CHECKs:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">ALTER TABLE users\nADD CONSTRAINT gender_male\nCHECK (\n    CASE\n        WHEN gender = 'M'\n        THEN\n            CASE\n                WHEN age &#62;= 21\n                THEN 1\n                ELSE 0\n            END\n        ELSE 1\n    END = 1\n);\n\nALTER TABLE users\nADD CONSTRAINT gender_female\nCHECK (\n    CASE\n        WHEN gender = 'F'\n            THEN\n                CASE\n                    WHEN age &#62;= 18\n                    THEN 1\n                    ELSE 0\n                END\n        ELSE 1\n    END = 1\n);</pre><p>We added more logic, and now it depends on the &#8220;<strong>gender</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>age</strong>&#8221; columns. A CHECK constraint is satisfied if, and only if, the specified condition evaluates to TRUE or UNKNOWN(for NULL column value) for the row of the table.

These configuration options are across the following areas in security: authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing.</p>\n<h2>MongoDB Security Overview</h2>\n<p>MongoDB security is composed of four main areas of focus, authentication (who), authorization(what), encryption (how), and auditing (when).  This section is intended to give you a high-level overview of the different security focus areas for MongoDB.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/enable-auth.html\">Authentication</a> is how you identify yourself to MongoDB.  There are many ways to authenticate oneself to a MongoDB database, from standard username and password using the SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) protocol, certificate-based authentication to tying into an identity management solution such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), Active Directory and Kerberos.</p>\n<p>Authorization is how MongoDB determines what you, as an authenticated user, can do.  MongoDB supports authorization using the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) method.  MongoDB lets you create roles which are groupings of privileges that any user granted that role can do.  MongoDB comes with a comprehensive set of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles\">built-in roles</a> as well as giving you the flexibility to create your own custom roles.  Common roles like read-only and write are there of course, but also ones useful for monitoring any node, backup and restore, and user administration. Additionally, MongoDB also supports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/04/24/percona-server-for-mongodb-ldap-enhancements-user-to-dn-mapping/\">LDAP authorization</a> which allows you to sync LDAP groups with roles to simplify management.</p>\n<p>Encryption is how your data can be encrypted while in flight (Transport) and while on disk (At Rest).   Transport encryption keeps your data encrypted while it is sent to and from your application to MongoDB.  MongoDB supports TLS/SSL encryption for data in-flight using x.509 Certificates, and here&#8217;s an example of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/05/31/mongodb-deploy-replica-set-with-transport-encryption-part-3/\">setting up Transport Encryption</a>.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/data_at_rest_encryption.html\">Encryption at Rest</a> keeps your data safe from an external party who might get a copy of your data files as they’ll be completely unreadable in their encrypted form.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/auditing.html\">Auditing</a> shows you when users connected, when privileges were changed, various admin events, users attempt something they shouldn&#8217;t, etc. based on filter criteria you can set.  This is helpful in compliance situations where you have to be able to show who was on the database at what time, what privileges they had, when privileges were changed, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t confuse auditing as a way to track users&#8217; activities in real-time, but rather think of it as a way to create a tamper-proof, append-only log file that you can go back to that shows what was happening and by whom during a specific time.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong>  Auditing is an expensive operation and will impact performance, be sure that you’re getting value from it and your IT Compliance team is able to actively use it, before setting it up.</p>\n<h2>Configuration Options</h2>\n<p>So while knowing the important areas of MongoDB Security is great, how do we ensure they are enabled or set up correctly?  And which ones are the most important?  We’ll now go through 5 configuration options that will help you secure your MongoDB environment!  We’ll also list some required configuration options that will work in conjunction with our 5 most important configuration options to keep your data safe.  We’ll break these configuration options into their security focus areas.</p>\n<p>MongoDB uses a configuration file in the YAML file format.   The configuration file is usually found in the following <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#configuration-file\">locations</a>, depending on your Operating System:</p>\n<h3>DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>On Linux, a default /etc/mongod.conf configuration file is included when using a package manager to install MongoDB.</li>\n<li>On Windows, a default &#60;install directory&#62;/bin/mongod.cfg configuration file is included during the installation.</li>\n<li>On macOS, a default /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf configuration file is included when installing from MongoDB’s official Homebrew tap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Authentication:</h3>\n<p>Our first configuration option, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#security.authorization\">security.authorization</a>, is perhaps the most important for enabling security on your MongoDB Deployment.  This configuration option not only enforces MongoDB using authentication so that a user must at least login using credentials but it also simultaneously engages role-based access control which limits what a user can do.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">security:\n  authorization: enabled</pre><p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong>  If you set this configuration option up before creating a user in MongoDB, you could use the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#localhost-exception\">localhost exception</a> in order to create your first user.  This is especially helpful in cases of automation or other situations where you want to have all your configuration options configured only once and then come in and add users.</p>\n<p>There are several other authentication configuration options that are required for your MongoDB deployment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>security.clusterAuthMode &#8211; The authentication mode used between replica set or sharded cluster nodes to authenticate.  This will typically be either keyFile or x509.  Acceptable values are:\n<ul>\n<li>keyFile &#8211; default, only accepts keyfiles</li>\n<li>x509 &#8211; uses only x509 certificates for cluster authentication</li>\n<li>sendKeyFile &#8211; only used when transitioning from keyFile to x509 certificate authentication.   Accepts keyFiles and x509 certificates</li>\n<li>sendX509 &#8211;

This configuration option is new in MongoDB 4.2, previous to MongoDB 4.2, this configuration option is named <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.ssl.mode\">net.ssl.mode</a>.   This configuration option decides how strictly you want to enforce TLS encryption.   The options for this configuration option are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabled &#8211; signifies that there is no encryption whatsoever.</li>\n<li>requireTLS &#8211; signifies that all traffic, regardless of origin, is encrypted.  requireTLS is the most secure setting for this configuration option.</li>\n<li>allowTLS &#8211; signifies that there is no encryption going on between members of the replica set or sharded cluster, but the DB server will accept both encrypted and non-encrypted traffic from the application hosts.  Only used for transitioning between disabled to requireTLS in a rolling restart fashion.</li>\n<li>preferTLS &#8211; signifies that there is encryption going on between members of the replica set or sharded cluster and that the DB server will accept both encrypted and non-encrypted traffic from the application hosts.

for Data at Rest Encryption on Percona Server for MongoDB.</a></p>\n<p>Important configuration options for the Vault Integration are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>security.vault.serverName &#8211; server name that your vault server is on</li>\n<li>Security.vault.port &#8211; port for vault connectivity</li>\n<li>security.vault.tokenFile &#8211; location of file with vault token</li>\n<li>Security.vault.secret

(Certificate Authority) on your local mongodb node</li>\n<li>security.vault.rotateMasterKey &#8211; only used to rotate the master key</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>MongoDB Enterprise Specific Data At Rest Encryption Configuration Options:</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, MongoDB Enterprise does not have Vault Integration for Encryption at rest except in MongoDB Atlas.  MongoDB Enterprise does support the KMIP protocol and you can integrate MongoDB with any Key Management tool that utilizes the KMIP protocol.  Documentation can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/#key-manager\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Important configuration options to support Key Management through the KMIP protocol are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>security.kmip.serverName &#8211; server name where your Key Management tool resides</li>\n<li>security.kmip.port &#8211; port for your key management tool</li>\n<li>security.kmip.serverCAfile &#8211; path on your MongoDB hosts of a CA file (Certificate Authority) for secure connection to your Key Management Tool</li>\n<li>security.kmip.clientCertificateFile &#8211; path to the client certificate used for authentication to your Key Management tool</li>\n<li>security.kmip.rotateMasterKey &#8211; only used to rotate the master key</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Auditing:</h3>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/auditing.html\">Auditing</a> allows IT Security Compliance teams to track and log activities that are run against the MongoDB database.  There are several important auditing configuration options for MongoDB,  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/index.html#auditLog.filter\">auditLog.filter</a> is the most important as it decides what exactly you are setting up in your auditing log.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">auditLog:\n  filter:  { &#60;field1&#62;: &#60;expression1&#62;, ... }</pre><p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For example, if we only wanted to have an audit log entry created every time someone created or removed a collection, we would set the auditLog.Filter as such:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">auditLog:\n  filter: { atype: { $in: [ \"createCollection\", \"dropCollection\" ] } }</pre><p>&#160;</p>\n<p>If we wanted to audit everyone with a specific role, we could set the auditFilter as such:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">auditLog:\n  filter:{ roles: { role: \"readWrite\", db: \"appdb\" } }</pre><p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Additional required configuration options for auditing are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>auditLog.destination &#8211; whether the audit log will be written to a file, to the console, or to the syslog</li>\n<li>auditLog.path &#8211; if outputting to a file, the destination directory, and file name of the audit log.   Note that the user MongoDB runs as must have read and write permissions to this directory.</li>\n<li>auditLog.format &#8211; the format the audit log is output to, options are JSON and BSON, with JSON being the more commonly used format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, while auditing is important to track and log activity in your database, including accessing PII or other sensitive data, you don’t want to expose PII in your auditing or other log files.  To accomplish this you must set up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/log-redaction.html\">log redaction</a> on your MongoDB Replica Set or Sharded Cluster.   The important configuration option for log redaction is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/index.html#security.redactClientLogData\">security.redactClientLogData</a>.   Acceptable values for this configuration option are true and false.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">security:\n  redactClientLogData: true</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we’ve gone over five important MongoDB configuration options to ensure you have a more secure MongoDB deployment as well as some other configuration options that help the five keep your data secure.  We hope that these configuration options will help you build more secure MongoDB deployments and avoid being a statistic of a data breach.   Thanks for reading!</p>\n<h4>Additional Resources:</h4>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\"
