Features like <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/know-you-go-google/\">popular times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/take-control-your-commute-google-maps/\">multimodal navigation</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/navigate-and-search-real-world-online/\">offline maps</a> help you better understand your world so you can decide how to interact with it.</p><br/><p>This week, we’re rolling out new visual improvements that bring even more detail and granularity to the map, making it easier to understand what an area looks like whether you’re exploring virtually or planning a visit.</p><br/><p><b>A more colorful and accurate view of the world</b>🌎</p><p>Google Maps has high-definition satellite imagery for over 98 percent of the world’s population. With a new color-mapping algorithmic technique, we’re able to take this imagery and translate it into an even more comprehensive, vibrant map of an area at global scale. Exploring a place gives you a look at its natural features—so you can easily distinguish tan, arid beaches and deserts from blue lakes, rivers, oceans and ravines. You can know at a glance how lush and green a place is with vegetation, and even see if there are snow caps on the peaks of mountaintops. </p><br/><p>With this update, Google Maps has one of the most comprehensive views of natural features on any major map app—with availability in all 220 countries and territories that Google Maps supports. That’s coverage for over 100M square kilometers of land, or 18 billion football fields!</p><br/><p>This update is visible no matter what area you’re looking at—from the biggest metropolitan areas to small, rural towns.</p><br/><p>Mapping the rainbow 🌈</p><p>How exactly does this color-mapping technique work? First, we use computer vision to identify natural features from our satellite imagery, looking specifically at arid, icy, forested, and mountainous regions. We then analyze these features and assign them a range of colors on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\">HSV color model</a>. For example, a densely covered forest can be classified as dark green, while an area of patchy shrubs could appear as a lighter shade of green. </p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\"><div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\"><ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\"><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Iceland_Resize.max-2000x2000.jpg);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">iceland_resized</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Iceland’s rich landscape is now much easier to visualize.

For me, sometimes it’s the easiest way to send a quick note to my friends and family. You can now send audio messages with Google Assistant on Android smart phones--without holding down the little mic icon. To get started, just say, “Hey Google, send an audio message” or “Hey Google, send an audio message to Paul saying I’m on the way.” The feature is available in English-speaking countries around the globe, as well as in Portuguese in Brazil.</p></li><li><p><b>Get help reading web articles:</b>Between staying informed and entertained, I find myself reading a lot of content on my phone these days. With Google Assistant, your browser can <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/assistant/easier-access-web-pages-let-assistant-read-it-aloud/\">read web articles out loud</a>. Whenever a web article is displayed on your browser in your Android phone, you can say, “Hey Google, read it” or “Hey Google, read this page” and it will immediately read aloud the content of the web page.</p></li><li><p><b>Find restaurants offering delivery or takeout:</b>Some days, it feels like I blink and it’s suddenly 5 p.m. On days when I don’t have time to cook dinner but need to get a meal on the table, I say, “Hey Google, find restaurants that deliver near me” or “Hey Google, show me restaurants with takeout.”</p></li><li><p><b>Snap a selfie:</b>I recently took a trip to Yosemite and wanted to quickly capture the perfect family photo during our hike—including the deer behind us. By saying, “Hey Google, take a selfie,” Assistant will open your phone’s front-facing camera and snap a picture on the count of three. </p></li><li><p><b>Call or text your best friend:</b>I have a standing call with my best friend every other week. When it’s time to hop on the line, all I need to say is “Hey Google, video call Taylor.” And if I’m running late to our call, I can always just ask Google to send her a text by saying, “Hey Google, tell Taylor I’m running late.”</p></li><li><p><b>Share your favorite content:</b>You can easily share things from your phone with friends using your voice, like articles or photos. Simply say “Hey Google, share this with Taylor” and Google Assistant will share that link or image with the person you chose. </p></li></ol><br/><br/></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/1iDwaBcecVY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":355,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Assistant_audio_message.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"572247ca2f00572c29e6f69688d891bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/18/20-42-24-676_8dec6a398503468a.webp","destWidth":471,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Assistant_audio_message.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/18/20-42-24-676_8dec6a398503468a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/1iDwaBcecVY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn42@2020_6/2020/08/18/20-42-36-821_d6bdb0a9af0b1cb8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597783344364},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 04:42:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 04:42:24","title":"House music: New multi-room audio control from Nest","link":"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-multi-room-audio-control-nest/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>As a new parent, my Nest home audio system has become a go-to, whether it’s to keep my daughter entertained during bathtime with some music...or keep myself entertained with a podcast while I’m making a bottle at 3 a.m. Controlling the audio throughout my home, no matter who’s listening, has been incredibly helpful. </p><p>Today, we’re expanding that control.
