That same year, the thirty-two-year-old <strong>Frederick Douglass</strong> (1818&#8211;1895) declaimed in a powerful anti-slavery speech, included in his indispensable <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frederick-Douglass-Library-Black-America/dp/1556523521/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Selected Speeches and Writings</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/frederick-douglass-selected-speeches-and-writings/oclc/1195968028&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are times in the experience of almost every community, when even the humblest member thereof may properly presume to teach &#8212; when the wise and great ones, the appointed leaders of the people, exert their powers of mind to complicate, mystify, entangle and obscure the simple truth &#8212; when they exert the noblest gifts which heaven has vouchsafed to man to mislead the popular mind, and to corrupt the public heart, &#8212; then the humblest may stand forth and be excused for opposing even his weakness to the torrent of evil.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Early in his career as a novice itinerant speaker for William Lloyd Garrison&#8217;s antislavery activism movement, Douglass had been especially impressed, in both senses of the word, by the example of the white women who so concertedly opposed the torrent of evil &#8212; women who taught him the true meaning of solidarity by paying the price of severe ostracism to play a central role in the movement&#8217;s recruiting, fundraising, and organizing; women who set aside their own suffrage to take up the cause of abolition and in consequence were not enfranchised as full citizens of their own country until almost half a century after black men got the right to vote; women one of whom Douglass would eventually fall in love with and marry. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_62352\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Frederick-Douglass-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143106813/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=680%2C736&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"736\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62352\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=240%2C260&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=320%2C346&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=600%2C650&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frederick Douglass</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a letter to a friend, penned in the same era as his contemporary Margaret Fuller was laying the foundation of American feminism while advocating for prison reform and black voting rights under her animating ethos that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/05/margaret-fuller-figuring/\">&#8220;while any one is base, none can be entirely free and noble,&#8221;</a> Douglass reported on a series of antislavery rallies across Pennsylvania, where he and his fellow Garrisonians were met with hostility. With a swell of gratitude to the handful of local supporters who had stood up to the majority of their own community to attend and support the meetings &#8212; a living testament to Albert Camus&#8217;s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/17/albert-camus-the-rebel/\">&#8220;real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present&#8221;</a> and to James Baldwin&#8217;s exhortation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/08/02/james-baldwin-a-quarter-century-of-un-americana/\">&#8220;we must dare to [take it] upon ourselves to become the majority by changing the moral climate [for] it is upon this majority that the life of any nation really depends&#8221;</a> &#8212; Douglass wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our few friends in that place, who are not the sort to be discouraged&#8230; filled me with admiration, as I viewed them occupying their noble position; a few women, almost alone in a community of thousands, asserting truths and living out principles at once hated and feared by almost the entire community; and doing all this with a composure and serenity of soul which would well compare with the most experienced champion and standard bearer of our cause, Friend Garrison himself. Heaven bless them, and continue them strength to withstand all trials through which their principles may call them to pass.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Decades later, from the hard-earned platform of a long and far-reaching life, he would revisit the subject in his final autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Times-Frederick-Douglas-Classics-Library/dp/1853265691/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/life-and-times-of-frederick-douglass-complete-history-to-the-present-time/oclc/944267855&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>When the true history of the antislavery cause shall be written, woman will occupy a large space in its pages, for the cause of the slave has been peculiarly woman’s cause.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Observing woman’s agency, devotion and efficiency in pleading the cause of the slave, gratitude for this high service early moved me to give favorable attention to the subject of what is called “Woman’s Rights” and caused me to be denominated a woman’s-rights-man.

Instead, he dreamt of becoming an inventor; then a physician; then a botanist. He took to &#8220;the making of books&#8221; only late in life, recounting: &#8220;When I first left home to go to school, I thought of fortune as an inventor, but the glimpse I got of the Cosmos at the University, put all the cams and wheels and levers out of my head.&#8221; It was during those school years that the polymath Alexander von Humboldt&#8217;s epoch-making book <em>Kosmos</em> first captivated the popular imagination with the notion of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/07/the-invention-of-nature-humboldt-wulf/\">nature as a cosmos of connections</a>, inspiring the young Walt Whitman to declare that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/12/17/sarah-kay-astronaut-whitman/\">&#8220;a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars&#8221;</a> and the young John Muir to write his address on the flyleaf of his first journal as &#8220;John Muir, Earth-Planet, Universe.&#8221; On the pages of his journals, Muir would arrive at his animating credo that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/10/john-muir-nature-writings/\">&#8220;when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>Still in his twenties, a century and a half before neurologists began uncovering <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/05/27/oliver-sacks-gardens/\">the healing power of nature</a>, Muir began discerning the immense psychological and physiological rewards of immersion in the living cosmos of nature and its uncommon salve for the various malaises, distempers, and wearinesses of body and mind we accrue in the course of living as thinking, feeling creatures in a perpetually precarious world. In one of those notebooks, posthumously collected in the 1938 treasure <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/John-Mountains-Unpublished-Journals-Muir/dp/0299078841/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/john-of-the-mountains/oclc/163335903&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nature, while urging to utmost efforts, leading us with work, presenting cause beyond cause in endless chains, lost in infinite distances, yet cheers us like a mother with tender prattle words of love, ministering to all our friendlessness and weariness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In an entry from the journals he kept during his transformative time in the Sierra Mountains, he celebrates nature not only as a mental, emotional, and spiritual buoy but as a holistic sanity tonic distilled in the body. Well before Walt Whitman devised his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/05/walt-whitman-workout/\">marvelous outdoor workout</a> while recovering from his paralytic stroke, well before William James advanced his revolutionary theory of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/11/what-is-an-emotion-william-james/\">how our bodies affect our feelings</a>, Muir writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Gain health</em> from lusty, heroic exercise, from free, firm-nerved adventures without anxiety in them, with rhythmic leg motion in runs over boulders requiring quick decision for every step. Fording streams, tingling with flesh brushes as we slide down white slopes thatched with close snow-pressed chaparral, half swimming or flying or slipping &#8212; all these make good counter-irritants. Then enjoy the utter peace and solemnity of the trees and stars&#8230; Find a mysterious presence in a thousand coy hiding things.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64204\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/give-me-nights-perfectly-quiet-and-i-looking-up-at-the-stars_framed-print?sku=s6-8967181p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg?resize=680%2C853&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"853\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64204\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg?resize=240%2C301&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg?resize=320%2C402&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg?resize=768%2C964&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg?resize=600%2C753&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

Television was then a young medium, aglow as any young medium with the promise of its potential and blind to its peril &#8212; something reflected with chilling clarity in Burnett&#8217;s own idealistic vision for it, so starkly contrasted by the echo chamber and manipulation laboratory television has become in the half-century since:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the most important functions of television is the honest display of human beings to one another. When this happens, it becomes possible to judge whether the standards and beliefs being held up for approval are really as valid and generally supported as we are led to believe. Social progress is slowed by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/12/20/hannah-arendt-origins-of-totalitarianism-loneliness-isolation/\">isolation</a>, and one of the great advantages of good television is that people are exposed to wide varieties of views and attitudes quite different form their own.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the vision that shaped <em>Face to Face</em>, which set the template for what became, half a century later, the most popular manifestation of a new medium: the podcast.

In the loveliness of mathematics and logic, he discovered an instrument of thought that could have, were it more widely adopted, prevented the inhumanity of the world wars. Shortly before his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/06/bertrand-russell-oswald-mosley/\">remarkable response to a fascist&#8217;s provocation</a>, he reflects on the greatest peril of and to our humanity:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>Fanaticism is the danger of the world. It always has been and has done untold harm. I think fanaticism is the greatest danger there is. I might almost say that I was fanatical against fanaticism.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71660\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Face-Face-1st-Hugh-Burnett/dp/B0036NTAYK/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bertrandrussell_felikstopolski.jpg?resize=680%2C595&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"595\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71660\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bertrandrussell_felikstopolski.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bertrandrussell_felikstopolski.jpg?resize=240%2C210&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bertrandrussell_felikstopolski.jpg?resize=320%2C280&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bertrandrussell_felikstopolski.jpg?resize=768%2C672&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bertrandrussell_felikstopolski.jpg?resize=600%2C525&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bertrand Russell by Feliks Topolski from <em>Face to Face</em>, 1964.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When asked what, in nearly ninety years of living, he has learned about life that he considers most important to pass on to posterity, Russell offers two things &#8212; &#8220;one intellectual and one moral.&#8221; The first is a sentiment evocative of Carl Sagan&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/03/baloney-detection-kit-carl-sagan/\">&#8220;Baloney Detection Kit&#8221;</a> for critical thinking:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only and surely at what are the facts. That is the intellectual thing that I should wish to say.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Two world wars after Tolstoy asserted in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/21/leo-tolstoy-gandhi-letter-to-a-hindu/\">his little-known correspondence with Gandhi</a> that &#8220;love is the only way to rescue humanity from all ills&#8221; and a decade after W.H. Auden made what remains the single most poignant one-word revision in the history of the English language &#8212; the idealistic &#8220;we must love one another or die&#8221; before the Second World War to the disillusioned &#8220;we must love one another and die&#8221; after it &#8212; Russell adds his second vital learning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The moral thing I should wish to say&#8230; is very simple. I should say: love is wise, hatred is foolish. In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other. We have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don’t like. We can only live together in that way and if we are to live together and not die together, we must learn the kind of charity and the kind of tolerance which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Russell&#8217;s kindred-spirited contemporary Albert Camus on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/07/24/albert-camus-interview-absurd/\">the three antidotes to the absurdity of life</a> &#8212; the third of which is an exquisite affirmation of Russell&#8217;s moral bequeathal &#8212; and a poetic counterpart in Maya Angelou&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/09/a-brave-and-startling-truth-maya-angelou/\">&#8220;A Brave and Startling Truth,&#8221;</a> and then revisit Russell on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/11/13/einstein-russell-manifesto/\">how to heal an ailing and divided world</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/18/bertrand-russell-free-thought-propaganda-doubt/\">our mightiest defense against political manipulation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/07/03/how-to-grow-old-bertrand-russell/\">what makes a fulfilling life</a>, and his immensely insightful Nobel Prize acceptance speech about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/09/21/bertrand-russell-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech/\">the four desires driving all human behavior</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.

This sense of direction in nature and life, this branching and spreading array, I shall compare with the root of the tree.</p>\n<p>From the root the sap flows to the artist, flows through him, flows to his eye. </p>\n<p>Thus he stands as the trunk of the tree. </p>\n<p>Battered and stirred by the strength of the flow, he guides the vision on into his work. </p>\n<p>As, in full view of the world, the crown of the tree unfolds and spreads in time and space, so with his work.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71646\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tree-nursery-by-paul-klee-1929_framed-print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?resize=680%2C558&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"558\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71646\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?w=1600&#38;ssl=1 1600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?resize=240%2C197&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?resize=320%2C263&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?resize=768%2C630&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?resize=600%2C492&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PaulKlee_TreeNursery_1929.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tree Nursery</em> by Paul Klee, 1929.

Between above and below can be no mirrored reflection. It is obvious that different functions expanding in different elements must produce divergences. </p>\n<p>But it is just the artist who at times is denied those departures from nature which his art demands. He has even been charged with incompetence and deliberate distortion.</p>\n<p>And yet, standing at his appointed place, the trunk of the tree, he does nothing other than gather and pass on what comes to him from the depths. He neither serves nor rules &#8212; he transmits. His position is humble. And the beauty at the crown is not his own.

She practices and practices a piece, and sometimes a magic thing happens and it seems the music starts to breathe. It sends a shiver through you. You can&#8217;t explain it, really; it&#8217;s a mystery. Well, when words do that, we call it poetry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emily-Michael-Bedard/dp/0440417406/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/emily_bedard13.jpg?resize=680%2C438&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71691\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/emily_bedard13.jpg?w=906&#38;ssl=1 906w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/emily_bedard13.jpg?resize=240%2C155&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/emily_bedard13.jpg?resize=320%2C206&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/emily_bedard13.jpg?resize=768%2C495&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/emily_bedard13.jpg?resize=600%2C387&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The next morning, the little girl takes her mother&#8217;s hand and the two cross the snowy day to visit their mysterious neighbor.

she told the coming generations in what became her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/12/rachel-carson-scripps-college-commencement/\">stunning and sobering farewell</a>, &#8220;to prove its maturity and its mastery &#8212;

all those burnt ferns </p>\n<p>and reptiles, sharks and bony fish &#8212;<br />\nthat was extinction on a scale<br />\nthat makes our losses look like a bad day at the slots. </p>\n<p>And perhaps we’re slated to ascend<br />\nto some kind of intelligence<br />\nthat doesn’t need bodies, or clean water, or even air. </p>\n<p>But I can’t shake my longing<br />\nfor the last six hundred<br />\nIberian lynx with their tufted ears, </p>\n<p>Brazilian guitarfish, the 4<br />\npercent of them still cruising<br />\nthe seafloor, eyes staring straight up. </p>\n<p>And all the newborn marsupials &#8212;<br />\nred kangaroos, joeys the size of honeybees &#8212; steelhead trout, river dolphins,<br />\nall we can save </p>\n<p>so many species of frogs <br />\nbreathing through their <br />\ndamp permeable membranes. </p>\n<p>Today on the bus, a woman<br />\nin a sweater the exact shade of cardinals,<br />\nand her cardinal-colored bra strap, exposed </p>\n<p>on her pale shoulder, makes me ache <br />\nfor those bright flashes in the snow. <br />\nAnd polar bears, the cream and amber </p>\n<p>of their fur, the long, hollow<br />\nhairs through which sun slips,<br />\nswallowed into their dark skin. When I get home, </p>\n<p>my son has a headache and, though he’s <br />\nalmost grown, asks me to sing him a song. <br />\nWe lie together on the lumpy couch </p>\n<p>and I warble out the old show tunes, “Night and Day”&#8230; <br />\n“They Can’t Take That Away from Me”&#8230; A cheap <br />\nsilver chain shimmers across his throat </p>\n<p>rising and falling with his pulse. There never was <br />\nanything else. Only these excruciatingly <br />\ninsignificant creatures we love.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Marie Howe&#8217;s sweeping <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/04/23/singularity-marie-howe-animated/\">&#8220;Singularity&#8221;</a> &#8212; that crowning curio in the poetic canon of individual and collective self-awareness as small and feeling creatures aglow with potential amid a vast and unfeeling universe &#8212; and the young poet Marissa Davis&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/07/05/singularity-marissa-davis/\">stunning response to Howe&#8217;s poem</a>, then revisit Jane Hirshfield&#8217;s kindred-colored perspectival masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/15/today-another-universe-jane-hirshfield-ledger-jasmine/\">&#8220;Today, Another Universe.&#8221;</a> </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.
