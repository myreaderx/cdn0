Before that late June appearance, Jake Tapper, the host of the Sunday show “State of the Union,” texted it to the senator from South Carolina ahead of asking for comment on air about President Trump’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/28/trump-promotes-video-supporter-saying-white-power/\">share a video</a> of one of his supporters shouting “white power” from his seat in a golf cart during a drive-by argument with an anti-Trump protester. “Thank you to the great people of The Villages,” Trump had added, by way of commentary, referring to the Florida retirement community where the incident took place.</p><p>Without much time to think, Scott got in touch with his chief of staff, Jennifer DeCasper, to get her opinion.</p><p>“Nobody is going to be upset if you call it out,” DeCasper, a former prosecutor who is also Black, recalls telling him. “Nobody. Not a Republican, not a Democrat, not a Black person, not a White person. This is a very obvious time for a ‘take this down’ statement, and that’s all you have to say.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z5EAWFTVCVEHZIEVV2ZPY4GRA4.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Sen. Tim Scott meets with President Trump in February 2018.  (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>Minutes later, Tapper played the clip for Scott on the air. The senator didn’t hesitate: “There’s no question,” Scott said. “He should not have retweeted it, and he should just take it down.”</p><p>In a town where Republicans seem to be rendered illiterate or are all suddenly late for lunch anytime the leader of their party says something racist or otherwise unhinged, calling out Trump is something of a novel approach. For four years now, Trump has been putting his allies in impossible situations: Speak up and get alienated, or stay silent and risk losing your moral standing. But Scott has been navigating this terrain with more agility than most.</p><p>While Scott was criticizing the tweet on CNN, Trump’s motorcade was pulling through a small crowd of protesters into Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., where he would play a round with his daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Scott’s fellow South Carolinian, Sen. Lindsey Graham. (“Ivanka has a great swing,” Graham told me later in an interview. And Jared? “Uh … he can hit the ball a long way.”)</p><p>A short time later, on the links, Kushner and Ivanka brought news of Scott’s comments to Trump, according to Graham. The senior senator said he told the president that if “that’s what Tim thinks, that goes a long way with me.” The president decided to take it down without an argument. It had been up for about three hours. (The White House declined to comment.)</p><p>“When Tim talks,” Graham said, “people listen.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7Y2HETWTJQI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>Tim Scott has been talking a lot lately. In June, on the fifth anniversary of the church shooting that left nine Black worshipers dead in his hometown of Charleston, he took the occasion not only to remember those who had died, but to push for passage of the police reform bill he had spearheaded in the wake of George Floyd’s death under the knee of an officer in Minneapolis.</p><p>Standing on the Senate floor, Scott, 54, cut a distinctive figure: youthful, bald, athletic (he was a high school running back), and one of three Black senators in the august legislative body — the only one on the Republican side. As he spoke about the Charleston shooting, Scott could barely hold back tears. His speech, framed as an attack on a Democratic colleague who had criticized Scott’s bill as inadequate to the task (and who used the loaded word “token” to describe it), highlighted the fact that police abuse is real, is experienced more often by Black citizens and often goes unacknowledged. “Had it not been caught on video, we might be in a different place,” Scott said of the clip showing Floyd being choked to death. He slapped his palm for emphasis and rattled off the names of unarmed Black men whose killings were recorded: Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Walter Scott (no relation to the senator).</p><p>In private, Scott has schooled his Republican colleagues on the everyday racism he and his family have encountered: the 18 times — by his count — he’s been pulled over by police in the past two decades; the bigoted voice mails left for his office; the story of his grandfather, whose life provides the senator with perspective on his own challenges.</p><p>But being the Republican race explainer is not a role Scott loves, especially when it means being questioned by the media whenever the president does something offensive, like refer to several predominantly Black nations as “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/magazine/trump-insulted-these-countries-travel-writer-celebrates-them/\">shithole countries</a>” or tell American-born or naturalized congresswomen of color to “go back” to their “broken and crime infested” homelands.</p><p>“Of all the issues that are going on, I know the racial ones are the most provocative,” Scott told me in June, during one in a series of interviews. “But I’m not the only person that people can talk to about it. I don’t want to be racially profiled into a position where I only get to talk about what the president does.”</p><p>He finds himself in a formidable position, and also a precarious one. Scott, who speaks with Trump regularly and has many good relationships within the administration, is influential enough to get the president to second-guess a tweet or to support a piece of legislation. But Scott’s role as counselor on racial matters is also shaped by everything he chooses not to criticize — and by his unwavering loyalty to the president. After all, on issues of race, Trump’s instincts and rhetoric remain unaffected, despite Scott’s counsel.</p><p>So what does it mean to be a Black senator and supporter of a president whose campaign is fueled, in part, by racial hostility? And what kind of political future can someone like Scott have in a party that Donald Trump has remade in his image?</p><img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213195817_c212e/image/607a729e-ca08-431d-b016-b3717d2465ed_p.jpeg?ts=1598213195981\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) heads into a hearing at the Hart Senate Office Building in July. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>In 2005, when Michael S. Steele was the lieutenant governor and the first African American elected statewide in Maryland, he got a call from a reporter asking him if he had a problem with the fact that his boss, Gov. Robert Ehrlich, belonged to an all-White golf club. Caught off-guard, Steele told the reporter he didn’t mind: “I don’t know that much about the club, the membership, nor do I care, quite frankly, because I don’t play golf. It’s not an issue with me,” he said.</p><p>One of his next calls, however, was to Ehrlich to figure out “what the hell was happening” and to make sure the boss knew he had to “resign from the club” immediately.</p><p>“It’s always a very challenging position to be close to the principal,” Steele told me. Steele, who later became the first African American to chair the Republican National Committee, says: “Trying to navigate, trying not to throw anyone under the bus. It was hard as a lieutenant governor, but it’s got to be even more challenging with Trump because something happens virtually every day. I don’t know how they do it.”</p><p>There is a lot to answer for. Donald Trump’s introduction to public life, in the 1970s, was as the scion of a real estate business sued by the Department of Justice over alleged racial discrimination. As a presidential candidate he spread unfounded “birther” conspiracy theories about the background of America’s first Black president, and as president he went out of his way to say there were “very fine people” among the tiki-torch-carrying white-supremacist rally goers in Charlottesville.</p><p>It’s an unenviable position to be the one senator asked constantly to account for the president’s language and policies regarding race because that one senator happens to be Black. “You guys just won’t stop asking the questions. So I answer the question, and I don’t have a long answer, which, for whatever reason makes you think you should ask it a different way.” Accordingly, Scott has developed a go-to response. “I can’t control the president of the United States,” Scott says. “I can only control what I do.”</p><p>And as a senator with legislative goals and with a president who can help him achieve them, that means figuring out a way to work with Trump. And so he chooses his words carefully, only ever going as far as saying the president acts in “racially insensitive” ways, but never calling him <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2019/10/14/anti-racist-revelations-ibram-x-kendi/?arc404=true\">racist</a>. (Steele himself doesn’t tread that line as carefully. “I don’t know,” he says. “Growing up, the people who were most racially insensitive tended to be racist.”)</p><p>It’s an unenviable position to be the one senator asked constantly to account for Trump’s language and policies on race because that one senator happens to be Black.</p><p>Instead of spending all his time trying to parse what’s in the president’s heart, Scott would rather point out all the good that has come from the Trump presidency: the tax reform Scott helped craft, a program called Opportunity Zones that creates tax incentives to encourage investment in struggling communities, more funding for historically Black colleges, and a criminal justice bill signed into law.</p><p>J.C. Watts, a former college quarterback who became part of the House leadership team in the 1990s, can empathize with Scott’s situation. Watts arrived in Washington as a young congressman with a warning: “A prominent Black conservative told me that I was about to enter a peculiar situation,” he recalls. “He said, ‘You’re not going to get the support of the civil rights community, and you’re not going to get the support of the conservative community. No one will fully trust you.’ ”</p><p>Watts soon realized that his Black Republican-ness was all any reporters seemed to ask him about in interviews. As for his congressional colleagues, they didn’t seem interested in building a more-diverse coalition. “Republicans tend to say you have to be a Republican or be Black; you can’t be both,” he says. “But that’s impossible to do. It’s like separating the water from the wet.”</p><p>This mentality is a barrier to the GOP, Watts argues. As a whole, Black Democrats tend to be more religious and more moderate than Democrats of other races, according to recent polling from Pew Research Center, with 25 percent of those polled calling themselves “conservative.” And yet in the last presidential election 89 percent of Black voters supported Hillary Clinton over Trump and ranked lowering health-care costs among their top concerns. Figuring out how to change that, Watts says, is the “$64,000 question.”</p><p>In search of answers, the Republican National Committee commissioned a report back in 2012 on why the party was falling behind in federal elections. The “autopsy” found Republicans were viewed as “scary” and “narrow-minded,” and unless they worked to broaden their appeal beyond their White base, they risked losing future elections. This was something that Steele had been trying to tell the party for years. Not that members were particularly willing to listen.</p><img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213196043_9bb13/image/384bfa78-92a6-489c-9514-a3ac68a72042_p.jpeg?ts=1598213196280\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Scott at work with staffer Molly Venegas. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>As much as Scott stands out, he’s always had an impressive ability to disappear. Quarantine conditions are no problem for him. He would rather stay in to read and write late into the night than go out with friends or colleagues. A deeply religious man, he’s often found huddling in a corner somewhere during late-night votes in the Senate, deep into his Bible study.</p><p>Early in Scott’s tenure as a senator, before he became so well-known in his state, his ability to stay under the radar was to his advantage, and he would, on occasion, don jeans and a ball cap and spend the day “undercover,” sweeping floors at a burrito joint, say, or riding a city bus as a way to talk to his constituents without all the pressure that comes with meeting an elected official.</p><p>If Republicans were having trouble selling conservatism to a diverse electorate, Scott figured he could be just the salesman they needed. “I sold doughnuts door to door, I sold vacuums door to door, I sold Amway door to door,” Scott told me in 2014 on a reporting trip I took with him to anonymously stock shelves in a Goodwill in Columbia. “So for me, that’s what I do.”</p><p>That day, he chatted with ex-cons, the working poor and a diverse cross-section of voters, fitting in in a way that many of his colleagues could never dream of — conducting a secret listening tour for political purposes. He may be a self-described introvert, but he has a natural charm, the kind of guy who knows the Capitol Hill police officers’ names and what football teams they root for. Known for his colorful socks and the stage presence of a revivalist preacher, Scott for a time even debated going into the seminary.</p><p>But there’s another reason Scott could pull off his undercover shtick: The people and places he visited were not foreign to him. Scott grew up in North Charleston, the son of a single mother who worked 16-hour days as a nursing assistant to provide for her three boys. A terrible student (“When you fail both English and Spanish they don’t call you bilingual,” he likes to joke. “They call you bi-ignorant.”), Scott spent more time in high school hanging around a local Chick-fil-A than studying. He struck up an unlikely friendship with the franchise owner, John Moniz, a White conservative Christian who became Scott’s mentor and who encouraged him not only to give his all to school, but to football. Scott ended up with a partial scholarship to Presbyterian College — and a newfound conservative ideology.</p><p>He started selling insurance after college, eventually owning an insurance business, and when Scott decided he wanted to run for elective office, he did what most Black candidates do: He sat down with the Democrats. But when they told him it would take a long time to work his way up through the hierarchy, he didn’t feel like waiting and took his talents to the Republican side of the aisle. It helped that he’d long felt more conservative than his Democratic friends, and it helped that the Republicans seemed more interested in making him a star.</p><p>The Republican Party donated the maximum amount of $5,000 to his first campaign, for Charleston County Council, the first time the party had given so much for a county council candidate, and Scott romped his Democratic opponent with 80 percent of the vote. In 2010, after a stint in the South Carolina House of Representatives, Scott threw his hat in the ring for the U.S. House, defeating Strom Thurmond’s son in a primary that Republicans couldn’t help but feel was symbolic.</p><p>“It meant a lot to the Republican Party that we finally had elected an African American and not just talked about it,” says Katon Dawson, who as the South Carolina chairman of the party recruited Scott to run for Congress.</p><p>Scott wasn’t the only Black Republican to arrive at the U.S. Capitol the next year. Rep. Allen West joined him too, and the retired Army lieutenant colonel from Florida was more than quotable (and controversial) enough for the two of them. Where West seemed most comfortable comparing Democrats to Nazis, Scott kept his head down. He was so risk averse that when his chief of staff suggested they might want to work on criminal justice reform, Scott balked, worrying, like Watts had before him, that such a move would pigeonhole him as the race-minded politician.</p><p>“If you jump on the bandwagon of issues that you are obviously uniquely prepared to discuss and champion, then you can get lost on the other overall issues,” Scott says. “That’s something I resisted because I didn’t want to be the ‘Black Republican.’ ”</p><p>A rare freshman who had the support of both the tea party members who dominated his class and the GOP leadership that the tea party bucked against, Scott earned a reputation as a serious legislator and an effective communicator. When Sen. Jim DeMint, the senior senator from South Carolina, stepped down in 2013, then-Gov. Nikki Haley tapped Scott to fill the seat.</p><p>His appointment, once again, made history. Not everyone was celebrating, though. He was the first Black senator to serve from a Southern state since Reconstruction, a milestone that an op-ed in the New York Times, by political science professor Adolph L. Reed Jr., stated only “obscures the fact that modern Black Republicans have been more tokens than signs of progress.”</p><img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213196342_3bc25/image/c2bec008-17e4-46d0-912a-1263abe47cfd_p.jpeg?ts=1598213196549\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Scott with  Sean Smith, his communications director. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>Shortly after Scott became a senator he got a license plate for his car that read USSENATE2. This was something that his close friend and fellow South Carolina Republican, then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, found hilarious. Gowdy teased his buddy about how the talk shows would be all over him every time he failed to signal, ran a stoplight or “played that Christian music he loves too loud.”</p><p>Gowdy says Scott chuckled, but only for a second. “He said to me, ‘How many times have you been pulled over in the past year, because for me it’s seven,’ ” Gowdy told me. “ ‘And I want them to know I’m not a threat.’ ” For Gowdy, getting to know Scott helped him realize the truth — so obvious to many — that the experiences of Black Americans are fundamentally different from those of White Americans. “He has opened my eyes to things that I could never have seen except for having the eyes of a Black man loaned to me,” Gowdy says.</p><p>Or, as Bakari Sellers, a Democrat who served with Scott in the state legislature, puts it: “He’s a lot of people’s Black friend these days.” With a friend like Scott, the hope is that the Republicans can get a few more people to RSVP to their party. After all, if this year’s presidential election is anywhere near as close as the last one, even a slight boost in Black voters could help tip it to Trump.</p><p>“Trump is obsessed with the Black vote,” says Armstrong Williams, himself a Black conservative media personality from South Carolina. And yet, Scott’s ability to help the president on that front may be a mirage. In 2016 Trump won only 4 percent of the Black vote in South Carolina, according to exit polls collected by CNN. Scott didn’t do much better, convincing only 8 percent of Black voters in his state to pull the lever for him. Even Sellers, who considers Scott someone he would “give a kidney to” if asked, says he would never vote for the guy.</p><p>South Carolina’s Democratic Party chairman, Trav Robertson, says that Scott should be worried about an electorate that is getting more and more diverse in his state (Scott isn’t up for reelection until 2022). His being Black, Robertson argues, matters a lot less to voters of color than it does to White Republicans. “It makes them feel better about the things they have said or done,” he says, “because they can say, ‘Hey, look: My position with Donald Trump doesn’t matter because we have an African American U.S. senator who is standing with us.”</p><p>Since coming to the Senate, Scott has gone much more out on a limb in terms of racial issues than he ever did in the House. That impulse didn’t exactly feel like a choice. In April 2015 police killed a Black man, Walter Scott, not far from the senator’s childhood home in North Charleston. That summer, a white supremacist shot and killed nine African Americans attending Mother Emmanuel AME church just over 10 miles away. “I do think that 2015 was a watershed moment where it became apparent to me that I had a unique voice on the issue of racism that still exists in the nation that needed to be addressed,” he told me. “That’s one of the reasons why I became a lot more vocal about the personal pains and challenges I have experienced.”</p><p>Scott describes himself as a Republican who “just happened to be Black,” but that perspective feels larger than it has before. As a new senator in 2015, he stood beside Haley when she announced they would be taking down the Confederate flag from the State House grounds. Later that year, for his first piece of legislation as a senator, he introduced a bill to get congressional funding for body cameras. That bill didn’t pass, but in 2018, the work he put into criminal justice reform with the likes of Democratic Sen. Cory Booker became law.</p><p>After George Floyd’s death in May, Scott and his staff knew that if he didn’t craft a police reform bill in response, it was possible no one in the Republican Party would. “He went to see Leader McConnell and asked what was going to happen,” DeCasper, his chief, says. “And literally the leader said, ‘You tell me.’ It was terrifying.”</p><p>What came next, depending on whom you ask, was either a good-faith attempt at reforming the police or a half-measure designed more to give the appearance of action than anything else. The bill Scott crafted would have restricted the use of chokeholds, though not ban them outright, and penalized departments that did not require body cameras. Unlike a Democratic bill that passed in the House, Scott’s bill would not have ended qualified immunity, which protects officers from being held civilly liable for violating the constitutional rights of citizens.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union opposed what it called Scott’s “rushed” legislation filled with studies and commissions instead of action. Talking about the bill, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Republicans were “trying to get away with murder.”</p><p>Without any Democratic support, the bill failed to get out of the Senate, and Scott took to the floor in late June to cry foul. This bill, he claimed, had 70 percent of what Democrats wanted in it, and they were letting “presidential politics” get in the way of compromise. He pointed out that if Democrats were truly serious about issues like banning chokeholds, they hadn’t been acting like it. Cities like Detroit, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Philadelphia could have banned them years ago on their own, he said, yet hadn’t. Then, he ended the speech, showing he wasn’t above playing politics himself.</p><p>“All these communities have been run by Democrats for decades,” he said. “... I’m willing to compete for their vote. Are you?”</p><p>“Am I trying to make up for comments made by the president?” Scott says. “Deﬁnitely not. What I am trying to do is make the country stronger. And I can do that by working with the president.”</p><p>In September 2017, the president asked Scott to come to the Oval Office after Scott expressed displeasure with Trump’s comments following riots in Charlottesville. A rally held by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in response to the proposed removal of a Robert E. Lee statue had turned violent when it met counterprotesters, resulting in the death of protester Heather Heyer. Trump afterward remarked that there had been “very fine people” on both sides.</p><p>Scott had told reporters he would not “defend the indefensible,” after which the president requested a meeting. As Jennifer DeCasper rode toward the White House gates with her boss, a few thoughts flew through her mind. They were, in no particular order: What the hell are we going to say to the president? Am I going to get fired if this goes poorly? And, how did I get here?</p><p>To answer the last question first: Born and raised in Colorado, DeCasper first came to the Hill in 1999 to work for her home-state senator Wayne Allard before leaving Washington for a legal career. She had a daughter, whom she raised on her own, became a hotshot prosecutor — and gave up that job after watching her child crawl over too many gruesome case files. She left in 2009 as the country continued to dig itself out of a financial crisis and took one of the only jobs she could find, working on the tarmac at Dulles International Airport directing airplanes in an orange vest.</p><p>In 2010, before Scott came to office, someone handed him her résumé, and he called her in for an interview. She bombed. “He asked me if I’d ever been to the South, and I said Florida,” she says. “And when he brought up his faith, I just lost it. I’ve never cried in an interview before that one.” As a woman of faith, DeCasper was moved by Scott’s devotion, but she left that interview sure she wouldn’t get the job. Scott would tell her later that he was, indeed, weirded out by the encounter, but he prayed on it that night and decided to give her the job anyway. They’ve been a team ever since; DeCasper worked her way up to chief of staff in 2015.</p><p>“We sat in the Oval Office,” Scott says, “and when you’re criticizing the president of the United States, talking about the compromising of moral authority, it can strike a nerve with someone who is not typically a person who listens well in those instances. He’s a counterpuncher, so criticizing him is not always the best way to get a positive response out of him. I had no intentions of being critical, just being honest about how I saw the situation.”</p><p>In their discussion, Scott didn’t hold back. “He did take the president on a journey of sorts,” DeCasper says. “It was phenomenal to see a Black man informing a White man of his history.” In addition to describing the racism that he and those in his community experience daily, Scott spoke about his grandfather, Artis Ware, who picked cotton in South Carolina and faced brazen discrimination, yet maintained a love of country in his heart. It is the story of his grandfather, says Al Jenkins, one of Scott’s oldest friends who now works for the senator, that gives Scott strength in such high-pressure moments. His grandfather never learned to read or write, but he used to sit at the kitchen table in the mornings with the newspaper in hand, trying to set an example for young Tim.</p><p>“His grandfather was the model, the example of how to endure,” says Jenkins. “Can you imagine his life in the ’30s, ’40s, ’50s in rural South Carolina dealing with people who called him names on a regular basis, and still getting up each day to do the job? Whatever Tim has to go through, it’s nothing like what his grandfather experienced.”</p><p>The Trump meeting was successful in at least one way from Scott’s perspective. When the president asked what he could do to help with the communities that were offended by his remarks, Scott pitched him on the idea of Opportunity Zones, legislation that encourages investment in poor communities, and that with the president’s blessing became part of the 2017 Republican tax overhaul. The meeting was successful in at least one way for the president as well: Afterward, his press office blasted out photos of their discussion, proof that the two were still on the same side (though the office did misspell the senator’s name in the caption as “Tom Scott.”)</p><p>“Am I trying to make up for comments made by the president?” Scott told me. “Definitely not. What I am trying to do is make the country stronger. And I can do that by working with the president.”</p><p>As for the history lesson, the results were more ambiguous. Scott and DeCasper were surprised by how well Trump seemed to take the conversation in, nodding along without interruption, keeping his focus on the senator as his story unfolded. “In that moment it did strike a nerve,” DeCasper says. But, “I’m not certain what the lasting effects were.”</p><p>“Behavioral modifications don’t happen overnight,” she says about Scott’s attempts at tutelage with the president. “It takes forever to teach your 2-year-old manners. What makes you think teaching a 65-year-old, 75-year-old man is going to happen? … It’s just an unrealistic expectation.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PS453GTJYI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>With the November election less than 80 days away, time is running out for Trump to court new voters. He bungled the response to the coronavirus pandemic (which has had an outsized effect on communities of color), and this summer saw a ramping up of Trump’s worst instincts when it comes to race. In response to protests that have sprung up across the country in the wake of Black deaths at the hands of police officers, Trump has taken the opportunity to defend memorials to Confederate generals, call a Black Lives Matter street painting a “symbol of hate” and repeal a housing desegregation rule that he said was “having a devastating impact” on “once thriving Suburban areas.”</p><p>Scott may not agree with these impulses, but his detractors will say that his continued support of Trump speaks at least as loud as his criticisms. “The way it comes off to me, the criticisms are not in any shape or form as bold as they need to be,” says Christale Spain, the coordinated campaign director for the South Carolina Democratic Party, about Scott’s calling the president out. “From South Carolina, growing up in Charleston, right in a slave-trade county … [Scott] doesn’t say anything, if you ask me. It amounts to nothing. … It amounts to everything for Trump to have a Black senator standing by his side.”</p><p>“He’s been part of the group that enabled Trump to take us to the brink of the destruction of our republic and democracy,” adds Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia.</p><p>When Trump leaves office, whether it’s next year or after, there will almost certainly be a battle for what Michael Steele calls “what’s left of the soul of the party.” But the sides will not all be clearly demarcated. There will be a large clutch of die-hard Trump supporters, a smaller group of Never Trumpers. But the vast majority of the GOP will be made up of people somewhere in the murky — some might say, swampy — middle.</p><p>On the one hand, if Trump is repudiated, Scott can point to plenty of instances in which he was critical. If Trumpism is reelected, Scott has a list of accomplishments he can point to for proof of his great working relationship with the president. If that’s an overt tactic — having it both ways — it’s one that Trump constantly attempts himself, since he takes so many stances on so many issues that he can always claim to ultimately be right.</p><p>“I know that my assignment is fraught with controversy and challenges and misunderstanding,” Scott told me. “People are more interested in how they feel than in objective perspective. And I’ve got to be okay with that.” Ultimately, Scott says everything he does he is doing for history. He knows that people will look back at this president, and at Scott’s relationship with him, and have strong opinions (though he believes perhaps they will be less vicious then). Scott also knows that he can never please the left, and that every time he criticizes the president he angers the base. In this way, Scott is just free to do what he thinks is right.</p><p>Rep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California and the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, says she feels “empathy” for her friend on the other side of the aisle, having to play his role in a party of “extremists.” She was not one of the Democrats who tried to villainize Scott after he put forward his police reform bill. Though she had plenty of problems with it, she saw it as a good-faith attempt by Scott to get something passed. After it failed, the two met in his office to discuss steps forward. They talked about their shared experiences with the police and the shared desire to get something done. “We don’t see the world that differently,” she says. “He’s a Black man above all else.”</p><p>Perhaps, Bass thinks, Scott is playing a “long game,” doing what he needs to stick around long enough to play a role in what the Republican Party can look like in the future. Scott has said that his next Senate campaign in 2022 will be his last. There have been rumors of a possible run for governor, and Scott’s friend Gowdy says he has been encouraging him to run for president. It’s an open question whether Scott wants to stay in politics at all. Scott certainly has a lot to gain, politically, by not burning all of his bridges in the party. For now, though, the more pressing matter may be: What does he lose for all the times he stays quiet?</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href=\"https://feedx.net\" style=\"color:orange\" target=\"_blank\">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href=\"https://feedx.xyz\" style=\"color:orange\" target=\"_blank\">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 04:20:31 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213195610_b5ade/image/07bbcc5b-1d5b-4a03-b0fc-baeb6f1799c2_p.jpeg?ts=1598213195730":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn9@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-38-581_6272853cf8956d1b.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z5EAWFTVCVEHZIEVV2ZPY4GRA4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn1@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-13-38-143_203695b239b71b57.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7Y2HETWTJQI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn61@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-13-42-029_22d58c39f7c001df.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213195817_c212e/image/607a729e-ca08-431d-b016-b3717d2465ed_p.jpeg?ts=1598213195981":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-13-39-249_e9360d801fad8981.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213196043_9bb13/image/384bfa78-92a6-489c-9514-a3ac68a72042_p.jpeg?ts=1598213196280":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn43@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-13-40-560_483254b338c7d4d2.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f9a9520118be29f510d87a4bb0524d64_published_1598213196342_3bc25/image/c2bec008-17e4-46d0-912a-1263abe47cfd_p.jpeg?ts=1598213196549":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn5@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-38-526_9550d97d86fbf201.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PS453GTJYI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn78@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-40-710_4d2de6215e5e4cc9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417757},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"Kellyanne Conway to leave the White House at the end of the month, citing the need to focus on her family","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-white-house/2020/08/23/6c26e18a-e5a7-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/6c26e18a-e5a7-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_published_1598235640889_d7da2/image/ecb1c807-7b36-4bc6-a882-6dac5611a464_p.jpeg?ts=1598235641013\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Ashley Parker</i><br><i>2020.08.24 10:12</i></div><p>Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Trump and one of his longest-serving aides, is leaving the White House at the end of the month.</p><p>Conway, whose title is counselor to the president, was Trump’s third campaign manager in 2016 and the first woman to successfully manage a presidential campaign to victory.

Our four children are teens and ‘tweens starting a new academic year in the middle school and high school that will be conducted remotely from home for a least a few months. As millions of parents nationwide know, kids ‘doing school from home’ requires a level of attention and vigilance that is as unusual as these times.”</p><p>Conway continued: “This is completely my choice and my voice. In time, I will announce future plans. For now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.”</p><p>Conway’s high school aged daughter had drawn attention for tweets about her parents and politics.</p><p>On Sunday, however, she also tweeted that social media was “becoming way too much” so she had decided to take “a mental health break.”</p><p>“See y’all soon,” she wrote. “Thank you for the love and support.

Senior advisers on the campaign had suggested she take a leave of absence from the White House to join Trump’s reelection effort, and anticipated a significant role where she would travel to two states a day between now and the election.</p><p>But Conway said she could not envision herself in that role right now, spending so much time away from her family.</p><p>In her statement, Conway also expressed her gratitude to Trump, his wife Melania, Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen, as well her colleagues in the administration.</p><p>“The incredible men, women and children I’ve met along the way have reaffirmed by later-in-life experience that public service can be meaningful and consequential,” she wrote. “For all of its political differences and cultural cleavages, this is a beautiful country filled with amazing people.

For example, if an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is issued for the Moderna/NIAID vaccine before Phase 3 is complete, “the individuals who are in the placebo limb should be given the option of being unblinded and should be given the vaccine if they so wish,” explained Anthony S. Fauci, director of the NIAID, in an email response.</p><p>Polashenski, who works as a nanny in the summertime and an elementary school music teacher during the school year, said she had been feeling helpless over the last few months as covid-19 ravaged the country. She’d been nervously anticipating the return to school in the fall, and keeping some distance from her mother, who has Stage 4 cancer. “Our relationship just hasn’t been the same, and that’s okay, because her safety is obviously the most important,” she said.</p><p>Polashenski wanted to contribute, but she wasn’t sure how. That’s what drew her to the vaccine trial. She applied for Phase 1 of the study but was rejected due to her asthma, she said, and so she reapplied for a later phase.</p><p>“This is something that I’m absolutely eligible to do, and I’m happy to do it,” Polashenski said. She’s excited about “participating in history.”</p><p>Polashenski said she knows that there’s a risk involved and that others may see her as a “guinea pig.”</p><p>“It is my choice to take that risk and I’m happy to do it,” she said. “If people like me aren’t willing to do that, then we’re going to be suffering the effects of this pandemic much longer.”</p><p>As a family physician in Kenner, La., Victoria Smith, 52, has seen three of her patients die as a result of the virus, she said. On July 30, Smith received her first shot in the late-stage Pfizer and BioNTech trial.</p><p>“Knowing that the really most effective way for us to get control of this disease is going to be through a vaccine, I really wanted to be part of that effort,” she said.</p><p>Smith is hoping that she received the vaccine, and that it proves to be protective, but she was also drawn to participate because of how <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/26/trial-coronavirus-vaccine-researchers-making-sure-black-hispanic-communities-are-included-studies/\">this pandemic has disproportionately impacted Black and Latino people</a>. “I wanted to be part of any efforts to decrease this scourge,” she said. “Also, as an African American, knowing that, in the past, scientific research has been done sometimes upon African Americans, not with our consent and active participation, so I wanted to be part of a trial that I was an active protagonist in.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A274FFKGIRFTPFJY5QE3FQ466E.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">(Courtesy of Victoria Smith)</small></div><p>Smith said she hopes she’ll be a role model for getting vaccinated. As a doctor, she encounters many people “who really have mistrust of all kinds of vaccines.”</p><p>Mary Dixson, 48, a lecturer in the department of communication at the University of Texas at San Antonio is enrolled in the Pfizer trial through Clinical Trials of Texas in San Antonio. She says she wants to be “a voice for the vaccine process.”</p><p>“You imagine the people in these trials,” she said, “and I don’t think people imagine their next-door neighbor or their friend on social media.”</p><p>Dixson said she feels a bit split on not knowing whether she received the vaccine. “There’s part of you that just desperately wants to know,” she said, “but I do have a fear that if I was 100 percent certain that I had the vaccine, that maybe I would behave in a way that was less responsible, just sort of psychologically.” She said not knowing ensures she will continue taking all the necessary precautions.</p><p>Sophie Tintori, 34, a postdoctoral research fellow in biology at New York University, is participating in the Pfizer trial through New York University’s Langone Health. She initially considered joining Phase 1 of the trial, but after doing her own research, decided she felt most comfortable proceeding with a later stage of the study. She said she thinks “the risk is quite low at this point” of the trial, but notes that “it is an experiment, it’s an unknown, the effects of the substance are not yet known — that’s why this experiment is happening.”</p><p>As a scientist, getting to bear witness to that research is part of what drew her in, and she’s happy to participate in the process. “That’s probably the main motivation at this part,” she said. “But then, of course, there’s also the less altruistic sense that it’s going to be a long time until any of these drugs are approved, and if I do get vaccinated on the way then I have no problem with that possibility.”</p><img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/54b4b9505359ff9c9371b65443450156_published_1597695699926_5a3a7/image/07a35254-e7e4-411c-9124-fb6c19f68be2_p.jpeg?ts=1597695700029\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><p>Trial participants do get varying amounts of compensation — some of the women spoken to for this article said they’ll receive $119 per site visit — but none of the women interviewed said payment was their main reason for enrolling.</p><p>Polashenski said she initially really wanted to get the vaccine, and that it would be a “bonus” if she were protected.

(Minas Panagiotakis/Getty)</small></div><div><i>By Rick Maese</i><br><i>2020.08.24 19:00</i></div><p>Thomas Hong was only 4 when he took up skating, but he quickly fell in love with going fast. Before long he was skating circles around the ice every day, year-round, blossoming into a top-rated junior short-track speedskater. In 2017, at age 20, he helped an American relay team set a world record. The next year, he raced for the United States at the Winter Olympics.</p><p>“By 2019, I was kind of the ace of the team,” Hong said. “I was taking it year to year and still trying to decide about the next Olympics. But as long as I was having fun and getting better, it made sense to keep going.”</p><p>After the PyeongChang Games, U.S. Speedskating hired a new short-track coach, Wilma Boomstra, who brought an aggressive attitude and coaching style to the ice. But barely two years into her tenure, Hong and other skaters said Boomstra’s approach crosses a line, and they have accused her of verbal, mental and emotional abuse.</p><p>Now 23, Hong says he has lost his love for speedskating and is considering retirement less than 18 months before the 2022 Beijing Olympics. He’s one of at least three skaters who have turned down invitations to train with Boomstra on the national team. And he is one of three skaters who filed complaints against the coach this year.</p><p>U.S. Speedskating, the sport’s governing body, investigated. Among its findings, according to a letter it sent to skaters last month: “Emotional misconduct in the form of verbal acts such as threatening communication towards athletes,” “bullying behavior in the form of shaming athletes in front of others” and “name-calling.”</p><p>But the organization opted to retain Boomstra, defending her coaching while instituting reforms aimed at improving her relationships with skaters.</p><p>“We feel strongly that Wilma is a very good technical and tactical coach — one of the top coaches in the world,” said Ted Morris, the chief executive of U.S. Speedskating. “We all have areas that we can improve upon. We’re committed to giving her those tools to make her better. If it doesn’t get better, we’ll make a decision.”</p><p>U.S. Speedskating declined to make Boomstra available for an interview. In an email response to questions from The Washington Post, Boomstra said the investigation has given her “an opportunity to review, reflect and refocus on how I can be a better communicator with our athletes moving forward.”</p><p>“There is a fine line when it comes to motivating athletes,” she added. “What works for one athlete might not work for another. I need to improve my understanding of where that line is for each of my athletes.”</p><p>In interviews with The Post, though, several skaters in the tightknit short-track community — the national team is typically made up of 12 skaters — said Boomstra has already lost many athletes’ trust. She has inflicted emotional damage on young skaters, they said, and prompted talented veterans and promising prospects alike to quit or train apart from the national team.</p><p>“When these issues are brought up and at least half the team is telling them about these issues, it should be a major red flag,” one skater said. Added another: “It’s not ideal to be two years away from the Olympics and to have people quitting and refusing to skate for her.”</p><p>In interviews with The Post, eight skaters detailed abuse they said they’ve experienced and witnessed. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearful of retaliation by team officials and worried about risking their spots on future national teams or funding that comes from U.S. Speedskating. They described belittling comments, vulgar language and demanding and punitive practices. They also accused Boomstra of playing favorites and creating a culture of distrust.</p><p>“It’s like waking up every day, not wanting to do something I‘ve loved for years,” one skater said. “It’s like when you break up with a first love — just a gut-wrenching feeling like someone had ripped out your heart. And that was every day.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HWIK3HA5MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Thomas Hong skates during a relay heat at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Hong says he's considering retiring rather than skate for Wilma Boomstra. (Bernat Armangue/AP)</small></div><p>‘Incredibly direct’</p><p>After the U.S. team managed just one short-track medal at the 2018 Olympics, U.S. Speedskating wanted to shake up its leadership. It turned to Boomstra, 50, the brash Dutch coach who had coached the U.S. national team from 1993 to 1995, leading American short-track skaters to four medals in six events at the 1994 Games. She became a private coach, and for years several skaters turned to her to help prepare for the Olympics.</p><p>“Initially I was on board,” Hong said. “I’d trained with her for a couple of weeks when I was 15 or 16 and then again three to four weeks when I was 18. I was excited for the prospect of her being my coach.”</p><p>But Hong and others said they quickly discovered Boomstra’s style was a stark departure from what they were accustomed to. Practice sessions amounted to a daily barrage of screaming, insults and public humiliation, skaters said.</p><p>“If she doesn’t like the way you’re skating, she’ll call you an embarrassment,” one skater said. “She’ll say you don’t belong there. It’s mental abuse, and that’s what happened to me.”</p><p>“I was literally depressed all the time,” another said. “I didn’t want to go to practice. I knew as soon as I was there, any happiness would just go away. It felt like I was wasting my life.”</p><p>“It gets to a point where it’s not motivating skaters. She’s actively discouraging them,” said Jae Jae Yoo, a five-time member of the national team. He retired last year, in part because of injury, but he was put off by what he said he saw and heard from Boomstra. “You have people quitting the sport and leaving the program. How is that motivating them?”</p><p>Other skaters said Boomstra routinely referred to some female skaters as fat and made other comments about their weight or conditioning.</p><p>“At one point she told me, ‘If you’re going to skate with me, I need you to lean out,’ ” one skater said. “I had been bulimic three years prior to that. When she told me that, I weighed 110 pounds. I was not overweight, and I was still working on my relationship with food.”</p><p>Morris, the U.S. Speedskating executive, said he was “aware that she can be incredibly direct sometimes. But I feel we have 100 percent addressed that, and she understands that she’s not to weigh in on that, and that’s input our sports nutritionist should be providing to our athletes and not that head coach.”</p><p>Boomstra also regularly called athletes “pussies,” skaters said. Morris acknowledged that particular insult “popped up a lot in the investigation.” He said the coarse language has since been addressed.</p><p>“I think we need to have a little sympathy for someone where English is a second language,” he said. “You revert to the few tools you have in the toolbox.”</p><p>In her email to The Post, Boomstra said she does “do not feel my interactions with skaters has been threatening in any way.”</p><p>“I’m disappointed that some athletes have perceived my interactions with them to be negative,” she said.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7UU23OHA5MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Boomstra and Maame Biney talk during the short-track world championships in 2019.  (Christof Koepsel/Getty)</small></div><p>One incident from last summer offers a window into Boomstra’s style and U.S. Speedskating’s decision to keep her. When a teenage skater arrived late for a team workout, Boomstra instructed him to perform push-ups as punishment. But the skater had recently slashed his arm with a skate blade and was wearing a protective brace that prevented him from doing them. Boomstra instructed him to do them one-handed instead. His teammates were horrified.</p><p>“He tried to do the one-arm push-ups, crying the whole time, and kept falling back onto the mat,” said one skater who was present. “She was humiliating him. Everyone was watching.”</p><p>But the injured skater, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation, defended the coach.</p><p>“I was upset because obviously it was hard,” he said. But, he added: “I deserved it. I didn’t really think much about it. If anything, I was never late again.”</p><p>The skater is one of several who have reported positive experiences training under Boomstra.</p><p>“There are new people, and I think it’s even better this year,” he said. “We keep growing as a team.”</p><p>U.S. Speedskating’s Athlete Advisory Council, a group of skaters that plays a role in the organization’s governance, reviewed the investigative report and agreed that some of Boomstra’s tactics “do not serve a motivational or training purpose and … have been harmful to athletes.”</p><p>In a letter to U.S. Speedskating in July, the council wrote that Boomstra’s behavior “crossed the line” and “needs to change.” But it declined “to draw a conclusion on whether Wilma’s behavior constituted emotional abuse,” and it made no recommendation on her job status.</p><p>“We recognize that there is a fine line between challenging athletes for motivational/training purposes, and causing perceived emotional abuse,” long-track skater Carlijn Schoutens, the council chair, wrote in the letter.</p><p>In an interview, Schoutens, a bronze medalist from the 2018 Olympics who retired last year to pursue medical school, said distinguishing between motivational tactics and abusive behavior “is definitely not black-and-white.”</p><p>“That’s what makes this really difficult to reach any conclusion on,” she said. “Every coach has their style; every athlete has their preferred style of being coached. Hopefully, there’s a line.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FPUNI4AXEMI6REWJG5VU7ZL764.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">The U.S. team of, from left, Carlijn Schoutens, Mia Manganello, Brittany Bowe and Heather Bergsma won bronze at the 2018 Winter Olympics. (Petr David Josek/AP)</small></div><p>Playing favorites</p><p>For the Athlete Advisory Council, one of the biggest problems identified by investigators was Boomstra’s “lack of fair coaching for lower caliber athletes at World Cups,” according to its letter. Skaters told The Post that less accomplished athletes often bore the brunt of her behavior and that signs of favoritism were evident from Day One.</p><p>“She told me that I wasn’t worth her attention,” one skater said. “I wasn’t allowed to ask for advice or help. She would pretend to forget my name. She would tell me every day, ‘It’s a privilege for you to be here.’ ”</p><p>Boomstra’s frosty relationship with another skater, Jamie Jurak, hit a breaking point during a 2019 World Cup event in Italy. According to multiple people who witnessed the events, Boomstra approached Jurak after a bad relay exchange in training and told her she could no longer practice with her teammates. Jurak eventually pressed her for an explanation. “She said: ‘You don’t belong here. There’s nothing here to coach. You’re an embarrassment,’ ” according to one person familiar with the exchange, which was corroborated by others. Jurak was in tears.</p><p>Said Boomstra in an email: “We had included her in relay training the previous week in Germany and it created a dangerous situation on the ice for all of our athletes. The safety of our skaters is paramount.”</p><p>Morris said Boomstra delivered her message to Jurak in a poor way. “That came to our attention, and we addressed it,” he said, adding that they told her: “Hey, it doesn’t matter — this athlete qualified, she made the team, you need to integrate her as much as possible.”</p><p>Jurak was considering filing a formal complaint, according to two people familiar with the incident. Instead, she wrote an email in February 2019 to three U.S. Speedskating officials with the subject line, “Athlete Statement of Coach Misconduct.” “I have had MANY coaches in the 20 years and never has one told me I am not coachable or don’t belong out there on the ice,” she wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Post.</p><p>Jurak, who now skates long track, declined to comment. After hearing her concerns, U.S. Speedskating agreed to pay for part of her travel costs.</p><p>“We had a very direct conversation,” Morris said. “I could tell how upset she was. We had sent her the bill for reimbursement. When I saw how upset she was, I felt it was fair for us to cover 50 percent of it.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7S5Z2FHA5MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">From left, Steven Dubois of Canada, Hwang Dae Heon of South Korea and Thomas Hong of the United States hold up their medals for the 1,500-meter race at the ISU Four Continents short-track championships in Montreal in January. (Graham Hughes/AP)</small></div><p>Pushing back</p><p>In late 2019, after skaters voiced complaints to Boomstra and U.S. Speedskating officials, the group came together for a team meeting to talk through their concerns. Four skaters present at the meeting said Boomstra defended her tactics and refused to make changes.</p><p>After the meeting, Hong was miserable traveling with the national team, he said. Days would pass without the coach speaking to him. When she did, he said, she was tearing him down, no longer trying to make him better. At season’s end, he left the team with no intention of returning.</p><p>“I’ve always felt coaches had my best interest at heart,” Hong said. “This is the only time I’ve felt I have a coach actively hoping I wouldn’t do well.”</p><p>In March, at the conclusion of the 2020 World Cup season, several athletes decided to do more to combat Boomstra’s behavior. They were surprised to learn that U.S. Speedskating requires a $500 fee to file a complaint against another person. So they turned to U.S. Center for SafeSport, the organization created by Congress to protect amateur athletes from abuse.</p><p>SafeSport forwarded the complaints to U.S. Speedskating. A SafeSport spokesman said it routinely sends complaints that don’t allege sexual abuse back to national governing bodies. But the skaters said they were frustrated to learn SafeSport passed off their concerns because they didn’t trust U.S. Speedskating to do a proper investigation.</p><p>“If I knew that U.S. Speedskating was going to be the one investigating it themselves, I never would’ve done it,” said one of the athletes who filed a complaint. “It’s so pointless.”</p><p>U.S. Speedskating has been through this before. In 2012, more than a dozen short-track skaters boycotted the team, accusing Jae Su Chun, the national team coach at the time, of abusive behavior. A U.S. Speedskating investigation found no pattern of abuse, but the investigator said that “does not mean we are condoning the methods or the tactics that were used by the U.S. Speedskating coaches.” Chun resigned, and the team named a new head coach 16 months before the Sochi Games, where it won just one medal.</p><p>This time, Morris coordinated with law school students from a nearby university to carry out the investigation. After three-plus months of interviewing skaters and others, the investigators outlined concerning behavior, according to the letter sent to skaters, including “threatening communication,” “bullying behavior,” failure to provide “fair coaching for lower caliber athletes” and “intimidation by a coach in a position of authority over the skaters.”</p><p>U.S. Speedskating implemented a number of measures in response, according to the same letter: requiring a third party be present for all coach-athlete meetings; ongoing “team culture meetings” without Boomstra present “for feedback purposes”; and required meetings between Boomstra and a sports psychologist “on athlete communication and separation of coaching and personal relationships.” In addition, Boomstra is required to consult with the short-track program director before making any decisions that affect athletes, and she will be evaluated quarterly by U.S. Speedskating.</p><p>“My takeaway and what I conveyed to Wilma was that athletes have changed over the last 20 years, and you got a young group of athletes here, and you need to evolve the way you communicate with them and motivate them,” Morris said. “We’re going to do everything in our power to give you the resources and the tools to get better at that.”</p><p>Schoutens said the Athlete Advisory Council will continue to monitor the situation, too, checking in every three to fourth months for signs of progress.</p><p>“I think that we recognize that if even one athlete feels like they’re experiencing inappropriate coaching, that’s one too many,” she said.</p><p>Most of the short-track athletes are now in Utah, preparing for the fall season and a final push for the Beijing Olympics. Morris held a team meeting with them on Friday without Boomstra. He laid out the reform measures now in place and reiterated his support for the coach, according to two people present.</p><p>Hong was not there. He’s back home in Maryland, still sorting out his future. For now, he has no plans to resume serious training and is preparing for the fall semester at the University of Maryland.</p><p>“I’m still figuring things out,” he said. “I haven’t officially retired. But the last year was difficult. It was by far the worst I’d ever experienced. It’s something that no one should have to go through.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:21:24 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b6ad99a6bbfa2c22abccfc392ed24167","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B47V5CXA5QI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn85@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-13-38-996_66a10d384c8f2237.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HWIK3HA5MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn97@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-13-39-430_70969f5fe376142c.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7UU23OHA5MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn9@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-39-371_eb0e9a618a498bf2.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FPUNI4AXEMI6REWJG5VU7ZL764.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-40-683_a08d0c1bf4935347.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7S5Z2FHA5MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-13-40-200_721dd51815dfef92.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417748},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"Marco and Laura take aim at Gulf Coast, threatening wide area from Louisiana to Texas","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/08/24/marco-laura-gulf-storm-path/","description":"<img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HHXVWU32VNF5TMCNYI4DZEXZ7A.png\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Simulation of Marco (near Louisiana) and Laura (near Cuba) on Monday morning.

You think I’m lucky? Because I don’t always feel lucky.</p><p>At every stage of what we went through, I look back and it’s like: How is this possible? What are the odds?</p><p><b>Timothy Graveson, 15:</b> I didn’t even know what a ventilator was. I didn’t know about ECMO or life support. I never had any idea how bad this could get, which is probably what kept me from panicking.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PQGDVZ7JYZHGPP773RETZGI2HE.JPG\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">From left, Matthew Graveson, 16, Sherry Graveson, George Graveson, and Timothy Graveson, 15, outside their home in Alexandria, Va. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)</small></div><p><b>George Graveson (father):</b> I got the virus first. We were taking aggressive measures to social distance, but I must have picked it up at the grocery store or somewhere. I had a tiny cough, and then I had chills one afternoon. It wasn’t anything huge. It wasn’t super drastic, and if one person in the family was set up to get hit hard based on age or whatever, it was probably going to be me.</p><p><b>Sherry Graveson (mother):</b> I tested positive and it was nothing. I barely had a sniffle. No fever. No cough. Why? Why was it nothing? My daughter was in the house with us all the time, and she never even got it. None of it makes any sense.</p><p><b>Matthew: </b>We were so careful. I wasn’t allowed to see friends, even though I asked my parents like a thousand times a day. We wore masks. We quarantined more than any family I know. I remember texting one of my friends and saying: “Even if I get the virus, I’m not that worried. Maybe for my parents, but for us it will probably be like a cold.” I thought kids weren’t supposed to get the virus as bad. I thought it wasn’t common for kids to infect other people and pass it on.</p><p><b>Sherry: </b>Matthew started complaining about a runny nose on Tuesday. Then it was pinkeye symptoms on Wednesday, and the fever came after that. We tried every possible way to manage it at home, but his temperature wouldn’t come down. He was lethargic and his whole body ached. We were calling the doctor and saying: “It wasn’t like this for us. This is different. Why isn’t he getting better?” They were perplexed. They just kept saying: “There’s a lot we don’t understand. We’re asking the same questions.”</p><p><b>George: </b>This is a kid who’s the example of young and healthy. He works out all the time. He’s on all the sports teams, and now you’re watching him struggle with the stairs. We started to hear warning phrases from doctors about oxygen supply and multi-system failures. The decline was impossibly fast.</p><p><b>Sherry: </b>They told me to monitor his oxygen level. I checked all the time. Late one night, something told me to go check again, and it was dropping. I called 911. I rode with him to Fairfax Inova, near where we live in Virginia, and George stayed home to look after our two younger ones. The doctors did the X-ray, and it showed some pneumonia. They said they needed to take him upstairs so he could be admitted. They told me: “I’m sorry, but you have to go home. You can’t be here as a visitor.” That was their rule because I’d had covid.</p><p><b>Matthew:</b> That was the first time I felt afraid. I didn’t want to be alone. I kept asking her if she would have to leave, and she was saying: “No way. No.”</p><p><b>Sherry:</b> I explained the situation to doctors, managers — I had like five different employees I was talking to. I said: “Are you kidding, me? He’s a minor. He’s really sick.” But it was their rule. They took him upstairs, and I stood there, and what was I going to do? I got in the car. I felt sick. It was wrenching. I’ll never forget that drive home. I went into the house and tried to hold it together and make sure the other kids were okay.</p><p><b>Timothy:</b> After Matthew went to the hospital, the virus was in my head. My parents were trying everything to keep my sister and me safe. They would bring food on a tray, set it outside my door, and then I’d wait until they got back downstairs. I barely left my room for a week. I was still healthy at that point, but I felt like I was waiting to get it. I would blow my nose and be like: “Do I have it? Is this it?” Drinks would go down the wrong pipe, and I’d be like: “Oh no! Am I dying? Is it happening?” And then one day I couldn’t catch my breath, and I didn’t have to guess anymore.</p><p><b>Sherry: </b>We took him to Inova — and it was the same thing for both boys. The doctors tried to help their lungs with supplemental oxygen, but it wasn’t enough. They tried high-flow oxygen, flipping them over on their stomachs, different drugs, and finally a ventilator to breathe for them. Matthew’s kidney was failing. He had liver problems. It was hour by hour whether they were holding through the night. At one point the doctors called and said they needed to rush Matthew to the other side of the hospital, because there was only one intervention left that might save his life. I wasn’t there. I couldn’t see him. They were saying: “We need your approval to go ahead with this.” There was a witness on the phone, and it was: “Now. Now. Now.”</p><p>It was too much, and then a week or so later we went through it again with Timothy.</p><p><b>Timothy:</b> All of the sudden it felt like 50 nurses and doctors came rushing in. I couldn’t control my breathing. They were like: “Just lie back and it will be over.” I kept thinking: I need to be asleep. Fall asleep. Please, fall asleep. I could hear a million beeps and so many footsteps. That’s the last thing I remember.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZMY6SXAAII6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Prayer rocks outside the Graveson family home in Alexandria, Va.  (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)</small></div><p><b>Erik Osborn (doctor):</b> We used ECMO machines for both boys, and that’s the highest form of life support we can offer. Ninety-five percent of our ECMO patients would be dead without it. The machine essentially replaces your heart and your lungs by pumping blood out of your body, oxygenating it, and then sending it back. It’s last-resort. We’re pushing the boundaries of physiology and bringing a patient to places they would never have gone on their own. You’re suspending someone in the state right before death and keeping them in that place for days or weeks so their lungs have a chance to recover.</p><p><b>George: </b>The boys were in rooms 618 and 620, and we were allowed to visit for one hour a day. They were connected to these big bags of medicine, with tubes and wires running everywhere.</p><p><b>Sherry:</b> It was hard to get in the car and know what you were going to see. It was hard to go there, emotionally. We would rub their hair and hold onto their hands. We would read to them, sing, pray with them, try to have a conversation. There was no reciprocation. We’d search for anything hopeful until the hour was up.</p><p><b>George: </b>Sometimes I would close my eyes and hold onto the fact that at least their hands felt warm.</p><p><b>Sherry:</b> I understand a lot more now about what faith is really about, which comes when you have nothing else left. I’m an organist at three churches in Alexandria, and we had daily prayer groups, people praying from over 50 countries, people sending us monetary support, food, favorite scriptures. I wrote down about 100 verses and plastered them all over the house — on the microwave, doors, TVs, mirrors. I wanted reminders everywhere. “In this world you will have tribulations, but take heart. I have overcome the world.”</p><p><b>Dr. Osborn:</b> You get into thinking about that nebulous line between life and death with these patients. For Matthew, I remember days when we would bring down his medication and try to wake him up to see how he was doing, and we got nothing. He wasn’t responding. You had no idea where his brain was, or if it was okay, or if he was still in there. We have the best medical advancements available to us, but at that point, what you’re doing is trying to stimulate the patient by grabbing their shoulder, looking into their eyes, and seeing if their eyes respond to you. This will sound unscientific, but there’s something about looking into a patient’s eyes and seeing that they’re still a living being, and maybe they recognize they’re looking at another living being, and you can see and feel their life force.</p><p>The nurses can sense that all the time. “Did he follow commands?” “No.” “Did he move his legs?” “No, but he’s there. He’s still in there.”</p><p><b>Matthew:</b> I remember dreams. I was in some abandoned hospital, and I was chained to the bed. I kept fighting the chains and trying to escape. When I woke up, I couldn’t tell what was real. I saw a hospital room and a whiteboard on the wall, but the day and the month didn’t make sense. I was like: Where am I? What happened to all of May?</p><p><b>Timothy: </b>Me, too. There’s a whole month that I basically don’t remember.</p><p><b>Sherry:</b> That’s a good thing. Believe me.</p><p><b>Timothy:</b> When I woke up, I still thought I was dreaming. Everything was pitch black. Sounds came back first. I heard beeping again, and I could feel the restraints on my arms. I couldn’t move my arms, legs, chest, anything. I didn’t believe I was back in reality until my Mom started showing me videos of my teachers and everyone praying for us. Then I was like: Okay. This must be real. This is too crazy even for a dream.</p><p><b>Sherry:</b> All the pain and anguish of that month was nowhere near as intense as the joy when they came back. Matthew opened his eyes and right away he tried to bust out of his bed. He still had his trach in his neck, but he saw me, and he tried to hug me. The nurses were crying and losing it. “He knows who I am!”</p><p><b>George:</b> The relief that they recognized us, and reached out for us, and made the same jokes — it was euphoria.</p><p><b>Sherry: </b>The community arranged a parade when the boys came home about a month later. It was too much for them to walk, but we rode in a car behind a police escort. We had firetrucks and hundreds of people standing alongside the road holding signs and balloons. The boys were speechless.</p><p><b>Matthew: </b>The support is mind-blowing, and I’m grateful. But there’s a part of me that’s still like: Why me? I was healthy. I never really got sick. Even during the quarantine, I was working out and getting stronger, and then I ended up losing like 50 pounds and waking up as, like, a skinny, weak kid. There’s a lot to rebuild.</p><p><b>Timothy:</b> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy. It’s a miracle to be alive, but it would have been luckier not to get it.</p><p><b>George:</b> It’s still a lot for us to process. For both boys to get sick like that?</p><p><b>Sherry:</b> They’re back home. They’re getting better. I go to bed at night knowing we’re all here under the same roof. But I keep waiting for more answers. Can they get sick again? How long do they have antibodies? I asked every single doctor, and they said: “They probably have some kind of immunity, but we don’t know how long, or how much, or what happens if they get it again. It’s a novel virus. It behaves unpredictably.”</p><p><b>About this series</b></p><p>Voices from the Pandemic is an oral history of covid-19 and those affected.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 23:20:23 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6df91ebf76ceb3ae810a040cfc9950f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/6df91ebf76ceb3ae810a040cfc9950f9_published_1598218554659_c2d3a/image/04212e36-352b-4fad-bb1a-c9e3748b5197_p.jpeg?ts=1598218554799":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-40-638_157086df127e49a5.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PQGDVZ7JYZHGPP773RETZGI2HE.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-13-39-823_5ed1a41cdb4b3617.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZMY6SXAAII6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn69@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-13-38-690_0f1e08cc18b3f215.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417761},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"Jerry Falwell Jr. agrees to resign from Liberty University","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/08/24/jerry-falwell-jr-agrees-resign-liberty-university/","description":"<img src=\"\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3DPLXRG6JAI6VNHREW3WFTN36Q.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. speaks at the 2017 convocation at Liberty University.

The move came after a series of personal scandals rocked the evangelical university he has led since 2007.</p><p>Opposition to his presidency had been growing, but came to a dramatic head after two new reports about a young man Falwell and his wife befriended at a Florida pool, went into business with and who allegedly was sexually connected to the couple. One report painted Falwell as the victim of an obsessive affair; the other as an eager participant manipulating a naive young man.</p><p>Falwell had been placed on paid leave Aug. 7 after he posted a provocative picture of himself and his wife’s assistant on social media. Both had their zippers partially down and Falwell was holding a dark beverage he joked was nonalcoholic and “just a prop.” Drinking or being around alcohol as well as sexual promiscuity are banned for students under Liberty’s personal code of conduct. Liberty board members had said in a statement Friday that they were investigating.</p><p>Monday was the first day of classes for Liberty students this fall.</p><p>Liberty University was founded in 1971 to “train champions for Christ,” and many at the school revere the memory of his father, Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent evangelist who was one of the school’s founders.</p><p>For many years, Falwell was best known for lifting the university his father helped found out of debt, shoring up its finances, improving its physical campus and leading a dramatic growth in enrollment.</p><p>He made national headlines when he endorsed President Trump in 2016, one of the first prominent evangelicals to do so.</p><p>He also garnered criticism for that: A former chairman of Liberty’s executive committee, Mark DeMoss, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/01/jerry-falwell-jr-s-trump-endorsement-draws-objections-from-his-late-fathers-confidant/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28\">resigned over the endorsement</a>, saying Trump’s campaign was a rejection of the values the university promotes.</p><p>And a series of scandals increased concern among some alumni, students and other supporters of the university.</p><p>At a Liberty convocation in 2015, Falwell <a href=\"https://www.wsls.com/news/2015/12/08/jerry-falwell-jr-defends-his-statements-about-muslims-and-gun-control-opposition/\">said</a> the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that year could have been prevented if people had concealed-carry permits and had guns to “end those Muslims before they walked in killing.”</p><p>In May, Falwell tweeted a photo of a face mask decorated with an image of a person in Ku Klux Klan robes and another in blackface, in an attempt to taunt Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) over his blackface scandal from a medical school yearbook. Falwell <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/06/08/liberty-falwell-blackface-tweet/?itid=lk_inline_manual_33\">deleted the tweet and apologized</a>, but several students and staff members left the school in protest.</p><p>The board faced increased pressure to take action, with pastors and influential supporters including Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a Southern Baptist minister and former Liberty instructor, calling for his resignation. An alumni group, Save71, called for Falwell’s permanent removal. “We put no faith in riches or comfort, in status or power,” they wrote. “We put our faith in Christ alone, and we want Liberty University to follow Him.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 21:20:37 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6405602faf31d7234b9985a79cfd7f4c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3DPLXRG6JAI6VNHREW3WFTN36Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn66@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-13-39-169_fea4f23a59e97b3d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417748},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"DeJoy pushes back on criticism of cost-cutting changes to USPS","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/24/dejoy-testimony-usps-house/","description":"<img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECMIQRXE64I6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.

Internal Postal Service documents obtained by The Washington Post and distributed to mid-level managers stated that DeJoy’s new goals included eliminating overtime.</p><p>DeJoy testified that he suspended some of his cost-cutting moves to ensure public confidence in the Postal Service in the run-up to the November election. “This sacred duty is my No. 1 priority between now and Election Day,” he said.</p><p>“I encourage all Americans who choose to vote by mail to request their ballots early and vote early as a common sense best practice,” he added.</p><p>But many of his maneuvers will remain in place. Extra mail delivery trips will remain banned, DeJoy testified to a Senate panel on Friday. Mail-sorting machines and mailboxes that were removed will not be reinstated, he said.</p><p>DeJoy on Monday said that eliminating the extra mail delivery trips has improved the agency’s performance, citing internal USPS statistics.</p><p>“We have accomplished this goal,” he said, adding later, “While we have had temp service declines which should not have happened, we are fixing this.”</p><p><i>By: Jacob Bogage</i></p><p><b>10:51 AM: Hearing presents dueling portraits of on-time performance</b></p><p>House Democrats and Postmaster General DeJoy are presenting seemingly incompatible views of recent Postal Service performance at the hearing.</p><p>On Saturday, Chairwoman Maloney released <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/new-postal-service-documents-show-nationwide-delays-far-worse-than-postal\">an internal USPS document</a> dated August 12 showing, in Maloney’s words, “a significant drop in service standards across the board since the beginning of July.”</p><p>That comports with an “exponential” drop in on-time delivery that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/\">some businesses and individuals</a> reported around the same time.</p><p>\"We have all seen the headlines from every corner of our country, we have read the stories and seen pictures, we have heard directly from our constituents, and these new documents show that the delays are far worse than we were told,\" Maloney said in a statement.</p><p>In his opening statement, on the other hand, Postmaster General DeJoy says “in just a few weeks, we have substantially improved our on-time dispatch schedule from 89.4 percent to 97.0 percent on time.”</p><p>So which is it: a \"significant drop in service standards\" or a schedule that has \"substantially improved\"?</p><p>The answer may depend on the time frame. The data presented by Maloney only <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/PMG%20Briefing%20-%20Service%20Performance%20Management%2008-12-20%20%282%29.pdf\">go through the week of August 1</a>, and show the on-time performance of first-class mail falling to around 85 percent by then.</p><p>It is now August 24, and in the intervening weeks it may be the case that service has rebounded back to the level DeJoy cites in his statement.</p><p>He mentions, for instance, that one of the changes he made to mail service was to reduce the number of “late trips” and “extra trips” starting in early July. He says that “caused mail to miss the scheduled transportation, and has temporarily impacted mail and package service performance.”</p><p>He goes on: “We have acted quickly to correct these issues and have seen immediate improvements.”</p><p>The reconciliation of Maloney and DeJoy’s claims, then, would look something like this: in early July, DeJoy’s changes to mail service resulted in a steep drop in on-time performance. That drop persisted through at least the beginning of August. As DeJoy tells it, service since then has rebounded.</p><p><i>By: Christopher Ingraham</i></p><p><b>10:29 AM: Democratic committee chairwoman suggests mail delays aimed at hobbling mail-in voting</b></p><p>The chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform suggested Monday that the new postmaster general may be attempting to “hobble mail-in voting” to help President Trump.</p><p>Rep.

However, many Americans have experienced delays in receiving their mail, something that DeJoy has acknowledged and attributed in part to challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“Perhaps Mr. DeJoy thought his sweeping changes would not cause any delays. In my opinion, that would be incompetence at best,” Maloney said. “Or perhaps this was intentional. … Perhaps Mr. DeJoy is just doing exactly what President Trump said he wanted on national television, using the blocking of funds to justify sweeping changes to hobble mail-in voting.”</p><p>In his own opening statement, the top Republican on the committee, Rep. James Comer (Ky.) accused Democrats of propagating “a baseless conspiracy theory” and criticized what he called a “hysterical frenzy whipped up around this issue by my colleagues on the left and their friends in the media.”</p><p><i>By: Erica Werner</i></p><p><b>09:44 AM: DeJoy reaffirms Postal Service will prioritize ballots</b></p><p>Postmaster General Louis DeJoy vowed in his opening statement to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that the U.S. Postal Service would prioritize election mail as the November election draws near and said he would pause “any immediate efforts that might be utilized to tarnish the Postal Service brand, particularly as it relates to our role in the democratic process.”</p><p>His remarks, submitted Monday morning, largely mirror his testimony to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where he testified Friday. He told senators that he did not ban overtime — which he repeated in his statement to the House committee — or curtail it. He also repeated that the Postal Service would continue to treat election items mailed at bulk rates with first-class privileges.</p><p>DeJoy, in his opening statement, decried a “false and unfair” narrative that he said could “undermine public confidence in the electoral process.”</p><p>“Managing the Postal Service in an efficient and effective manner cannot succeed if everything is politicized; this was a key insight that led to the creation of an independent Postal Service in the first place,” he said. “In such an atmosphere, it becomes impossible for the Postal Service to do the job that Congress has tasked us to do, and that it is my solemn duty to uphold.”</p><p>President Trump earlier this month said he would seek to block funding for the Postal Service to try to hamper its ability to process mail-in ballots. Trump’s comments, along with DeJoy’s controversial cost-cutting agenda, have turned the nation’s mail service into a political football.</p><p>DeJoy cracked down on overtime hours, according to internal USPS documents circulated to mid-level management and obtained by The Washington Post. He also banned extra trips to ensure on-time mail delivery. The Postal Service also removed close to 700 mail sorting machines and dozens — by some estimates, hundreds — of public collection boxes.</p><p>DeJoy said those removals would be suspended until after the election, but he also told the Senate committee that he would not reinstall any equipment or roll back his policy on extra mail delivery trips.</p><p><i>By: Jacob Bogage</i></p><p><b>09:39 AM: DeJoy was hired to be a ‘transformational leader’ and make ‘dramatic changes,’ Postal chairman set to testify</b></p><p>DeJoy was hired to be a “transformational leader” who would make “dramatic changes” to the Postal Service to make it financially viable, according to Duncan’s written testimony.</p><p>In his prepared remarks, Duncan rejected criticisms that the Postal Service had intentionally tried to disrupt the mail voting process for the November election, and said changes made by DeJoy were intended to improve “ingrained inefficiencies in Postal operations.”</p><p>“Throughout this process, the Board’s focus has been on ensuring that the Postal Service operates more effectively and efficiently,” Duncan’s testimony reads. “Unfortunately, some have sought to argue that these long-needed reforms are intended to disrupt the ability of voters to use the mail for voting. … Nothing could be farther from the truth.”</p><p>Duncan, former chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2007 to 2009 and former president and chief executive of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, is scheduled to testify at the House hearing Monday morning on the Postal Service.</p><p>In his testimony, Duncan is expected to explain the years-long financial challenges of the Postal Service and the search process that took place once the former postmaster general, Megan Brennan, notified the Board of Governors of her impending retirement last fall.</p><p>The postmaster general reports to the bipartisan Postal Board of Governors, which directs and controls the agency’s operations and expenses. The board comprises nine governors who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Duncan was appointed by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate in August 2018.</p><p>According to Duncan’s testimony, two outside search firms helped the internal search committee review more than 212 candidates. The board unanimously selected DeJoy for his experience in the private sector as a logistics executive who could help the Postal Service save money and improve its service, according to Duncan.</p><p>“The Postal Service has experienced more than a decade of financial losses, and this year again is closing in on another $11 billion in losses. There must be dramatic changes if the Postal Service is to succeed,” Duncan’s testimony reads. “Mr. DeJoy was selected to be that transformational leader, who can help strengthen the Postal Service for the long term.”</p><p>The hearing is set to begin at 10 a.m.</p><p><i>By: Michelle Ye Hee Lee</i></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:20:24 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f354c83d4fcc90abb8512ea7a7958ced","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECMIQRXE64I6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-13-39-017_314515ce85d89aa9.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f354c83d4fcc90abb8512ea7a7958ced_published_1598282206543_18beb/image/6fbaea7a-8759-49e6-b099-022af5d8fe6a_p.jpeg?ts=1598282206611":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-13-40-096_e2846df3286aed0b.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/f354c83d4fcc90abb8512ea7a7958ced_published_1598282206637_a809f/image/75d684c2-c65c-4b60-8185-c59c68104670_p.jpeg?ts=1598282206690":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-13-40-004_80d332067ffcbba0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417749},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"Donald Trump Jr. and the future of Trumpism: He upended expectations four years ago.

Just a few months before his father entered the presidential race, Don Jr. was dabbling as a guest host of infomercials where he would interview executives marketing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KDzPO76NFk&t=6s\">temporary office rentals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ap1VIw62rA&t=6s\">obscure construction techniques</a>.</p><p>“What exactly is grip metal technology?” the real estate scion, stiff and unsmiling, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAjZ2_m3rH0\">asked one guest</a>.</p><p>To prepare for his convention speech four years ago, Don Jr. practiced each day for a week. When he took the lectern, he started by praising his wonderful wife and mentioning their five children — and then identified himself as the son of “a great man.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PBHZFRFSI4I6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Don Jr. with his father on the North Portico of the White House in July 2018. (Mark Wilson/Getty)</small></div><p>The speech was notable for its polish. The candidate himself would fulminate in his own speech about violence in the streets, but Don Jr. eloquently heralded his father’s common touch. His father “didn’t hide out behind some desk in an executive suite. . . . We didn’t learn from MBAs. We learned from people who had doctorates in common sense,” Don Jr. told a rapt crowd. He didn’t call Mexicans rapists. He didn’t hurl insults. As he went on, the speech developed its own cadence; soon, the packed convention hall was calling out “Trump!” after each of his rhythmic sentences.</p><p>The political world was dazzled. “Poised and focused,” <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/07/20/donald-trump-jr-delivers-the-speech-his-dad-never-could/\">wrote the New York Post’s John Podhoretz</a>, calling it a speech Trump Sr. would never have been able to pull off. “I think I watched the speech of a future politician there,” said David Chalian, CNN’s political director. “In fact, a much better politician than his own father,” added Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, “and strikingly, much more knowledgeable in conservative orthodoxy than his own father as well. The pundit-class consensus was clear: Once Donald Trump’s crazy experiment in politics went down in flames that November, the son would be the one to watch out for.</p><p>Four years later, Don Jr., 42, who declined to comment for this story, has upended expectations again — or perhaps undermined them. Despite his father’s plan that he stay behind the scenes with his brother Eric and run the family business, Don Jr. has found a central role in the Trump universe, but not as a businessman or a poised and focused politician. Rather, he has become one of his father’s most aggressive and reliable defenders — a bombastic regular on Fox News, and a skilled meme-maker who relishes trolling the libs, flirting with some of the darker corners of his father’s base in the process. Don Jr. may well be the future of Trumpism after all — if Trumpism turns out not to be a political philosophy but a media-savvy culture-war incubator.</p><p>He is preparing for this year’s convention speech, scheduled for Monday night, the same way he did the last one, but he will come to the stage transformed. After a divorce, a special counsel investigation and countless skirmishes with his opponents, Don Jr. is battle-worn and grizzled — less constrained than he was four years ago, and far more confident.</p><p><b>After Trump's surprise</b> win, CEOs flocked to meet with the president-elect's daughter Ivanka, in hopes that she would have her father's ear and perhaps help moderate his more extreme positions. Ivanka had always been viewed as her father's favorite, and now she and her husband, Jared Kushner, were anointed to go along to Washington. Her older brother, meanwhile, kept his head down. Don Jr. wasn't seen as a key conduit to his father's future administration. His main focus as a member of the transition team was to secure Ryan Zinke as interior secretary.</p><p>However, he <i>had </i>taken meetings during the 2016 campaign — including one in particular that would cause the entire administration problems.</p><p>“If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html\">wrote in an email</a> to a go-between offering to set up a meeting with a source promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, provided in cooperation with the Russian government.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kremlin-denies-knowing-of-donald-trump-jr-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-during-2016-campaign/2017/07/10/c2bfee34-6566-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html\">June meeting, with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya</a>, was a bust, but when it was first reported in the summer of 2017, it was the first evidence of any member of the Trump family showing openness to accepting help from Russian officials. It pulled Don Jr. into the center of what became the Mueller investigation — and led, indirectly, to his evolution as a key player in the conservative media world.</p><p>To hear his allies tell it, the negative attention that he received from the mainstream media about the Veselnitskaya meeting elevated him on the right as a symbol of media persecution. But Don Jr. had already started dabbling in controversy on his own.</p><p>After a September presidential debate, he tweeted an article from the conspiracy-theory-mongering site Infowars claiming that Hillary Clinton had worn an earpiece during the event. That same month, he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKMtdN5Bam5/\">shared</a> on Instagram a Photoshopped image of him and other members of the Trump campaign in a heroic group pose (labeled “The Deplorables”) alongside a cartoon frog known as a white supremacist mascot. That same month, on Twitter, he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles: “If . . . I told you only three would kill you, would you take a handful?” he posted. “That’s our Syrian refugee problem.” He promoted an article on the old, discredited conspiracy theory that the Clintons were involved in White House aide Vince Foster’s suicide.</p><p>The supportive attention from conservative media prompted him to lean into campaigning and fundraising for his father. And at any rate, by that point his ability to pursue new business for the Trump Organization was severely limited by conflicts of interest and damage to the brand from his father’s divisive policies. He started traveling with a camera-ready new girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, whom he started dating in 2018, and developed a smooth stump speech.</p><p>“Don’s become a force of nature on the political stump and has a genuine following because they see him out there fighting every day,” said Cliff Sims, a former White House communications official who remains close to Don Jr. “His dad sees him out there and it’s like a chip off the old block. He thinks he’s pretty good.”</p><p>Yet Don Jr.’s combative social media presence drew even more attention. “He lobs these meme bombs that are entirely provocative and are meant to be alienating to the left,” said Leslie Hahner, a professor of communications at Baylor University who studies the rhetoric of the alt-right. “He tends to wink to conspiracy theorists and white supremacists who amplify his father’s position.” And in turn, he repeats messages from all corners of social media with the imprimatur of the president’s son, drawing them “into the public conversation with a relevance they wouldn’t normally have,” Hahner adds.</p><p>Don Jr.’s allies say he’s just having fun and is sometimes oblivious about where the material originates. “It’s pretty simple, really,” Sims said. “The guy sees funny memes and puts them on Instagram.” August’s offerings have included memes implying that Joe Biden is cognitively impaired or supportive of urban riots and highlighting Bill Clinton’s relationship with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (who also socialized with Trump Sr.).</p><p>Last month, Twitter ordered Don Jr. to delete a misleading tweet featuring a controversial group of doctors — proponents of the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine — claiming masks don’t thwart the spread of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/\">coronavirus</a>, contrary to established science and public health recommendations. The site suspended his account for 12 hours, prompting his press adviser, Andy Surabian, to claim on Twitter, “Big Tech is the biggest threat to free expression in America today & they’re continuing to engage in open election interference — full stop.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXCXS4C2IMI6VDX5B6IEXXMAK4.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Donald Trump Jr., right, on a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2020, with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). (Evelyn Hockstein for The Washington Post)</small></div><p><b>Don Jr. has become</b> a kingmaker in Trumpworld, using his social media network to elevate certain personalities in and around the administration. One such figure is Charlie Kirk, who became Don Jr.'s body man after meeting him at the 2016 convention. \"If I don't like you, it's not going to work out,\" Kirk recalls Don Jr. telling him. But they hit it off, Kirk suggesting campus events they could do together in Midwestern swing states. Don Jr. went on to boost Kirk's Turning Point USA organization, dedicated to mobilizing conservative students, by speaking at well over 20 of their events — and more crucially, amplifying Kirk and Turning Point on social media.</p><p>“When Don Jr. retweets you, the biggest thing you get is [that] a lot of journalists follow Don, so whatever he retweets has a better chance of getting rewritten in other outlets,” Kirk said. “Whatever retweet pattern you were expecting, you can put an exponent on that when Don retweets you.”</p><p>Kirk also praised his mentor’s savvy when it comes to “the culture fights.” When the president last week rage-tweeted a demand for a boycott of Goodyear after a viral image of an employee training manual appeared to suggest the tire company had banned Make America Great Again hats but not Black Lives Matter insignia, Don Jr. fanned the flames with a more sharply articulated gripe: “You’re only censored if [you’re] a conservative,” he tweeted. “Now even corporate America will let you shill for a Marxist orginazation [sic] but not support the duly elected President of The United States.” (Goodyear maintained that the policy was a ban on all partisan political branding in the workplace.)</p><p>When Richard Grenell’s confirmation as U.S. ambassador to Germany was held up for months, Don Jr. vigorously championed his cause both on social media and through a network of media operatives and allies who helped keep the story alive in conservative outlets. After he was confirmed, Don Jr. promoted Grenell’s work, including his threats against German companies working on a Russian oil pipeline and his behind-the-scenes work to deport a former Nazi prison guard from the United States — all of them helping to generate the kinds of headlines his father loves. Grenell was later made acting director of national intelligence.</p><p>Now with his “MAGA Candidate of the Week,” Don Jr. highlights various congressional hopefuls, tweeting out fundraising links, filming promotional videos and recording robocalls.</p><p>“Don is a bigger asset to the future of the party than his father, regardless of the outcome of the election,” said Sam Nunberg, an early Trump adviser. And that party, as it has evolved over the past four years, isn’t likely to be offended by a few Pepe the Frog memes or ugly conspiracy theories. “The Republican Party in 2020 sure isn’t Mitt Romney’s party,” added a friend of Don Jr.’s, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.).</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ILF2PVXD6MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Donald Trump Jr. warms up the crowd before his father’s arrival at the announcement of his reelection campaign in Orlando in June 2019. (Joe Raedle/Getty)</small></div><p><b>Before he decided</b> to run for Senate, former attorney general Jeff Sessions held discussions about how to create an apparatus to carry on the ideals of the Trump movement — populism, nationalism, anti-immigration, protectionism. Though the talks never amounted to much, they did raise a natural question: What comes after Trump — or rather, who?</p><p>When his parents divorced, Don Jr. was 13 and didn’t speak to his father for a year. After college, he spent a year out West indulging his love of hunting and fishing, which he learned from his mother’s father during the summers he would spend with his grandparents in Czechoslovakia. These are pastimes in which his father has no interest — but which his allies say connect him to Trump’s base of supporters.</p><p>“If Don weren’t a Trump, he’d still be a guy in a MAGA hat, hunting on weekends and chanting ‘Build the Wall’ at rallies,” Sims said. “He’s a true believer, and that authenticity has helped fuel his rise as a political figure in his own right.”</p><p>Don Jr.’s bright future arguably depends on a certain discipline as he continues to juggle business responsibilities, campaigning, social media bomb-throwing, and multiple TV and radio appearances a week; he’s far more visible than Ivanka, whose profile has receded while his has grown.</p><p>Yet his momentum has been fueled by his embrace of a less staid and conservative persona than the world saw in 2016. At the end of 2018, he finalized his divorce from Vanessa, his wife of 13 years and mother of their five children. He’s now got a beard, an unburdened mien and an increasingly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1295530875682082816\">blustery, bleary</a> manner in his cable-news appearances — far from the polite, buttoned-up executive seen on the national stage four years ago, in the days when Hillary Clinton, while grasping for something to praise about her opponent, cited his well-bred children.</p><p>The casual speculation that Don Jr. would someday run for president hasn’t completely subsided. But whatever his goal, he understands that his father had to become a cultural figure before he became a political one. So these days, as he focuses on trying to get his father reelected, he’s giving interviews to the likes of Barstool Sports, and launching his podcast, which shares the title “Triggered” with his first <a href=\"https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07TD411ND&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_PBQqFbAFHFHXE&tag=thewaspos09-20\">book</a>. He avoids politicians for the most part, welcoming guests such as former football pros Herschel Walker and Burgess Owens and Ultimate Fighting Championship’s Tito Ortiz and Colby Covington.</p><p>In June, he made an exception for a filmed Father’s Day edition of the show, “with the most powerful father in the world,” Don Jr. crowed. His father responded with something between a smile and a grimace. The son’s first question, an attempt at jocular banter, was awkward: “Who is your favorite Trump child, and why is it Ivanka?”</p><p>It was his most popular episode ever.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:20:29 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1221f21edfe203f3bbc87200a1d08609","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/b884a7cc-e3e7-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_published_1598272077805_65adf/image/159d86ff-0079-4fb4-911b-e8f330840e48_p.jpeg?ts=1598272077911":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn13@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-13-38-334_041fefbee6b06eb6.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PBHZFRFSI4I6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-13-39-656_b12ce9ffd0f44db9.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXCXS4C2IMI6VDX5B6IEXXMAK4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn97@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-13-38-197_d967d01af20b3f86.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ILF2PVXD6MI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn5@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-13-39-082_2dee04a483db1dd9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417750},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"How a veteran’s idea to solicit donations for a border wall won over Trump supporters — and produced conspiracy charges","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/how-a-veterans-idea-to-solicit-donations-for-a-border-wall-won-over-trump-supporters--and-produced-conspiracy-charges/2020/08/23/5d95c946-e3f0-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/5d95c946-e3f0-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_published_1598230379154_c0ede/image/a9ca3a1a-4530-4139-a6d2-af468b2ac6b8_p.jpeg?ts=1598230379256\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Matt Zapotosky</i><br><i>2020.08.24 08:09</i></div><p>Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran and conservative activist who lost three limbs in Iraq, was angry.

Others involved in We Build the Wall say they were unaware of some of the conduct that investigators claim to have uncovered and would wait to learn more.</p><p>“I can’t imagine that Steve Bannon, whom I know well, is either that careless or that dumb,” said former congressman Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), who served on the advisory board of We Build the Wall. “I saw in the press that Bannon will be pleading not guilty, and I will wait for more information or evidence before making any further comment.”</p><p>Almost from the start, We Build the Wall was dogged by controversy. In early 2019, just after the campaign had launched, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/veteran-trump-wall-brian-kolfage-immigration-facebook\">BuzzFeed News</a> reported on allegations that funds Kolfage raised in a previous campaign for veterans at military hospitals had not actually gone to the medical centers, and that he had pushed to sensationalize right-wing content at a news website he ran.</p><p>In the wall funding effort, Ruegner, an organizer for the tea party movement and a writer, said the group had initially hoped to give the donations they raised to the government but were told the government could not promise the funds would be used for a border barrier.</p><p>GoFundMe suspended Kolfage’s campaign after it had raised more than $20 million, warning Kolfage that he had to identify a legitimate nonprofit to which the funds would be transferred, according to the indictment against him. Bannon and Badolato, a business partner, ultimately created such a nonprofit, and the group changed its direction — deciding donor funds would be used on private construction of a wall, rather than given to the government, according to the indictment.</p><p>But to get GoFundMe to release the donations, they had to agree that Kolfage would “personally not take a penny of compensation,” and that donors would have to reaffirm they wanted their donation to go to We Build the Wall, according to the indictment.</p><p>Ruegner said one of her jobs was to call and email donors, convincing them to re-opt in. She said she was paid for her work but declined to say how much. She has not been accused of any wrongdoing and said she has had no contact with law enforcement. The group ultimately only lost about 10 percent of its contributions, Ruegner said.</p><p>Federal prosecutors alleged that the group persuaded donors to stay on by promising Kolfage would take no compensation. Ruegner, who said she left the organization in October 2019 and did not handle finances, insisted that in the script she read to donors, they promised only that Kolfage would not be paid “until after the first mile is built” and made no representations about others.</p><p>The group had high-profile conservative support. In addition to Kobach, Bannon and Tancredo, it counted among its advisory board members Erik Prince, a conservative activist and defense contractor close to Bannon; former Milwaukee County sheriff David Alexander Clarke Jr.; and former Major League Baseball star Curt Schilling. A member of the group tweeted last summer that she had personally met with Trump and answered specific questions about the project, and Yahoo News reported that acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/acting-homeland-security-chief-chad-wolf-makes-unannounced-visit-to-privately-funded-border-wall-223803492.html\">visited</a> one of the group’s building sites.</p><p>“We all kind of knew each other from conservative stuff that we were doing,” Ruegner said. “How it grew, it was just very organic and very fast.”</p><p>Progress on the wall, though, was another matter. In the early months of 2019, some who said they were donors began complaining on We Build the Wall’s Facebook page and to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/shocker-the-gofundme-campaign-to-build-the-wall-is-a-bust?ref=scroll\">the Daily Beast</a> about the lack of construction. Kobach had told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/politics/kris-kobach-wall-funding.html\">the New York Times</a> in January 2019 — when he declared the effort had Trump’s blessing — that they would hopefully be breaking ground “within weeks,” but as of mid-May, they had not.</p><p>According to the We Build the Wall website, the group completed its first small section near Sunland Park, N.M., in June 2019. The next month, Trump Jr. made a surprise visit to a symposium the group held and praised the organization as “private enterprise at its finest.”</p><p>“Doing it better, faster, cheaper than anything else,” he added, in comments the group highlighted on its website.</p><p>The way prosecutors tell it, though, Kolfage, Bannon, Badolato and Shea — a vocal supporter of Trump online — were privately scheming to pocket hundreds of thousands for themselves and keep the arrangement secret using fake invoices and sham vendor arrangements.</p><p>It is unclear how federal authorities first became interested in the group, but the investigation was underway by October — when the men were tipped to its possible existence from a financial institution, according to the indictment. That investigation, led by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, culminated last week, when authorities took all four into custody.</p><p>Bannon was pulled off a 150-foot yacht called the Lady May owned by a friend and business associate, Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui — a vocal online critic of the Chinese government who was once close with that country’s intelligence service but is now wanted by authorities in Beijing on charges of fraud, blackmail and bribery.</p><p>Trump had already seemed to sour slightly on the group. After <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/he-built-a-privately-funded-border-wall-its-already-at-risk-of-falling-down-if-not-fixed\">ProPublica</a> reported in July that its wall was in danger of falling into the Rio Grande, the president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/trump-rips-private-texas-border-wall-built-by-his-supporters/2020/07/12/015bd542-c44e-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html\">tweeted</a>, “I disagreed with doing this very small (tiny) section of wall, in a tricky area, by a private group which raised money by ads. It was only done to make me look bad, and perhaps it now doesn’t even work.”</p><video src=\"https://d21rhj7n383afu.cloudfront.net/washpost-production/The_Washington_Post/20200820/5f3e9b94c9e77c00011a5ede/5f3e9db94cedfd00071d3815/file_640x360-600-v3.mp4\" width=\"100%\" controls></video><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">President Trump responded Aug. 20 to news of the arrest of his ex-political adviser Steve Bannon, saying he hadn't worked with Bannon for \"years.\" (The Washington Post)</small></div><p>After Bannon’s arrest, Trump reiterated that he did not support the privately constructed wall.</p><p>“I don’t like that project,” Trump said. “I thought it was being done for showboating reasons.”</p><p>Ruegner, who met Trump in 2014 and has a picture with him on her Facebook page, said she was unbothered by the president’s comments.</p><p>“He doesn’t know us personally. He only knows the information that’s being given to him. That information can change depending on who’s giving it,” she said, noting that Donald Trump Jr. had visited the wall.</p><p>Bannon and Kolfage have portrayed themselves as being targeted for their support of Trump. In a series of Facebook posts about his arrest, Kolfage wrote, “The witch hunt is on! I’m not going to be bullied into being a political prisoner for my beliefs. I have fought hard for these freedoms and the SDNY is on [an] all out assault to take down every Trump insider from the 2016 election, that means Bannon.”</p><p>SDNY refers to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case.</p><p>Bannon, emerging from the courthouse after an initial hearing in which he pleaded not guilty, similarly said, “This entire fiasco is to stop people who want to build the wall.”</p><p>Ruegner said she remains proud of the work the group did. She said the government told the group it could cost as much as $25 million to build just one mile of barrier; We Build the Wall, she said, built at least 3½ miles for less than that. She said she did not mind Kolfage, in particular, taking a salary, given how much work he did.</p><p>“This organization 100 percent did what they said they were going to do with the money,” Ruegner said.</p><p>Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, have continued to investigate. Just as authorities moved to arrest Bannon, two others who worked with We Build the Wall — Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence — said <a href=\"https://www.americafirstprojects.com/news/exclusive-dustin-stockton-and-jennifer-lawrence-statement-on-bannon-and-webuildthewall-indictments/\">in a statement</a> that “heavily armed federal law enforcement officers” executed search warrants on their cellphones and served them with subpoenas to appear before a grand jury in New York.</p><p><i>Julie Tate contributed to this report.</i></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 01:20:24 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c34fe48cd02ca9eca3fce0676eb7cd65","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/5d95c946-e3f0-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_published_1598230379154_c0ede/image/a9ca3a1a-4530-4139-a6d2-af468b2ac6b8_p.jpeg?ts=1598230379256":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn45@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-38-251_1dbb6e967a1b7c99.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/5d95c946-e3f0-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_published_1598230379305_d7521/image/09ee3960-98a5-4a95-808d-b4d1ddca8717_p.jpeg?ts=1598230379378":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn49@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-13-38-389_fd802364398f9b9b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417761},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"5 myths about the U.S. Postal Service","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-us-postal-service/2020/08/21/6a113206-e304-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/6a113206-e304-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_published_1598222841066_665bf/image/a874b135-838b-4742-892f-1383018e9afb_p.jpeg?ts=1598222841170\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Richard R.

(CJ Gunther/EPA-EFE)</small></div><p>The Continental Congress made Franklin postmaster general in 1775, but he wasn’t the founder of the Postal Service as we know it today. He had been Philadelphia’s postmaster and America’s co-postmaster general under the British Crown, and in 1775 he inherited an existing organization that retained some of its colonial trappings. A <a href=\"https://njpostalhistory.org/media/pdf/ratechartdoc.pdf\">rate chart</a> that Franklin issued after he took office, for instance, was substantially similar to one he had issued under colonial rule.</p><p>In 1788, the ratified Constitution gave Congress the power “To establish Post Offices and post Roads.” President George Washington sought a postal service that could logistically bind western territories with the Eastern Seaboard. In <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washs02.asp\">1790</a>, he urged Congress’s “establishment of the militia, of a mint, of standards of weights and measures, of the post office and post roads.” James Madison, then a congressman, wanted to ensure the flow of information from citizens to their representatives. The result was a postal organization with an expanded mandate, codified in the <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/object/npm_1984.1127.8\">Post Office Act of 1792</a>. With this law, Congress subsidized the circulation of information on public affairs, which at that time primarily meant delivery of newspapers. It also set protocols for the establishment of new postal routes: Ordinary Americans were empowered to petition lawmakers to extend mail service to their localities, fashioning the post office as we now conceive it.</p><p>Myth No. 2: Today’s financial crisis is an unprecedented disaster</p><p>The USPS lost $3.9 billion in 2018, $8.8 billion <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-post-office-losses-more-than-double-to-88-billion-for-the-year-while-revenue-rises-2019-11-14\">in 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/08/us-postal-service-loses-2point2-billion-in-3-months-as-virus-woes-persist.html#:~:text=U.S.%20Postal%20Service%20loses%20%242.2%20billion%20in%203%20months%20as%20virus%20woes%20persist,-Published%20Fri%2C%20Aug&text=While%20package%20deliveries%20to%20homebound,first%2Dclass%20and%20business%20mail.\">$2.2 billion</a> in a three-month stretch this year.

In April, a Boston Globe editorial carried the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/13/opinion/postal-service-has-never-been-more-valuable-or-more-endangered/\">headline</a>, “The postal service has never been more valuable — or more endangered.”</p><video src=\"https://d21rhj7n383afu.cloudfront.net/washpost-production/The_Washington_Post/20200821/5f3fc80cc9e77c00011da6fa/5f3fd2c8c9e77c000727b939/file_640x360-600-v3.mp4\" width=\"100%\" controls></video><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">The U.S. Postal Service has seen significant delays in mail delivery since the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy took over in June. (Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>But the greatest fiscal crisis that the agency has ever confronted occurred <a href=\"https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8ZW33GB\">in the 1840s</a>, when its revenue plummeted  as a result of head-on competition from private carriers in the high-volume market from Boston to Philadelphia. Hobbled by an antiquated rate structure and a rigid bidding process, postal administrators found it impossible to negotiate advantageous contracts with new railroads and steamships. Aghast at the possibility that sparsely populated regions of the country <a href=\"https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D86M4QDP\">might lose access</a> to low-cost mail delivery, Congress <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/universal-service-and-postal-monopoly-history.pdf\">lowered</a> the basic letter rate. In addition, it no longer pretended that the organization should cover its costs, which it failed to do in <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1970/hist_stats_colonial-1970p2-chR.pdf?\">most years</a> between 1851 and 1970.</p><p>Myth No. 3: The Postal Service is obsolete</p><p>In 2011, the tech site Gizmodo ran a post <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/09/the-post-office-is-dying-because-we-dont-need-it-anymore/\">titled</a> “The Post Office Is Dying Because We Don’t Need It Anymore.” In a 2016 Vice <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgkpzn/why-is-the-post-office-still-a-thing-outdated-technology-mail-letters-usps\">story</a> asking, “Why Is the Post Office Still a Thing?” Rachel Pick started with her impression that “it provides an important service. But demand for those services is ebbing in the digital age, and delivering paper mail almost daily seems like an excessive waste of fuel and paper.” In the Internet era, regular mail has been derisively tagged as “<a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/letters/article/Letters-USPS-should-trade-snail-mail-for-the-web-15240276.php\">snail mail</a>.”</p><p>It’s true that addressing an envelope or buying stamps is foreign to many, particularly younger Americans. But last year, the USPS handled almost <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/pieces-of-mail-since-1789.htm\">143 billion</a> pieces of mail (more than half of which was junk mail) — <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/13/us-postal-service-america-coronavirus\">almost half</a> of all the mail delivered in the world. As Vox reported earlier this year, the Postal Service is a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/16/21219067/us-postal-service-shutting-down-rural-america-native-communities\">lifeline</a>” for communities with little access to broadband Internet, not enough residents to have a polling place or too remote for private delivery services. Although one 2020 study <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200721005356/en/ACI-Speedpay-Pulse-Study-Finds-70-Percent\">found</a> that “1 in 5 consumers has decreased their [bill] payments through the mail or in person,” over the past year 38.3 percent of consumers still “made a payment through the mail.” One reason for the outcry over recent postal delays is that Americans rely on the post office for delivery of <a href=\"https://www.nalc.org/news/nalc-updates/statement-by-nalc-president-fredric-rolando-the-postal-service-is-vital-in-this-crisis\">1.2 billion</a> prescriptions each year, according to the National Association of Letter Carriers.</p><p>Myth No. 4: The post office should run like a business</p><p>In an op-ed for the Hill last year, the R Street Institute’s Kevin Kosar <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/444316-financial-collapse-of-the-united-states-postal-service-is-coming\">wrote</a> that back in 2007, then-Postmaster General John Potter told Congress “that the business model of the agency was already broken.” This month, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-post-offices-problem-isnt-trump-11597360885\">argued</a> that “lawmakers could give the USPS more freedom to act like a business: to raise prices if warranted; to close lonely, desolate post offices; to stop Saturday mail — or Wednesday mail if it comes to that.”</p><p>But the post office isn’t meant to be run as a business. A 1790 law, “An Ordinance For regulating the Post-Office of the United States of America,” <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/rbc/rbpe/rbpe21/rbpe213/21300300/21300300.pdf\">stated</a> that the “communication of intelligence with regularity and dispatch, from one part to another of these United States, is essentially requisite to the safety as well as the commercial interest thereof.” The <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-72/pdf/STATUTE-72-Pg134.pdf\">Postal Policy Act of 1958</a> states: “The postal establishment was created to unite more closely the American people, to promote the general welfare, and to advance the national economy,” and though the post office “should be operated in an efficient manner, it clearly is not a business enterprise conducted for profit or for raising general funds.” As journalist Winifred Gallagher  <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/the-wreck-is-in-the-mail/615172/\">explained</a>, since Republican President Richard Nixon signed the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, the USPS has functioned as a “government-business hybrid.”</p><p>Myth No. 5: FedEx and UPS can replace the Postal Service</p><p>Writing for Forbes in 2013, Doug Bandow <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2013/08/12/the-post-office-is-broke-its-time-to-end-washingtons-postal-monopoly/#3c6b256d6979\">concluded</a> that “the only answer” to the Postal Service’s woes “is to turn mail delivery over to market competition.” In May, Gary MacDougal, who has served as a UPS director, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/phase-out-dont-bail-out-the-post-office-11588719001\">argued</a> that the Postal Service should be phased out and that “the combination of UPS, FedEx, DHL, Amazon and countless local delivery companies would pick up the slack left by the wind-down of the post office.” (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>But 20 years ago, when the USPS and FedEx were negotiating a collaboration, then-Postmaster General William Henderson <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB96828232531860163\">told</a> the Wall Street Journal that “FedEx really has some infrastructure that we need, and we have some infrastructure that they need.” FedEx works in concert with the post office, which is FedEx’s <a href=\"https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/money/industries/logistics/2020/08/10/us-postal-service-changes-fedex-ups/3299744001/\">largest customer</a>.</p><p>If all Americans were reliant on private carriers, some could be deprived of vital delivery services that those carriers deem insufficiently profitable: Unlike Japan or Britain — smaller nations with limited postal privatization — the United States spans several time zones and is, in many places, thinly settled.

He pulls up in his truck to a gated property that’s closer to Arkansas than Dallas. Waist-high bluestem grass sways in the wind across 922 acres that stretch out before him. The air is filled with “dick-dick-see-see-see,” the song that gives the dickcissel prairie bird its name.</p><p>Welcome to Daphne Prairie, mostly flat grassland that has been in the Hicks family since 1839 and is one of the last unplowed prairies in Northeast Texas. Laying at the edge of prairie as it transitions into eastern forests, the land looks today as it did when settlers arrived in Texas — before cotton was king and concrete was poured across the region.</p><p>And Hicks, a 75-year-old lawyer who visits his property weekly in a bucket hat and jeans, is trying to keep it that way, hopeful that untouched grasslands in Texas and across the country can help mitigate climate change.</p><video src=\"https://d21rhj7n383afu.cloudfront.net/washpost-production/Baker_Institute/20200817/5f3ad15ec9e77c00011b415b/5f3ad164cff47e0009898aab/file_640x360-600-v3.mp4\" width=\"100%\" controls></video><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Prairie grasslands in Texas offer a potential for carbon storage and a way to combat climate change. (The Washington Post)</small></div><p>Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by mid-century to avert catastrophic effects from global warming. Carbon dioxide is the most prevalent greenhouse gas; the amount in the atmosphere has been rising as humans burn fossil fuels. Not only must the world stop releasing more carbon, some CO2 already in the air also must be removed, experts say.</p><p>That’s where the prairie comes in.</p><p>As part of photosynthesis, plants pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their stems, leaves and roots. Unlike trees, grasslands store most of their carbon underground, in their roots and the soil.</p><p>And that makes them more reliable “carbon sinks” than forests, according to a 2018 University of California at Davis study. Because carbon is stored in the soil, it is not released back into the atmosphere when grasslands burn, as it is when trees go up in flames.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YP2CW5XBMQI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">The land, outside Mount Vernon, Tex., is a registered native prairie.</small></div><p>A pristine prairie can also be home to hundreds of types of plants. Poets and explorers wrote about the spectacular view above ground, but the real magic is what happens below the surface.</p><p>“It’s a good locker to put the carbon into,” said Jim Blackburn, an environmental lawyer and Rice University professor. “Carbon will stay in the soil for centuries.”</p><p>But there are few pieces of pristine land left like Daphne Prairie, untouched by plow or urban sprawl.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GIFMRXBMQI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Hicks, a lawyer who visits his property weekly, if hopeful that untouched grasslands in Texas and across the country can help mitigate climate change. </small></div><p>Less than 0.1 percent, or about 5,000 acres, remain of the original 12 million acres of Blackland Prairie that once spanned from San Antonio to the Red River north of Dallas, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The trend is the same throughout the tallgrass prairie system that runs from the Texas coast north to Manitoba, making it one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America.</p><p>To create incentives for landowners to preserve natural land, Blackburn and the Baker Institute at Rice are leading a group of organizations as varied as the Nature Conservancy and Valero Energy to brainstorm ways to create a market for storing carbon in the soil of prairies, farms, ranches and grasslands in Texas and around the country.</p><p>Funding is available to landowners for carbon stored in forests, such as California’s cap-and-trade market, and the same should be done for soil, Blackburn said.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYTBNHXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">The Hicks property is official.</small></div><p>The value of pristine grassland in the fight against climate change is not just its ability to store carbon, Blackburn said. Prairie grass helps the land recover from weather that is becoming more destructive as the planet warms, he said.</p><p>Blackburn, the co-director of Rice University’s Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation From Disasters Center, learned this while studying Hurricane Ike, which hit the upper Texas coast in 2008. The Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston and other inhabited areas were “absolutely wiped out” by storm surge that pushed 20 miles inland, Blackburn said. But native prairies and grazing land on the coast recovered quickly.</p><p>“If you are looking for a definition for the word ‘resilience,’ it is these native prairie and marsh systems,” Blackburn said. “They evolved with storms. Storms are built into their DNA. Storms are not hard-wired into human DNA, except to run from them or the results they leave behind.”</p><p>Blackburn wondered how property owners could be persuaded to keep the land in its natural state to help bear the brunt of future storms. “That would be the best long-term insurance policy on the Texas coast,” he said.</p><p>It was hard to identify anyone who would pay landowners to mitigate flood damage, Blackburn said. But carbon storage is another matter, particularly for oil and gas companies looking for ways to offset the carbon dioxide that they emit.</p><p>All native grasslands in the country together could sequester up to 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, Blackburn estimates. The nation’s annual carbon dioxide output was nearly 7 billion metric tons in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>The group led by Blackburn and the Baker Institute is working on a blueprint for a nationwide program to pay for carbon storage in soil. Landowners who enter such a program would agree to a 10-year commitment. If the land is sold, the commitment restarts.</p><p>The amount of carbon retained in soil can be measured in a variety of ways.</p><p>The earliest method was to put a soil sample in an oven at 500 degrees. At that temperature, organic matter is burned off and carbon can be calculated using the weight of what is left.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHISJAXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Steve Bolgiano owns 50 acres in Farmersville, Tex. </small></div><p>Another rudimentary way of measuring is to bring a book of color palettes into the field and match the shade of the soil to estimate the amount of carbon.</p><p>Land that has been not been tilled or overgrazed has the potential to sequester the most carbon, said Hal Collins, a microbiologist with the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. One acre of pristine prairie can store about 5 tons of carbon, he said.</p><p>Soil scientists like Collins bring samples into a lab and use an instrument designed to measure organic matter. “It basically does the same thing as the oven, but in a more controlled environment,” he said.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCFHXXHBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Bolgiano in Farmersville.</small></div><p>Carbon sequestration is also good for soil health, building up organic matter that has been depleted over the past 200 years because of plowing and the heavy use of fertilizer.</p><p>A piece of land can recover, and store more carbon relatively quickly, with changes in cultivation, Collins said.</p><p>Precision may be the key. With strip tillage, which means plowing only where a seed is placed, about 50 percent of the land is left undisturbed, Collins said. Targeting fertilizer to where it’s needed, as opposed to spraying it across a field, can also increase the amount of carbon in the soil.</p><p>A payment system for carbon storage would be welcomed even by landowners who recognize the value of undisturbed soil. Keeping land wild costs money, whether it’s through actual upkeep or because of an opportunity lost.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEOIIKXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Bolgiano in Farmersville. </small></div><p>Hicks said he has spent $220,000 on gravel for three miles of roads around Daphne Prairie so he can get around easily to check for invasive species. The property has a maze of fencing with 16 gates to corral cattle that get loose from neighboring lands. He spent a few thousand on a barn and $2,500 for a thermal imaging scope for nighttime hunting of feral pigs, which tend to either eat or destroy Silveus Dropseed grass. It’s all to protect the rare plants on the prairie.</p><p>“It costs a lot of money. But I haven’t had kids. I haven’t had kids in college,” said Hicks, whose family struck oil in Daphne Prairie in 1936. “This particular thing caught my attention. For the sake of nature, I feel real good about it.”</p><p>His godson first told Hicks about the land’s potential for mitigating global warming. He decided shortly after to keep his land in a natural state for perpetuity and gave a conservation easement to the Native Prairie Association of Texas with plans to bequeath the land to the group.</p><p>“I hope my life can be judged on the merits of my personal decisions — on the prairie and in my lifestyle — in advancing practices to limit the forces threatening our planet,” Hicks said.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSL2HAXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">New development surrounds Bolgiano's property. </small></div><p>Other landowners are less committed.</p><p>Every year, 2 million acres of farmland are lost to development in the United States, according to the Texas Farm Bureau.</p><p>In February, an 80-acre prairie southeast of Dallas was cleared to make way for an industrial park despite some community pushback.</p><p>Less than 40 miles north of that parcel, Steve Bolgiano has a deed to 50 acres of pristine prairie in Farmersville.</p><p>He bought it in 1999 and it has remained vacant since. Before 9/11, he drew up plans to build a subdivision on it. Then he thought about creating an eco-resort. These days, he is leaning toward having a wedding venue on the property. Something to keep the original landscape intact, but also capitalize on it. There’s money in that view, he said.</p><p>“I mow yards for a living,” Bolgiano said. “I’m not Ross Perot. I can’t give it away for conservancy. I can’t afford it.”</p><p>That’s why Blackburn is trying to get the ball rolling on a nationwide program.</p><p>“The first priority is we’ve got to get a market,” he said. “Landowners need to see that there’s money to be made off of carbon in the soil.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:20:29 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"75151451cdc908c807d12cd5ee659719","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/75151451cdc908c807d12cd5ee659719_published_1598272855857_9e598/image/3cbdb248-83d6-4c92-9b57-f74c1c5bff3f_p.jpeg?ts=1598272856120":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-13-38-946_8976185a0769c8a1.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YP2CW5XBMQI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-13-43-086_1d98219890e4f4a4.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GIFMRXBMQI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-13-45-162_52b25ec8681fb145.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYTBNHXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-13-40-889_0736e9e775ac3b62.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHISJAXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn74@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-13-39-790_49fa9b70eb85398d.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCFHXXHBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-13-42-317_d487741eb8d50743.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEOIIKXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-13-41-040_a7cf683f80bbea30.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSL2HAXBMUI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-13-41-347_3d8f57373e8a3772.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417761},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"Video shows Wisconsin police shooting a Black man multiple times as he enters a car","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/23/kenosha-police-shooting-video-wisconsin/","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/7ec4490b6b36e2ef8c1f9f6f2ed7f744_published_1598267473784_d406d/image/39e29455-851a-4ba2-af0e-d9fe0075731d_p.jpeg?ts=1598267473865\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Kenosha, Wis., police are investigating after officers shot a Black man multiple times as he got into a car, in an incident caught on cellphone video.

Lawyer that I am, I laid out my arguments: I am a single mother. We live in a 1,200-square-foot San Francisco condo. I travel constantly for work. Too much responsibility, too many chores, not enough time.</p><p>My children kept begging. Finally, exasperated, I told them, “Look, guys, I am more likely to serve you a dog for dinner than to get you a dog for a pet.” They turned several shades paler and never brought it up again.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YFGETHG5NII6VNHREW3WFTN36Q.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">The author’s dog, Kittle, who is half bichon-frise, half poodle. (Courtesy of Lara Bazelon)</small></div><p>Here is the truth: I hate dogs. I know, it is awful to say. Especially since I grew up in a house with dogs and reaped the benefit of their unconditional affection. But as an adult, I turned a sharp and unforgiving corner. The barking, the shedding, the leg-humping. The way their owners talked about them like precious offspring. The last straw snapped when I was living in Los Angeles. One day, when I was running in the park, a dog, illegally off-leash, chased after me and bit me in the upper thigh, his teeth sinking through my flesh and drawing blood.</p><p>Then the pandemic came, bringing drastic changes to the world and to my thinking about giving my children a pet. They had no playdates. I had no travel. Weeks turned to months. Online school ended. Other than their father, my ex-husband, we saw no one except masked strangers on the street, all of us careful to turn our faces away.</p><p>As we grew increasingly isolated, we also became less willing to leave the house, content with what our screens gave us: virtual games, virtual friendships, virtual work. We drifted away from one another and from the idea that it was important to interact in three dimensions. We were alienated from the world.</p><p>In May, I accepted that there would be no camp. It also seemed unlikely that we could go on vacation to the East Coast to see my family. Finally, sitting with my children at the dinner table, I broke. The pandemic was here to stay, for months if not years. Our family needed a lifeline.</p><p>“I am thinking we should get a dog.”</p><p>My 11-year-old son stared at me, then at the jam jar I use as a wine glass. “Are you drunk?” he asked.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>My 9-year-old daughter looked worried. “Are we going to have to eat it?”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>It turned out that many, many other people — equally isolated and unhappy — had the same idea. We checked the shelters in our area. Some were shuttered. Some were open by appointment only. Most of the dogs had been scooped up. I widened my search, emailing breeders in different parts of the state. A six-to-12-month wait, they told me.</p><p>A friend suggested a breeder in North Carolina. We went on the website and saw a tiny white puppy with brown ears, a bichon poodle.</p><p>“That’s our dog,” my daughter said.</p><p>“We’ll name him Kittle,” my son said. “The tight end for the 49ers.”</p><p>I looked at Kittle’s price tag and gasped. And that was excluding the plane ticket for the nanny who would fly him across the country.</p><p>Then I remembered the money I was saving by not sending my children to camp. This dog was a bargain.</p><p>Once the deal was sealed, my children began acting like expectant parents. They shopped online, picking out Kittle’s crate, blankets, chew toys, dog bowls, treats and football swag — collar, leash and doggy sweatshirt. I dutifully paid and smiled when they happily opened the shipping boxes, as if it were Christmas. But I didn’t feel happy. I felt dread.</p><p>Kittle arrived on June 4. We drove to meet him at the airport. My children were wild with excitement. I was not. Kittle was no longer a two-dimensional image on the Internet. I was going to have to deal with him as an actual living being. A member of our family. And I hated dogs. <i>What have I done? </i>I kept asking myself silently as we sped down the empty freeway.</p><p>In the waiting area, we watched as the passengers dribbled out — masked, grim, eyes trained on the nearest exit. Then came Kittle, with his very nice nanny, an unemployed flight attendant. I showed her my ID, and she put him in my arms.</p><p>Kittle was a tiny shivering ball of fur, too terrified to make a sound. When I held him, I felt something crack inside my hard, mean, dog-hating heart.</p><p>The first night, Kittle cried and cried, just like my children had when I brought them home from the hospital. I got out of bed and held him, just like I had held them, rocking and cooing. It was dark and I was tired, but I didn’t mind.<i> I love you</i>, I told him. And suddenly I realized that I meant it.</p><p>Kittle has transformed our lives. The world, flattened and drained of joy, has come alive again as he experiences it. He is curious about the shrubbery and smells and people he sees out on the street. Walking with Kittle is like parading around with a celebrity. We get stopped constantly. We talk to people again — real conversations — like in the Before Times. Little kids, teenagers, couples and senior citizens ask if they can pet him. We say yes. Kittle rolls onto his belly, paws up. Every day, at least one person — often a clerk at the grocery store or a security guard stationed outside — tells us, “Thank you, this made my day.”</p><p>Kittle gives meaning and purpose to what would otherwise be shapeless and dreary hours. He needs to be fed, bathed, housebroken. He needs at least two walks a day. On our own, we would never take two walks. Now we do it for Kittle.</p><p>Those walks have become the highlight of my day. The four of us sit atop Tank Hill, gazing out at the views of San Francisco. We take off our masks. My kids eat chocolate chip cookies. I feed Kittle bits of hot dog. Yes, we spoil him. I’ve turned into exactly the kind of dog owner I once scorned.</p><p>Kittle is in many ways just like any other dog — that is, in all the ways I hate. He barks and nips and humps my leg. He chews the furniture and shreds my legal pleadings. He leaves his toys lying around the house. Sometimes he pees on the rug.</p><p>What he gives back, though. Oh, what he gives back! In this time of fear and panic and misery, his love — its purity and hopefulness and nourishment — is priceless.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:20:24 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"364c0ae3de0d4af184d138874c576b81","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0045605e-d094-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_published_1598214731682_1762a/image/60d329f2-8843-4f20-b7e3-4a6337f94b1f_p.jpeg?ts=1598214731768":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-13-40-378_bf48e951a629d66a.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YFGETHG5NII6VNHREW3WFTN36Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-13-38-340_6ac4e6fd951d0789.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314417749},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:13:37","title":"TikTok filing lawsuit against Trump administration to fight impending ban","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/24/tiktok-lawsuit-trump/","description":"<img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3YZ52NHF4YI6VP2EBUY4QWBYUU.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">(Hollie Adams/Bloomberg)</small></div><div><i>By Rachel Lerman</i><br><i>2020.08.24 23:00</i></div><p>TikTok is taking its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/17/tiktok-ban-us-faq/\">fight against the Trump Administration</a> to the courts, saying it will file a legal challenge Monday against the government’s order to ban the video app effective mid-September.</p><p>TikTok alleges Trump’s executive order is “not rooted in bona fide national security concerns,” according to excerpts of the complaint the company detailed in a blog post. It also alleges the U.S. government did not conduct a fair process in deciding that the app needed to be banned in the country and that its Chinese owner ByteDance must divest its assets in the U.S.</p><p>It said it plans to file the suit later Monday in federal court in the Central District of California.</p><p>President Trump cited national security concerns as he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/06/trump-tiktok-executive-order/\">issued an executive order</a> on Aug. 6 banning the app in the U.S. after 45 days. It would be the first time a major consumer app is banned in the country using international emergency economic powers.</p><p>The order put pressure on deal talks already in progress for ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations of TikTok to Microsoft, Twitter or another American company. Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/02/microsoft-says-it-intends-continue-discussions-with-tiktok-acquisition-after-conversation-with-trump/\">considered the leading suitor</a> for the short-form video app, has said it will complete its deal talks with TikTok by Sept. 15.</p><p>TikTok has been engaged in a wide-reaching public relations campaign all year to convince U.S. customers and regulators that it is not a threat. It has continually insisted that it does not share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, and even hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO here.</p><p>But Trump and other lawmakers have raised concerns that TikTok could pose a national security threat because of the control China exerts over companies based there, raising fears that the company could one day be compelled to hand over customer information.</p><p>In its lawsuit, TikTok says it stores American user info in the U.S. and Singapore, and points to the “extraordinary measures” it says it has taken to protect user privacy.</p><p>“By banning TikTok with no notice or opportunity to be heard (whether before or after the fact), the executive order violates the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment,” TikTok’s order reads, according to excerpts in the blog post.</p><p>TikTok can sue to challenge the underlying process of the executive order, but not the merits of the decision itself, said Robert Chesney, an associate dean at the University of Texas School of Law.</p><p>“This is why TikTok is in a tough spot, unless the game is just delay,” Chesney said of a potential lawsuit.</p><p>Trump issued a second order on Aug. 14, ordering ByteDance to divest its 2017 acquisition of an app called Musical.ly, which later merged with TikTok. In its lawsuit, TikTok alleges the government process that led to that order was completed five minutes before its deadline on July 30 after a months-long review.</p><p>The decision was “principally based on outdated news articles, failed to address the voluminous documentation that Plaintiffs had provided demonstrating the security of TikTok user data, and was flawed in numerous other respects,\" TikTok wrote in its lawsuit, according to the blog.</p><p>TikTok says it has more than 100 million users in the U.S., and is especially popular with teens and young adults.

(Travis Dove/AFP/Getty Images)</small></div><p>CHARLOTTE — The renomination of Trump will take place today in humbler conditions than the Republican National Committee had planned. Representatives of 57 states and territories will gather in a room of the Charlotte Convention Center, in chairs positioned six feet apart. They will stand and deliver their delegates to the Trump-Pence ticket. By lunchtime, the business of the 2020 convention will be over.</p><p>“Just logistically, this thing is going to be remarkable,” said Ron Kaufman, a Massachusetts RNC member who led the search for a convention site. “We spent a couple years planning a convention in Charlotte, then for two months it was going to be in Jacksonville, and now we’re here. It’s going to be different, but the work between the RNC and the campaign is the best I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>To enter the convention center, delegates and party officials had to abide by North Carolina’s strict covid-19 guidelines, including a deep nasal swab and a daily temperature check. Face coverings were strongly encouraged, but before the program began, mask usage among state party leaders and delegates was mixed. Stickers and signs in the convention center, which portrayed an elephant and a stick figure standing six feet apart, were obeyed outside; in the hall, some delegates held conversations standing closer together.</p><p>It was a departure from the way Democrats handled their own “virtual convention,” with delegates from around the country discouraged from going to the party’s hub in Milwaukee. The DNC asked delegations to record videos from their states, reporting the number of votes for Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Here, each delegation was allowed a maximum of six attendees and will select a representative to announce how many votes the president received from their states. A camera stood at the back of the room for delegates to practice their remarks, some of them mixing promotions for their states with criticism of the Democratic Party and its ticket. Some pulled down their face masks as they practiced, and some left them on.</p><p>There’s no suspense about the outcome. The president won all but one of the delegates available in this year’s primaries, caucuses and state conventions — one went to former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who ended his campaign on March 18.</p><p><i>By: David Weigel</i></p><p><b>08:35 AM: DNC welcomes Republican convention with ad accusing Trump of ‘deadly mismanagement’ of the coronavirus</b></p><p>The Democratic National Committee welcomed the arrival of the Republican National Convention with a new television ad accusing Trump of “job-destroying incompetence and deadly mismanagement” of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“Welcome to the RNC, Republican National Chaos,” the narrator says in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DNCWarRoom/status/1297867012430016512\">the 30-second spot</a>, which opens with a scene of downtown Charlotte. “Because Trump is meeting the covid moment with job-destroying incompetence and deadly mismanagement, students and teachers are left to themselves, the jobless left without a lifeline, grandparents left to die alone, an economy left to perish.”</p><p>“Because Trump has no plan for covid, nothing will change, because Trump won’t change,” the narrator continues. “Enjoy the convention.”</p><p>The ad is part of larger efforts to counter the messaging of Republicans this week as the party gets its turn to spotlight Trump and his second-term agenda.</p><p><i>By: John Wagner</i></p><p><b>08:31 AM: Mike Pence hopes four years of subservience to Trump paves his path to the presidency</b></p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VRPU4QXDWEI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Vice President Pence listens during President Trump's meeting with Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi in the Oval Office at the White House last week.

Mike Pence made a pilgrimage to Selma, Ala., in 2010 to commemorate the 45th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday.” He marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge just a few feet from Lewis as they retraced the historic route, and posed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/govpencein/status/557246506861084672\">for a photo</a> at the foot of the span — the Indiana Republican in crisp gray and the Georgia Democrat in somber black, their shoulders touching.</p><p>But when Lewis died last month of pancreatic cancer at 80, Pence, now vice president, held off on issuing a public comment on the civil rights hero’s passing. Trump was no fan of the late congressman and openly complained about Lewis’s refusal to attend his inauguration. Only after the White House distributed a perfunctory proclamation on the death in Trump’s name did Pence feel comfortable releasing a statement of his own, memorializing Lewis as not just an “icon” but also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1284528816199802880\">“a colleague and a friend.”</a></p><p>That hesitation — deferring to Trump for cues, and then following his lead — was classic Pence.

But it mentioned valuations of three Trump properties: a Los Angeles golf course, an office building at 40 Wall St. and a country estate called “Seven Springs” in Westchester County, N.Y.</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/trump-statements-of-financial-condition/\">The Washington Post reported </a>that Trump had inflated the potential sale value of the Seven Springs property in a “Statement of Financial Condition” — a type of document he sent to potential lenders to demonstrate his wealth.</p><p>In 2011, Trump’s statement claimed that the property had been “zoned for nine luxurious homes,” and that the value of those home lots raised the value of the overall property to $261 million — far more than the $20 million assessed by local authorities. Local officials said Trump had received preliminary conceptual approval for those homes, but never completed the process or obtained final zoning permission. The homes were never built.</p><p>The court filing also mentions a question about a loan on Trump’s Chicago hotel, which one of Trump’s lenders forgave in 2010. The filing does not say why that forgiven loan is of interest to investigators.</p><p>The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on Monday morning. Trump still owns his businesses, though he says he has given day-to-day control over to his sons.</p><p>This is not Trump’s first fight with the New York attorney general. A previous attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, sued Trump for defrauding students at his “Trump University,” in a case that led Trump’s school to pay $25 million to settle in 2016.</p><p>Later, the attorney general’s office sued Trump for misusing donations in his nonprofit, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, to buy art for his clubs, pay off legal obligations for his businesses and to help his own political campaign. That suit ended in November, with a state judge <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-ordered-to-pay-2-million-to-charities-over-misuse-of-foundation-court-documents-say/2019/11/07/b8f804e2-018e-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html\">ordering Trump to pay $2 million in damages</a>.</p><p>Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance (D) <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-tax-returns-manhattan-district-attorney/2020/08/20/acc52122-e2ee-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_story.html\">is also leading an investigation </a>into the Trump Organization.</p><p>Vance has subpoenaed the Trump Organization’s longtime accountants, Mazars USA, for eight years of the president’s tax returns and other tax preparation documents. Trump sought to block that subpoena, on the grounds that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-renews-claim-that-he-is-immune-from-criminal-investigation-in-effort-to-block-manhattan-da-probe/2019/10/11/e7d0df28-ec5d-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html\">he was immune to criminal investigation as president</a>. He lost at the Supreme Court, and now his lawyers are fighting an effort to block the subpoena on other grounds.</p><p>The scope of Vance’s investigation remains unclear. It began with an inquiry into payoffs made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels — who said she had an affair with Trump — before the 2016 election. But in recent court filings, Vance has suggested that he may be looking into financial practices at the Trump Organization as well.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020
