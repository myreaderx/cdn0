Unfortunately, the pandemic changed everything, and the Marvel Studios film has taken the date originally planned for <em>Eternals</em> on November 6.¬†</p>\n\n<p>The film&#39;s marketing campaign slowly seems to be gaining traction, however, with a feature in the new issue of Empire Magazine. Some stills from the mag¬†have now been shared online with the spotlight on Florence Pugh&#39;s Yelena Belova, a character it&#39;s widely believed will end up becoming the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s new Black Widow in the aftermath of this highly anticipated spinoff film.¬†</p>\n\n<p>We still don&#39;t know¬†where she was during the events of<em> Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, but that could be explained if Yelena is captured by General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross and forced to be his Black Widow in the MCU&#39;s iteration of the Thunderbolts.¬†</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s pure speculation at the moment, but it does feel like a natural progression to take the character in as making Belova a one-and-done would be a tremendous waste on Marvel&#39;s part.</p>\n\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/black_widow/\">HERE</a> for more <em>Black Widow</em> news from CBM!<br />\n¬†</p>\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"pt\">S√ÉO AS PATROAS!!

In the original trilogy, Smith was essentially the lead villain and a great foe for Neo to face (their fight scenes were nothing short of extraordinary).¬†</p>\n\n<p>Now, Weaving has explained that it was director¬†Lana Wachowski who made the decision to \"pull the plug\" on his return as Agent Smith, explaining that he was even part of table read.¬†</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Lana Wachowski had rung me at the beginning of last year,\"</strong> the actor told <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/1147360-exclusive-hugo-weaving-talks-about-his-involvement-with-the-matrix-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coming Soon</a> in a recent interview. <strong>\"Lana was very keen for me to be involved in The Matrix.

However, Laurence Fishburne&#39;s absence has upset a lot of fans, while¬†Wachowski&#39;s track record is very hit-and-miss meaning <em>The Matrix 4</em> might not be that great regardless of who does or doesn&#39;t return.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll have to wait and see.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 08:30:00 +0000","feedId":13958,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e5a96f01a539ffffb1f8ea8c94b267b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296444664},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:00:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:00:44","title":"RUMOR MILL: BAD BOYS FOR LIFE Directors Reportedly Eyed To Helm MS.

The news was understandably met with some criticism, especially as there were questions about exactly how safe that would be for other cast and crew members.</p>\n\n<p>Well, despite sharing that initial story about work on the movie taking place minus its leading man, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/global/the-batman-resumes-filming-without-robert-pattinson-1234759647/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Variety</a> now reveals that production is, in fact, still on pause.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Studio insiders have denied that shooting is taking place with Pattinson, but note that <strong>\"Crew members are still doing construction work on sets and props at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, UK.\" </strong>Anyone who came into contact with the Bruce Wayne actor is quarantining, however, and it&#39;s said to be <strong>\"unlikely\"</strong> that anything is shot until that two-week quarantine period ends.¬†</p>\n\n<p>The trade explains that, <strong>\"It is also unclear if Pattinson has symptoms of the disease or if he is asymptomatic. Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, did not confirm that the star had tested positive and would only say that a member of the production had coronavirus.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite cases being on the rise, it&#39;s still believed that shooting in the UK is safe.

Obviously, Wonder Woman 1984 is up next. For now, it is where it is. Like I said earlier, certain movies deserve to be on the big screen. My belief is Wonder Woman is one of those.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>In other words, <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> won&#39;t be following in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/disney/\"><strong><em>Mulan</em></strong></a> by heading to a streaming service, and, for now, Warner Bros. clearly remains committed to the theatrical experience.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to this question, Sarnoff was asked whether a PVOD release for <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/sci-fi/\"><strong><em>Tenet</em></strong></a> was ever considered, and it seems that was always off the table. <strong>\"No. It is a remarkable, cinematic, beautiful film. It is so impactful. It is a movie meant for the big screen. I‚Äôm very proud of our approach. A lot of people are pushing stuff into next year.

Much of that stems from Christopher Nolan&#39;s alleged insistence that it receive a theatrical release in the midst of a pandemic, and while there are safety measures in place, some experts maintain¬†that it&#39;s simply not safe to sit in a crowded cinema.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>Tenet </em>was dealt another blow earlier this year when <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/batman/the_dark_knight_rises/\"><strong><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></strong></a> star Anne Hathaway said Nolan, <strong>\"doesn‚Äôt allow chairs, and his reasoning is, if you have chairs, people will sit, and if they‚Äôre sitting, they‚Äôre not working.\"</strong> This created something of an uproar, and the filmmaker&#39;s spokesperson was quick to issue a denial.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Well, in an officially released <em>Tenet</em> book, it&#39;s confirmed by star John David Washington that Nolan does indeed ban chairs from¬†his sets.<strong> \"Nolan&#39;s no-frills set was deliberately devoid of chairs,\"</strong> it reads. <strong>\"Watching the relentless energy of the crew, Washington was determined to lead the front.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\"&#39;I&#39;m like, &#39;I can&#39;t be tired. I can&#39;t sit down if these guys aren&#39;t&#39; But then, after the sixth day, I broke down.

None of them are bad enough to give the movie a miss (even for $29.99), but if there is going to be a sequel, they should be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying that spoilers follow from this point, but even if you haven&#39;t watched <em>Mulan</em> yet, there&#39;s information here which could help you decide whether it&#39;s worth paying for.¬†</p>\n\n<p>So, to take a look through this feature, all you guys need to do is click the \"Next\" button below!<br />\n¬†</p>\n\n<h2>Did Work: The Action Scenes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan1\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/z7Gv1Y9/Mulan1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>With a movie like this, if the action scenes hadn&#39;t worked, then the whole thing might have fallen apart. Luckily, those definitely live up to expectations, and while the final confrontation between Mulan and Bori Khan might have benefited from being a little longer (and deadlier) to help up the stakes.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the action does work nicely, and while it&#39;s obviously PG - there&#39;s no <em>Game of Thrones</em>-level violence here - the choreography is well-handled, and what plays out on screen is exciting.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s particularly the case when <em>Mulan</em> herself leaps into the fray, and star¬†Liu Yifei effortlessly brings this warrior to life in a convincing, enthralling manner. Honestly, she&#39;s perfectly cast here.¬†<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage2\">\n<h2>Didn&#39;t Work:¬†Bori Khan</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan2\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/XFtb7SS/Mulan2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Simply put, <em>Mulan</em>&#39;s villain is a major disappointment.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Jason Scott Lee looks suitably menacing as Bori Khan, but his mission is simplistic (he wants to take over China), poorly explained (he wants to take over...because he&#39;s evil?), and mostly underwhelming. We never really get to spend much time with him, and he&#39;s never fleshed out beyond just being a nasty piece of work with a thirst for power.¬†</p>\n\n<p>For some, that will be enough, but¬†like Marvel&#39;s movies once had a villain problem, it seems the same is now the case with these live-action¬†remakes. <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>&#39;s Gaston was great, but Jafar didn&#39;t make an impact in <em>Aladdin</em>, and that <em>Maleficent</em> sequel&#39;s baddies...well, who were they again?<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage3\">\n<h2>Did Work: A Strong Message</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan4\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DDvBBh4/Mulan4.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>When we meet Mulan, her family want her to be married off to someone, and her father is so proud that he&#39;s willing to go to war and die just to protect their legacy. It&#39;s at this point this young woman realises that she¬†must fight for her family&#39;s honour...by pretending to be someone she&#39;s not.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, Mulan comes to understand that she has to be herself, saves her fellow soldiers, and returns to them as her true self. Initially rejected, she later returns to them - even if means dying - so that she can save China and stop them from walking into a trap. Overall, it&#39;s pretty powerful stuff!</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a strong message here for little girls that they should never hide who they are and be proud of their achievements. Everyone can take something from that, and it works really well.<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage4\">\n<h2>Did Work:¬†Xian Lang</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan3\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3pNBzJn/Mulan3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Another of <em>Mulan</em>&#39;s villains, Xian Lang is a¬†powerful witch with shapeshifting abilities and an ally of Bori Khan. However, he has no respect for her, and we quickly learn that she&#39;s only aligned herself with that baddie because it appears there are no other options for someone like her.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it&#39;s meeting Mulan that helps her realise that there are other paths, and her last-minute sacrifice comes as a major surprise and a moment that feels earned rather than forced.¬†</p>\n\n<p>The only minor issue here is that it seems Xian Lang is only here to further Mulan&#39;s story, and it&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t actually get to see a little more of this enigmatic character in action.¬†<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage5\">\n<h2>Didn&#39;t Work: It&#39;s All A Bit Rushed</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan5\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/K93wkcq/Mulan5.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Mulan</em> is two hours long, but it flies by, and actually feels surprisingly brief. There&#39;s admittedly a lot of story to pack into this adventure, but perhaps a little too much time is wasted on her family life and what appears to be Mulan&#39;s¬†budding romance with her fellow soldier¬†Chen Honghui.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s hard to criticise those elements too much because they actually work really well, but Mulan&#39;s transformation from¬†a young woman masquerading as a soldier to a warrior who saves her entire country all happens very fast. Suddenly, we&#39;re rushed into the final battle, and that comes far too soon after she&#39;s first revealed herself (this part of the film just feels too \"compact\").</p>\n\n<p>This really isn&#39;t the end of the world, but it feels like the script needed one final, small polish.¬†<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage6\">\n<h2>Did Work: Mulan&#39;s New Love Interest</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan6\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/xDv07Kq/Mulan6.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Liu Yifei is great as Mulan, but if there&#39;s one real breakout performance here, it&#39;s¬†Yoson An as Chen Honghui. The titlular character&#39;s love interest, their romance is only ever really hinted at, but it&#39;s handled in a way that will make you want to see them reunited somewhere down the line.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Both as an ally of¬†Hua Jun (Mulan&#39;s persona when she&#39;s posing as a male soldier) and later Mulan, An¬†adds a lot to the movie, and ultimately proves to be a great co-star for Yifei to bounce off.¬†</p>\n\n<p>If there&#39;s one thing these live-action Disney remakes do well, it&#39;s the romance, and that&#39;s the case for <em>Mulan</em> as well. It&#39;s to the movie&#39;s credit that it doesn&#39;t become too much of a distraction.¬†<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage7\">\n<h2>Did Work: \"Chi\"</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan7\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/sjd62GG/Mulan7.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Fans of the animated movie will either love or hate this, but Mulan&#39;s still with a blade is largely explained by \"Chi.\"¬†In traditional Chinese culture, that&#39;s believed to be a vital force forming part of any living entity, and it&#39;s when Mulan taps into this that she becomes a truly gifted warrior.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there&#39;s definitely an element of natural skill here too, and she stands out as the best soldier in her regiment even suppressing that side of her. It&#39;s a unique approach, and one that makes Mulan a superhero of sorts and explains some of the movie&#39;s more fantastical elements.</p>\n\n<p>With any luck, this is something that a sequel will delve into in even greater detail.¬†<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage8\">\n<h2>Didn&#39;t Work: It Doesn&#39;t Quite Feel Epic Enough</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan8\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KsdcxCH/Mulan8.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Visually, <em>Mulan</em> is a beautiful movie, and as we&#39;ve already pointed out, it&#39;s definitely hard to fault the action. The only real problem, though, is that events on screen occasionally don&#39;t feel epic enough, with the battles perhaps not as grand as we&#39;ve become used to seeing on screen.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps <em>Game of Thrones</em> has just spoiled us, but what we witness here isn&#39;t overly grand, and relatively small scale. That could have easily been changed and enhanced with some VFX.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it&#39;s possible that&#39;s not what director Niki Caro wanted, and if so, that&#39;s definitely admirable. However, there&#39;s definitely room for improvement, and it&#39;s a shame that the battles are the only time Mulan feels a little low budget (when it&#39;s quite clearly meant to be a massive blockbuster movie).<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage9\">\n<h2>Did Work: An Awesome Cameo</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan10\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gvzjxMT/Mulan10.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll keep this one brief, but keep your eyes peeled during the final few minutes of the movie, and you&#39;ll notice that <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. </em>and <em>The Mandalorian</em> star¬†Ming-Na Wen makes a cameo appearance.¬†The actress is credited as an \"Esteemed Guest\" and introduces Mulan to the Emperor.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like she&#39;s passing the baton to¬†Liu Yifei, and it&#39;s a sweet and touching moment for fans.¬†<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ListPage10\">\n<h2>Didn&#39;t Work: The Missing Songs</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Mulan9\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/pRBbH8Q/Mulan9.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>While <em>Mulan</em>&#39;s score does pay homage to some of the classic tracks from the animated movie (in admittedly clever ways), there&#39;s no denying that the absence of the songs themselves really stings.¬†</p>\n\n<p>In some respects, everyone breaking into song might not have worked with the tone <em>Mulan</em> is going for, but the likes of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> and <em>Aladdin</em> certainly didn&#39;t suffer from including them. Of course, it&#39;s just not these songs that are M.I.A.; Mushu is absolutely nowhere to be seen!¬†</p>\n\n<p>The phoenix is a pretty lousy replacement, and a rebooted version of Mushu could have worked and feels like a missed opportunity. The movie is already pretty fantastical, but would have benefited from leaning a little more into that, paying homage to the animated classic at the same time.<br />\n¬†</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/js/ListCode.js\"></script>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":13958,"bgimg":"https://i.ibb.co/z7Gv1Y9/Mulan1.jpg","linkMd5":"6babdf9326aeb88967f096c9b577f552","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-00-44-929_423320da0365388b.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":63746,"destBytes":25096,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.ibb.co/z7Gv1Y9/Mulan1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-00-44-929_423320da0365388b.webp","https://i.ibb.co/XFtb7SS/Mulan2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-00-46-198_57a69da60bcaf77c.webp","https://i.ibb.co/DDvBBh4/Mulan4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn85@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-00-46-364_eb76124f3ec9b448.webp","https://i.ibb.co/3pNBzJn/Mulan3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-00-46-334_c6c95f5a75923b12.webp","https://i.ibb.co/K93wkcq/Mulan5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn83@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-00-46-288_e0fa6a5959700de2.webp","https://i.ibb.co/xDv07Kq/Mulan6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-00-46-177_41c1053fb2ca5917.webp","https://i.ibb.co/sjd62GG/Mulan7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn96@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-01-19-144_8a85232f5f3870af.webp","https://i.ibb.co/KsdcxCH/Mulan8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-00-46-576_159524da82c609c4.webp","https://i.ibb.co/gvzjxMT/Mulan10.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-00-46-350_413ad858c27beb99.webp","https://i.ibb.co/pRBbH8Q/Mulan9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-00-46-189_bfbdd86b25cce1e6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296444665},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:00:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:00:44","title":"NO TIME TO DIE International Trailers Contain New Footage; Confirm A Major SPOILER","link":"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/action/james_bond/no-time-to-die-international-trailers-contain-new-footage-confirm-a-major-spoiler-a178118","description":"<p>A <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/action/james_bond/no-time-to-die-daniel-craigs-007-embarks-on-his-final-mission-in-action-packed-new-trailer-a178079#gs.eoyah9\"><strong>new trailer</strong></a> for Cary Joji Fukunaga&#39;s<em><strong> No Time To Die</strong></em> was released yesterday, and several international versions have now found their way online, confirming a widely reported <font color=\"red\">spoiler</font> for the film in the process.</p>\n\n<p>The trailer below is simply an alternate cut of the more widely released original featuring some snippets of new footage, but the foreign language versions confirm a rumor we&#39;ve been hearing since before the movie had even wrapped production: Lashana Lynch&#39;s Nomi is indeed the new 007.</p>\n\n<p>In the English language versions of the teaser Bond can be heard saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve met your new double O‚Äù, keeping the big reveal a surprise.

We praised the movie&#39;s visuals in our review (<a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/disney/mulan-spoiler-free-review-a-stunning-and-authentic-new-take-on-this-iconic-character-a178095\">which you can check out by clicking here</a>), and much of the credits for those absolutely goes to¬†Make-Up And Hair Designer Denise Kum.</p>\n\n<p>Her past credits include the likes of¬†<a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/captain_america/captain_america_the_first_avenger/\"><strong><em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em></strong></a>, <em>Hugo</em>, and¬†<a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/\"><strong><em>Ash vs Evil Dead</em></strong></a>, but Kum&#39;s work on <em>Mulan</em> is arguably her most impressive and visually stunning to date.</p>\n\n<p>Talking to the prolific¬†Make-Up And Hair Designer by email back in June, we asked Kum about what it took to bring the world of <em>Mulan</em> to life in live-action, the work that went into¬†creating the appearances of the movie&#39;s villains, and even her work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe a few years back.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, we want to say a huge thank you to Kum for taking the time to answer our questions!<br />\n¬†</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mulan10456234\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/FzzzYBp/Mulan10456234.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>How did you come to be involved with <em>Mulan</em> and what did it mean to you to be part of the movie?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Mulan‚Äôs director, Niki Caro, asked me to come on board to design the hair, makeup, and prosthetics for the Mulan project. We are longtime collaborators and friends. Mulan marks the sixth feature film we have completed together. It was an honor to be a part of the film and to personally be able to work on a story from my own Chinese heritage with such an important female role model.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the visuals in the animated movie inspire or influence your work at all in this live-action adaptation?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>There are keyframes and images from the animated film that did inform some of the character‚Äôs realizations. For some of the looks, the make-up approach was not derivative but more a nod in the direction of heightened color and brightness you get with animation. For example, this is demonstrated in the sequence with the matchmaker character and Mulan. Using primary colors that are very symbolic in Chinese culture - and at the same very seminal and kept in old school Disney characters (such as Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse).</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Which character in <em>Mulan</em> was the most challenging to work on?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>They all had particular challenges depending on what live-action stunts they had to endure, and of course, the makeup, hair, and prosthetics had to last the distance. Yifei had to execute a few in-camera effects with tricks using a fishing line wire with different hairpieces which enabled her to move in a particular way - whether it was to tumble down, come unraveled, riding horseback or in the tea scene where she is balancing precariously. As our central character, she had to look completely authentic and convincing at all stages of the film, so maintaining that throughout filming was extremely important. In terms of a lot of components happening at once, Xianniang had prosthetics, a very long wig, airbrushed FX, and makeup which made navigating time in the chair with what was practical for each setup. As for the crowd, the background world of the shoot in China was very challenging for the team. We had Imperial Palace scenes in full formal costume, with many many wigs - some with cages, some with headwear all during a very hot and humid summer shoot. Ensuring all the actors remained cool and hydrated while maintaining full wig hairdos and preventing makeup from melting in extreme heat was definitely demanding.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What sort of work went into ensuring that <em>Mulan</em> was authentic to China during the period the movie is set in, and how much research did that require?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Substantial research was undertaken by all departments. There was a great collective bank of information - we had cultural advisors from an early stage of production that we could consult and run our ideas past. Since we were dealing with a period in time where there are no photographs, a time where information has been passed down via mythology - I started at the source by looking at a lot of sculptures, scrolls, paintings, cremains and poetry, as well as, literature and mythology of certain dynasties. Museums, collections, and art books were a great resource for the film. I found it extremely interesting to read texts on the cultural and social anthropology of ancient China. It was also important to mix history with a modern edge and make it engaging and relatable to a contemporary audience.</em><br />\n¬†</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mulan104562344\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/z4mptTk/Mulan104562344.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>From what we&#39;ve seen in the trailers, Mulan has a lot of different looks in the film, from a traditional ceremonial costume to her warrior armor. Can you talk us through the challenges of giving Liu Yifei those vastly different looks over the course of this movie?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Liu Yifei as Mulan has many looks as we follow her on her journey through the film, which begins with her as a child and growing into a young girl who has a natural beauty. In one scene, she made up heavily for an appointment with the village matchmaker, after this Mulan disguises herself as a boy to be conscripted into the imperial army. Thus, we see her as a male conscript and then as a soldier, and eventually, she reveals her ‚ÄúTrue Self‚Äù as our warrior woman. Yifei is wonderful to work with and was so open to all of the ideas for each look and each transformation. She has an exceptional attitude and of course great bone structure. I wanted to concentrate on each look as part of her journey‚Ä¶ as each was an integral part of the storytelling. We did a few tests in order to create a convincing boy look, we had to balance whether to be more or less feminine - all to be done without looking like she has a scrap of makeup on. With the different looks, I would say making everything look invisible and seamless so nothing is distracting from the performance is important. From dirt levels to the movement of the hair - vastly different environments are always a test. As most of the action sequences are shot in real landscapes, and at a time with high winds, rain, snow, and then, of course, opposing climates of heat and humidity - whilst the actors are navigating being on a wire, harness or on horseback. Nature and nerves have a big part to play. Silhouette and shape were key to the feminine and masculine differences so it was very collaborative with the great costumes that Bina Daigeler designed for each of the looks</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gong Li&#39;s Xian Lang looks like an incredible character who transitions between practical and visual effects as she shapeshifts - what sort of role do you play in that transformation, and what was it like working on her?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Xianniang has special prosthetics that we would apply just before she was scheduled to be on set, as once they were on she had restricted use of her hands. We had stunt safe sets and hero closeup sets, which all had to work in practical terms and in physical situations often with weapons. These could then later be enhanced with VFX as required for any morphing or fighting sequences. Gong Li is incredibly self-aware, she was very mindful of all the components that were put together for her look, and when things needed to be checked, she was always patient. Which is great when part of the ensemble is not necessarily the most comfortable. She endured a very long wig with a crown, prosthetics, airbrushed makeup, lashes, and her beauty/character look which made up our Xianniang.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jason Scott Lee&#39;s character is also unique from a visual perspective; what sort of work went into turning him into <em>Mulan</em>&#39;s villain?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Jason really brought the makeup of Bori Khan to life. Director, Niki Caro, wanted there to be a sense of battle to his character, so his facial scarring was meant to look like old wounds that had healed over. I combined this idea with the placement of the scarring to almost like facial tattooing; in the way, the lines and forms would assist his facial expressions. We did several tests where we would have Jason move his face in extreme ways and pull faces in the mirror so we could see what would work best and move with his expressions seamlessly - all in effort to deepen his inner fighter! Guyliner and man braids were also very key and we had fun with that.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You worked on <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>, and I was wondering if you could talk about what your work on that project involved as we have a lot of superhero fans on the site?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Captain America and the recent Black Widow are films that I have been lucky enough to be asked to work on, it‚Äôs always fun to visit as a day player, to help out with stunts, or actors when they need an extra pair of hands.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you like to return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe if the opportunity presents itself down the line?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I think that would be a very exciting prospect to consider.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>It&#39;s still early days for the <em>Mulan</em> franchise, but if a sequel does happen, are you hoping to return?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Yes, it is the early days, but Mulan is such a great character, that a sequel would be great; And, an invitation that wouldn‚Äôt be refused.</em><br />\n¬†</p>\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEkYivmDZYx/?utm_source=ig_embed&#38;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Was In Talks For THE FLASH","link":"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/justice_league/justice-league-star-ray-fisher-not-cooperating-with-investigators-says-wb-was-in-talks-for-the-flash-a178136","description":"<p>Following actor Ray Fisher&#39;s very serious accusations regarding on-set misconduct against¬†<strong><em>Justice League¬†</em></strong>replacement director Joss Whedon and producers Jon Berg and Geoff Johns earlier this summer, Warner Bros. announced their intention to launch an independent investigation into the matter.¬†</p>\n\n<p>However, things took a nasty turn earlier today when Fisher called out Walter Hamada, the President of DC Films, by tweeting,¬†\"<em><strong>After speaking out about Justice League, I received a phone call from the President of DC Films wherein he attempted to throw Joss Whedon and Jon Berg under the bus in hopes that I would relent on Geoff Johns.</strong></em>,\"¬†and continued¬†to preach his \"Accountability > Entertainment\" mantra to his 63.7K followers.</p>\n\n<p>This latest development¬†prompted an extremely stern response from Warner Bros., who dropped quite the Friday night shocker, now accusing Fisher - who had previously voiced his approval of the investigative¬†team - of not actually cooperating with the third-party investigators who have made multiple¬†requests to speak with him over the past few weeks.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Their statement also seems to imply that Fisher was seemingly most¬†upset with how his character&#39;s arc changed in the theatrical cut of¬†<strong><em>Justice League</em></strong>¬†and was not pleased that his suggested script revisions were not taken into serious¬†consideration, which, while unfortunate, isn&#39;t exactly unprecedented in Hollywood where directors, writers and producers understandably get¬†final say. It&#39;s likely this may have resulted in the deterioration of his relationship with Whedon, who was brough in to revamp the movie at the request of WB.</p>\n\n<p>Another factor further complicating matters¬†is that Fisher was also reportedly engaged in early negotiations to potentially reprise his role as Cyborg (along with other Justice Leagers) for Andy Muschietti&#39;s¬†<strong><em>The Flash</em></strong>, but the status of that now remains uncertain as he and Hamada haven&#39;t spoken since July.¬†</p>\n\n<p>While it&#39;s unclear whether those talks will resume now, one thing we do know for sure is that this situation is about to get a whole lost messier for both side.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Read Warner Bros. full statement below:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In July, Ray Fisher‚Äôs representatives¬†asked¬†DC Films President Walter Hamada to talk to Mr. Fisher about his concerns during the production of ‚ÄúJustice League.‚Äù The two had previously spoken¬†when Mr. Hamada asked him to reprise his role as Cyborg in Warner Bros.‚Äô upcoming Flash movie, together with other members of the Justice League.¬†In their July conversation,¬†Mr. Fisher recounted disagreements he‚Äôd had with the film‚Äôs creative team regarding his portrayal of Cyborg, and complained that his suggested script revisions were not adopted. Mr. Hamada explained that creative differences are a normal part of the production process, and that a film‚Äôs writer/director ultimately has to be in charge of these matters. Notably, Mr. Hamada also told Mr. Fisher that he would elevate his concerns to WarnerMedia so they could conduct an investigation.¬† At no time did Mr. Hamada ever ‚Äúthrow anyone under the bus,‚Äù as Mr. Fisher has falsely claimed, or render any judgments about the¬†‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù¬†production, in which Mr. Hamada had no involvement, since filming occurred before Mr. Hamada was elevated to his current position.¬†¬†</em></p>\n\n<p><em>While Mr. Fisher never alleged any actionable misconduct against him, WarnerMedia nonetheless initiated an investigation into the concerns he‚Äôd raised about his character‚Äôs portrayal.¬†Still not satisfied, Mr. Fisher insisted that WarnerMedia hire an independent third party investigator. This investigator has attempted multiple times to meet with Mr. Fisher to discuss his concerns but, to date, Mr. Fisher has declined to speak to the investigator. Warner Bros. remains committed to accountability and to the well-being of every cast and crew member on each of its productions. It also remains committed to investigating any specific and credible allegation of misconduct, which thus far Mr. Fisher has failed to provide.¬†</em></p>\n</blockquote>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 05:30:00 +0000","feedId":13958,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7d176540af6cd126e3618970c77128b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296444664},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:00:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:00:44","title":"FOLLOWED Exclusive Interview: Director Says Unexplained Paranormal Events Happened On Set","link":"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/followed-exclusive-interview-director-says-unexplained-paranormal-events-happened-on-set-a178122","description":"<p>Found footage films have been a part of the horror genre for some time now.¬†<em><strong>Cannibal Holocaust¬†</strong></em>kicked off the sub-genre in the eighties with¬†<em><strong>Blair Witch Project¬†</strong></em>truly popularizing the story-telling device in the late nineties.

So¬†I do believe there are spirits and things like that out there. I have never experienced it, at least personally, I&#39;m talking about like seeing a ghost, something like that. However, though, there are unexplainable things that happen. </em></p>\n\n<p><em>Case and point, in our movie, Followed, there were bizarre things that happened on set that we couldn&#39;t account for in terms of why that was the case. So, one of the scenes is that the prop head just fell. And that moment¬†wasn&#39;t planned, but it was part of the movie.¬†In the elevator sequence, there was a point where the lights start to flicker; it was not planned.¬†And there are other things behind the scenes; hopefully, one day we&#39;ll release. </em></p>\n\n<p><em>There was one sequence¬†where Mike is putting the drone in the basement, and as he does it, he makes it light¬†up. It&#39;s okay, little baby. He&#39;s talking about his drone, right? It&#39;s¬†a little baby. Nothing happened on set; it was fine because we¬†had 20 people there. Everything was fine. But when we were editing it, when Mike says it&#39;s okay, little baby, I kid you not, we hear loud as¬†day, a noise of a baby crying. Now here&#39;s the question. What the heck did that noise come from? Right? Because it was so loud. It wasn&#39;t just a faint one. It was really loud as if the baby was right there on set. Now here&#39;s the thing. If the baby was on set, all of us would have heard it. Right? All of us because obviously, you know, we get all the sounds with everybody on set. So how come none of us heard anything whatsoever, and it only materialized when we were cutting the film, which again, up to this day, we have no explanation. We&#39;ll probably cut it into the deleted scene or the behind the scenes stuff. And that and amongst other things that happened after the movie was over. </em></p>\n\n<center><iframe data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" height=\"315\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/media/player/989qi-e9df37?from=usersite&#38;vjs=1&#38;skin=1&#38;fonts=Helvetica&#38;auto=0&#38;download=1\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"Episode 25: Dropping the Mic with Actor Matthew Solomon\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></center>\n\n<p><em>For example, I went to¬†a friend&#39;s place of work, and he&#39;s a security guard at the building. And then we were talking about the movie, and we were making fun of the quote-unquote ghost in the film. And all of a sudden, all of his monitor went out. Like I kid you not, just like in a found footage film. I was basically making fun of the ghost, the fake ghost, and whatnot that we were talking about, then all of his monitor, it just had that glitchy effect,¬†and it was gone. And then¬†my buddy had to say, dude, this building is haunted. You got to apologize. And I was like, oh shit. And I did apologize in a sense. And then it went back on, right? </em></p>\n\n<p><em>So those are the things that, do I have an explanation for that? No, I don&#39;t.¬†But I haven&#39;t seen one myself. My parents have, my mom has, my uncle,¬†everybody that told me their encounters or whatnot, but I&#39;ve never seen it. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying that I am, I am a believer, but I&#39;m a skeptical believer. I do want to see a ghost in real life.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>*This interview has been edited for clarity.*</em></p>\n\n<p>What do you guys make of these comments from Antoine Le and Tim Drier?
