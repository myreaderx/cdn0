/></p><p>Now that we work from home I feel like we are more aware of how quickly our workspaces can become cluttered. Not just with snacks and numerous mugs of coffee but also with the tech accessories! I personally find myself using a lot more cables and peripheral accessories and that is bound to happen because I am not in an office set up and still trying to keep everything functioning smoothly in the available space I have for working and living. Modular <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/keyboard/\">keyboards</a> like this were specifically designed to address this very issue and Link is the latest concept design aimed at giving the user a clutter-free computer accessory ecosystem.</p><p>Having a visually harmonious, intuitive, and efficient set of tech accessories allows the user to keep all devices and peripherals charged and in sync at all times &#8211; its the same calm you experience when you start your day on a clean, organized desk! Link is a collection of essential computer accessories that are integrated to work together to optimize functionality for the user right from wireless charging devices to compact input devices. &#8220;The goal of this project was to design an ecosystem of peripherals that aims to deliver an experience that is customizable, easy to use, and adaptable to the computer users&#8217; needs at a moment&#8217;s notice,&#8221; says the designer. So no more scampering around for a certain jack if you have to plug in a non-Apple device or having a network of cables that just take up more space + energy!</p><p>The designer felt the need to create a truly effortless, delightful, and seamless user experience that went beyond beautiful aesthetics. Link is a one-stop-shop to keep devices charged, synced, and &#8216;linked&#8217; together with as minimal cables and inconveniences as possible. The keyboard is a constant at everyone&#8217;s desk and therefore the peripheral devices were formed to work around it like modular accessories. The set includes the keyboard along with &#8217;tiles&#8217; which are the peripheral accessories. These tiles include a drawing tablet, wireless charging pads, a touchpad, a number pad, and a dial which is the most interesting of them all. &#8220;Pan around. Zoom. Select. Click. Clack. Rotate. The Dial instantly becomes your favorite digital input tool,&#8221; says the designer about including the playful accessory. All modules are battery operated and magnetically connect to the side of the keyboard to dock and recharge when low on charge before being reused again. It also comes equipped with NFC, Bluetooth, and wireless charging capabilities to make it the ultimate unifying hub. Less is more, and less is specifically one cable.</p><p>Designer: Evan Stuart</p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/0b86e197729487.5efa6d53d8148.gif\" alt=\"link1\"

forever","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=271262","description":"<p><iframe\ntitle=\"SEADON - All-Terrain Shirts with 16 Natural Performances &#x1f343;\"

Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with cotton&#8230; but hey, it&#8217;s human nature to look for better solutions, right? Meet Seadon, a series of high-performance tees made for everyday wearing. Designed to be more breathable, durable, comfortable, temperature-regulating, moisture-wicking, and fast-drying than the standard cotton tee, Seadon&#8217;s everyday tee shirts come made from a mix of innovative fibers. From comfortable merino wool to naturally cooling eucalyptus-based Tencel, and the sustainable and moisture-wicking recycled PET, Seadon&#8217;s tees are anything but the status quo cotton tees.</p><p>Seadon&#8217;s Daily Tees push the boundaries of the understated comfort and utility of your go-to tee shirt. Designed around specific purposes, the tees come in three variants. The Traveller is the perfect base-layer tee shirt, designed for long trips and outdoor use. Made from 70% Merino Wool and 30% Eucalyptus-fiber Tencel, the tees are engineered to be soft and comfortable as they regulate temperature, resist wrinkling, staining, and repel liquids. The Traveller works as a great insulator and can be worn over thick coats and jackets. Conversely, if the sun gets too rough, the tee works well independently too, with a rating of UPF~ 50+ to protect you against harsh sunlight. Designed to be worn over long journeys, the tee can be worn for as long as 7 days before needing to be washed.</p><p>For more active lifestyles, the Trailblazer tee gives you the comfort of a fabric that feels comfortable and airy when worn. Made from equal parts RPET and Polygiene (and finished with &#8216;miDori&#8217; a naturally wicking coating derived from algae oil), Seadon&#8217;s Trailblazer tees are perfect for sweating in. The tees naturally stretch to let you move freely, dry faster than traditional clothing, and offer high breathability and sun-protection. Made from a yarn that&#8217;s derived from recycled plastic, these tees last much longer than traditional clothing, while also being more sustainable and having a lower carbon footprint than your cotton or polyester tee shirt.</p><p>Seadon&#8217;s third variant proves to be its most popular with &#8216;best-of-both-worlds&#8217; features. Crafted from a proprietary combination of Bluesign RPET (recycled PET), Polygiene, Eucalyptus Tencel, and with the moisture-wicking miDori coating, the Daymaker gives you the comfort of your favorite tee shirt but upgrades its abilities with durable stitching, moisture-wicking, quick-drying, as well as temperature-regulating features.</p><p>Each tee comes in multiple sizes for men and women, sports a variety of colors, and even sleeve lengths. Sporting an evergreen design that&#8217;s well-paired with a durable build, comfortable yarn, and a host of features that just make them superior, Seadon&#8217;s Daily Tees reinvent the wheel by taking the ubiquitous, classic cotton tee and making it softer, more long-lasting, breathable, stretchable, and the kind of tee your skin will fall in love with. Besides, its ethically-sourced supply chain and bio-degradable packaging will ensure the environment loves your tees too!</p><p>Designer: Seadon Design</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://kicks.to/seadon/G7QoZYV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $13</strong></a>.

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>As a fan of fictional writing, nothing excites me so much as to see a whole new world, unexplored and full of opportunities. That is exactly how I feel every time I see an <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/architectural-designs/\">architectural design</a> posted by <a\nhref=\"https://www.instagram.com/inwardsound/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@inwardsound</a>, an Italian 3D artist on Instagram who creates these surreal yet realistic views of our future, kind of like showing different versions of Earth in parallel universes where one twist in fate or act of man resulted in the new society that would be formed under their influence. The designer uses a mix of software, including Cinema4D and photoshop to achieve his vision. Just looking at the detailed effort that goes into each of these renders, it is easy to create a story of someone who lives in that space, which hopefully is COVID-free!</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271371\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/05-Habitat_Dystopian-Future-architecture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1306\" /></p><p>Living in cities, with homes that are so close by, we often know the person on the window opposite, they are practically our neighbors too! Habitat imagines a city where gravity is under control, so people reside on the land level and sky level (literally!) in this amazing view of what the world would be like if we run out of space in our cities. New York 2200 is here, and chances are, you will have a friendly neighbor above you as well!</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271367\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/02-Inward-Sound_Dystopian-future-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>When man overruns all the forest to create cities, how do they balance the green space? By creating a dedicated space on a higher plane to create a forest that gets plenty of sunlight and it thrives enough to sustain the urban population. Titles Urbs, this render brings to mind such a space, with the richest of the people getting the higher floor and most of the benefits of the environment. Altered Carbon vibes anyone?</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271379\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/03-Space-Settlements_Dystopian-future-architecture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Whether our future is in space or on another planet, one thing is for sure &#8211; we need greenery! Probably if we enforce that lesson earlier, the future won&#8217;t come to a moment where we have to leave the planet. Morbid musings aside, this giant space-ship in the render Space Settlements seems to maintain that healthy balance of nature and humans on it that brings hope that these humans won&#8217;t be the round-ish blobs Disney&#8217;s masterpiece Wall-E envisions.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271375\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/04-Central-Station_Dystopian-Future-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>The year is 2120 and the city is Tokyo. Anyone who has lived or traveled to Japan knows that it is one of the most organized city in terms of its directions and signage. The huge structure that houses various railway and bullet train lines that run through it every minute is the past of this futuristic Central Station that in the next 100 years should account for the VTOL&#8217;s, hoverboards and jet packs as well!</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271372\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/06-Myst_Dystopian-Future-architecture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1312\" /></p><p>What do you do when you run out of horizontal space? You create a parallel plane to create housing for the remaining humans. Seems a tad bit difficult in terms of the logistics, but the design here named Myst has a charm of its own, like the water-filled city of Venice, where the old and the new come together and share a space while allowing nature to flourish around them.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271376\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/07-O2-Station_Dystopian-Future-architecture3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>The increasing sales of air purifiers around the world are proof that we recognize the impact of our actions and the increasing air pollution. But what do we do when the pollution level is so high, that the small scale home purifiers are not enough? We create the O2 Station! Imagine a central, large-scale purifier if you will who stands tall and is responsible for cleaning the toxic air around us, making the environment habitable for humans and plants alike!</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271366\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/01-Inward-Sound_Dystopian-future-architecture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>What would happen if the circular alien space ship that landed in New York (in Avengers Endgame, of course, this is not a conspiracy reveal) never left? I could imagine it growing earthy vegetation over time and becoming a part of the city’s heritage just like this design titled E-C-C. Population growing at an unprecedented pace causing us to capture space in every form &#8211; be it vertical skyscrapers or circular structures &#8211; this is a reality we can see sooner rather than later.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271363\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271361/09-Quiet-City_Dystopian-Future-architecture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1315\" /></p><p>Usually, we associate the colour red with vibrance and even violence but there is something about the use of red in this render that brings to mind the zen temples of Kyoto in their fierce autumn glory. The multi-level structures in a grid-like a pattern are random yet organized at the same time, giving the city its name, the Quiet City. Look at this for long and I can almost hear the bells tolling!</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271380\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/architectural-design-renders-that-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-humanity-part-2/08-Rotor-City_Dystopian-Future-architecture3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>We know the importance of the earth&#8217;s rotation in our daily lives. Can you imagine living only in the night, with no daylight coming to your rescue? When humans live in space, we will try to replicate what we already know and that is what gives the Rotor City its unique shape. Built around a central axis, the city is built to rotate like Earth, retaining the balance we are familiar with and making the transition from Earth to space easier.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271364\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271361/10-Inward-Sound_Dystopian-future-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>When the people in the 1900s imagined 2020, flying was a legitimate mode of transport and here I am in 2020, stuck in quarantine with no flight in sight. So maybe the future we are envisioning will be not a vastly different route but more of a nod in the right direction, creating that balance we seek. New Life is such a futuristic city, overrun by skyscrapers and plants alike, showing that the new modern must be more green than grey!</p><p>Love these design renders as much as we do?

category","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=271599","description":"<p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-271600\"

challenges the presence of multiple markets. Meet the Paysage, a conceptual computing device that targets both laptop and desktop users with a unique hybrid design. Its design features a two-part construction &#8211; the main CPU, which sits within the keyboard-unit (like most laptops), and the screen, which rather than resting on the top of the keyboard, comes with a flexible construction that wraps around the top and the bottom, sandwiching the keyboard in between. The image above should fairly help illustrate what I mean.</p><p>This unique build is what sets the Paysage apart. Flip open half the screen and you&#8217;ve got yourself a standard laptop/netbook, equipped with a keyboard, trackpad, four USB-C ports, an Aux input, and its dedicated speakers. However, things get interesting when you realize that the entire keyboard unit detaches from the screen completely, leaving you with a much larger flexible display that you can open out and mount on a tabletop stand, giving you a desktop experience complete with a massive elevated screen and an external keyboard.</p><p>The Paysage was originally envisioned nearly a decade ago (<a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2013/02/07/the-hybrid-laptop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">and subsequently covered on YD too</a>), and it&#8217;s only with recent advancements in flexible OLED displays that the Paysage seems more real. In its latest iteration, designer Kevin Depape details out the device further, with magnetic fixtures, connecting cables, and an overall design that seems like something Microsoft could pull off if they tried. A Surface DeskBook perhaps?!</p><p>Designer: Kevin Depape</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-271601\"

imagine Arthur Curry&#8217;s go-to weapon is his shining trident, but sometimes a small pocket-knife is all you need to get the job done. Launched as a highly limited edition run, the Hirin is designed by Dew Hara, son of eminent blade designer Koji Hara in partnership with CRKT.</p><p>Limited to just 500 pieces, the Hirin comes with a drop-point blade made from Böhler M390 stainless steel that folds right into its exquisitely styled 6AL4V titanium handle. The Hirin measures 5.2 inches when closed, opening up to become an 8.6-inch pocket-knife that&#8217;s really ideal for most outdoor tasks The blade opens in an ambidextrous fashion, allowing it to open or close either through the left or the right with a comfortable flick, thanks to CRKT’s IKBS ball bearing system. Each knife comes manufactured to perfection in Maniago, Italy, along with an exclusive leather case, designed by Hara too. And while the Hirin may look like something out of Aquaman&#8217;s arsenal, CRKT explicitly states that it doesn&#8217;t have any superpowers&#8230; unless looking spectacular is a superpower.</p><p>Designer: Dew Hara for <a\nhref=\"https://www.crkt.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"

scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p><p>It&#8217;s a wireless charger, but it&#8217;s better than a wireless charger. Cell by Ampere works as a dock as well as a UV sterilization chamber for your belongings. It&#8217;s a weirdly relevant combination of features but believe you me, Cell does a great job of being multifunctional but still being sensible. Every feature and use-case is well thought out, making it just the most conveniently handy accessory to have on you. Here, let me explain.</p><p>It&#8217;s no secret that your glossy, shiny, expensive smartphone is one of the most germ-filled things currently in your pocket. It&#8217;s also no secret that your phone is one of the most useful gadgets you&#8217;ve got on your person, so that&#8217;s really a conflict of interest, isn&#8217;t it? Cell by Ampere comes with a collapsible design that houses 2 wireless charging coils on the top, and UV-C LEDs on the base. Place your phone on top, and it fast-charges without wires, however, collapse the silicon rim around the sides and the base becomes a UV chamber, allowing you to sterilize your phone, watch, earphones, keys, or any EDC in mere minutes. Designed to be handy, Cell can be used as a UV wand too, allowing you to sterilize larger areas (like your door-handles, keyboards, food delivery parcels) by just waving the UV light over them. One could argue that being germ-free is just as much of a benefit as a fully charged smartphone, and the Cell&#8217;s 2-in-1 nature helps cover both those areas.</p><p>Things get really interesting when you realize that there&#8217;s more to Cell&#8217;s functionality. Its foldable silicone design can be half-expanded at an angle too, allowing your charger to effectively become a dock that works in landscape as well as portrait mode. Designed to allow you to use your phone while it&#8217;s getting juiced, the wireless charging surface comes with an anti-friction layer that holds your phone securely in place, and stops charging if your phone loses alignment. A USB-C output on the side of the Cell lets you even further connect a secondary charger for your smartwatch, and the collapsible design makes this entire world of functionality just as slim and portable as your phone itself. Plus, the cherry on the cake? Cell&#8217;s own wire and adapter are made from anti-microbial materials too, so your belongings are always clean&#8230; but don&#8217;t take my word for it! Just ask the guys at Business Insider, Digital Trends, and CES who called the Cell the best smartphone accessory of 2020!</p><p>Designer: Grant Shi of Ampere</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://cell-a-powerful-uv-sanitizer.kckb.st/e30f0658\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $65</strong></a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-07-30T09:04:28+00:00\">$99.99</del> (35% off).

home!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=271303","description":"<p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271358\"

/></p><p>Do you remember when park benches were actually just stubs of chopped trees or creatively placed wooden logs? I remember my mom could tell I had been to the park because my clothes smelled like wood and grass, and that is exactly what this beautiful stubby chair reminds me of! This <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/chair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chair</a> is an amazing display of nostalgia and minimalism through furniture design.</p><p>The designer wanted to incorporate our inherent ways of interacting with nature into a chair. Stubby chair was inspired by these environmental settings that combined the love for interiors with an element from the exterior world. Nature is the best designer (for the most part!) so observing nature gives the designer a lot of clues and points of directions where they should pay attention so it fits seamlessly into our lives. &#8220;Over time, you settle down with some household items, borrowed from nature. At the same time, you understand that the world is changing and you are changing with it,&#8221; she says describing the simplistic design which can age with time.</p><p>It is about looking at a familiar object through a different lens. Stubby chair brings back that attention to the details and functions of a sturdy chair. What would be a wooden chair would now be considered outdated so the incorporation of the metal pipes shows the same wooden chair in a modern light. &#8220;Do not be attached to the place and time. Do not endow the item with any particular style because of its deposit and burden it with the historical era in which the item was created,&#8221; says the designer on the product&#8217;s evergreen design along with the philosophy behind it.</p><p>Designer: Nissa Kinzhalina</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271356\"

design it was the name of the product that caught me eye &#8211; Pluching! Pluching is a mashup of the words pluck + stretching and it was the quickest, most genius way to describe the functionality of this personal device!</p><p>Our modern lifestyle involves us being stationary in one position for long hours which is unhealthy and Pluching was created as an organic solution that brings more movement! The time spent sitting in one place has increased so much ever since the pandemic began because all we do is work from home and then watch Netflix at home. This can cause turtle neck syndrome, shoulder pain, back pain, and unhealthy stiffness which you can minimize using stretching equipment like Pluching. The idea was to design exercise equipment that gives the effect of band exercise and stretching but could clip-on on the back of your chair for ease. Pluching uses a powerful neodymium magnet that is embedded in a silicon clip to secure the equipment and give you stability.</p><p>It also includes Bluetooth and a heat detection sensor are built into the handle, this allows users to check the exact number of times they stretch by syncing their app to the equipment. Users can also set stretching reminders on the app and they will be notified via vibrations when it is time to take a healthy break. If you&#8217;re reading this, straighten your back or better yet, get up and stretch!</p><p>Designer: Heesuk Lee</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271563\"

It’s literally a sole that ‘snaps to your feet’! Link presents a very unique approach to footwear. Just step into the soles and they automatically hug your feet, securing themselves in place. Without any upper cladding, the Link feels quite like walking barefoot. They allow your feet to remain ventilated, and providing all the freedom of movement and security you’d get from a pair of sneakers, but with the airy feel of flip-flops. Designed like a massive bumper-case for your feet, the Link is made with an EVA insole that provides the comfort and the grip, and a hard TPU outsole that comes with a fragmented design, allowing it to bend and flex with your feet. Together, the two materials make up Link’s construction, giving it flexibility, openness, friction/grip, and even a protective bumper around your feet, preventing your toes from accidental stubs and bumps.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271481\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271459/06-carota_design_self-lacing-nike_sneakers_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"701\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271482\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271459/06-carota_design_self-lacing-nike_sneakers_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Carota Design’s <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/12/20/i-could-get-used-to-these-self-lacing-nike-sneakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nike self-lacing sneaker</a> concepts literally look like they’re from the future. With hard-shell components and gloss/matte finish contrasts, they don’t look or feel like traditional shoes at all, aside from the familiar silhouette, which definitely is a good thing. Designed to highlight the futuristic aspect of shoes that secure themselves, the conceptual sneakers come with a red lace that stands well against the black sneakers. The laces travel from the outsole to the front, and then to the heel, where they connect to a motor that’s triggered by a button. Tap against the button and the motor tightens the laces up, securing the shoe in place. Tap a second time and the laces loosen, allowing you to slip your shoe out!

Each part of the shoe is plant-based, using materials like jute, pineapple husk, kenaf, linen, treated with natural oils like olive oil for suppleness and comfort. Tricky bits of the shoe’s design involved finding a workaround for the sole, which Native managed to solve by partnering with France-based Reltex to create a sole that comprises a eucalyptus-pulp insole, kenaf (hemp) and corn cushioning, and a sap-based tread that gives the shoes its grip. Binding all the shoe’s parts together formed the next challenge, as most shoe companies rely on toxic, non-biodegradable petrochemical-based glues to hold the sneaker’s parts together. Native’s solution involved stitching all the parts together using entirely plant-based threads that are strong enough for sneaker construction.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271493\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271459/02-Kengo-Kuma_ASICS_Shoe-Design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271494\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271459/02-Kengo-Kuma_ASICS_Shoe-Design2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p\nclass=\"post-without-image\">Teaming up with the renowned Japanese Architect Kengo Kuma, ASICS has unveiled the latest edition of the <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/11/12/inspired-by-japanese-bamboo-weaving-kengo-kumas-shoes-for-asics-are-like-moving-architecture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metaride</a>, an all-white running shoe with a pattern inspired by Japanese Yatara bamboo-weaving, on the shoe’s body. The fabric strips wrap themselves in a seemingly chaotic way, but in fact, are strategically placed to hold the foot steady by binding with the shoe’s innovative Flytefoam base that uses cellulose nanofiber, a strong and lightweight wood-pulp derived material currently being researched and explored in Japan.

Ill-fitted shoes are uncomfortable, but walking barefoot leaves children vulnerable to soil-transmitted diseases and parasites that can cause illness and even death, aside from the cuts, burns, and blisters. The Shoe That Grows combats the unfortunate scenario where children outgrow their footwear by being the one pair of footwear that grows with them.

The conceptual shoe features a unibody design with a subtle gradient from top to bottom, visually creating a separation between shoe and outsole, while there’s no surface break between the two. Harnessing the shape of the foot, building on the bones and muscles within, the 3D Surprise was envisioned as a new-age hiking boot with a design that was simple and sophisticated looking. The shoe comes with an exaggerated protrusion detail for the ankle bone, and a textured sole that looks industrial and organic at the same time.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271499\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271459/05-Spurz_Heel-light_Shoe-Design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"701\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271480\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271459/05-Spurz_Heel-light_Shoe-Design2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" /></p><p>Made to bend around your heel and fit onto any shoe of any size, the <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/01/24/heels-on-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spurz by 4id</a> come in a wide variety of colors and can be configured to either flash a steady light or blink continuously.
