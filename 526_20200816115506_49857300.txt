Too many calorie-tracking apps overwhelm you with data and are hard to use. Calory is different. The app&#8217;s elegant interface is designed to make quick work of logging food items and makes checking your progress easy.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">The app is available on the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac, which ensures you&#8217;ll always have a device nearby to help you stay on track. On each platform, one of Calory&#8217;s hallmarks is its straightforward, glanceable design. There is no distracting, extraneous information, just refined visual cues to make tracking your progress easy and a big plus button for quickly logging calories and meals. For more detail, you can view your data in a journal view, which provides a snapshot of each day tracked.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\">Calory&#8217;s clutter-free interface lets you monitor your calories daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly to spot trends. Tracking other statistics like carbs, proteins, fat, sodium, and more is available too. You can track water intake and your weight, and the app works with Apple Health, which privately stores the data you log.</p>\n<p id=\"p5\">To make entering meal data even easier, Calory lets you save custom plates, so you can quickly log your most common meals, and scan barcodes. There&#8217;s even a recipe database to help inspire you to try new, healthy meals. Of course, there is also Shortcuts integration, which allows you to log items and track your progress using Siri and your own custom shortcuts.</p>\n<p id=\"p6\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1441252752?pt=2102403&#38;ct=MacStories-August2020&#38;mt=8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Download Calory today</a> to start tracking what you eat or <a href=\"https://calory.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit calory.app to learn more</a> about the easiest, most elegant way to count your calories.</p>\n<p id=\"p7\"><em>Our thanks to Calory for sponsoring MacStories this week.</em></p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

The interview is lengthy yet well worth reading, especially since it&#8217;s the most we&#8217;ve heard from Apple&#8217;s head of ML and AI since he departed Google to join the company in 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"p2\">Based on some of the things Giannandrea says in the interview, it sounds like he&#8217;s had a very busy two years. For example, when asked to list ways Apple has used machine learning in its recent software and products, Giannandrea lists a variety of things before ultimately indicating that it&#8217;s harder to name things that don&#8217;t use machine learning than ones that do.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote3\"><p>\n  There&#8217;s a whole bunch of new experiences that are powered by machine learning. And these are things like language translation, or on-device dictation, or our new features around health, like sleep and hand washing, and stuff we&#8217;ve released in the past around heart health and things like this. I think there are increasingly fewer and fewer places in iOS where we&#8217;re not using machine learning. It&#8217;s hard to find a part of the experience where you&#8217;re not doing some predictive [work].\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p4\">One interesting tidbit mentioned by both Giannandrea and Borchers is that Apple&#8217;s increased dependence on machine learning hasn&#8217;t led to the company talking about ML non-stop. I&#8217;ve noticed this too &#8211; whereas a few years ago the company might have thrown out &#8216;machine learning&#8217; countless times during a keynote presentation, these days it&#8217;s intentionally more careful and calculated in naming the term, and I think for good reason. As Giannandrea puts it, &#8220;I think that this is the future of the computing devices that we have, is that they be smart, and that, that smart sort of disappear.&#8221; Borchers expounds on that idea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote5\"><p>\n  This is clearly our approach, with everything that we do, which is, &#8216;Let&#8217;s focus on what the benefit is, not how you got there.&#8217; And in the best cases, it becomes automagic. It disappears&#8230; and you just focus on what happened, as opposed to how it happened.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p6\">The full interview covers subjects like Apple&#8217;s Neural Engine, Apple Silicon for Macs, the benefits of handling ML tasks on-device, and much more, including a fun story from Giannandrea&#8217;s early days at Apple.

Not long after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/29/apple-google-facebook-amazon-congress-hearing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Congressional hearings investigating anti-competitive conduct</a> by large technology companies, including Apple, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft ended the TestFlight beta of its xCloud app</a> because Apple wouldn&#8217;t approve the game streaming service. Today, the conflict came to a head when Epic Games, the maker of the hugely popular Fortnite, filed a private antitrust suit against Apple.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">In hindsight, the series of events that unfolded today appear to be part of a carefully orchestrated plan leading to the filing of the lawsuit. The day began with Epic offering in-game currency at a discount in the iOS version of the game <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">using Epic&#8217;s own payment system</a> in clear violation of App Store guidelines. Apple responded by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pulling the game from the App Store</a>. In a statement to The Verge, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote4\"><p>\n  Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services.</p>\n<p>  Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem - including its tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we&#8217;re glad they&#8217;ve built such a successful business on the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p5\">Shortly after the game was pulled from the App Store by Apple, Epic filed a 62-page lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging violations of the federal Sherman Act and a similar California state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"p6\"><a href=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to Epic</a>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote7\"><p>\n  Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion, Apple&#8217;s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology monopolist in history.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p8\">The complaint alleges anti-competitive conduct in connection with the distribution of iOS apps and in-app payment processing. According to Epic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote9\"><p>\n  But for Apple&#8217;s illegal restraints, Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices, which would allow iOS users to download apps in an innovative, curated store and would provide users the choice to use Epic&#8217;s or another third-party&#8217;s in-app payment processing tool.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p10\">The lawsuit concludes with a request that the court issue an injunction prohibiting the behavior, declaring it unlawful, and ordering other equitable relief to prevent Apple&#8217;s actions and remedy the alleged harm that has been caused.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">The lawsuit was followed by an in-game video parodying Apple&#8217;s famous 1984 commercial asking Fortnite gamers to &#8220;Join the fight to stop 2020 from becoming &#8216;1984.&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\" id=\"div12\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?version=3&#38;rel=1&#38;fs=1&#38;autohide=2&#38;showsearch=0&#38;showinfo=1&#38;iv_load_policy=1&#38;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"p13\">Based on the timing of events, it appears that Epic intentionally violated Apple&#8217;s app review guidelines to pick a fight. I would be surprised if backroom negotiations didn&#8217;t precede the filing of the lawsuit, but regardless, Epic&#8217;s actions raise another line of attack against the way Apple runs the App Store. What&#8217;s different about Epic&#8217;s lawsuit is that it&#8217;s brought by a well-funded, private company that has hired <a href=\"https://www.cravath.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of the biggest global law firms</a> to fight for it. Barring a quick settlement, this will cost both companies a lot of money and subject Apple to bad publicity over a much longer period of time than a day&#8217;s testimony in front of Congress ever could.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

We’ve written about several of <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/marvis-review-the-ultra-customizable-apple-music-client/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/miximum-smart-apple-music-playlists-on-ios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apps</a>, but the earliest and highest profile debut of the year was <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/soor/id1439731526?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soor</a>, a meticulously designed client that distinguishes itself with a fully customizable Home view for displaying only the content sections you care about –&nbsp;choosing from things like Recently Added, Playlists, Recently Played, New Releases, For You, and more. Federico reviewed <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/soor-a-third-party-apple-music-client-for-iphone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the launch version of Soor</a> and found a lot to like about its unique approach, but he ultimately was disappointed by the absence of certain functionality that’s readily available in Apple’s first-party Music app.</p> \n<p id=\"p3\">In the nearly 18 months since launch, Soor has improved in significant ways. I adore the throwback <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_Flow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cover Flow</a>-inspired playback screen, where you can smoothly swipe through a horizontal row of artwork, and time-synced lyrics are now available via a tight <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musixmatch-lyrics-finder/id448278467?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Musixmatch</a> integration. There are still certain functions you’ll need to pop into Apple’s Music app for, sometimes due to Apple Music API limitations that Soor’s developer can do nothing about, and other times because the app simply doesn’t offer certain features yet – AirPlay 2, for example, is still unsupported. Overall though, for my uses at least, Soor covers enough core Apple Music functionality that there’s very little I need the first-party client for. The biggest absent feature on my wishlist is an iPad app, which I’m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanmays/status/1285812955779461120?s=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glad to see is on the roadmap</a>, especially since iPadOS 14 will soon offer a much-improved first-party Music app.</p> \n<p id=\"p4\">Soor’s improvements have made it a truly compelling alternative to the first-party Music app, and today’s 2.0 update continues that trend by offering two big new features: magic mixes and release alerts. The latter is a nice addition, but the real pillar of this update is magic mixes.</p> \n<p id=\"p5\">\n <!--more--></p> \n<h2 id=\"magic-mixes\">Magic Mixes</h2> \n<p id=\"p6\">Magic mixes enable building highly customizable and dynamic mixes using a variety of Source, Filter, Sort, and Limit options. Since these mixes are dynamic, as new music is released or Apple makes changes to its editorially-curated playlists, your mixes update to reflect an ever-changing roster of matched songs.</p> \n<p id=\"p7\">To get started creating a magic mix, you can tap the new magic mix icon in the mini player, or hit Manage Sections at the bottom of the app to create a mix from there.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/AB223E44-2588-4E0C-BC7F-A4B018CB6338-1595434087617.png\" alt=\"The vast array of magic mix configuration options.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The vast array of magic mix configuration options.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p9\">Sources for a magic mix can include content both from your Library and from the full Apple Music catalog. On the Library side, you can choose from albums, playlists, loved songs, recently added or recently played music, and more. When choosing sources from the Apple Music catalog you’ll see the full roster of For You<sup id=\"fnref-63915-1\"><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=63915#fn-63915-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1</a></sup> suggested playlists and albums to choose from, plus all of the top playlists curated by Apple’s staff, or you can select hot or top songs, new releases, or even a custom search term. These source options make magic mixes more powerful than anything I’ve encountered in another music app, and the experience of choosing them is delightful thanks to some design polish in the selection process.</p> \n<p id=\"p10\">Once you’ve chosen sources for your magic mix, you can move on to filtering rules, which includes 15 different categories of filters spanning things like play count, date added, like state, explicit, title, artist, and much more. The whole process is intuitive as you select a filter then choose the rule for it using parameters like ‘Equals,’ ‘Not Equal To,’ ‘Contains,’ ‘Before’ or ‘After,’ and more.</p> \n<p id=\"p11\">The final two configuration points for your mix are sort and limit options. Limit simply lets you enter a number of tracks that you want to limit the mix to. Sort options, on the other hand, are plentiful, including things like last played, play count, release year, genre, duration, shuffled, and more. These can then be set in ascending or descending order.</p> \n<p id=\"p12\">All of this detailed walkthrough is necessary to explain how you can build some wild, fine-grained custom mixes in Soor. The fact that they update dynamically is just icing on the cake.</p> \n<p id=\"p13\">One of my favorite details about the magic mix feature is that it pairs so beautifully with Soor’s section-based design. Every magic mix you create is accessible as its own Home section, giving you the ability to customize the app’s layout with the music you care about most. For example, I’ve created an extremely simple mix that takes a single playlist and sorts its track order by release date, from newest to oldest. This mix meets a desire I’ve long had for this particular playlist, and now lives at the top of my Home layout.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/FED2E2C2-BA00-4985-AF61-C4426651B92C-1595434090869.png\" alt=\"My simple, but valuable Discovered magic mix.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">My simple, but valuable Discovered magic mix.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p15\">The playlist is called Discovered, and it’s where I save new singles I come across that I want to listen to later. Much of my music listening is album-oriented rather than centering on playlists, but Discovered is my most frequently listened to playlist because it’s where all singles go for me, whether they’re from artists I already love or new ones I find. I never add singles to my Library because they would clutter up my Recently Added screen, so instead I save them to this playlist and keep the ‘Add Playlist Songs’ Music toggle in iOS’ Settings app disabled, ensuring that tracks added to playlists won’t populate my Library.</p> \n<p id=\"p16\">The problem with this approach for saving new singles is that the first-party Music app offers no option for changing the way a playlist is sorted. So what ends up happening with my ever-growing Discovered playlist is that I hear the oldest songs, which live at the top of the playlist, far too often, while my most recently saved songs remain neglected and often forgotten at the bottom of the list. I could always use Music’s shuffle feature, but that still isn’t quite what I want, which is to simply reverse the order of the playlist so the newest songs play first and the oldest ones play last. With Soor’s ‘Release Year’ sort option set in descending order, a magic mix solves this problem. And I can not only access my reverse-order Discovered playlist as its own dedicated Home section in the app, but I can also quickly kick off playback via a shortcut.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3A59BBB9-25DA-4B6D-9210-2CAEE8E023B0-1595434093798.png\" alt=\"Adding a magic mix as a shortcut via Siri, then to my Home screen.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Adding a magic mix as a shortcut via Siri, then to my Home screen.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p18\">That’s right, every magic mix you create comes with Shortcuts support. There’s an Add to Siri button at the bottom of each magic mix edit screen, so you can start playing your custom mix with a simple Siri voice command, or by running a shortcut from the Shortcuts app. Personally, I’ve created a Home screen shortcut that kicks off my Discovered magic mix, but another thing I may consider in the future is adding it to Shortcuts’ widget. Whether run from the Home screen, or a widget, or the full Shortcuts app, or even Siri, I love how easy it is to start playing magic mixes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"release-alerts\">Release Alerts</h2> \n<p id=\"p19\">I won’t go too deep into this, since it’s a feature already available elsewhere such as in Apple’s Music app and the excellent dedicated utility, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MusicHarbor</a>. But it’s still worth noting that Soor now offers alerts for new releases from artists you follow, and the implementation details are quite nice.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/78F5B6D7-9007-4FC1-9E26-1BC538867C7C-1595434094668.png\" alt=\"Soor offers a feature-rich release alert system.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Soor offers a feature-rich release alert system.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p21\">There’s a new bell icon in the top-right corner of Soor’s interface which you can tap to view and manage release alerts. This screen will show you all artists you currently follow, provide the option of searching for new artists to follow or choose from suggestions that are based on your playback history. The only missing option I’d want is the ability to automatically follow all artists in my Library.</p> \n<p id=\"p22\">Besides serving as a way to find artists to follow, this screen also displays all recent releases from artists you’re following, upcoming releases from those artists, and also a list of upcoming releases from all artists. It’s a full-featured release tracking experience that’s elegantly integrated into the app.</p> \n<p id=\"p23\">Soor presents new releases not only in the dedicated hub behind the bell icon, but also at the top of the app’s Home view. If there are multiple new releases, they’ll be presented in a stack that you can cycle through by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanmays/status/1285802405678821376?s=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">swiping on the displayed music artwork</a>, and there’s an X button in the top-right corner of the banner to dismiss it.</p> \n<p id=\"p24\">Soor’s release tracking feature more closely resembles the power of MusicHarbor than the minimalist approach of Apple Music, which gives it a unique edge since unlike MusicHarbor, it’s built into a full-fledged Apple Music client, mitigating the need to keep an extra utility app around.</p> \n<hr id=\"hr25\">\n <p id=\"p26\"><strong>iOS 14 Disclaimer:</strong> If you’re using the iOS 14 beta, currently there’s a bug with the Apple Music API that causes certain iOS 14 users to see a ‘Session Expired’ message when pulling new data from Apple Music, which happens upon every app launch. I haven’t had this problem myself at all, but Soor’s developer Tanmay explained to me that it only affects iOS 14 users who newly install the app, not existing users. He <a href=\"https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4956912038707200\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has a radar filed</a>, so hopefully the problem will be fixed in a new iOS 14 beta soon, but if you’re new to Soor and using iOS 14, this is a short-term annoyance you should be aware of.</p> \n <hr id=\"hr27\">\n  <p id=\"p28\">Soor’s debut last year brought a lot of design elegance and worked exactly like my ideal music app would: a single-screen interface with fully customizable sections, so that I see only the music I care about most and it’s all quickly accessible. The app did come with drawbacks though, as Federico’s initial review highlighted.</p> \n  <p id=\"p29\">With its evolution over the last 18 months, Soor has become more compelling than ever. There’s still no iPad app or AirPlay 2, and there will always be certain features exclusive to Apple’s first-party client, but if the strengths of Soor – UI customization, magic mixes, and a beautiful, top-tier design that extends from the Home view to the playback screen – are of greater value to you than its drawbacks, then the app might just become your new favorite Apple Music client.</p> \n  <p id=\"p30\">Soor is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/soor/id1439731526?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available on the App Store</a> as a one-time purchase.</p> \n  <div class=\"footnotes\" id=\"div31\"> \n   <hr>\n    <ol>\n     <li id=\"fn-63915-1\"> Which Apple has now rebranded Listen Now in iOS 14.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=63915#fnref-63915-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">↩︎</a> </li> \n    </ol>\n   </hr>\n  </div> \n  <hr />\n  <h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3>\n  <p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.</p> <p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Introduced as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UThGcWBIMpU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an unnamed &#8216;sneak peek&#8217; in 2018</a>, Mac Catalyst offered the promise of a simple and efficient way for iPad developers to bring their apps to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100 million Mac users</a>. The reality was that it can be hard to transition an app from an iPad to a Mac, and the results weren&#8217;t always great.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">The trouble was the result of a confluence of multiple factors, including:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul4\"><li>The first iteration of Mac Catalyst used iPad design conventions in places that felt out of place on the Mac</li>\n<li>There was too little documentation</li>\n<li>Excitement surrounding SwiftUI left developers wondering whether Apple was committed to Mac Catalyst</li>\n</ul><aside class=\"aside aligncenter aside-narrow\" id=\"aside5\"><h3 class=\"pre-title\" id=\"supported-by\">Supported By</h3>\n<h2 id=\"concepts\">Concepts</h2>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/icon-1595254554207.png\" alt=\"\"></center>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://concepts.app/download?utm_source=macstories)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer\">Concepts</a></strong>: Sketch, Note, Draw</p>\n</aside><p id=\"p6\">WWDC 2020 was different. Apple introduced what was effectively Mac Catalyst 2.0 with its Optimized for Mac initiative, a separate Mac Catalyst path that follows Mac conventions more closely but requires more work. The company also built Messages and Maps, two of its flagship apps, using Mac Catalyst, demonstrating a deeper commitment to the technology than ever before. The result is a brighter future for Mac Catalyst that clearly has a role to play alongside SwiftUI and Apple&#8217;s other frameworks.</p>\n<p id=\"p7\">To understand where Mac Catalyst is heading, though, we first need to understand where it has been over the past two years.</p>\n<p id=\"p8\"><!--more--></p>\n<h2 id=\"just-check-the-box\">Just Check the Box</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2018-02-06-05-680-1596036268188.png\" alt=\"Project Sneak Peek.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Project Sneak Peek.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p10\">Mac Catalyst has had a short but unusual history. In a rare move for Apple, the company provided a sneak peek of the then-unnamed project at WWDC in 2018. At the same time, Apple also revealed that it had used an early version of Catalyst to bring Stocks, News, Voice Memos, and Home to the Mac from the iPad.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">The reception from observers and developers was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17438450/apple-marzipan-mac-ios-apps-port-mojave-appkit-uikit-future-platform-software\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lukewarm</a>. None of those first four Catalyst apps involved the kind of complex UIs commonly found in many Mac apps, and all of them broke longstanding Mac design conventions. That left a lot of developers and users uneasy about Catalyst&#8217;s future, but most were willing to wait to see what Apple had in store for third-party developers before judging the technology too harshly.</p>\n<p id=\"p12\">WWDC 2019 helped to a degree, but not enough. On the one hand, Apple revealed Podcasts, an imperfect but more complex and Mac-like app built with Mac Catalyst. On the other hand, though, Apple didn&#8217;t update the original four Catalyst apps, leaving observers to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902020/macos-catalina-review-apple-music-podcasts-catalyst-ipad-apps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">question the company&#8217;s commitment</a> to Mac Catalyst.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Untitled%207%400-1596037377768.5x.png\" alt=\"The original four Mac Catalyst apps &#8211; Stocks, News, Voice Memos, and Home &#8211; have been joined by five others.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The original four Mac Catalyst apps &#8211; Stocks, News, Voice Memos, and Home &#8211; have been joined by five others.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p14\">Apple also <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oversold Catalyst at WWDC 2019</a> as a simple checkbox transformation from iPad to Mac app. It turned out to be anything but that. It was certainly possible to get many apps up and running relatively quickly by checking a box in Xcode, but <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-important-role-design-plays-in-building-a-mac-catalyst-app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refining those apps</a> so they fit in reasonably well on the Mac was another story altogether. Creating something that fits in with AppKit-based apps <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/pcalc-developer-james-thomson-shares-his-catalyst-experience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">took substantial work in many cases</a> due to the inherent limits of Catalyst itself.</p>\n<p id=\"p15\">When Catalina shipped in the fall, the result was a raft of new Mac Catalyst apps, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/12/catalyst_two_months_in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many of which weren&#8217;t very good</a>. There were exceptions, which <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/macos-catalina-the-macstories-review/8/#catalyst-apps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I covered in my Catalina review</a> and subsequently, but with developers stuck fighting with their tools and having to recreate controls that weren&#8217;t made readily available, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/catalysts-rough-edges-risks-alienating-developers-and-users-alike/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many were left wondering what the future held for Mac Catalyst</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p16\">The cloud over Mac Catalyst was exacerbated by the debut of SwiftUI, Apple&#8217;s declarative system for building modern UIs using the Swift programming language. Introduced alongside Catalyst in 2019, Apple made it clear that its ultimate goal was to allow developers to use SwiftUI to build interfaces across all of its platforms. The message was clear: <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2019/06/07/the_next_era_ends_the_swift_era_begins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SwiftUI was the future</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p17\">SwiftUI managed to muddy the waters to the point that John Gruber declared that Mac Catalyst had been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/06/11/simmons-swift-era\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">effectively deprecated before it left the gate</a>. With Catalyst clearly a transitional technology and SwiftUI poised to rule the future, developers were left wondering if adopting it was a gamble on a dead-end, also-ran technology. It didn&#8217;t help that <a href=\"https://tla.systems/blog/2019/10/08/catalytic-converter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developer documentation was sparse</a>, the original four Mac Catalyst apps sat largely untouched throughout 2019, Podcasts, though better than earlier Catalyst releases, was aided by non-public APIs, and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/macos-will-soon-support-universal-apps-enabling-a-single-purchase-for-mac-iphone-and-ipad-apps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">universal purchases couldn&#8217;t include Mac Catalyst apps</a> until earlier this year. As a result, many developers decided to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3405122/catalyst-reveals-apples-struggle-with-the-future-of-the-mac.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sit out the first wave of Catalyst apps</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p18\">What WWDC 2020 confirmed was that the addition of Mac Catalyst apps to universal purchases a few months earlier was a sign of things to come. Apple was listening to developers about the pain points of developing Catalyst apps and making adjustments. The company was refining its message and providing a clearer path forward for developers.</p>\n<p id=\"p19\">In hindsight, revealing Mac Catalyst as a &#8216;sneak peek&#8217; in 2018 may have been a mistake. The desire to send a message to developers that a new era of alignment between the iPad and Mac was coming is understandable. However, without a full understanding of the implications of SwiftUI or knowledge of the upcoming design changes to Big Sur and the Apple Silicon transition, too much of the story remained a black box that left developers perplexed. It&#8217;s a good example of how little is to be gained from a secretive company like Apple revealing an isolated part of its plans for the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mac-catalyst-comes-into-focus\">Mac Catalyst Comes Into Focus</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Untitled%208%400-1596037508714.5x.png\" alt=\"Third-party Mac Catalyst apps highlighted at WWDC 2020 during the keynote.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Third-party Mac Catalyst apps highlighted at WWDC 2020 during the keynote.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p21\">What has changed is that the paths to the future of development across all of Apple&#8217;s platforms have finally come into focus. WWDC 2020 confirmed developers&#8217; hunch that SwiftUI is the future. However, that comes with a big caveat. SwiftUI may be the future, but it&#8217;s also not entirely ready for the present. As far as SwiftUI has come in its first year, there are still limitations that mean it isn&#8217;t a workable solution for every new app, let alone the millions of existing apps.</p>\n<p id=\"p22\">SwiftUI&#8217;s future is bright, and I fully expect that we will see more new apps written with it. Still, we&#8217;re a long way from putting the final nail in Mac Catalyst&#8217;s coffin. The present is very much a hybrid world where Mac Catalyst will play a crucial transition role in making the Mac app ecosystem as vibrant as that of iOS and iPadOS and driving developers to adopt the current-generation iPadOS features that translate to Mac features.</p>\n<p id=\"p23\">Several aspects of WWDC 2020 and its immediate aftermath should give any developer who sat out the first wave of Mac Catalyst apps confidence to build an app with the technology. One is the new features that address many of the early complaints leveled against Catalyst, including:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul24\"><li>An AppKit date picker which has replaced the tumbler-style picker that&#8217;s been around since the first iPhone was released</li>\n<li>Pull-down menus</li>\n<li>Keyboard event enhancements and cursor control</li>\n<li>tvOS focus event handlers</li>\n<li>Photo extensions</li>\n<li>Better window and tab management</li>\n<li>A color picker and color well</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p25\">Apple has also finally addressed the lack of documentation with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/mac-catalyst\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a terrific tutorial and other materials</a> that debuted just last week.</p>\n<p id=\"p26\">Also included in the enhancements to Mac Catalyst is a new mode that Apple calls &#8216;<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10056\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optimized for Mac</a>,&#8217; which changes the default scaling of an iPad app from 77% to 100% and results in crisper text and graphics. Optimized for Mac also includes Mac-style controls that match macOS control sizes. These will require developers to make adjustments in many cases to ensure that the controls don&#8217;t break the layout of their apps. Buttons, pickers, sliders, and other controls are equivalent to what developers would get when building an AppKit app, and some controls like checkboxes are only available to Optimized for Mac apps. The trade-off for a Mac Catalyst app that hues more closely to traditional conventions is that building an Optimized for Mac Catalyst app requires more work than a standard Mac Catalyst app.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screenshot%202020-06-22%2018-1592874941210.46.31.png\" alt=\"'Optimized for Mac' added many more Mac-like control options for Mac Catalyst apps.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">&#8216;Optimized for Mac&#8217; added many more Mac-like control options for Mac Catalyst apps.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p28\">Between standard Mac Catalyst apps and ones that are Optimized for Mac, the landscape Apple has covered is substantially broader than what was covered with the first iteration of Mac Catalyst. The quick and expedient way of building a Mac Catalyst app that&#8217;s scaled to 77%, so its UI elements work better, has gained meaningful improvements. Now, though, there&#8217;s an entirely different, alternative path developers can take that provides a much more Mac-like product. It&#8217;s more work to be sure, but it also demonstrates that Apple cares about more than just making it easier for developers to add iPad apps to the Mac. It&#8217;s also about giving developers the tools to make a Mac Catalyst app that&#8217;s at home on the Mac. At the same time, though, the simpler Mac Catalyst path acknowledges the practical reality that creating an Optimized for Mac version isn&#8217;t always economical.</p>\n<p id=\"p29\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10143\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020&#8217;s Mac Catalyst story</a> is a more complicated narrative than &#8216;check a box, and your iPad app becomes a Mac app,&#8217; but it&#8217;s also one that tells a more compelling story that fits with the alignment of the Mac and iPad as mutually reinforcing systems. The same thing can be seen in the redesign of macOS. The facile view is that the Mac is being remade in the iPad&#8217;s image. However, this perspective ignores the migration of features like sidebars, Finder-like file navigation, and cursor support from the Mac to the iPad. Each is evolving based on an overarching vision of creating a familiar but platform-specific UI that helps make users comfortable on any of Apple&#8217;s devices without learning different interactions and design metaphors where they don&#8217;t serve the unique qualities of each device.</p>\n<p id=\"p30\">To that end, the iPad and Mac now share idioms like the sidebar, toolbars, and app icons that vary depending on the platform but are instantly recognizable. That lowers the barrier for consumers who started on the iPad, making it easier for them to use a Mac too.</p>\n<p id=\"p31\">Apple also did a better job at WWDC 2020 of articulating Mac Catalyst&#8217;s position among the company&#8217;s many developer tools. Developers with a mature AppKit version of an app are not being encouraged to abandon AppKit. Those frameworks may not be the long-term future of Mac development, but they aren&#8217;t being deprecated any time soon. Likewise, iPadOS developers with an established UIKit app aren&#8217;t being encouraged to leave UIKit behind. Instead, iPad developers have options that range from running their app directly on Apple Silicon-based Macs with no changes to building standard Mac Catalyst apps and Optimized for Mac apps. It&#8217;s a practical, realistic acknowledgment that the economics of moving an app from the iPad to the Mac vary widely, so the development paths should too.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/apple_macos-bigsur_maps-curatedguides_06222020-1592874779715.jpg\" alt=\"Maps and Messages are both Mac Catalyst apps in macOS 11 Big Sur.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Maps and Messages are both Mac Catalyst apps in macOS 11 Big Sur.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p33\">However, of all the announcements at WWDC this year, the one that should give developers and users the most confidence that Apple is committed to Mac Catalyst is that it rebuilt Messages and Maps with Mac Catalyst. Both apps are central to the iPhone and iPad experience but had fallen behind on the Mac. Even in the early betas of Big Sur, Messages and Maps are solid, faithful Mac versions of their iPad counterparts. They are also substantially deeper, feature-rich apps than the early Mac Catalyst apps Apple released.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr34\"><p id=\"p35\">A catalyst increases the rate of change in a chemical reaction. In retrospect, it&#8217;s an aptly descriptive name for Mac Catalyst. Apple has been experimenting with ways to jump-start the Mac app market for years. The Mac App Store and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-redesigns-mac-app-store-with-ios-like-editorial-focus-new-product-pages-and-more/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its subsequent redesign</a> didn&#8217;t seem to move the needle substantially, but I remain optimistic that Mac Catalyst will do so <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple-rolls.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with time</a>. Ultimately SwiftUI, which is rapidly developing on a parallel path, will likely eclipse Catalyst, but that reality is still years away because of millions of UIKit apps already on the market. Rewriting those apps for AppKit makes no sense for many developers, as demonstrated by the lack of iPad apps that have made their way to the Mac already. SwiftUI isn&#8217;t a realistic alternative for most of those apps, either.</p>\n<p id=\"p36\">With Mac Catalyst, there&#8217;s an opportunity for developers to significantly increase the potential size of the market for their apps without taking much risk. Some of those new Mac Catalyst apps will be subpar, just like there are junky iPhone and iPad apps. I&#8217;m not a fan of lousy apps, but I&#8217;m still glad that the barrier to entry to the App Store is low. It opens opportunities for newcomers who might otherwise find it too hard to get started.</p>\n<p id=\"p37\">I expect Mac Catalyst will have the same effect. More developers than ever before have access to the Mac App Store. That will create competition that pushes all developers to make better products for their users, regardless of the underlying technology used to build it. In my book, that is how it should be and the best way to strengthen the Mac as a platform.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr38\"><p id=\"p39\"><em>You can also follow our 2020 Summer OS Preview Series through our <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/os-preview-2020/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dedicated hub</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/os-preview-2020/feed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subscribe to its RSS feed</a>.</em></p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Sometimes that means turning the rules upside down and inside out like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flipflop-solitaire/id1256860418\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flipflop Solitaire</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/really-bad-chess/id1109751921\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Really Bad Chess</a>. Other times, it means removing the tedious and boring parts of games to breathe new life into them, which is precisely what he and Jack Schlesinger have accomplished with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1489118195\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Good Sudoku</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">I started with Good Sudoku as a novice. I&#8217;ve played sudoku before and knew the rules, but it&#8217;s not a game that has ever grabbed me and stuck. As a result, as much as I&#8217;ve enjoyed Gage&#8217;s other games, I approached Good Sudoku with a healthy dose of skepticism. However, after several days of playing the game, I&#8217;ve found that stripped of its tedious aspects, sudoku is engaging to the point of being addicting and a whole lot of fun.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\"><!--more--></p>\n<p id=\"p5\">If you haven&#8217;t played sudoku before, the basics are pretty simple. It&#8217;s played on a 9 x 9 grid subdivided into smaller 3 x 3 grids. The object is to fill the grid with the digits 1 - 9, so there&#8217;s only one of each numeral in a row of 9 squares, a column of 9 squares, and the 3 x 3 sub-grids called houses.</p>\n<p id=\"p6\">Each board is filled in with some numbers to start, and the rest of the squares are left blank for you to fill in, which is where things get tricky. As Gage and Schlesinger explain on the game&#8217;s website, sudoku puzzles are generated programmatically, allowing puzzle creators to dial in their difficulty. Gage and Schlesinger built a sudoku generator that created the over 70,000 puzzles in the game, but they didn&#8217;t stop there. Instead, they chose to run the puzzle generation AI in the background as you play, allowing the game to offer insights, tools that improve the experience, and hints, all of which remove the most frustrating aspects of the game.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/B848107D-EF4C-4E59-85E2-A3F3A78FFA51-1595420297258.png\" alt=\"Good Sudoku uses a dedicated number pad and a system to show you your options.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Good Sudoku uses a dedicated number pad and a system to show you your options.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p8\">Good Sudoku uses a dedicated onscreen number pad for filling out puzzles, a note-taking system, and hints to help you learn increasingly sophisticated techniques for solving puzzles. By default, tapping on a number in the number pad highlights every instance of that number in the puzzle and the other squares affected by it, leaving only the open spots for the number unmarked. However, this can be turned off or adjusted in settings.</p>\n<p id=\"p9\">Also, tapping on a blank square in the puzzle displays just those digits of the number pad that can be played in that square. The combination of tools is powerful and feels a little like cheating. Still, even if you begin playing with a simple trial and error approach as I did, the assistance that Good Sudoku&#8217;s tools provide allows patterns to begin to emerge even for beginners. Instead of feeling like work, where my job is to check and recheck which numbers are still available in each column, row, and house, I found myself exploring the relationship between the way the numbers were laid out on the grid and considering strategies for solving them.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/B884778D-2BB9-423E-A4C1-B28B641AC822-1595420055707.png\" alt=\"Good Sudoku&#8217;s focus mode and its note-taking system make it easy to keep track of possible solutions.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Good Sudoku&#8217;s focus mode and its note-taking system make it easy to keep track of possible solutions.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p11\">Good Sudoku includes a note-taking system too.

Also, Accent Notes and Cross-Out Notes can be used to eliminate specific numbers from consideration or to assure you that a number goes in one of a couple of squares.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/96AC5B95-61FC-4127-8FB3-B42B28F25C71-1595419484413.png\" alt=\"Good Sudoku includes multiple levels of difficulty, resources for learning new puzzle-solving strategies, and daily challenges with leaderboards.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Good Sudoku includes multiple levels of difficulty, resources for learning new puzzle-solving strategies, and daily challenges with leaderboards.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p13\">If you back yourself into an unsolvable corner, Good Sudoku lets you know and can rewind your moves to the first spot where the puzzle can still be solved. There&#8217;s also an introduction to the basics of how to solve puzzles, help tips throughout, and an entire section called Improve that&#8217;s dedicated to demonstrating strategies for solving puzzles. Coupled with puzzles divided across multiple levels of difficulty and modes, three daily challenges that get harder throughout the week, and global leaderboards, Good Sudoku is a rich, deep puzzle game that will grow with you as your skills develop, keeping the game fun and challenging</p>\n<p id=\"p14\">I&#8217;m a big fan of Good Sudoku&#8217;s design too. It shares a similar aesthetic to previous releases by Gage that combine a focused and clear look with excellent sound design, music, and haptic feedback on the iPhone, all of which create a welcoming environment for concentrating on each puzzle.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\" id=\"div15\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjG9_PI5S-8?version=3&#38;rel=1&#38;fs=1&#38;autohide=2&#38;showsearch=0&#38;showinfo=1&#38;iv_load_policy=1&#38;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"p16\">Sudoku puzzles can be incredibly challenging, which is a big part of why they are fun and so popular. The downside, though, is the tedium. It&#8217;s a barrier to newcomers getting started and a layer that masks the satisfaction of seeing the deeper strategies that can be employed to solve a difficult puzzle.</p>\n<p id=\"p17\">Good Sudoku removes barriers to enjoying sudoku with excellent design. It&#8217;s not just that it looks good. It does, but Good Sudoku accomplishes something that you don&#8217;t see too often. It takes an established game and makes it better by applying computing power so that it doesn&#8217;t get in the way of enjoying the game. Whether or not you&#8217;re a fan of sudoku, an experienced player or a novice, Good Sudoku is a fresh take on a classic game that is worth checking out.</p>\n<p id=\"p18\">Good Sudoku <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1489118195\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can be downloaded for free from the App Store</a>.

Between TV shows, movies, music, books and other reading, podcasts, and videogames, the supply of content far outstrips the time I have by an order of magnitude. As a result, I&#8217;m both picky and often slow to getting around to some media, especially games, which often require a substantial time commitment. The trouble is that it&#8217;s easy to lose track of games I&#8217;ve read about, that someone has recommended, and even those that I&#8217;m in the middle of playing if I can&#8217;t play regularly.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">I&#8217;ve approached the problem in a lot of different ways. Text notes are a quick and portable solution but lack detail. Apps designed to track lots of different kinds of media have the benefit of consolidating everything in one place, but often don&#8217;t accommodate features specific to one kind of media. As a result, I&#8217;ve recently gravitated to apps that focus on just a single type of media. For videogames, that solution has been <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GameTrack</a>, an app that we&#8217;ve covered in our <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club MacStories</a> newsletters in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\"><!--more--></p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/231C5250-34E5-40AA-AEA1-73AE47E8C62E-1596795907551-1596816726626.png\" alt=\"GameTrack&#8217;s Backlog, Archive, Wish List, and Ranked lists.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">GameTrack&#8217;s Backlog, Archive, Wish List, and Ranked lists.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p6\">The app&#8217;s tab bar is divided into four sections: Lists, Discover, Activity, and Statistics. GameTrack comes with three default lists: Backlog, Archive, and Wish List. If you subscribe you can add more lists, including ranked lists which are a fun way to pick your favorite games for a system, genre, or franchise. Backlog can be further divided into Now Playing, Play Next, and Collection, and Archive into Finished, Completed, and Abandoned. Wish List is organized by release date and can send you notifications when the games listed there become available. You can pick the platform you&#8217;re playing on when more than one is available, and games on your lists can be sorted and grouped based on multiple criteria too.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9400BCF7-FAC3-4D7D-A23E-99EB22D1033D-1596796253404%202-1596817161692.png\" alt=\"Each game&#8217;s entry includes details drawn from the IGDB database and rich artwork.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Each game&#8217;s entry includes details drawn from the IGDB database and rich artwork.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p8\">Each game in a list includes a summary of it pulled from the IGDB database, screenshots, trailers, ratings, release date, genre, critic rating, and other metadata. GameTrack lets you move items between lists and customize entries with alternate artwork from a game&#8217;s detail view. You can also specify a completion percentage and take notes, which is a handy way to save a URL of a game&#8217;s review, leave reminders to yourself about what you want to do next in a game, or remember who recommended it. Editable metadata is also accessible from a context menu when you long-press on a game&#8217;s artwork. I only wish that URLs saved in notes were links that would open in Safari View Controller so I could view them easily in-app.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/FA5300DD-2994-42E6-ADB6-5F76C79078C0-1596796516400-1596817287430.png\" alt=\"The Discover tab is a terrific way to browse games.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The Discover tab is a terrific way to browse games.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p10\">The Discover tab allows you to browse games in the IGDB database in categories like Featured, Popular, Upcoming, Recent, Hyped, and Just Added, as well as by platform and a handful of popular franchises. You can also search for games that you want to add to your lists from this tab.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/C7F88E3B-362C-44E5-ADB6-BCC7009B230F-1596797001359-1596817395326.png\" alt=\"Activity includes games you and the people you follow have added to GameTrack.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Activity includes games you and the people you follow have added to GameTrack.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p12\">The Activity tab serves as a reverse chronological log of games you&#8217;ve added and to which lists. Here, you&#8217;ll also find entries of anyone you follow. The feature is powered by Sign In with Apple and syncs across devices. I haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time with the Follow feature, but account activity along with lists syncs quickly and reliably and it&#8217;s easy to find and follow someone if you know what their username is, or if they share a link to their profile with you. It would be nice to discover users you don&#8217;t know that have similar tastes in games, but that isn&#8217;t currently possible.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\">Despite the discovery limitations, I like the Activity feed a lot because it provides an opportunity to connect with other users to share the games you love. The app also allows you to share individual games using the share sheet, but I&#8217;d like to share full lists of games with friends and collaborate on lists too.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3C4FC41E-45E9-44B0-AC1D-DDA50561DC23-1596797283127-2-1596817800383.png\" alt=\"From the Account tab, you can share your profile, view recent activity, and browse statistics about your games.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">From the Account tab, you can share your profile, view recent activity, and browse statistics about your games.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p15\">The final tab is a combination Account and statistics view. From here, you can view followers and who you follow, access settings, and view and share or delete posts in your activity feed. You can also see statistics about the games in your lists broken down by categories like genre, platform, personal ratings, and your history of archiving games. Finally, you can log into your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam accounts to track information from them as well.</p>\n<p id=\"p16\">Settings are worth mentioning, too, because GameTrack is highly customizable if you are a subscriber. You can change the app&#8217;s theme, layout, tint color, and app icon, personalizing it to suit your tastes. I particularly like the new default icon and alternative icons, which have added depth and a touch of realism to the icon&#8217;s D-pad. Of course, the original version is available too, in multiple colors and special variants. Settings is also where you can manage the details of your GameTrack account, connect your Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam accounts, and export your library data.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/4917B2DF-E3B1-4CC0-91C8-D85D8A63971C-1596797572286-1596817596854.png\" alt=\"GameTrack on the iPad.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">GameTrack on the iPad.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p18\">I&#8217;ve primarily used GameTrack on my iPhone, where the colorful game art tiles and slide-up card interface work especially well for navigating lists and searching for games. The tab bar design doesn&#8217;t translate as well to the iPad, where it is split across three columns. If my iPad is connected to a keyboard, the keyboard row often covers up GameTrack&#8217;s tab bar. I can hide the keyboard row, but it still makes navigating GameTrack too difficult. Also, as you switch tabs, the content in the second and third tabs don&#8217;t update until you select something new, which can lead to confusing or irrelevant information being displayed in them. On the iPad, GameTrack would probably benefit from considering the new sidebar layout offered with iPadOS 14, which is something developer Joe Kimberlin-Wyer has said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joekw/status/1281308221806981121?s=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">he is working on</a>.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr19\"><p id=\"p20\">Despite a somewhat awkward iPad design and some wishes here and there, I love GameTrack. Now, when someone recommends a game, I quickly drop it into my Wish List for the next time I&#8217;m in the mood for a new game and have the time to play it. That&#8217;s a much better system than buying a game on a whim and letting it sit for months before I try it for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"p21\">I&#8217;ve also found myself browsing the Discover tab a lot, too, especially when I get behind on the videogame news that I usually follow. It&#8217;s a quick way to get a fix of the latest popular games and watch a few trailers, which open in Safari View Controller so I don&#8217;t have to leave the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p22\">Videogames have been one of my outlets as I&#8217;ve spent more time at home during the global pandemic. They&#8217;ve served an important entertainment role, allowing me to escape from the constant barrage of bad news for a little while. GameTrack has reduced the friction of starting a new game, even if I&#8217;ve been away from gaming for a while, by always having something ready on one of my lists, which I love. If you&#8217;ve been looking for a way to organize your gaming life, you can&#8217;t go wrong with GameTrack.</p>\n<p id=\"p23\">GameTrack <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is available on the App Store</a> as a free download. Custom icons and lists, ranked lists, tints, themes, layouts, and automatically updating release dates for games are all part of a $0.99/month or $7.99/year subscription.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

They don&#8217;t want to leave news curation up to an algorithmic service like Apple News, or a social media platform like Twitter or Facebook. They also care about tools like filtering controls, and tweaking the reading experience to their preferences. For such a user, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiery-feeds-rss-reader/id1158763303?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiery Feeds</a> may be a natural choice due to its abundance of supported RSS services and settings to tweak, along with some key pro features. Today, Fiery Feeds is better prepared to meet the needs of that kind of user thanks to a pair of important additions: full-text search and saved searches. Throw in optimized iPad pointer support, plus a new native article rendering option, and the latest Fiery Feeds update is a compelling one.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\"><!--more--></p>\n<h2 id=\"search-improvements\">Search Improvements</h2>\n<p id=\"p4\">Saved searches are a feature commonly found in Mac apps but rarely their iOS and iPadOS counterparts. Fortunately, Fiery Feeds is the latest exception to this trend, debuting a new saved search option that&#8217;s available even on mobile-first platforms. Saved searches can be created with a simple tap on the plus button that appears any time a search is initiated, and they appear in your feed list in a dedicated section.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/31711bf7-72ce-4a91-b135-595e47b70cba.png\" alt=\"Creating a saved search.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Creating a saved search.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p6\">Saved searches would be pretty pointless were it not for another key addition to this release: full-text search. You can now enter any search term to have Fiery Feeds scan not only the title but also the body of every link in your feeds, surfacing matching articles from the flood of all your subscriptions. Full-text search and the ability to save searches seem like features designed with my &#8220;quintessential RSS user&#8221; in mind: they provide even more nuanced content controls than ever before, so you can spend your time viewing exactly the content you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ipad-pointer-support\">iPad Pointer Support</h2>\n<p id=\"p7\">On the iPad, today&#8217;s update brings full support for iPadOS&#8217; pointer. When you have a trackpad or mouse connected to your iPad, the pointer will adapt to different interface elements in Fiery Feeds. It will snap to buttons so you can click them more easily, morph into a text input line in search boxes, let you right-click items in your feed list or article list to open context menus, and the pointer will even highlight feeds or articles it&#8217;s hovering over. Most of this is standard protocol for pointer-optimized iPad apps, with the sole exception of the hovering behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"p8\">When I first started using the iPad&#8217;s pointer in iPadOS 13.4, I occasionally found that certain interface elements I&#8217;d expected to react with a highlighting or dimming effect when I hovered over them offered no such response; notes in a note list, for example, or folders in a folder list. Apple set the standard for this behavior and third-party apps have mostly followed suit. Fiery Feeds does things differently, however, causing cells in your feed list and article list to change color shades in response to the pointer&#8217;s presence. While it&#8217;s been interesting seeing an implementation that more closely models what I originally expected, the app has confirmed for me that I think Apple made the right call in limiting the pointer&#8217;s visual activity. I&#8217;ve found the extra visual cue more distracting than helpful in use, and wish there was an option to disable it. Ultimately though, I think it&#8217;s a matter of personal taste, and some users may find Fiery Feeds&#8217; approach exactly what they&#8217;ve been looking for from the iPad&#8217;s pointer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"miscellany\">Miscellany</h2>\n<p id=\"p9\"><strong>Native article rendering.</strong> Fiery Feeds&#8217; developer Lukas Burgstaller has built a native rendering system that parses a site&#8217;s HTML itself and uses native OS elements like UIImages and UILabels to display an article&#8217;s content. I prefer viewing articles with their source site&#8217;s design retained, so this doesn&#8217;t impact me personally, but for those who prefer the app&#8217;s uniform layout for articles&#8217; content, this change should result in improved performance.</p>\n<p id=\"p10\"><strong>Search in settings.</strong> One of my favorite details about Fiery Feeds is how customizable it is. This means the app, by necessity, has a big and complex settings screen, and before now it was easy to get a little lost in there. Now, there&#8217;s a search box in settings to help you quickly find the function you&#8217;re looking to tweak.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr11\"><p id=\"p12\">None of today&#8217;s changes to Fiery Feeds are revolutionary, but they do make the app tangibly better in key ways. Full-text search and saved searches can be extremely valuable tools, especially for users who subscribe to a lot of feeds. I&#8217;ve praised the app before for its three-column layout on iPad, so it&#8217;s great to see pointer support keep that iPad app current with modern technologies. And the miscellaneous improvements, including a fundamental change in how articles are rendered, are welcome too.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\">Fiery Feeds is available <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiery-feeds-rss-reader/id1158763303?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on the App Store</a> as a free download, with an optional Premium subscription to unlock advanced features such as the new saved searches and full-text search.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Although the new 27-inch iMac&#8217;s design is identical to the existing model, this is still a significant update compared to the iMac it replaces.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">According to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple&#8217;s press release</a>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote4\"><p>\n  &#8220;Now more than ever, our customers are relying on the Mac. And many of them need the most powerful and capable iMac we&#8217;ve ever made,&#8221; said Tom Boger, Apple&#8217;s senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing. &#8220;With blazing performance, double the memory, SSDs across the line with quadruple the storage, an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a better camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics, the 27-inch iMac is loaded with new features at the same price. It&#8217;s the ultimate desktop, to work, create, and communicate.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p5\">Last updated in March 2019, the new iMac features 6 and 8-core 10th generation Intel CPUs that can reach speeds of up to 5.0GHz with Turbo Boost. Storage is all SSD now with transfer speeds up to 3.4GB/s when launching apps and large files. There&#8217;s also an 8TB SSD option for the first time, which is four times the storage available in the previous model. Until today, the standard configurations of the 27-inch iMac came with Fusion drives.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://bddf794624247cea6a0b-b4761d2ba0154d0278c36dbf2b3c114d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/imac.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p7\">The new iMac has been upgraded to AMD Radeon Pro Series 5000 graphics. The display of the iMac is the same resolution as before, but now, it comes with a new nano-texture option first seen in the Pro Display XDR, which provides a low-reflection, matte finish, and it supports Apple&#8217;s True Tone technology. The new all-in-one desktop also includes a T2 chip for boot and data security, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, and improved speakers and microphones.</p>\n<p id=\"p8\">Apple&#8217;s other iMacs received smaller updates today too. SSDs are now standard in the 21.5-inch model, although a Fusion Drive is still an option. Also, a 10-core Intel Xeon processor is now standard in the iMac Pro.</p>\n<p id=\"p9\">Today&#8217;s updates are in line with Apple&#8217;s statements during WWDC that the company had additional updates to Macs based on Intel CPUs in the pipeline. Although Macs with ARM processors are on the way later this year, Apple has not revealed which models will be converted to ARM first. Consequently, if you need a new desktop Mac, it&#8217;s still worth considering the Intel-based models, especially the new 27-inch iMac, which is substantially improved over its last iteration.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Not only are the app&#8217;s 3D soundscapes of a high sound quality and perfectly paired with headphones, especially noise-cancelling ones like AirPods Pro, but Portal also engages your other senses to help you focus, sleep, or mentally escape when you can&#8217;t physically escape. One way the app does this is through its visual scenes, which provide each different sound portal with a location&#8217;s snapshot that your imagination can lock on to. Another way is via Philips Hue integration, which enables your home lights to automatically sync to different colors and brightness settings that fit best with the portal environment you&#8217;ve chosen. This combination of immersive sound with visual scenes and real-world correlation via smart lights makes Portal a uniquely holistic experience.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\">I&#8217;ve been using Portal ever since January, but even more since March, when my ability to physically leave home was drastically scaled back. I don&#8217;t use it when sleeping, but it&#8217;s certainly helped me both focus and escape, providing the much-needed feeling of being in a new environment even when my physical surroundings are left unchanged. For these reasons, as well as the presence of features like breathing exercises in the app, I find it appropriate to call Portal not just an ambient noise utility, but a wellness app too.</p>\n<p id=\"p5\">Today, Portal is launching a big 3.0 update that leans into its core strengths by providing more of what makes the app great: its portals. Previously the app offered a total of 19 portals, and today that number more than doubles as 25 new portals have been added for a total of 44 &#8211; and more are on the way.</p>\n<p id=\"p6\"><!--more--></p>\n<p id=\"p7\">With any other ambient noise app, a large batch of new sounds would be a nice addition, but not necessarily worth writing a new article about. But with Portal, since each of the 25 additions represents a real location that&#8217;s been captured and optimized for the app, and paired with a custom Hue preset, adding 25 portals was clearly a huge undertaking. That level of effort shines through with all of the app&#8217;s portals.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/01f7ebe4-a6a7-4506-a79e-2e47401147ea.png\" alt=\"A few of the new portals in version 3.0.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">A few of the new portals in version 3.0.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p9\">The set of 25 new portals is split into two collections: 14 portals from the Scottish Highlands, which were captured at wintertime, and 11 from the Slovenian Alps in summer. The app&#8217;s new content library says that a Devon &#38; Cornwall collection will be added soon too.</p>\n<p id=\"p10\">Speaking of the content library, the huge expansion of portals offered necessitated a change in how you navigate the app. Previously, all available portals resided in a simple horizontal row you could swipe through. Even with the 19 previous portals, though, this was a bit unwieldy to navigate. Now you start with a limited selection of portals, and browse new ones to add from the content library. There&#8217;s even editorial content that&#8217;s been added as you browse, so you can not only see what the location looks like and hear what it sounds like, but also read some additional context about it.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">I&#8217;ve yet to come across a portal I didn&#8217;t enjoy, but it&#8217;s nice that you can now keep only the portals you value most. Another positive change is that all your saved portals can be rearranged in the order you prefer, making the navigation system of swiping between portals function better than before.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9c871268-e75c-4345-aece-cdb8c7e29b74.png\" alt=\"Adding a portal to your collection.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Adding a portal to your collection.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p13\">Along with the big portal expansion and plans for continued new collections being added, Portal is introducing a membership plan today. You can still download the app for free and enjoy six portals perpetually at no cost; gaining access to the full content library, however, will require a $29.99 annual subscription for new users following a 7-day free trial. Membership revenue is intended to fuel continued creation of new portals as well as enable the app to expand beyond the iPhone and iPad &#8211; Mac and Apple TV versions are in the plans for Portal&#8217;s team. I hope support for iPad multitasking is on the roadmap too.</p>\n<p id=\"p14\">As part of this membership rollout, Portal&#8217;s developers are providing some of the most generous transition offers I&#8217;ve seen for existing users of the app. If you&#8217;ve previously paid for Portal in any way, either through unlocking the app&#8217;s In-App Purchase or buying it when it was a paid app, you&#8217;ll receive a lifetime membership entirely free. And if you&#8217;ve previously downloaded the app at all, even though you&#8217;ve never paid for it, you can unlock a lifetime membership for a one-time In-App Purchase of $9.99.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr15\"><p id=\"p16\">Portal has proven essential to my peace of mind and productivity this year as I&#8217;ve spent most of my time in a small New York City apartment, trying to work while my wife does the same just a few feet away. Combined with my AirPods Pro and noise cancellation, the app has been a dependable escape and focus tool. Both for work and relaxation, it&#8217;s hard to beat the uniquely immersive experience Portal provides. If you ever find yourself in situations &#8211; whether at home, at the office, or elsewhere &#8211; when you need to create the feeling of being transported elsewhere, but can&#8217;t actually leave, I can&#8217;t recommend Portal highly enough.</p>\n<p id=\"p17\">Portal is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/portal-focus-sleep-escape/id1436994560?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available on the App Store</a> for iPhone and iPad.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-launches-web-based-music-app-as-public-beta/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its first public beta of the Apple Music web player</a>, which after several months came out of beta earlier this year and resides at <a href=\"https://music.apple.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">music.apple.com</a>. On the heels of an updated Music app in this fall&#8217;s releases of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and more, the company isn&#8217;t delaying keeping its web player in-sync with the app versions. A new public beta of Apple Music for web can be accessed now at <a href=\"https://beta.music.apple.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beta.music.apple.com</a>, sporting a design to match the changes seen in the forthcoming macOS 11 and iPadOS 14, and a new Listen Now page that replaces the prior For You option.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">The design refresh doesn&#8217;t bring major changes, just aesthetic tweaks to elements like the sidebar. Listen Now represents the most substantial update, but it still works similarly to the former For You page. It contains collections of recommended albums and playlists based on your listening activity, alongside Apple Music&#8217;s algorithmic playlists like New Music Mix and Chill Mix. You&#8217;ll also find Recently Played, New Releases from artists in your Library, and a new prominent section called Top Picks. After using Listen Now in the OS betas for the last couple months, I&#8217;ve grown to prefer it over For You, despite there being relatively few differences between the two. Having Top Picks front and center, for example, is a better choice for me than For You&#8217;s placement of the algorithmic playlists up top, since I rarely listen to those.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\">It&#8217;s great to see that Apple Music&#8217;s web player will be updated on the same cycle as its apps.

Schiller will retain oversight of the App Store and Apple Events, and continue reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook, but most of his current responsibilities will shift to Greg (Joz) Joswiak, who takes over the title of senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">Here&#8217;s Schiller on this significant day of transition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote4\"><p>\n  &#8220;It has been a dream come true for me to work at Apple, on so many products I love, with all of these great friends &#8212; Steve, Tim, and so many more,&#8221; said Schiller. &#8220;I first started at Apple when I was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned changes in my life. I&#8217;ll keep working here as long as they will have me, I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p5\">Tim Cook remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote6\"><p>\n  &#8220;Phil has helped make Apple the company it is today and his contributions are broad, vast, and run deep. In this new role he will continue to provide the incredible thought partnership, and guidance that have defined his decades at Apple&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p7\">Schiller has been one of the most visible members of Apple&#8217;s team for a long time, most notably owning primary responsibility for introducing new hardware at Apple keynotes, such as the latest iPhone models each year. His expected absence from future such occasions will mark a stark shift for the company.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/B23B1602-D05B-4744-BE8A-D50AA1B8A904-1596561809760.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p9\">Joswiak, who takes Schiller&#8217;s former role, is no unfamiliar face himself. He has over two decades of leadership experience within Apple, and in recent years has become a regular presence at Apple events as well. Despite being a major force within the company, however, Joswiak&#8217;s presence on the executive team represents a new level of leadership for him, and come with major new responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"p10\">After many years of stability at the highest levels of leadership, time is finally catching up with Apple&#8217;s executive team. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/jony-ive-to-leave-apple-to-form-new-design-firm-and-sabih-kahn-named-svp-of-operations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">departed the company</a> last summer, just a few months after Angela Ahrendts <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-retail-chief-angela-ahrendts-leaving-company-replaced-by-deirdre-obrien/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vacated her role as SVP of Retail</a>. While today&#8217;s news follows a different pattern, since Schiller is remaining with the company despite his reduced role, so much change at the top of the organization feels very new for the modern Apple era.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">As someone who began following Apple closely only about a decade ago, not long before the passing of former presentation chief Steve Jobs, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of Schiller product introductions and am really going to miss his presence for many keynotes to come.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Many restaurants have been unable to offer indoor dining, and the lack of a commute as much of society adjusted to work-from-home life provided the opportunity to spend more time in the kitchen. Bread baking became <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/health/bread-baking-health-benefits-coronavirus-wellness/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a popular habit</a>, but so did home cooking in general. All of this has brought an influx of new entrants to cooking.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">I&#8217;m not new to cooking, but I&#8217;ve nonetheless found myself in the market for a better solution for recipe management, meal planning, and cooking walkthroughs. The app I&#8217;ve found best suited for my needs is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-cooking-companion/id1461650987?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crouton</a>, from developer Devin Davies.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\">Crouton offers a handful of valuable aids for cooking, but the feature at the center of it all is the app&#8217;s recipe management system. Once you have recipes stored in the app, you can view those recipes in a well-designed, intuitive format, but you&#8217;ll also be able to easily assign recipes to your weekly meal plan, add ingredients to your grocery list, or be guided through step-by-step instructions while cooking.</p>\n<p id=\"p5\"><!--more--></p>\n<p id=\"p6\">To get started adding recipes, there are a few options available: you can create new recipes via manual entry, import recipes from <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paprika</a>, or import recipes from the web. I used the Paprika importer my first day with the app and it saved me a lot of time. Since then, my primary method of adding recipes has been via web imports. While there&#8217;s unfortunately no share extension or action extension to do this directly from Safari, Crouton&#8217;s web importer is nearly as pain-free an experience. Copy the URL for a recipe you found online to the clipboard, then open Crouton and you&#8217;ll see a pop-up offering to import that recipe into your collection. You can modify any details you&#8217;d like, but in my experience the web importer has done a solid job on every try.</p>\n<p id=\"p7\">Recipes can be sorted into folders you create, otherwise they all live in the default &#8216;All Recipes&#8217; folder. One nice touch is that recipes can be stored in multiple folders at once, making it more like a tagging system than a traditional folder approach. It&#8217;s an important detail since plenty of recipes don&#8217;t fit neatly into a single category.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/738c6ca4-b066-4f94-97ba-217831b75c3a.png\" alt=\"Crouton on iPad features a two-panel layout.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Crouton on iPad features a two-panel layout.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p9\">My two favorite aspects of Crouton are its intuitive modern design for parsing recipes and the ease of adding those recipes to a meal plan.</p>\n<p id=\"p10\">On a recipe&#8217;s detail screen, everything is neatly organized in a layout that makes sense. Rounded rectangles are used to house each of the different blocks of data available for recipes, such as prep and cook times, the ingredients list, and numbered step-by-step cooking directions. As someone who considers himself barely more than a cooking novice, Crouton&#8217;s playful aesthetics help make recipes feel more approachable to me.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">Another thing I appreciate about the recipe detail screen is that it&#8217;s not over-cluttered with features you may not care about; rather, every feature has been thoughtfully added and fits well into the layout of the page. Those features include the ability to scale a recipe&#8217;s ingredients for the number of people you&#8217;re feeding, hit the play button to enter cooking mode and get one instructional step on-screen at a time, tap the shopping cart item to easily add select ingredients to your grocery list, and share the recipe in a variety of formats &#8211; the PDF option even lets you customize the document&#8217;s design and contents.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/fb039a5f-45a8-4d05-9b9d-ad6bbbc3197f.png\" alt=\"Cooking mode is great on the iPad, where ingredients are visible on the left and instructions on the right.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Cooking mode is great on the iPad, where ingredients are visible on the left and instructions on the right.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p13\">Speaking of cooking mode, the most natural way to cycle through each instructional step is to swipe through them, or use the arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen. But it&#8217;s worth noting that there&#8217;s a hands-free mode too on devices featuring the TrueDepth camera system. Developer Devin Davies has implemented a clever way of using the TrueDepth camera&#8217;s face detection features such that you can wink at your device to have it cycle through cooking steps. A right wink moves to the next step and a left wink moves backwards. So if you can set your compatible iPhone or iPad Pro at a level where it can see your face well, this is a convenient way to keep dirty hands away from your device. You can enable this feature via the eye icon in the top-right corner of cooking mode.</p>\n<p id=\"p14\">Meal planning has a dedicated tab in Crouton&#8217;s tab bar, and consists of a simple list of current and upcoming days in descending order. Tap a day and you&#8217;ll see your collection of recipes, sorted into their appropriate folders, for you to choose from. You can add either a single recipe to a day, or multiple recipes to cover not only the main entree but also any sides and/or dessert you plan to prepare. There&#8217;s nothing innovative about the way any of this works, but there doesn&#8217;t need to be &#8211; its simplicity is its strength.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/b6b9430d-bcb8-45a0-b0cb-402b6dcd33bb.png\" alt=\"Recipe folders (left) and the meal planner with a web recipe import pop-up (right).\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Recipe folders (left) and the meal planner with a web recipe import pop-up (right).</p></div>\n<p id=\"p16\">I don&#8217;t use the grocery function of Crouton, but it&#8217;s worth noting that it&#8217;s very easy to add ingredients from your recipes to the in-app Groceries tab, which can also hold grocery items you manually add. The best part is that this tab can be synced with Reminders, so that the contents of your grocery list in reminders is reflected in Crouton as well, and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"p17\">Finally, Crouton comes equipped with the sort of system features you would expect from a modern app. Dark mode support enables automatic theme switching, context menus are used throughout the UI, and you can choose from a selection of alternate app icons for your Home screen. Near and dear to my heart, there&#8217;s an iPad client that supports Split View and Slide Over multitasking, and the app also takes good advantage of the larger display with a two-panel layout. I&#8217;ve found the iPad app especially useful while in the process of cooking, since I can sit the device in Magic Keyboard atop our kitchen island and swipe through cooking directions one page at a time.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr18\"><p id=\"p19\">Crouton makes meal planning easy, provides a beautiful way to store and view your recipes, and plays a key role in the cooking process. I&#8217;m not someone who cooks more than once or twice a week, so it&#8217;s possible that for someone more active in the kitchen there are advanced features missing that I&#8217;m unaware of, but I&#8217;ve found that Crouton offers exactly what I need in this type of app. It&#8217;s modern, keeps things simple in a good way, and offers valuable utility with style.</p>\n<p id=\"p20\">Crouton is a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-cooking-companion/id1461650987?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free download on the App Store</a>, with a one-time In-App Purchase available to remove recipe storage limits.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

The company is already carbon neutral today for its global corporate operations, and this new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have net zero climate impact.</p>\n<p>  &#8220;Businesses have a profound opportunity to help build a more sustainable future, one born of our common concern for the planet we share,&#8221; said Tim Cook, Apple&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;The innovations powering our environmental journey are not only good for the planet &#8212; they&#8217;ve helped us make our products more energy efficient and bring new sources of clean energy online around the world.

With our commitment to carbon neutrality, we hope to be a ripple in the pond that creates a much larger change.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p3\">Achieving carbon neutrality for its corporate operations was a nice milestone for the company, but this new commitment appears far more challenging. Apple works with third-party suppliers and manufacturers all around the world to build its devices, and fulfilling this new goal depends a lot on those third parties. It will be interesting to see over the next decade all of the different actions that will be taken to find success in carbon neutrality, but the report of Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/28/kuo-no-charger-in-iphone-12-box/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">including fewer accessories in the box with new iPhone purchases</a> certainly seems like it would help.</p>\n<p>→ Source: <a href='https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/' target='_blank'>apple.com</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 14:48:14 +0000","feedId":526,"bgimg":"https://56243e3f6f46fe44a301-deabeb5f3878e3553d0b065ea974f9bf.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/256px.png","linkMd5":"f069b217b323b81a76eb0b8743ce4437","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-54-46-345_901ee973c59d45b7.webp","metaImg":"https://56243e3f6f46fe44a301-deabeb5f3878e3553d0b065ea974f9bf.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/256px.png","destWidth":256,"destHeight":256,"author":"Ryan Christoffel"},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:54:40","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:54:40","title":"Due for Mac Modernized with New Design and Features","link":"https://www.macstories.net/?p=63948","description":"<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Untitled%400-1595785955853.5x.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p2\">A full-fledged task manager is terrific for many projects, but if you dump your entire life into one, it can quickly become a cluttered mess.

However, with today&#8217;s update, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/due-reminders-countdown-timers/id524373870\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Due for Mac</a> joins the iOS version with a fully-modern design and slate of new features, putting it on par with the outstanding iOS version, which <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/due-adds-modern-shortcuts-support-with-new-reminder-creation-parameters/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I&#8217;ve covered</a> <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/due-30-adds-pure-black-theme-custom-snooze-times-and-haptic-feedback/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the past</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\"><!--more--></p>\n<p id=\"p5\">If you&#8217;re not familiar with Due, the app&#8217;s strength is the ability to create reminders and timers quickly. Reminders can be one-off or repeating events and can be entered using natural language syntax that auto-populates the due date and time field. According to the developer, Due&#8217;s natural language engine has been improved with today&#8217;s version 20.1.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screenshot%202020-07-28%2007-1595941291032.59.43.png\" alt=\"Due detects dates and times and gives you options for how to treat them.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Due detects dates and times and gives you options for how to treat them.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p7\">My favorite touch here is that when as you type a due date or time into a new reminder, Due provides keyboard shortcuts to set the date and time and then remove the date text you typed, set the date but leave the text in the reminder, or ignore the typed date text altogether. I use these options to do things like set reminders that contain a deadline in the description but will go off in advance of the deadline. For example, I can set a reminder to &#8216;Publish article at 10 am&#8217; ignoring &#8216;10 am&#8217; and then typing &#8216;9:45 am&#8217; and using that as the time for an alert.</p>\n<p id=\"p8\">Another of Due&#8217;s hallmarks is the ability to auto-snooze reminders and timers. For important tasks that need to be completed on a schedule, auto-snooze is terrific because it will remind you at regular intervals that an item is due or a timer finished running until you shut it off. Rescheduling a reminder is simple, too, using keyboard shortcuts, the right-click menu, or menu item to delay it 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Untitled%202%400-1595787137788.5x.png\" alt=\"The difference in design between Due before (left) and after (right) its update is striking.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The difference in design between Due before (left) and after (right) its update is striking.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p10\">The difference between the old version of Due and version 20.1 is apparent immediately upon opening the app for the first time. Due has dispensed with the top and bottom window chrome. Instead of a toolbar at the top of the window, there&#8217;s a narrow sidebar for navigating the app&#8217;s sections and creating new reminders or timers. A search field also spans the top of the window, which is a terrific addition for quickly locating a reminder or timer if you&#8217;ve got an extensive collection of either.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Untitled%202%400-1595786685919.5x.png\" alt=\"Reminders are organized into four temporal categories that are collapsible.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Reminders are organized into four temporal categories that are collapsible.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p12\">Reminders are now organized automatically by due date into four categories: Today, Tomorrow, Next 7 Days, and Future. Each category can be collapsed with the disclosure triangle next to its heading, allowing you to focus on one section at a time, which is another nice touch for those with long lists of reminders. Readability is also enhanced by the ability to adjust text size in the app&#8217;s Preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\">Due&#8217;s redesign extends to its use of typography and color too. Each reminder category features big, bold titles that break up your list of reminders into meaningful sections. The default theme is Vanilla Lilac and features a light purple sidebar and section text against a light window background. The app includes another light and two dark themes, all of which I like a lot: Lavender, Slate Dark, and Pure Black. There&#8217;s also an option to switch themes based on your Mac&#8217;s light/dark mode settings that lets you pick whatever combination of light and dark themes you prefer.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screenshot%202020-07-26%2008-1595788561970.08.45.png\" alt=\"Due is highly customizable.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Due is highly customizable.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p15\">The redesign of Due is a significant leap forward and an excellent illustration of the importance of design. Mac app design had long since passed by the previous version of Due. With version 20.1, Due not only feels at home among other modern Mac apps, but it&#8217;s easier to navigate and visually superior to the previous version&#8217;s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"p16\">Due&#8217;s update on the Mac runs deeper than just its new design, though. There are new features too. Due can be run exclusively from the menu bar if you prefer that to seeing its icon in your dock. I try to limit the number of apps in my menu bar, so it&#8217;s not a feature that I&#8217;ll use, but it&#8217;s a nice option to have. Instead, I run Due as a standard dock-based app that launches on login and use a custom global keyboard shortcut to quickly bring the app to the foreground.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screenshot%202020-07-26%2013-1595788347371.14.15%400.5x.png\" alt=\"Like the iOS version, Due for Mac supports gestures.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Like the iOS version, Due for Mac supports gestures.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p18\">The app has also added gesture support, allowing users to swipe left on a trackpad with two fingers to mark a reminder as complete and swipe further to delete it. The same gesture is used in timers to reset a countdown or delete a timer. Bulk editing is available now too. Simply highlight several reminders at once to mark them all as complete, reschedule or delete them, or change their alert and auto-snooze settings.</p>\n<p id=\"p19\">Due for the Mac has adopted the same sort of business model as its iOS and iPadOS counterpart. The Mac app is a separate $14.99 purchase from the iOS and iPadOS version and comes with one free year of updates from the date of purchase. After that, for an additional $9.99/year, you can purchase the app&#8217;s Upgrade Pass to receive upgrades for an additional year. If you stop subscribing, any feature updates you get through the subscription will remain available.</p>\n<p id=\"p20\">When I&#8217;m in the midst of a big project, I have a tendency to let other things slide more than I should. I&#8217;ve tried throwing those items into OmniFocus or another task manager I&#8217;m using at the time, but it only makes things worse. Although a task manager ensures that those items won&#8217;t get lost entirely, they have a tendency to clutter my task manager and thus add to a sense of being overwhelmed.</p>\n<p id=\"p21\">It&#8217;s times like this when I turn to Due. Many of the things I drop into the app are one-off reminders. Others are the kind of repeating tasks that are all too easy to forget about if I&#8217;m deep into writing or some other task. However, I also turn to Due for things that absolutely need to be done by a specific time. I use this sparingly, but auto-snooze is a fantastic way to ensure something gets done when it needs to be, especially since it syncs over iCloud so my reminders follow me wherever I happen to be. If you&#8217;ve ever needed a little extra prodding to get something done on time, Due is an excellent solution.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

David Smith summarizes their feedback well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote12\"><p>\n  &#8220;The experience was without a doubt one of my favorite yet.&#160; The clarity and personality of the pre-recorded videos was excellent.&#160; The Labs experience was just as useful as during in-person events.&#160; Even the sense of community felt way better than I would have predicted.&#160; I really liked this format and hope that Apple incorporates most of it in future years.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p13\">In terms of specific announcements, a highlight for Kaya Thomas was App Clips, the new technology that enables small pieces of app data to be accessed on-demand without installing a whole app. Thomas said of the feature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote14\"><p>\n  &#8220;It&#8217;s something I would have never guessed was coming and is a really innovative new experience for helping with discovery of apps. It&#8217;s not a use case that works for every app, but for the apps it does, it will allow developers to worry less about the drop-off rate that comes with the user having to go to the App Store to download your app.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/975996a1-b528-4242-9020-05648c2fb27e.jpeg\" alt=\"App Clips are a new way for users to discover apps.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">App Clips are a new way for users to discover apps.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p16\">Many developers were enthused and surprised by all of the Mac-related news from the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"p17\">Charlie Chapman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote18\"><p>\n  &#8220;Between all the Catalyst improvements, SwiftUI, and iPhone apps coming straight to the Mac with Apple Silicon, it feels like the Mac is being opened up as a platform for iOS developers, and that&#8217;s really exciting. Seeing the Mac get so much love and attention this year was definitely a highlight, and I think we&#8217;re about to see a lot more activity in Mac software than we&#8217;ve seen in a while.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p19\">Becky Hansmeyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote20\"><p>\n  &#8220;I was most surprised by the macOS redesign. I was so focused on the transition to Apple Silicon that it never occurred to me they would drastically change the look of the OS this year. I was also pretty surprised by the automatic availability of iOS apps on the Mac.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p21\">James Thomson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote22\"><p>\n  &#8220;Catalyst got very welcome changes this year, and even a shout out in the keynote. It looks like almost everything I was asking for a year ago has now been added, which is great. And the fact that Apple was using it for Messages, one of their most important apps, gives me confidence I can rely on it sticking around.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/78ee86e2-ab0c-4452-a4d8-6be17e9a937e.jpeg\" alt=\"WWDC brought a lot of exciting Mac changes.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">WWDC brought a lot of exciting Mac changes.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p24\">But there were also, of course, some disappointments. Again there was a lot of commonality among developers, with changes in widget functionality being a common concern. For example, Thomson confirmed he won&#8217;t be able to ship a new widget with the same feature set as his existing one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote25\"><p>\n  &#8220;A lot of people love the existing PCalc widget, and I&#8217;m sad that it will eventually have to go away &#8211; maybe not this year, but probably next, [due to] the new widget architecture not allowing complex interactivity.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p26\">Simon St&#248;vring shared his hope that, with so much happening on the Mac, this would have been the year the platform gained Shortcuts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote27\"><p>\n  &#8220;I felt confident that we would get Shortcuts on the Mac, and with everything else Apple announced this year, I think it would fit right in. We&#8217;ll certainly see more iOS and iPadOS apps coming to the Mac soon, if not because of the new additions to Catalyst and SwiftUI, then because these apps will be available when Macs with Apple Silicon are released &#8211; these iOS and iPadOS apps would come with shortcuts built in.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p28\">Kaya Thomas was let down by another year&#8217;s absence of a key developer tool:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote29\"><p>\n  &#8220;I was most disappointed that there was no announcement of any new continuous integration/delivery tooling. Since Apple acquired Buddybuild a few years ago, every year I&#8217;ve hoped there would be an announcement of what they&#8217;ve done with it. There are a lot of continuous integration/delivery services out there, but it would be incredible to have a complete native solution made for Apple platforms.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"is-apple-listening\">Is Apple Listening?</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/71b83ec0-65e2-496b-be9c-7243af6ba490.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p31\">Apple has a notorious penchant not only for secrecy, but also for doing all of its product work in seeming isolation from the outside world. Users and developers alike are often left wondering if the company truly listens to feedback or not, an issue exacerbated by the fact that it often takes years of behind-the-scenes work for Apple to address such feedback. We all love a good Apple surprise, but for developers in particular, whose livelihood is tied to the choices Apple makes, being left in the dark can be scary.</p>\n<p id=\"p32\">WWDC is usually the prime occasion for Apple to show the development community that it&#8217;s listening, as the company unveils new OS versions, frameworks, APIs, and other tools designed to empower making the best apps possible. Following the 2020 virtual conference I asked developers whether they felt heard by Apple this year. Unsurprisingly their answers varied, and in some cases depended on what those developers were hoping for.</p>\n<p id=\"p33\">Simon St&#248;vring, for example, was encouraged by the significant investment he sees from Apple into areas that are central to his apps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote34\"><p>\n  &#8220;In the past few years I&#8217;ve been working quite a lot with the Intents and IntentsUI frameworks, Apple&#8217;s frameworks that let developers integrate with Siri shortcuts, and it is clear to me that in 2019 and 2020 those frameworks received major improvements to accommodate the needs of developers.</p>\n<p>  Examples include the support for input and output parameters that were added to Shortcuts in iOS 13, which was probably at the top of most Shortcuts users&#8217; and developers&#8217; wish list. Not only did Apple add support for parameters, but they also provided a very flexible solution.</p>\n<p>  Another example is the in-app intent handling that was added to iOS 14. This new API lets developers implement Shortcuts actions that are more powerful than previously, something I&#8217;ve heard several developers wish for since the introduction of Shortcuts in 2018.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p35\">The common tendency to judge Apple&#8217;s progress by its relevance to your own projects highlights the reality that no matter how large the company grows, it can&#8217;t build everything every year. Kaya Thomas echoed this idea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote36\"><p>\n  &#8220;It&#8217;s never 100% disappointment or 100% wishes fulfilled. There were still some disappointments regarding things developers were looking forward to, for example Apple announcing a new CI tool as a follow-up to their acquisition of Buddybuild. On the other hand, the new StoreKit testing capabilities was a long-awaited ask that they finally fulfilled.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p37\">In terms of more general thoughts on how much Apple is listening, I found it interesting how commonality was found among those newer to the development community and those with longer histories working on Apple platforms. Everyone found Apple&#8217;s receptivity to developer feedback generally positive, but mentioned a few areas that can still lead to frustrations.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/ddef53fe-891f-4f0d-8e2d-082b0af50b73.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p39\">Representing that newer wave of developers is Becky Hansmeyer and Charlie Chapman.</p>\n<p id=\"p40\">Hansmeyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote41\"><p>\n  &#8220;I feel like Apple is definitely making an effort to listen to developers more; however, it still feels like there are several layers of corporate policy and bureaucracy (and perhaps stubbornness?) that make addressing developers&#8217; concerns a very slow, frustrating process.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p42\">Chapman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote43\"><p>\n  &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been an Apple developer for very long so I can&#8217;t say for sure, but based on stories of the past it does seems like Apple&#8217;s a little more receptive to feedback from the developer community than they may have been before.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p44\">Long-time developers James Thomson and David Smith see Apple&#8217;s attentiveness as largely the same as the past, but like Hansmeyer and Chapman, their views are generally balanced between optimism and realism.</p>\n<p id=\"p45\">Thomson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote46\"><p>\n  &#8220;[Apple listens] a reasonable amount&#8230;pretty much the same as always. There is an element of &#8220;Apple knows best&#8221; to some of the changes, which you are expected to get on board with or be left behind, but that&#8217;s always been the case. In other areas though, there are definitely things where they have gone beyond what I even imagined they would.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p47\">Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote48\"><p>\n  &#8220;I&#8217;d say that they are listening to developers about the same as always.&#160; They are responsive and helpful in the fine-grained aspects of development, making changes and accommodations to their APIs based on our needs.&#160;But they also don&#8217;t often let the vocal complaints of parts of their development community distract them from their internal vision for the platform.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-unification-of-software-development\">The Unification of Software Development</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/a9b5c3c5-7e78-4041-b933-67e586c51aef.jpeg\" alt=\"Build once, ship everywhere is a theme of modern Apple development.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Build once, ship everywhere is a theme of modern Apple development.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p50\">A common theme of the last two WWDCs has been Apple&#8217;s focus on helping developers more easily build cross-platform apps. In the modern Apple ecosystem, it&#8217;s rare to find an app that&#8217;s iPhone- or iPad-only, and there&#8217;s a shrinking number of Mac-only apps too. Apple may not be merging its software platforms, but it&#8217;s doing a lot to make them work seamlessly in tandem.</p>\n<p id=\"p51\">Becky Hansmeyer remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote52\"><p>\n  &#8220;This year&#8217;s WWDC has made me feel incredibly excited and optimistic about the future of Apple platforms. It finally seems like Apple has a cohesive vision for its platform line-up and a clear understanding of each device&#8217;s particular strengths and roles in people&#8217;s everyday lives.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p53\">David Smith agrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote54\"><p>\n  &#8220;I feel very confident about the direction of Apple&#8217;s platforms right now.&#160; They have provided a cohesive vision for the future of their platforms from the Apple Watch to the Mac Pro.&#160; Many of the puzzle pieces that were required to make this happen have clearly been in the works for years and are now all falling into place.&#160;This foresight makes me feel good about the plans they have going forward and the thoughtfulness with which they are operating.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p55\">Simon St&#248;vring highlights a couple of those puzzle pieces as he echoes these comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote56\"><p>\n  &#8220;There are a lot of very exciting things going on right now. The unification, if not of the platforms then of the frameworks used by developers creating apps for the platforms, is very exciting. Now that we&#8217;re seeing the first year of iterations on SwiftUI and Catalyst, it&#8217;s becoming clear that they&#8217;ll play a big part in the future of Apple&#8217;s platforms. The opportunities for building fully native apps for all of Apple&#8217;s platforms is very encouraging.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"summer-projects\">Summer Projects</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/0544c7fd-505d-4c15-82a0-2fac5e92a8ad.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p58\">As a big fan of the apps made by these developers, I couldn&#8217;t let them go without asking about the things they&#8217;ll be working on over the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"p59\">Kaya Thomas was one of many developers interested in building new widgets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote60\"><p>\n  &#8220;I&#8217;m most excited about widgets, as a developer and consumer. Widgets being written in SwiftUI allows developers who can&#8217;t drop support for older OS versions to still be able to learn and use SwiftUI, which I strongly believe is the future of development for all Apple platforms. We aren&#8217;t limited by just having one widget and we can make them very configurable for our users. I think widgets will allow us to help save our users time by surfacing relevant and timely content right on their Home screens.</p>\n<p>  For We Read Too, I&#8217;m definitely exploring what a useful widget would look like, whether it&#8217;s showcasing the most recently added titles or a user&#8217;s recent favorited books.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p61\">James Thomson is using one of his apps to experiment with things he may want to implement in a different app:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote62\"><p>\n  &#8220;I am currently investigating the best way to build a next generation version of PCalc, and there are multiple paths I could take. Right now, I&#8217;m updating Dice by PCalc &#8211; which is really my small test app for new Apple technologies &#8211; to use the latest Catalyst features to make a more Mac-like experience. I&#8217;ll then see how I feel about using that for PCalc, or if I want to rewrite it all in SwiftUI.</p>\n<p>  If I had an Apple Silicon DTK machine, I couldn&#8217;t tell you anything because of the NDA. But I can say I&#8217;m pretty confident this processor transition will go smoothly for both developers and users, and it will be a lot easier to port existing apps to ARM than it was to go from PowerPC to Intel fifteen years ago.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p63\">Becky Hansmeyer just launched <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yarnbuddy-knit-and-crochet/id1267678125?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a new app</a>, but WWDC has given her plenty of additions to her to-do list:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote64\"><p>\n  &#8220;My latest iOS app, YarnBuddy, is written entirely in SwiftUI. I can&#8217;t wait to update it with a modern UI for the iPad, utilizing the new sidebar, toolbars, date/time pickers and color picker. I&#8217;m also planning to create some widgets, and possibly even bring the app to the Mac using Catalyst.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/c43ad634-7f45-476a-b98a-990d65be1dc4.jpeg\" alt=\"Widgets are on a lot of developers&#8217; to-do lists.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Widgets are on a lot of developers&#8217; to-do lists.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p66\">Charlie Chapman is at work on Dark Noise updates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote67\"><p>\n  &#8220;Dark Noise will definitely get a few improvements thanks to new technology with iOS 14. The new widgets are way better than what I was offering before. In my testing so far, Siri integrations work much better than on iOS 13, and the &#8220;Maybe you wanted&#8230;&#8221; alternative responses were really easy to integrate with. The new Wind Down experience also feels like a pretty obvious fit for white noise apps like Dark Noise.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p68\">David Smith has several major areas of focus moving forward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote69\"><p>\n  &#8220;This year has introduced three new opportunities that I&#8217;m hoping to immediately adopt.&#160;The first is adding iOS widgets to all my apps wherever I can.&#160;Being given access to a user&#8217;s Home screen provides for a whole new level of connection to my users.&#160;I&#8217;m very excited to see where that goes.&#160;</p>\n<p>  Secondly, I&#8217;m really excited by SwiftUI complications on the Apple Watch.&#160; I can enhance my current suite of complications with dramatically better performance and ability.&#160;</p>\n<p>  Lastly, I&#8217;m for the first time interested in trying my hand at making a Mac app.&#160;The toolset previously was just too high of a wall to scale, but this year enough of the pieces have come together that it feels like something I could tackle with some confidence.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"p70\">Finally, Simon St&#248;vring rounds out the list with a very ambitious project slate too:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote71\"><p>\n  &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a handful of things I&#8217;d like to do with my apps over the summer. WidgetKit is an interesting opportunity for Scriptable. I&#8217;m working on a feature that lets users create a script that presents a widget. The script will automatically run periodically on the Home screen to present up to date information. This immediately fulfills a need I have during the summer, as I&#8217;ve created a widget using Scriptable that shows me the pollen count of the day. As a person that has hay fever, that is very handy.</p>\n<p>  The new in-app intent handling is amazing for Scriptable, making it possible to use file bookmarks in a shortcut, process larger images in a shortcut, and generally perform operations that are more memory-heavy in shortcuts. I&#8217;m sure this is going to be a big deal for many Shortcuts utilities out there.</p>\n<p>  The new additions to Catalyst are going to be great for Jayson on the Mac, in particular. I&#8217;m looking forward to replacing Jayson&#8217;s custom implementation of tabs with the native tabbed windows on the Mac.</p>\n<p>  I&#8217;m also very curious to try out the new support for keyboard navigation in both table views and collection views, something I&#8217;ve already implemented myself in Jayson, but if Apple&#8217;s implementation works, I&#8217;m more than happy to replace it with my implementation.</p>\n<p>  Data Jar might also benefit from the new in-app intent handling. I will most likely also see how it can benefit from some of the new system and more modern UI components.</p>\n<p>  I&#8217;m also working on a new app in which I&#8217;ve already adopted the three-column split view. Support for three-column split views was on my WWDC wishlist, so I&#8217;m very pleased Apple has added it this year. I can&#8217;t wait for more iPad apps to adopt this.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<hr id=\"hr72\"><p id=\"p73\">As I reflect on the takeaways from this group of developers, I think 2020 brought not only the most unique WWDC in recent years, but also one of the most important for Apple development. Fueled by the transition to Apple Silicon and a major UI redesign in Big Sur, Apple&#8217;s vision for the future of the Mac &#8211;&#160;the only platform where developers can currently build Apple apps &#8211; is clearer and more exciting than it has been in years. And with evolving tools like SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst, and new cross-platform OS features like redesigned widgets, it appears that Apple is on the cusp of doing something that&#8217;s been a challenge for the company for some time: moving its platforms forward in lock-step, with no platform neglected due to a scarcity of internal resources.</p>\n<p id=\"p74\">Besides surpassing my expectations for what a virtual conference could be, WWDC 2020 also made me optimistic that every Apple platform has a bright, exciting future ahead.

When a workflow is so ingrained that it’s a habit, that’s good because it allows the task to become less about the tools and more about what you’re creating.</p> \n<p id=\"p7\">Paradoxically, though, familiarity can also lead to inflexibility, a resistance to change that undermines the very productivity that the solution enabled in the first place. It’s an inertial force that’s hard to resist, but I think it’s important to push back against it. Not solely for the sake of efficiency, but also to improve the results of your efforts.</p> \n<p id=\"p8\">The trick is knowing when experimentation with new workflows is unproductive fiddling and when it’s meaningful exploration. I’ve seen too many people fall into the trap where improving the process becomes the goal itself.</p> \n<p id=\"p9\">Early last year, I decided I was finished with letting tasks dictate how I work. I work across the Mac, an iPad Pro, and an iPhone all day long. Some jobs are more suited to one device than another, and some I just prefer to do on a particular device. The point is, though, that it’s something I want to be my choice, instead of something foisted on me by the nature of the work itself.</p> \n<p id=\"p10\">I’m fortunate that most of what I do migrates effortlessly from one device to another. Still, I’ve historically had two weekly responsibilities where I’ve felt tied to a Mac.</p> \n<p id=\"p11\">The first was producing the Club MacStories newsletters using Mailchimp’s web app. <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/desktop-class-safari-for-ipad-a-hands-on-look-at-the-difference-the-ipados-update-makes-to-apples-browser/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As I wrote last January</a>, Safari’s updates in iOS and iPadOS 13, which made web apps work roughly the same on my iPad Pro as on my Mac, solved that problem for me.</p> \n<p id=\"p12\">The second Mac-bound task was podcast recording and production. I recognize that there have been ways to accomplish podcasting on an iPad for a while. However, when it comes to recording in particular, I didn’t want to change the way I record episodes to work around the iPad’s limitations for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/11/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the same reasons Federico articulated</a> in <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beyond the Tablet</a>.</p> \n<p id=\"p13\">What made these two tasks frustrating is that they’re both tied to schedules that have limited flexibility. When I was traveling more, that left me with little choice but to take a Mac. I prefer to travel with my iPad Pro, but regardless, I’d rather pick how I work myself, even when I’m at home.</p> \n<p id=\"p14\">I’m not doing as much traveling now, but a recent road trip to Michigan led me to start thinking about my podcasting setup again. As with many trips in the past, I wound up taking my MacBook Pro along, in this case so I could record interviews for <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/174/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an episode of AppStories</a>. The setup was perfectly fine, but it felt like too much equipment for recording a few short interviews. Plus, I took my iPad Pro because I prefer it for writing and wanted to stay connected to mobile data as I wrote a story in the car.</p> \n<p id=\"p15\">Ever since Jason Snell wrote about <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his iPad Pro podcasting setup on Six Colors</a> early last year, and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/11/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federico adapted it for his setup</a> when he can’t use his Mac mini, I’ve wanted to try something similar. What held me back, though, was a combination of the complexity, cost, and infrequency with which I assumed I’d use the setup.</p> \n<p id=\"p16\">I also held out hope that iPadOS 13 or 14 would include improved audio routing that would make it possible to talk on Skype and record a local audio track. That hasn’t happened. Although I expect Apple will add that functionality eventually, it’s been 18 months since Safari solved my Mailchimp problem. With only podcasting standing in the way of my goal of device independence, and no software solution from Apple in the early iPadOS 14 betas, I figured it was time to revisit my hardware options.</p> \n<p id=\"p17\">I wanted a solution that worked equally well when I’m sitting at my Mac or iPad, allowing me to talk over Skype and record myself locally. What I discovered was an incredibly versatile solution that accomplishes in a single device what Snell and Federico cleverly constructed from a field recorder and USB audio interface: <a href=\"https://www.sounddevices.com/product/mixpre-3-ii/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Sound Devices MixPre-3 II</a>.</p> \n<p id=\"p18\">\n <!--more--></p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/mixpre3_ii_angle-1595472141802.png\" alt=\"The MixPre-3 II. Source: Sound Devices\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The MixPre-3 II. Source: Sound Devices</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p20\">There is more than one way to record a podcast, so it’s worth a brief aside about how we record at MacStories. As I already mentioned, Federico covers the same ground in more detail in his <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/11/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beyond the Tablet</a> story, so I won’t belabor it here. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the conversation happens over Skype, and we each record our audio tracks locally. When we’re finished, Federico sends me his track, I line everything up, and edit them to produce the show. We record the Skype call as a reference track and backup, but we don’t use that audio in production. <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/11/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Like Federico</a>, I wanted an iPad solution that replicates what I do on the Mac to cut down on the equipment I need and ensure consistent quality from episode to episode regardless of whether I’m using a Mac or iPad.</p> \n<p id=\"p21\">The trouble with the iPad is the inability to run a Skype call and record your local audio track at the same time without some sort of additional hardware. Snell and Federico’s solutions work around this by recording to an SD card in a <a href=\"https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/zoom-h6-handy-recorder-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zoom H6</a> field recorder, routing the audio from the H6 to a <a href=\"https://www.sounddevices.com/product/usbpre-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sound Devices USBPre 2 audio interface</a>, which handles the Skype call on the iPad Pro, so everyone can hear each other. What’s cool about the MixPre-3 II is that it replicates the same setup in a single, smaller device that costs less and has a few additional features that make it easy to use.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/DSC02068-1595472273801.jpg\" alt=\"One advantage of my MixPre-3 II setup is that it's nearly identical on the Mac and iPad.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">One advantage of my MixPre-3 II setup is that it’s nearly identical on the Mac and iPad.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p23\">It’s not surprising that the solution to what I was looking for is hardware made by Sound Devices. After all, Snell and Federico’s approaches incorporate the company’s USBPre 2 audio interface, which is a terrific piece of equipment. Due to the limitations of iPadOS, though, the USBPre 2 isn’t enough on its own. Snell’s insight that led him to add a Zoom H6 recorder to the mix captures the difference between the MixPre-3 II and the USBPre 2.</p> \n<p id=\"p24\">When I came across the MixPre-3 II, I quickly realized that I couldn’t be sure if the MixPre would suit my needs until I tried it. That’s because there doesn’t seem to be anyone using gear like the MixPre with the iPad Pro and writing about it. Fortunately, Amazon has a generous return policy, so I decided to see if I could figure it out for myself.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Untitled-1595472511897.png\" alt=\"The MixPre-3 II includes a solid set of inputs on its left and right sides.

Source: Sound Devices.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p26\">The MixPre-3 II is an incredibly versatile device, which makes it inherently complex. However, most of the complexity is tucked away in the device’s menu system, accessible from a tiny touchscreen on its front, and once it’s set up, you can ignore the complexity. In addition to the touchscreen, the face of the MixPre-3 II includes three satisfyingly metal knobs for each channel, plus play, stop, and record buttons. The left side of the MixPre-3 has two XLR microphone inputs, an on/off switch which is too hard to access, USB-A and USB-C ports, and a 3.5&nbsp;mm stereo out jack. On the right is another XLR input, a 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack, a 3.5&nbsp;mm Aux/Mic In jack, a micro HDMI port that records codes from a connected camera, and a dial that serves as a volume control for the headphones and an alternate means of navigating the touchscreen UI. The back of the device houses a battery pack that can be used to power the MixPre, and behind it is a slot for an SD card to capture recordings.</p> \n<p id=\"p27\">When the MixPre-3 II arrived, I immediately set it up using my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_YmogFbM19K1C6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Audio Technica ATR2100-USB microphone</a> that I use when I travel, connecting an XLR cable to channel 1 on the MixPre. I grabbed some headphones, connected those, and tethered the MixPre to my iPad Pro using the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with it. What followed was several frustrating hours of experimentation.</p> \n<p id=\"p28\">The trouble was that, although I could record my audio locally to the SD card, the audio of the Skype call still played over my iPad’s speakers and used the iPad’s microphone. It was a perplexing problem because audio from other apps was properly routed over the USB-C cable.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/DSC02091-1595472673226.jpg\" alt=\"The solution for Skype was to route its audio from the USB-C port on the iPad Pro to the MixPre-3 II's Aux/Mic In port.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The solution for Skype was to route its audio from the USB-C port on the iPad Pro to the MixPre-3 II’s Aux/Mic In port.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p30\">The solution was to disconnect the USB-C cable from the iPad Pro and use <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the USB-C to 3.5&nbsp;mm adapter</a> Apple sells for wired headphones plus a 3.5&nbsp;mm to 3.5&nbsp;mm cable from the adapter to the Aux/Mic In jack on the MixPre-3. That properly routed the Skype call, including my voice, to my headphones. This solution comes with one pretty significant caveat. Although the audio is routed over the 3.5&nbsp;mm cable, Skype still uses the internal iPad microphone. The sound quality of conducting a Skype call this way is acceptable. However, it means that if the local track recorded by your external microphone fails, your only fallback is a Skype call where you’ve been recorded over the iPad’s internal microphone, which will not sound as good as it would if your external microphone was used for the Skype call too. Whether this is a Skype, MixPre, or iPadOS limitation isn’t entirely clear, but it’s worth keeping in mind.</p> \n<p id=\"p31\">There are several ways to power the MixPre, including its USB-C port and the battery sled that attaches to the device’s back and can take AA batteries or Sony L-Mount batteries. The MixPre needs 7.5W to operate, so it can be powered by the iPad Pro’s USB-C port, which delivers the necessary power. However, because I’m using the iPad’s USB-C port to route audio to the MixPre, I’ve been powering the MixPre with a USB-C cable connected to a rechargeable battery pack or plugged into the wall with the AC adapter that comes with the MixPre.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/DSC02076-1595472792795.jpg\" alt=\"Unlike the iPad Pro, a USB-C cable connected to my Mac mini handles power and audio routing.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Unlike the iPad Pro, a USB-C cable connected to my Mac mini handles power and audio routing.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p33\">The setup is nearly the same when I’m at my Mac, except in that mode, I attach the USB-C cable to my Mac mini. Because the Mac doesn’t have the same audio limitations as the iPad, I can use Skype’s Mac app to conduct the call and <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Audio Hijack</a> to record my audio just as I’ve always done.</p> \n<p id=\"p34\">I have only recorded a couple of podcast episodes with this setup so far, but I like it a lot already. The hardware is solidly built, and the touchscreen is bright, showing off each track’s levels as I record. Another nice touch is that the channel knobs are ringed with LEDs too, which provide a second visual indicator of your levels.</p> \n<p id=\"p35\">However, one of the biggest advantages is just how little needs to be changed to move from the Mac to my iPad. The USB-C cable needs to be connected to a power source, and I need to add the 3.5&nbsp;mm cable to the Aux/Mic In jack, but that’s it.</p> \n<p id=\"p36\">Because the MixPre handles three separate channels, the adjustments I need to make there are minimal too. I dedicated channel 1 to my microphone, which needs a couple of tweaks when switching between my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002BACBO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_VwogFbJ2ZVVST\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shure Beta 87A</a> and Audio Technica ATR2100-USB microphones. Channel 2 handles audio coming into the Aux/Mic In jack when I’m recording on my iPad, and channel 3 handles audio coming over USB-C when I’m working on my Mac. Whichever channel I’m not using can be turned off. Better yet, I can save my Mac and iPad settings as tiny files that sit on my SD card, where they can be reinstalled if things get messed up.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/mixpre3_ii_flatlay_16x9-1595472953435.jpg\" alt=\"The MixPre-3 II isn't cheap, but it has advantages over other solutions. Source: Sound Devices.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">The MixPre-3 II isn’t cheap, but it has advantages over other solutions. Source: Sound Devices.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p38\">The hybrid solution developed by Snell and Federico took advantage of hardware they already owned, which is perfectly understandable, but purpose-built hardware like the MixPre has several advantages. Two are size and weight, which is important if you’re using an iPad Pro to record on the go. The USBPre 2 is 180 x 100 x 43&nbsp;mm in size and weighs 500 grams. The MixPre-3 II is 144 x 110 x 36&nbsp;mm and the same weight as the USBPre 2, but about 33% smaller by volume. To provide additional context, the MixPre has about the same footprint as a Magic Trackpad and thickness of an Apple TV. When you add the Zoom H6 to the mix, which is 77.8 x 152.8 x 47.8&nbsp;mm and 280 grams, the entire package becomes substantially bigger and heavier than the MixPre alone.</p> \n<p id=\"p39\">Another issue is cost. The MixPre-3 II isn’t cheap at $680. However, it’s nearly half the price of a USBPre 2 and Zoom H6 together. You’re still paying a premium price for pro-level gear, but in the world of high-end audio equipment of this quality and versatility, $680 is a fair price.</p> \n<p id=\"p40\">I’ve discovered a few other advantages to the MixPre that I didn’t anticipate too. The first is that the device records poly WAV files to its SD card. That means it can record multiple channels to a single WAV file that you can later split into separate tracks for editing. This isn’t limited to the usual left and right channels used for stereo sound. I can record the full Skype audio, my local audio, and a track that isolates Federico’s audio simultaneously in both configurations. Federico’s audio is still coming over Skype, so the quality isn’t as good as his locally recorded track. However, if his recording ever fails, having a separate track with just his voice will be an advantage when editing.</p> \n<p id=\"p41\">When I record on my Mac, I record to its internal SSD using Audio Hijack. What the MixPre gives me that I didn’t have with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MIXF2RS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_vCogFbXH4CHAM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tascam US-2x2</a> that I used before is the ability to record on an SD card too. What’s nice about that is it’s a backup that’s completely separate from my Mac’s hardware in the event the Mac catastrophically fails.</p> \n<p id=\"p42\">The backup situation with the iPad isn’t quite as robust, but it’s better than I expected. The MixPre has a USB-A port to which you can attach a small USB thumb drive or even a powered external drive.<sup id=\"fnref-63923-1\"><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=63923#fn-63923-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1</a></sup> As soon as you stop recording on the MixPre, the record button begins to flash, indicating that the file saved to the SD card is being automatically backed up to the thumb drive, while the progress is shown on the MixPre’s display. Having a second copy even if it’s not created simultaneously as you record provides additional protection. Because it’s automatic, you won’t forget to do it either, provided you leave the thumb drive plugged into the MixPre.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/PNG%20image-6C6118389212-1-1595505174632.png\" alt=\"When I'm finished recording, I can switch the USB-C cable from powering the MixPre-3 II to the iPad Pro's USB-C port for transferring files, eliminating the need for an SD card reader.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">When I’m finished recording, I can switch the USB-C cable from powering the MixPre-3 II to the iPad Pro’s USB-C port for transferring files, eliminating the need for an SD card reader.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p44\">I also love that the MixPre can act as a mass storage device. From the System menu on the device, tapping File Transfer switches the MixPre to storage mode. In this mode, moving the USB-C cable from powering the MixPre to plugged into the iPad Pro is a quick way to copy files from the SD card to the iPad without needing to open the battery compartment and remove the SD card. It’s both a convenience that avoids the need for an SD card reader and another way to quickly offload recordings for safekeeping in the cloud and locally on your iPad.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAC50AAAjwCAYAAAAKgq9xAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAM-2%2020-1595505184684.PNG\" alt=\"Dragging files from the MixPre's SD card to a folder in iCloud Drive for processing.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Dragging files from the MixPre’s SD card to a folder in iCloud Drive for processing.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p46\">Sound Devices also makes an iOS and iPadOS app called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sound-devices-wingman/id1137249438\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wingman</a> that works with the MixPre using Bluetooth. The app is in serious need of some design love, but it works well. The app allows me to start and stop recordings, monitor levels, edit file metadata, which is much nicer with the iOS keyboard than the MixPre’s touchscreen, and manage recordings. Especially with a new device like this, I’ve appreciated the ability to prop up my iPad mini nearby while keeping an eye on levels and making small adjustments.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/IMG_0155%202-1595505492118.PNG\" alt=\"Monitoring levels on my iPad mini using Sound Devices' Wingman app.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Monitoring levels on my iPad mini using Sound Devices’ Wingman app.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p48\">It’s fairly common for field recorders, but the MixPre comes with tripod connection points on the unit’s top and bottom too. That allows you to connect a camera when you’re shooting video and using an external microphone. However, simpler alternatives work too. I’m using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D76RNLS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_9IogFb59V0MMQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a small tabletop tripod by Manfrotto</a> to elevate the MixPre off my desk and tilt it up a little, making the display easier to read and creating a <a href=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/DSC02068-1595472273801.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shelter for Pikachu</a>.</p> \n<p id=\"p49\">With a hardware solution to recording locally and monitoring a Skype call, the only other piece of the iPad Pro podcasting puzzle is editing, which is straightforward. My editing process involves file preprocessing for loudness matching and cleaning up audio. I use Mac tools for that step of the process, but they are easily accessed by saving remotely-recorded tracks to iCloud Drive and then opening them by accessing my Mac mini from anywhere with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screens/id655890150\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Screens</a>. I wouldn’t want to edit that way, but preprocessing requires me to open the files and click only a few buttons to start the processing.</p> \n<p id=\"p50\">For editing on the go, I’ve been experimenting with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ferrite</a>. I haven’t produced a released episode with Ferrite yet, but I’ve experimented with it enough to be comfortable that I can. It took a while to find my way around the app. Still, between <a href=\"https://youtu.be/675gW3a0IAc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jason Snell’s excellent video</a> demonstrating how he edits using the Apple Pencil, the app’s terrific help system, and finding the keyboard shortcuts I needed, Ferrite is ultimately easier to use than <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logic Pro X</a>. I like Logic a lot, but it does so much more than the subset of tools I use that Ferrite is a refreshing change. I just wish it existed on the Mac too, so I could edit in similar ways on the iPad Pro and Mac.</p> \n<hr id=\"hr51\">\n <p id=\"p52\"><a href=\"https://www.ruminatepodcast.com/episodes/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I started podcasting in 2015</a> and used a Tascam USB 2x2 for the last four years. It has served me well, but it was never a device that was designed for travel. The Tascam is just a little too big for that. When I traveled, I used a <a href=\"https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/h5-handy-recorder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zoom H5</a> field recorder, but I didn’t use the Zoom regularly, which meant I always had to refresh my memory on how to use it before a trip. The Zoom’s monochrome display is also difficult to read compared to the MixPre.</p> \n <p id=\"p53\">In contrast, I’ll use the MixPre to record 2-3 shows per week, regardless of whether I’m in front of my Mac. That means its menus and settings will become second nature quickly, making recording on my iPad Pro just as effortless and comfortable. That alone makes the MixPre-3 II worth its price to me. The MixPre-3 II liberates podcast recording from a single device, allowing me to choose how I want to record instead of having how I work dictated by the task at hand.</p> \n <div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n  <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/DSC02075-1595473255885.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></img>\n </div> \n <p id=\"p55\">Still, I don’t expect to start recording our shows all over my house or in the backyard. There remains an advantage to recording in a controlled environment sitting in front of my 27-inch display. That isn’t going to change. The point is not to escape from the Mac’s clutches; it’s freeing me up to choose how I work and providing more options when recording at my Mac isn’t possible.</p> \n <p id=\"p56\">If you’d asked me a month ago why my podcasting setup and workflow was the way it was, my answer wouldn’t have been very far from “Because that’s how I’ve always done it.” Fortunately, my awkward recording setup while vacationing rekindled my quest for a device-independent workflow that started last year.</p> \n <p id=\"p57\">The difficulty and expense of solving a problem to work around an iPadOS limitation show that Apple still has work to do to support creative professionals on the iPad. For many people, the MixPre-3 II is probably not worth the cost. But for me, the MixPre is worth it because podcasting is a big part of the work I do each week, and I was no longer willing to wait for a software solution.</p> \n <p id=\"p58\">Workarounds are inherently frustrating. I spent several hours experimenting and studying Sound Devices’ documentation before I was content that the MixPre-3 II would work the way I wanted. I expect Apple will eventually get to iPadOS limitations like the inability to record locally while conducting a VoIP call.

At some point during that very long time, I start getting tired of my wallpaper and look for a replacement, only to quickly give up and conclude that none of the other options are good. The number of wallpapers available on the web is practically infinite, yet these days I scarcely bother to look for anything new.</p> \n<p id=\"p3\">So in some respects I’m both the best and worst person to review <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1518228413\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Wallpaper App</a>, a new Lumen Digital utility for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that does nothing but supply new wallpaper options. Best because I could use a new wallpaper solution, and worst because my passionate condemnation of most wallpaper options makes me inclined to find little of value in a new wallpaper app.</p> \n<p id=\"p4\">I see four primary strengths to The Wallpaper App, all of which give it an advantage over other wallpaper apps or services I’ve tried in the past.</p> \n<ol id=\"ol5\">\n <li>It’s extremely simple to navigate</li> \n <li>All wallpapers are designed to work well behind app icons, widgets, etc.<sup id=\"fnref-64012-1\"><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=64012#fn-64012-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1</a></sup></li> \n <li>You can customize wallpaper colors manually</li> \n <li>Wallpaper size options are tailored for Apple device sizes</li> \n</ol>\n<p id=\"p6\">\n <!--more--></p> \n<p id=\"p7\">Navigation is this easy: swipe on-screen to switch between styles of wallpaper, or tap on-screen to switch between color options for the current style.<sup id=\"fnref-64012-2\"><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=64012#fn-64012-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2</a></sup> When you find a wallpaper you like, hit the big Save button at the bottom of the screen. That’s pretty much it.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/72286b5b-b5ad-4df1-bda6-e4a6620b7a08.png\" alt=\"A handful of wallpaper style options.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">A handful of wallpaper style options.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p9\">If the app had the number of options found in most wallpaper apps, such simple navigation almost certainly wouldn’t work. But The Wallpaper App offers a purposely limited 15 styles of wallpaper. Several of these styles are modeled after Apple’s built-in wallpapers, like Ribbons, Fourteen, and Hello Sur. Every style has a distinct artistic flair to it, and importantly works well in the background of your Home screen or desktop, behind app icons, files and folders, widgets, shortcuts – all the things that keep your devices highly functional. The web is full of gorgeous wallpapers, but so many of them demand that they not be covered up. Not so the options found here, which look great in the background.</p> \n<p id=\"p10\">The small selection of style options isn’t a problem because the variations of each style are unlimited. The Wallpaper App generates new variations randomly in code, each of which feature different colors and details. So if you keep tapping forward, you’ll continue seeing more new variations. You can also swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen to toggle between light and dark versions of the same iteration or adjust its colors – now Apple just needs to support setting different wallpapers per system appearance in the OS.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/fea79c8f-9e10-4428-90de-2767017a9cc3.png\" alt=\"Every wallpaper can generate dark or light versions, or be color-adjusted.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Every wallpaper can generate dark or light versions, or be color-adjusted.</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p12\">A unique bonus feature of sorts – and I call it a bonus because the UI doesn’t explain anywhere that it exists – is that on compatible platforms you can drag and drop colors from an outside source to use them in any given wallpaper. This functionality pairs perfectly with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pastel/id413897608?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pastel</a>, the color palette utility <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/pastel-review-a-modern-color-utility-for-ipad-and-iphone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I reviewed recently</a>. On my iPad I can keep Pastel in a Slide Over window, or in Split View next to The Wallpaper App, and pick up a color from Pastel then drop it on a given wallpaper to see it dynamically adopt the new color. It’s a very nice extra touch.</p> \n<div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n <img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/155e0734-5de5-4d57-b87f-594ca782bad7.png\" alt=\"Dropping a color from Pastel into The Wallpaper App (before and after).\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Dropping a color from Pastel into The Wallpaper App (before and after).</p></img>\n</div> \n<p id=\"p14\">One of my main pet peeves when searching for wallpapers online is that it’s hard to find ones that perfectly match my device’s screen dimensions. But since The Wallpaper App was designed first and foremost with Apple users in mind, that’s not the case here. The app knows your device dimensions, and even your current device orientation – whether portrait or landscape – so tapping Save provides a wallpaper perfectly suited for those settings. It just works, and if you want a different sized version, you can simply tap and hold the Save button to see a context menu with additional options – including one for generating Apple Watch-optimized wallpaper.</p> \n<hr id=\"hr15\">\n <p id=\"p16\">Plenty of wallpaper apps are nicely designed, but none have ever managed to meet my needs like The Wallpaper App, and as a result I’ve never kept another wallpaper app saved on my devices for long. This time is different.</p> \n <p id=\"p17\">The wallpaper styles available here closely model the strengths of Apple’s own built-in wallpaper options, and as a result I can see myself returning to The Wallpaper App every time I get the itch for a new background – not only returning to it, but also finding something new that actually works for me. That’s never been true with another app.</p> \n <p id=\"p18\">A great iPhone or iPad wallpaper, to me at least, needs to be not just beautiful but also a good complement to the things sitting on top of it – apps and widgets. The Wallpaper App gets that. If you’ve struggled finding good wallpapers for your devices, this app is well worth a try.</p> \n <p id=\"p19\">The Wallpaper App is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1518228413\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available as a free download on the App Store</a> across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p> \n <div class=\"footnotes\" id=\"div20\"> \n  <hr>\n   <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn-64012-1\"> Unlike 90% of wallpapers on the web, which look great as stand-alone images but are too distracting and/or obscured when used on an iPhone or iPad.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=64012#fnref-64012-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">↩︎</a> </li> \n    <li id=\"fn-64012-2\"> On iPhone tapping is complemented by a nice bump of haptic feedback.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/?p=64012#fnref-64012-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">↩︎</a> </li> \n   </ol>\n  </hr>\n </div> \n <hr />\n <h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3>\n <p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.</p> <p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

My <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial review</a> praised how Chapman was able to take an otherwise standard utility app and build a standout experience which, from day one, raised itself above a crowded market of competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">The main reasons I loved Dark Noise from the start had little to do with the app&#8217;s basic utility: playing ambient noise. The app has always had a good selection of noise options, but nothing in the sound department made it truly special to me. It was the other areas of the app experience, everything surrounding that basic utility of ambient noise playing, that was so great. Icon animations, buttery smooth panel transitions, haptic feedback, strong iPad support, alternate app icons, Shortcuts support, a customizable widget, and more all made for a compelling product.</p>\n<p id=\"p4\">One of my only disappointments with Dark Noise was the inability to mix different noises together. Each noise could only be played in isolation, never more than one at a time, which proved a disadvantage compared to other ambient noise apps I&#8217;d used that enabled mixing different noises to create a custom soundscape. I&#8217;m happy to say that Dark Noise 2, released today, adds this functionality at last.</p>\n<p id=\"p5\">In Dark Noise 2 not only can you mix different sounds to create custom noises, but there are also eight new sound options to choose from, iCloud sync has been added for syncing your favorite sounds and custom mixes, and there&#8217;s optimized support for the iPadOS cursor. It&#8217;s a big release that retains the design elegance Dark Noise has had from day one, but expands the app&#8217;s usefulness in key ways.</p>\n<p id=\"p6\"><!--more--></p>\n<h2 id=\"sound-mixing\">Sound Mixing</h2>\n<p id=\"p7\">In any other app, adding a sound mixing feature could have been as bare-bones as letting you tap multiple sounds to cause them to play simultaneously. That would have been <em>fine</em>, but in fitting with the high bar set by the rest of the app, Chapman threw a lot of care and polish into Dark Noise&#8217;s sound mixing feature.</p>\n<p id=\"p8\">To get started creating a sound mix, simply tap the plus button in the top-right corner of the sound list. From here, you&#8217;re asked to set the mix&#8217;s name, add noises to it, and optionally customize its icon.</p>\n<p id=\"p9\">If there&#8217;s a limit to the number of sounds you can add to a custom mix, I haven&#8217;t been able to reach it yet in my testing, but I know you can add at least 10. You can even add multiple versions of the same sound for an interesting mix.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5d64cdc1-527a-4546-a637-08239dde5a63.png\" alt=\"Creating a custom mix on iPad.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Creating a custom mix on iPad.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p11\">After each sound is added, you&#8217;ll see a volume slider accompanying it so you can tweak the levels of different noises to your liking. As you make various adjustments, there&#8217;s a play button at the bottom of the screen which enables quickly sampling the product of your work. You only need to hit play once, because after the mix kicks off you can make adjustments and have the sound update in real-time to your changes, whether you&#8217;re simply tweaking volume levels or adding or removing entire noises. The whole mix creation process is simple and intuitive.</p>\n<p id=\"p12\">When you&#8217;ve assembled the right collection of noises and sound levels for your mix, you can either save the mix and be done, or you can keep the creative juices flowing by customizing your mix&#8217;s icon. Every mix has a default icon auto-assigned, but if you tap the Edit button beneath that icon you can either upload a custom image or even a GIF to serve as the mix&#8217;s icon, or take one of Dark Noise&#8217;s existing icons as your foundation and tweak it with different colors to suit your preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\">Images and GIFs are pulled directly from your Photos library, and GIFs in particular make great mix icons because they will animate when a mix is being played, just like any of the default noise icons in the app. If you want to use a built-in icon for your mix, you can choose from all the app&#8217;s options and change both the foreground and background colors to make it stand out from all other sounds in the noise list.</p>\n<p id=\"p14\">Saved mixes go into a new My Mixes section of the noise list, but you can also favorite them just like any other noise to send them to the top of the list. If you ever want to edit a custom mix, you can do so via the Edit button that appears when long-pressing or right-clicking the mix.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-sounds\">New Sounds</h2>\n<p id=\"p15\">Dark Noise already had a great selection of sound options, but the new ones are nice additions:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul16\"><li>Rain on Tent</li>\n<li>Wind Chimes</li>\n<li>Windy Trees</li>\n<li>Seagulls</li>\n<li>Lake</li>\n<li>Ship Deck</li>\n<li>Flag</li>\n<li>Lullaby</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p17\">Many of these became instant favorites upon my first use, and of course each includes a beautiful animated icon upon being played. While I never felt like Dark Noise was lacking in sound options before, I appreciate the expanded roster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-the-rest\">All the Rest</h2>\n<p id=\"p18\"><strong>iPad cursor support.</strong> Before Dark Noise 2 you could still use a connected mouse or trackpad in the iPad version of the app, but nothing was optimized for that mode of input. Now, the cursor will snap to different interface elements like play/pause controls and buttons for AirPlay, sleep timers, and more. The heart glyph for favoriting sounds and the drag lines for rearranging favorites now subtly jump forward when you hover over them with the cursor too, which is a nice touch.</p>\n<p id=\"p19\"><strong>New app icons.</strong> Dark Noise already offered one of the most impressive arrays of alternate app icons, but it adds two more in this release: a skeuomorphic option inspired by macOS Big Sur&#8217;s new icon design and one that&#8217;s based on the artwork of Chapman&#8217;s own podcast, where he interviews indie developers: <a href=\"https://launchedfm.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Launched</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/4bb5d464-9494-4096-a630-35e42c45e348.png\" alt=\"There&#8217;s an icon for everyone.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">There&#8217;s an icon for everyone.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p21\"><strong>iCloud sync.</strong> Until now Dark Noise didn&#8217;t have a syncing system in place for keeping data between iPhone and iPad versions up to date. This honestly wasn&#8217;t a real problem, because the only thing sync would have been useful for was having your favorited sounds stay the same on both devices. It didn&#8217;t take much work to manually re-favorite the same sounds on each platform.</p>\n<p id=\"p22\">With the addition of custom sound mixes, however, it&#8217;s more important than ever to have a sync system in place, so I&#8217;m glad to see that iCloud sync is now employed both for populating your mixes across multiple platforms as well as syncing your favorites list.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr23\"><p id=\"p24\">Dark Noise 2 is a fantastic update that retains the app&#8217;s fundamental design strengths while adding valuable new functionality via custom mixes and great new sounds. I love that mix creation is a full-featured, intuitive experience rather than something that was quickly thrown together &#8211; it fits well with the whole app&#8217;s design ethos.</p>\n<p id=\"p25\">Some 2.0 releases for apps are more radical, but Dark Noise didn&#8217;t need that kind of update; rather, this latest version retains the strong foundation of the original while building upon it to offer more of what users want. If you were already a Dark Noise user, you&#8217;ll love the app even more now, and if you weren&#8217;t, there&#8217;s never been a better time to try it.</p>\n<p id=\"p26\">Dark Noise is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395?uo=4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available on the App Store</a> as a one-time purchase.</p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Much of the app&#8217;s history, which got off to a rocky start, has been focused on gathering and improving map data worldwide, but that&#8217;s beginning to change. The task is enormous and will never really be finished, but a shift has already started.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">Once, the improvements in Maps were focused mainly on its basic underlying data like getting roads and geographic features correct. However, today the emphasis is increasingly on providing a deeper set of data and new features like cycling routes and city guides. Google Maps has had some of this functionality for years, and many of the refinements to Apple Maps are in just a handful of cities and countries. However, with the completion of Maps&#8217; rebuilt map data in the US, Apple has begun to layer in new data and functionality that is poised to spread out much more widely.</p>\n<aside class=\"aside aligncenter aside-narrow\" id=\"aside4\"><h3 class=\"pre-title\" id=\"supported-by\">Supported By</h3>\n<h2 id=\"concepts\">Concepts</h2>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/icon-1595254554207.png\" alt=\"\"></center>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://concepts.app/download?utm_source=macstories)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer\">Concepts</a></strong>: Sketch, Note, Draw</p>\n</aside><p id=\"p5\"><!--more--></p>\n<h2 id=\"laying-the-foundation-for-new-features-with-data\">Laying the Foundation for New Features with Data</h2>\n<p id=\"p6\">The foundation of the new features being added to Maps is the underlying data that Apple is continuously collecting and updating. The ambitious map reconstruction was <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-is-rebooting-its-maps-app-with-rebuilt-map-data/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced in June 2018</a>. A year into the project, Apple announced iOS and iPadOS 13, which <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-maps-in-ios-13-sights-set-on-google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced the first new Maps feature</a> tied to the new maps: Look Around, the company&#8217;s take on Google Maps&#8217; Street View functionality. Apple has also continued to add and update data to its maps like real-time transit data, flight status information, EV charging stations, parking details, COVID-19 test centers, and indoor maps.</p>\n<p id=\"p7\">In January of this year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-continental-united-states\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">completed its map update</a> for the continental US. In the months since, the company has continued to expand Look Around, adding US cities like <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-maps-look-around-feature-expands-to-chicago/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-adds-look-around-for-seattle-washington-in-maps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seattle</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/1C79D168-2035-4742-B0D8-35BE8A66C9A0-1597255094124.png\" alt=\"Look Around includes footpaths in Osaka, Japan.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Look Around includes footpaths in Osaka, Japan.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p9\">Now, Apple is expanding its rebuilt maps to other countries. Just this past week, the company added a detailed map of Japan, which includes the Look Around feature for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. In Osaka, Look Around &#8211; which had previously only followed streets &#8211; added footpaths in the park surrounding Osaka Castle, something I hope to see come to other cities too. Also coming later this year are rebuilt maps for the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada. It will be interesting to see if maps for those entire countries are turned on all at once, as was done with Japan. That may be difficult with a country the size of Canada, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if that&#8217;s how Apple rolls out its new maps in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p id=\"p10\">New data layers are being added to Maps this year, including ones identifying speed and red-light cameras on your route, congestion zones, and environmental zones. Speed and red-light cameras have not appeared in the iOS 14 beta where I live yet, so I haven&#8217;t been able to try them. Presumably, however, they will work similarly to <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google&#8217;s Waze app</a> by displaying iconography in Maps where cameras are located. Congestion and environmental zones data will help drivers take them into account when picking a route. Also, Maps users in China will be able to securely store their license plate numbers to check which days they are permitted to drive in congestion zones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"better-location-tracking-and-new-routing-options\">Better Location Tracking and New Routing Options</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/43482c0c-43f2-47c3-a2f6-841b9e9cd134.png\" alt=\"Refine location in action.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Refine location in action.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p12\">The update to Maps adds an ingenious new way to determine your location too. Refine location is a clever way to pinpoint your location in a crowded city with tall buildings, which can reduce the accuracy of GPS. If iOS is unable to determine your location precisely, Maps will prompt you to hold up your phone and scan your surroundings with the iPhone&#8217;s camera. By comparing the images recorded against Look Around data and combining it with other available location data, Maps can more accurately place you on the map. Refine location is only available in <a href=\"https://www.justinobeirne.com/look-around-coverage-areas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cities with Look Around</a>, which is currently limited to the biggest US cities, plus Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya in Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\">Maps will also add cycling and electric vehicle routing features this fall. When it launches, cycling routes will be available in San Francisco, New York, Shanghai, and Beijing, although currently the feature is only live in San Francisco.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/E7A5406E-D9B0-4391-A9FE-7747CEC4ACC1-1597258057066.png\" alt=\"Bicycle routing allows you to optimize for time or avoid hills.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Bicycle routing allows you to optimize for time or avoid hills.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p15\">Cycling routes include several options that let cyclists customize their trips. An excellent example of the feature is illustrated by a route I picked from Mint Plaza to In-N-Out Burger in San Francisco. After entering the start and end points of the trip, Maps displays a new bicycle icon that you can tap to see your route options.</p>\n<p id=\"p16\">In this example, Maps provides two options. The first one is the fastest at 23 minutes, but hillier than the second, which takes an extra minute of riding. Along with the distance and overall elevation change, Maps displays a graph that depicts the inclines along the way and notes other features of the route, like bike lanes, shared roads, and busy roads. Maps also alerts you if any walking or stair climbs may be necessary. The same details are displayed on the Apple Watch.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/8153180D-770F-4CE0-B93F-709B1CBBFFCB-1597258162334.png\" alt=\"You can also set Maps to avoid busy roads.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">You can also set Maps to avoid busy roads.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p18\">Beneath the default routes picked by Maps are options to avoid hills and busy roads. My imaginary ride to In-N-Out Burger is a good example of how these two toggles can affect a route. The most direct route down Stockton Street is hilly. Instructing Maps to avoid hills takes me on a longer, flatter route down Mission Street to the waterfront. Choosing to avoid busy roads suggests a different route to the Embarcadero via Market Street. The Maps section of the Settings app has also been updated to allow you to pick cycling as the default mode of transportation and to avoid busy roads and hills by default.</p>\n<p id=\"p19\">Maps is also adding electric vehicle routing. The feature hasn&#8217;t appeared in the iOS 14 beta yet, but Apple says it will allow users to specify their type of EV and supported charger. That will allow Apple to highlight charging stations at regular intervals along a route as needed and add the time needed to charge your vehicle when calculating your ETA to your destination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"built-in-third-party-city-guides\">Built-In Third-Party City Guides</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/7CA9D6B5-F048-499B-960D-68D56FADBBF0-1597258213775.png\" alt=\"Guides can be found by searching for a place or topic like &#8216;ice cream,&#8217; for example.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Guides can be found by searching for a place or topic like &#8216;ice cream,&#8217; for example.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p21\">Another big addition coming to Maps is curated guides from third-party publishers, which can be located by searching for a city that supports them or for a topic covered by a guide. So far, I&#8217;ve seen guides from Lonely Planet, The Infatuation, and AllTrail, although between WWDC keynote slides and other reports, guides should also be coming from Louis Vuitton, The Washington Post, Time Out Group, Complex, and Zagat. Guides include collections of destinations like &#8216;Best Trails for Running Near SF&#8217; from AllTrails and &#8216;Best Ice Cream Shops in NYC&#8217; from Lonely Planet. Tapping on a guide drops pins for each location in the guide on the map and shows a short description of each location with accompanying photos. You can save an entire guide, share it via the share sheet, or save individual locations to custom collections you create.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/0B88960E-7899-4BCC-B7F5-7315D94B3F24-1597258213756.png\" alt=\"San Francisco and the surrounding area currently has the most guides, including outdoor activities, food, and tourist sites.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">San Francisco and the surrounding area currently has the most guides, including outdoor activities, food, and tourist sites.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p23\">The guides that I&#8217;ve browsed in San Francisco and New York are well done and concise, making them easy to digest. Currently, however, the catalog of guides is severely limited. At WWDC Apple said the feature will start with San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London. As of the publication of this story, there are only three guides in New York, a couple dozen in the San Francisco area, and none in Los Angeles or London. So far, there are twelve guides from Lonely Planet, nine from The Infatuation, and five from AllTrails. There are still several weeks to go before iOS 14 launches, so I expect more guides to be added soon. However, as with other Maps features, it&#8217;s going to be a while before the feature is widespread enough to be useful to many users, but worth trying if you&#8217;re in San Francisco or New York.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/568B5FA5-7E54-4942-9871-99C687D27187-1597258213162.png\" alt=\"Guides are discoverable in search results and certain location listings, and in San Francisco you can browse all guides and browse by publisher.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Guides are discoverable in search results and certain location listings, and in San Francisco you can browse all guides and browse by publisher.</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"catching-up-the-mac-with-catalyst\">Catching Up the Mac with Catalyst</h2>\n<p id=\"p25\">Also notable this fall is that Maps will join the ranks of Mac Catalyst with the release of macOS Big Sur. Unlike some of Apple&#8217;s early Mac Catalyst offerings, Maps follows standard Mac conventions users expect, like using checkboxes in its Preferences instead of iOS-style toggles, and it fits in nicely with macOS&#8217;s new design language.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5fc562a9-8291-4217-bb7e-3a5175d46b45.png\" alt=\"Maps running on Big Sur.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Maps running on Big Sur.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p27\">Beyond its looks, though, Maps being rebuilt as a Mac Catalyst app means it now enjoys feature parity with the iOS and iPadOS versions of the app. For the first time, Maps on the Mac supports Favorites, Look Around, and indoor maps. You can also send routes to an iPhone or iPad and track arrival times for anyone who has shared their ETA with you. Maps on the Mac will support the new iOS and iPadOS 14 features that I covered above too. With a full sidebar on the left and toolbar across the top of the app&#8217;s window, Maps on macOS 11.0 remains unmistakably a Mac app, but with all the features users will expect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approximate-location-provides-more-privacy-options\">Approximate Location Provides More Privacy Options</h2>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/532E24C5-B556-43AE-A70F-663C4AFAED80-1597258211596.png\" alt=\"If you only share your approximate location with Maps, your location is depicted by a large shaded circle.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">If you only share your approximate location with Maps, your location is depicted by a large shaded circle.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p29\">Privacy has also been enhanced in Maps to account for the fact that Apple&#8217;s CoreLocation APIs now allow users to share their approximate location with apps instead of their precise location. The change posed difficult design challenges for Maps, which was built around the assumption that it would always know a user&#8217;s precise location. The solution, which is <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10162\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detailed in a WWDC presentation</a>, implements a combination of user control, clear in-app communication, and an explanation of the value of providing precise data to allow users to make an informed choice while remaining useful to users who only provide approximate data.</p>\n<p id=\"p30\">The most apparent result of the change is that if you only grant Maps access to your approximate location, your position on the map is represented by a shaded circle encompassing your approximate location instead of a precise blue dot. The addition of approximate location sharing is a welcome one. Although I plan to continue sharing my exact location with Maps to take full advantage of things like turn-by-turn directions, there are plenty of other apps, like ones that list upcoming local events, that only need my general location.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr31\"><p id=\"p32\">When <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-maps-in-ios-13-sights-set-on-google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we checked in with Maps after WWDC 2019</a>, a large part of the US still did not have Apple&#8217;s enhanced maps, and Look Around was just rolling out in the San Francisco area. Now, the entire US and Japan have Apple&#8217;s new maps, and Canada, the UK, and Ireland are on the way. Plus, eleven US cities and three Japanese cities now feature Look Around. The progress is substantial, but there is still a long way to go before the new maps and Look Around are available worldwide.</p>\n<p id=\"p33\">Apple isn&#8217;t sitting still, though. While other countries are being mapped and brought online, new features are being built on top of the new maps where they are already available, which I expect will continue. It&#8217;s a frustratingly slow process at times, but given the size of the undertaking, it&#8217;s not surprising. In fact, what has been accomplished so far is actually quite remarkable. Apple hasn&#8217;t shared its plans for mapping beyond the countries that will be added later this year, but if the progress made in the US is any indication, we&#8217;ll see many more countries get Apple&#8217;s new maps and features between now and WWDC 2021.</p>\n<hr id=\"hr34\"><p id=\"p35\"><em>You can also follow our 2020 Summer OS Preview Series through our <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/os-preview-2020/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dedicated hub</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/os-preview-2020/feed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subscribe to its RSS feed</a>.</em></p>\n<hr /><h3>Support MacStories Directly</h3><p><p>Club MacStories offers exclusive access to <strong>extra MacStories content</strong>, delivered every week;  it&#8217;s also a way to support us directly.</p>\n<p>Club MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
