Native Notebooks are VS Code’s newest implementation of notebooks and the Python Extension is leveraging the Native Notebooks API to revamp the data science experience! Users can now benefit from the new functionalities below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The same extensions that users rely on when editing source code or markdown text in the VS Code Editor are now available in notebooks! For example, you won’t miss your VIM key bindings or your stylishly colored brackets anymore.</li>\n<li>In addition to an improved integration between extensions in notebooks, we have drastically improved the load time for notebooks! The following <a href=\"https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb\">notebook</a> builds and assesses the accuracy of an image recognition model that differentiates between dog breeds contains 49 code cells, 18 markdown cells, and their outputs (~5MB). The current notebook editor takes about 7 seconds to open this notebook, but the new notebook editor takes <u>less than a second</u>!</li>\n<li>Last but not least, the new interface has a fresh look and feel along with additional UI changes and cell manipulation capabilities that match VS Code&#8217;s design language that we&#8217;d love to get your feedback on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our goal is to reduce the time it takes you to get your work done and done well, with the sum of all these cumulative changes.</p>\n<p>For additional information on the new Native Notebooks API, click <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-to-try-out-native-notebooks\">How to try out Native Notebooks:</h1>\n<p>We are currently exclusively rolling out this new experience in <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\"><strong>VS Code Insiders </strong></a>build. If you do not already have it, download and install the latest version of the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python\">Python Extension</a> from the marketplace or install it directly from the extension gallery in Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p>To try the new native notebook, follow the instructions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure the Python extension is activated.
