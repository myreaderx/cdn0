With this shift to digital, it’s become even clearer that every advertiser is a performance advertiser. </p><p>With YouTube, marketers have the flexibility to shift budgets and invest in driving the results that matter most. As businesses begin to reopen, they have an opportunity to use video to drive both online and offline actions on YouTube, where 70 percent of people say they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on our platform.<sup>1</sup> That’s why we’ve invested heavily to <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/rebranding-strategy/\">introduce effective video solutions</a> that drive action. Last year, the number of active advertisers using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7671017\">TrueView for action</a> grew over 260 percent.<sup>2</sup> </p><p>Today, we’re making it even easier for you to inspire people to take action on YouTube with smarter solutions that make video more shoppable, use automation to drive conversions, and help you better understand attribution.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"><figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \"><img alt=\"Shopping.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Shopping.gif\"/></figure><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Make your video ads your new storefront</h3><p>Brands are strategically using video ads when merchandising new products. Recently, <a href=\"https://www.ae.com/us/en/c/aerie/cat4840006?pagetype=clp\">Aerie</a> needed to simultaneously drive brand love and omnichannel apparel sales for their 2020 spring campaign. They used YouTube as a full funnel solution and connected with audiences with the highest likelihood to purchase. As a result, Aerie saw strong engagement for their brand and achieved a 25 percent higher return on ad spend than the previous year—with nine times more conversions compared to their traditional media mix. </p><p>To help businesses establish a stronger e-commerce presence, we’re experimenting with a new way to make your actionable video ads more shoppable—complementing your ad with browsable product imagery to inspire the next purchase. All you need to do is sync your Google Merchant Center feed to your video ads, and you can visually expand your call-to-action button with the best-sellers you want to feature and drive traffic to the product pages that matter. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>An easier way to drive more conversions</h3>In addition, we know that with limited marketing budgets, it’s become harder to drive reach and convert demand at the same time. Today we’re announcing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee63ZSUGGSU\">Video action campaigns</a>, a simple and cost-effective way to drive more conversions across YouTube. It automatically brings video ads that drive action to the YouTube home feed, watch pages, and Google video partners, all within one campaign. To make it even simpler, we’ll include any future inventory that becomes available, like the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3002587?hl=en#:~:text=What%20to%20Watch%20Next%20Module,content%20they%20haven't%20seen.\">What to Watch Next</a> feed. This way you can save time to focus on strategic initiatives like crafting the right creative and messaging for your audiences.</div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"3phones_blogpost.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/3phones_blogpost.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’ve seen Video action campaigns work for companies of all sizes, including <a href=\"http://www.mos.com\">Mos</a>, a startup that helps students find funds for college to avoid large student debts. As a newer company, Mos was excited to test out a solution that could drive results quickly.

Lead forms help advertisers capture qualified leads while reducing costs - all without interrupting the viewing experience. Automobile giant <a href=\"https://www.jeep.com/\">Jeep</a> tried this approach with their Korea branch and saw a 13 times increase in completed leads at an 84 percent lower cost per lead. With lead forms, they generated “the most leads at the most efficient cost among all ad platforms,” says Kenny Hwang, Jeep’s Korea Marketing Manager. <br/></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Plan for greater impact across different consumer touchpoints </h3><p>We often see that people <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/online-search-and-video-shopping-behavior/\">switch between Search and YouTube</a> to find new information that influences what to buy.
