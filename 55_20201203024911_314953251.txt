We’re constantly coming and going, we usually don’t carry a lot of stuff with us, and no two travelers are alike so finding the perfect gift for the traveler in your life can be tricky.</p> \n<p>While a plane ticket is never a bad idea (I’m a window seat in case anyone is thinking of getting me one), I’ve put together this ultimate holiday gift guide for travelers as there’s a lot of great travel gear out there these days that helps people travel cheaper and better.</p> \n<p>Even me, the gear-adverse traveler, likes a lot of this stuff!</p> \n<p>This is stuff I actually think is super useful. No nonsense. No fluff. Just the best gifts for intrepid travelers and globetrotting nomads!</p> \n<div class=\"nm-toc\"> \n <p class=\"nm-toc-title\">Table of Contents</p> \n <ol> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/?p=148897#first\">Gifts Under $25</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/?p=148897#second\">Gifts Under $100</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/?p=148897#third\">Gifts Over $100</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2 id=\"first\">Gifts Under $25</h2> \n<h3>1. Packing Cubes</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DP2Nsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/tfg_packing_cubes.jpg\" alt=\"travel packing cubes\" /></a><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DP2Nsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Packing cubes</a> are an awesome tool to help you stay organized while you travel. Whether you’re a budget backpacker or traveling with half a dozen suitcases, packing cubes will keep you organized as you travel the world. They come in a variety of sizes, allowing you to store items big and small. If you know a traveler who needs a hand staying organized, this is the gift for them! (If you want something nicer and better quality, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OJ45Ih\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out these ones</a>!)</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2DP2Nsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2.

Since many hostels have lockers, backpackers need to have their own <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OHM1hR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">travel lock</a> when they’re on the road. While you can usually rent them at hostels, those prices add up after a while. I never leave home without a lock because I know it will come in handy.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2OHM1hR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3.

From chronic snorers to late-night drinkers to copulating couples in creaking bunks, hostels are known for their less-than-quiet accommodation. Add some earplugs to your shopping list. Because the gift of a good sleep is priceless!</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2r1mMLG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4.

Having a lightweight, quick-drying towel makes a huge difference when you’re on the road since regular towels are too bulky and heavy (and they take a long time to dry). Get a <a href=\"https://www.dryfoxco.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">travel towel</a> for your next trip so you can travel light.

Most passport holders have slots for your travel credit cards as well as any cash you have, making it a safe and convenient way to keep your valuables secure while you travel. While there are tons of expensive and fancy passport holders out there, a simple one will get the job done and save you money in the process (money you can spend on more travels!).</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2NUl0IL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8.

Having a reliable travel backpack is one of the most important items for a traveler. </p> \n<p>My favorite bag is the <a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=1e623eb9-55a4-4927-9712-0e0ea5344d22&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F148588%2Frei-co-op-flash-45-pack-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flash 45</a> from REI but other companies worth checking out for high-quality bags are Osprey, Nomatic, and MEC (for Canadians).</p> \n<p>Some bags worth checking out are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=1e623eb9-55a4-4927-9712-0e0ea5344d22&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F894562%2Fosprey-farpoint-40-travel-pack-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Men’s Osprey Farpoint 40</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=1e623eb9-55a4-4927-9712-0e0ea5344d22&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118594%2Fosprey-fairview-40-travel-pack-womens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Women’s Osprey Fairview 40</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CuRS5G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pacsafe Venturesafe X40 Anti-Theft Adventure Travel Pack</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>(For a different backpack, check out my guide <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/choosing-the-right-backpack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finding the right backpack</a> for more options!)</p> \n<h3>24.

Now, I’m a backpack guy but I love this new luggage set. It’s made from 100% recycled plastic! Every little part of it! I can get behind something that environmentally friendly. It also comes with a limited 10 year warranty too in case something goes wrong.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2zE6JIy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>26.

It’s light, it’s powerful enough for regular use, and the battery life lasts a long time. While an iPad might be another potential travel choice, I find the Air much more versatile — especially with their new M1 chip. You can just do a lot more with it. When I’m on the road, this is the laptop I travel with.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3q7nVPt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>27. iPhone</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lcnsYy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/iphone11.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 11\" /></a>While not a cheap phone, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lcnsYy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iPhone 12</a> has such a high-tech camera that you don’t need to take a traditonal camera with you when you travel. It has a solid battery life, a grat lens, beautiful screen, and, is overall, just awesome. True, I’m an Apple fanboy so I might be biased but hey, it’s my list!</p> \n<p>For a less-expensive phone with an equally awesome camera, check out the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fZbccS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google Pixel</a>. It’s less than half the price and has an excellent camera.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3lcnsYy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>28.

The wireless <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TxZudz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> headphones are fan favorites and my go-to brand. They are comfortable, rechargable, and do an amazing job at removing background noise. If you’re on a budget, consider the QuietComfort 25 instead.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2TxZudz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>29.

It can be hard to keep them all charged. An <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DDgxp1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">external battery</a> solves that problem. Two high-output USB ports make this external battery incredibly convenient, and it can charge up to 100 hours of battery in one go.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2DDgxp1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>30.

Hauling around physical books is a pain if you’re traveling often. With a Kindle, you can pack over 1,000 books into a single device and many versions can also use apps and access the internet. It’s a wonderful gift for the avid reader.</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <a class=\"amazonbuy\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2JiJn2K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy now on Amazon!</a>\n </center><br /> &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>31.

They’re incredible for photos and video no matter the climate. They’re waterproof and are perfect for both everyday city exploring as well as more extreme and adventurous activities. They’re just awesome. If the Hero 9 is too pricey, grab the 8.
