Over the course of those visits, we were able to identify and address the Z-axis problem (which I’ll write up later) and make some observations about the extruder that ultimately led to a successful workaround this weekend.</p> \n<p><span id=\"more-1770\"></span></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_120334_DSC01082.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_120334_DSC01082_mid.jpg\" alt=\"MakerBot CupCake extruder with DC motor\" /></a></p> \n<p>In our testing, Cort and I noted that — even just being driven by the ReplicatorG control panel — the extruder motor stalled fairly easily; it was fairly certain to stall with any PWM value below 240. Because yes, the CupCake shipped with a DC gearmotor.</p> \n<p>Cort and I were suspicious of the 8P8C cabling that delivers both communications and power from the motherboard to the extruder daughterboard, and Cort cleaned the plugs and jacks with DeoxIt. We also figured that after the hours of service that the motor experienced back in the day, it was probably starting to wear and draw more current to maintain the same speed. That would exacerbate the voltage drop from crusty cabling; so between the two, we figured that cleaning the contacts provided at least a modest chance of it working again with no further intervention. (Foreshadowing: nope.) After that troubleshooting session, I brought the printer back home to try out before the next time we were going to be able to get back together.</p> \n<h3>First Attempt: Mechanical Problems</h3> \n<p>Yesterday I cleared space on my workbench, set up the CupCake, and resumed trying to persuade it to do that same print from 2014. I still happen to have the G-code file that was generated back then, so I’m using that same object and that same G-code in order to introduce as few variables as possible.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_192757_DSC01070_crop.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_192757_DSC01070_crop_mid.jpg\" alt=\"failed 3D print on MakerBot CupCake\" /></a></p> \n<p>The first print failed impressively, twice. The jog in the middle was from the X axis binding when both of the back bushings popped out of the Y carriage, nothing to see here, move along. But then later it just stopped printing, much earlier than it had in 2014 or while testing at Cort’s house, which was discouraging.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_192958_DSC01073_annotated.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_192958_DSC01073_annotated_mid.jpg\" alt=\"small bearing lying on power supply\" /></a></p> \n<p>Oh hai! What are you??</p> \n<p>I stepped back into my workroom and saw this bearing sitting on the power supplies. ??? How did it get there? Did it fall off a shelf? Did someone break into my workroom during the two minutes that I was away and set a bearing on my bench?</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_193049_DSC01076.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_193049_DSC01076_mid.jpg\" alt=\"MakerBot CupCake extruder with missing motor shaft bearing\" /></a></p> \n<p>Oh. <em>That</em> bearing. You know, the one on the end of the motor shaft that keeps it from deflecting away from the filament and losing its grip. It just friction-fits into the hole in the laser-cut acrylic and it worked its way out, fell down, bounced off the Z stage, rolled out of the printer, landed on the power supplies, and stopped there instead of, you know, rolling under the washing machine and I’d be looking at the CupCake parts manifest to order a new one.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_194411_DSC01077.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/12/IMG_20200912_194411_DSC01077_mid.jpg\" alt=\"MakerBot CupCake extruder with motor shaft bearing reinstalled\" /></a></p> \n<p>Okay, you happy now? Good.</p> \n<h3>Second Attempt: Filament Problem</h3> \n<p>I noticed that the first print, purportedly at the same temperature I’ve always used in the past to get natural-colored prints, had a toasty marshmallow glow about it. I found the <a href=\"http://makerbot.wikidot.com/gcode\">MakerBot G-code reference</a> that lists which codes were implemented and how they were interpreted and found that <code>M104 Snnn</code> sets the nozzle temperature. Accordingly, I edited my 2014 G-code file, found the two M104 codes and edited them to lower the temperature, and started the print again.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_182913_DSC01092.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_182913_DSC01092_mid.jpg\" alt=\"failed 3D print on MakerBot CupCake\" /></a></p> \n<p>It failed early, due to &lt;ahem&gt; another mechanical problem. My original MakerBot ABS filament was shipped in a coil because spools hadn’t been invented yet, and pulling filament out of a coil is prone to snagging. If I get distracted watching Adam Savage YouTube videos and don’t pay enough attention to feeding filament off the coil, the extruder starts to climb up the filament into the sky like the Lorax, then plop itself back down dramatically and make a blob, at which point you may as well cancel the rest of the print.</p> \n<h3>Third Attempt: Extruder Problem Returns!</h3> \n<p>Still toasty marshmallow, so I edited the G-code and lowered the temperature again.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_183002_DSC01096.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_183002_DSC01096_mid.jpg\" alt=\"failed 3D print on MakerBot CupCake\" /></a></p> \n<p>At last, we’re back to the original failure mode! About 30 to 40 minutes into the print, the extruder motor stalled and just stopped pushing filament.</p> \n<p>I put my meter onto the motor leads and read 9.92 VDC, which would be an alarming drop from 12 VDC if it were true. I halted the print, started the ReplicatorG control panel, set the extruder motor PWM to 255, and read 11.78 VDC at the motor with the motor running, which was more like what I expected. I played around with different PWM values and found (A) that my meter low-pass-filters out the PWM and reads the average DC value (okay); and (B) that it reads about 10 VDC around a PWM of 239 to 240. That is, when the motor stalled, it was probably running at a PWM of 240.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/Reliability_vs._Speed.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/Reliability_vs._Speed.png\" alt=\"chart of MakerBot CupCake reliability vs speed at three nozzle temperatures\" /></a></p> \n<p>This led to some control-panel-based testing of how low the extruder-motor PWM value can be set and still push filament at different nozzle temperatures on this CupCake at this age in this condition in this workroom. The reliability values above are estimated, but they tell a pretty clear story that this CupCake extruder — as it sits today — really ought not to be driven at less than full DC <em>nor</em> with the nozzle at less than 220°C.</p> \n<h3>Fourth Attempt: Success</h3> \n<p>With that empirical &lt;cough — anecdotal&gt; information at hand, I referenced the MakerBot document again to determine that the only G-codes pertaining to the extruder motor were:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>M101 turn extruder on, forward (CW)</li> \n <li>M102 turn extruder on, reverse (CCW)</li> \n <li>M103 turn extruder off</li> \n <li>M108 extruder speed (Snnn)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>I searched my 2014 G-code file for M108 extruder speed commands and found only two, both setting it to a PWM of 240.</p> \n<p>240? Whyyyyyyy? However much a PWM of 240 slows down that DC gearmotor from straight 12 VDC — and I assure you no one on this planet knows — why would you want to push filament slower, when the filament speed is the bottleneck on printing and the X and Y axes can comfortably go faster than the extruder can keep up with? Le sigh.</p> \n<p>Anyway, I made another pass at hand-editing the G-code file, to raise the nozzle temperature back to 220°C and raise the extruder motor PWM from 240 to 255; and it was then ready to run without the likelihood of stalling due to too low a PWM and too low a temperature.</p> \n<p>As this was going to push more filament into the print than the previous G-code … which doesn’t matter on the narrow walls that constitute most of this print because they’ll just get squished wider, but there <em>is</em> some infill that will build up … I babysat the print and live-adjusted the Z every few layers to make them taller, accommodating the volumetric increase.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_105240_DSC01080.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2020/09/13/IMG_20200913_105240_DSC01080_mid.jpg\" alt=\"completed 3D print on MakerBot CupCake\" /></a></p> \n<p>And it worked. This print, which I no longer need and about which I care only as a canary, completed for the first time evar.</p> \n<h3>Next Steps</h3> \n<p>With a dataset of one completed print, I am declaring success.</p> \n<p>More seriously, of course it may fail again, either because the combination of PWM and filament viscosity wasn’t the only issue or because the motor is aging enough that it’ll soon be stalling at PWM 255 on the 12 V power supply. One could likely perk it up nicely with an external 15 VDC power supply, but that would require hacking (or duplicating) <a href=\"https://reprap.org/mediawiki/images/8/8d/Extruder_Controller_2.2_schematic.png\">the extruder PCB</a> to get a higher voltage to the A3949 motor driver ICs or hacking an interface off of the H-bridge outputs to use an external H-bridge driver, neither of which particularly appeals.</p> \n<p>I know that back in the day, people figured out how to upgrade their extruder DC gearmotor to a stepper-motor drive, <a href=\"https://reprap.org/wiki/Wade%27s_Geared_Extruder\">“Wade’s Geared Extruder”</a> being the most-evolved example. I’d love to upgrade to stepper drive — I already have the parts for a Wade’s geared extruder — but I can no longer find any notes online about how to drive that using an external stepper driver (which one wants), only <a href=\"https://reprap.org/wiki/Microcontroller_Firmware_Hints#Driving_Steppers_with_the_Extruder_Controller_V2.2_.28Arduino_inside....29\">a description of how to use the two onboard H-bridge drivers to drive a stepper</a> and <a href=\"https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?13,64849,64856#msg-64856\">a forum post on how badly that works</a>. It’s always been my plan to do that upgrade, but it’s tough finding the documentation about nascent DIY upgrades ten years of noise later.</p> \n<p>Independent of making sure I have a working extruder motor, I have to figure out a working slicer and redetermine slicer settings. I’d be perfectly content still using Skeinforge; but when I install apparently the same version I was using in 2014 onto my current laptop, it looks and behaves completely different, so that’s a puzzle. I’ve created and lightly tweaked a CupCake printer profile in PrusaSlicer; but Slic3r (and PrusaSlicer by extension) do not have a G-code flavor for the CupCake (their MakerBot G-code flavor appears to be for a much later model) and I don’t think that G-code is going to run successfully. (I tried, and it did some odd things.) Nor can I find any documentation on how to create or edit Slic3r G-code flavors, which I’d be totally willing to do. So that’s a bit of a puzzle.</p> \n<p>That means, of course, that although I can successfully complete old prints, I can’t yet start new ones.</p> \n<p>Finally (for now), why is my ABS coming out toasted darker when it used to print at the same color as the raw filament? My best guess is that ten years of sitting have degraded the filament, but that’s outside my area of expertise. As shown at the top of this post, though, even lowering the nozzle temperature to 210°C doesn’t keep it from darkening and looking scorched.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Sep
