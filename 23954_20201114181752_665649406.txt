Unlike standard EDR search capabilities, which allow administrators to review previously collected data about activity on devices, Live Query allows you to reach out and directly gather information about the current state of a single device or your entire fleet of devices.</p>\n<p>The ability to pull these artifacts from Windows event logs allows teams that are responsible for incident response to gather crucial information around an incident directly from the impacted devices extremely efficiently.</p>\n<p>For instance, pulling this log data from affected systems can highlight what user accounts have been compromised and abused by attackers, how those accounts are connecting to different systems, and well as help to build a chronological timeline of the attacker’s activities. And being able to identify relevant artifacts and use that evidence to develop additional queries that could be run across a wider set of the system provides situational awareness that is a necessity during investigations.</p>\n<p>This newly added functionality makes it easy for users to create their own custom queries to gather real-time Windows event log data, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Event ID</li>\n<li>Time an event occurred</li>\n<li>Source or channel of the event</li>\n<li>Provider name and guide associated with an event</li>\n<li>Severity level of an event</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Along with being able to build custom queries, our <a href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/threat-analysis-unit/\">Threat Analysis Unit</a> (TAU) has also handcrafted a series of recommended queries that leverage the Windows event log query capability. These pre-built queries – along with the more than 90 that already exist in the console &#8211; can be run across your entire Windows fleet with the click of a button, bringing the time required to start gathering these artifacts down to mere seconds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-78048 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.www.carbonblack.com/wp-content/uploads/Windows-Event-Logs.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\n<p>So whether your team is looking to identify devices that may be at risk due to the Windows ZeroLogon Vulnerability (<a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1472\">CVE 2020-1472</a>), or you’re interested in keeping an eye on RDP login activity, or you are looking for indicators of anti-forensics and persistence mechanisms such as cleared event logs and new scheduled tasks, these pre-built queries will save your team time in hunting down potential threats and reducing risk in your environment.</p>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/using-live-query-to-audit-your-environment-for-the-windows-cryptoapi-spoofing-vulnerability/\">Using Live Query to Audit Your Environment for the Windows CryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/how-cb-liveops-helps-with-vulnerability-assessment/\">How Live Query Helps with Vulnerability Assessment</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/new-cb-liveops-release-brings-recommended-queries-to-users/\">New Release Brings Recommended Queries to Users</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/querying-windows-event-logs-for-faster-investigation-and-response/\">Querying Windows Event Logs for Faster Investigation and Response</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com\">VMware Carbon Black</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 16:00:34 +0000","feedId":23954,"bgimg":"https://cdn.www.carbonblack.com/wp-content/uploads/Windows-Event-Logs.gif","linkMd5":"19b4e04f8f1723a4f28fa7a8354698af","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn50@2020_3/2020/11/14/18-17-50-817_b3a434618ef066a0.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":1187040,"destBytes":308062,"author":"Sheida Azimi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.www.carbonblack.com/wp-content/uploads/Windows-Event-Logs.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn50@2020_3/2020/11/14/18-17-50-817_b3a434618ef066a0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605377800940}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 02:16:40","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 02:16:40","feedId":23954,"fetchDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 18:16:40 +0000","fetchMs":513,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":72400,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d74ee4cd41d209f5fd2464bcfd300583","hostName":"europe-23*","requestId":"14fd705e33ed4a11b8afb703bce73064_23954","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":308062,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx18":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:31:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:26:24","id":23954,"name":"VMware Carbon Black","url":"https://www.carbonblack.com/feed/","subscriber":137,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.carbonblack.com/wp-content/uploads/favicon-32x32-1.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn2@2020_6/2020/09/06/20-26-23-618_815ccce11fb49fc8.png","description":"Cloud Native Endpoint Protection","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":308062,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605377800352,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":581,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":7,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://cdn.www.carbonblack.com/wp-content/uploads/Windows-Event-Logs.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn50@2020_3/2020/11/14/18-17-50-817_b3a434618ef066a0.webp","sourceBytes":1187040,"destBytes":308062,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":23954,"totalSpendMs":11628,"convertSpendMs":9579,"createdTime":"2020-11-15 02:17:41","host":"europe-58*","referer":"https://www.carbonblack.com/?p=78017","linkMd5ListStr":"19b4e04f8f1723a4f28fa7a8354698af,19b4e04f8f1723a4f28fa7a8354698af","githubUser":"myreaderx18","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.1 MB","destSize":"300.8 KB","compressRate":"26%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx18":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
