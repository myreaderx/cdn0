In it, relief is attained, life-changing decisions are made, and some of the best acoustics can be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone can be whoever they want to be in the shower, even a Grammy-award winning singer. So why not up the ante and add some tunes during your private time?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class='youtube-player' width='770' height='434' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNSCIuHKhro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons aligncenter\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ampere/shower-power-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-hydropower?utm_source=kickbooster-direct&#38;utm_medium=kickbooster&#38;utm_content=link&#38;utm_campaign=a6b0cc11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>CHECK IT OUT ON KICKSTARTER</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ampere/shower-power-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-hydropower?utm_source=kickbooster-direct&#38;utm_medium=kickbooster&#38;utm_content=link&#38;utm_campaign=a6b0cc11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shower Power</a> by <a href=\"https://ampere.shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ampere</a> is the first speaker built especially for shower time. Installing one to the side of your showerhead takes the water flowing through the system and uses it to rotate an internal impeller inside the Shower Power speaker. This impeller is connected to a mini-generator which provides power to the device’s Lithium-ion battery. This powers Shower Power, letting you listen to your favorite tunes, videos, and podcasts as you take a shower.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"628\" height=\"824\" src=\"https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-inside.gif\" alt=\"shower power\" class=\"wp-image-140357\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning on your shower automatically starts Shower Power’s charging capabilities as well as the speaker itself. Depending on the water flow, your shower can generate anywhere from 150-200mA of power to charge the battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can listen through the Shower Power for up to 170 hours straight whilst water is running through it, though I’m pretty sure your skin will be all wrinkly once you get out after such a long shower. More practically however, it takes 14-16 hours to fully charge and you can listen to it for up to 14 hours without any water running.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-on.gif\" alt=\"shower power\" class=\"wp-image-140360\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering if the Shower Power affects the strength of your water flow or your water usage, it doesn’t. There is no need to remove the device once it’s installed; just think of it as an extension to your showerhead.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"1103\" src=\"https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-controls.jpg\" alt=\"shower power\" class=\"wp-image-140356\" srcset=\"https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-controls.jpg 680w, https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-controls-560x908.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can control Shower Power using your Bluetooth-enabled wireless devices or by using the control panel found at the bottom (there’s even a waterproof remote for certain backers who pick the option). If the Shower Power’s 40 mm 5W speaker isn’t enough for your entire bathroom, it can be paired with Ampere’s Droplet mini Bluetooth waterproof speaker so you can up the surround sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"445\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-prototypes-445x1500.png\" alt=\"shower power\" class=\"wp-image-140358\" srcset=\"https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-prototypes-445x1500.png 445w, https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-prototypes-356x1200.png 356w, https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-prototypes-456x1536.png 456w, https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-prototypes-608x2048.png 608w, https://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shower-power-prototypes.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Shower Power is made using 100% recycled ocean plastic and each device is estimated to consist of around 15 recycled plastic bottles. Seeing as the Shower Power connects to a water source, the plastic compound it is made out of is made to be waterproof, durable, and 99.9% antimicrobial.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons
