This show, titled <em>“Homeplace”, </em>was installed at <a href=\"https://www.hastingscontemporary.org/\">Hastings Contemporary</a> in the Spring of 2020. Here are Lakwena’s words about these paintings:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“I’m an artist and a mother, and I’m looking at where those two roles cross over. My art is concerned with mythologies; things we hold to be true, and I want to tell the truth to my kids. I know that they go out into the big wide world and I can’t control what happens out there. They’ll hear things and be influenced by things that I have no control over. But I can ensure that in my home I am sending them clear messages about who they are, their value, their worth, what to do in times of need, where to go to for help, what to set their hearts on, what is important. So that’s what these paintings are about. They contain words of affirmation, words that will encourage, warn and inspire. </em></p>\n<p><em>My intention is to create a safe space. As these paintings and images of them travel, literally and virtually, my hope is that they might act as sparks to encourage others to define spaces of safety, and also as signs to point people to places of safety.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>So beautiful, in both execution and message.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 08:00:37 +0000","feedId":16219,"bgimg":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lakwena_macivor.jpg","linkMd5":"0fa4ad88c6880c170e5e0b185ff79153","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn73@2020_2/2021/09/28/13-14-25-406_13df772faf1c211b.webp","destWidth":584,"destHeight":4176,"sourceBytes":1869132,"destBytes":261532,"author":"the jealous curator","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lakwena_macivor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn73@2020_2/2021/09/28/13-14-25-406_13df772faf1c211b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632834857953}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 21:14:17","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 21:14:17","feedId":16219,"fetchDate":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 13:14:17 +0000","fetchMs":7657,"handleMs":14128,"totalMs":30257,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bc1eecef1292254c09de6c1e66b750f3","hostName":"europe62*","requestId":"e2f567e01c4741219e22e52fa2b0e677_16219","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":261532,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:12:21","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:30:53","id":16219,"name":"The Jealous Curator","url":"http://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/feed/","subscriber":206,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":261532,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1632834836058,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":7768,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":14128,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lakwena_macivor.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":584,"destHeight":4176,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn73@2020_2/2021/09/28/13-14-25-406_13df772faf1c211b.webp","sourceBytes":1869132,"destBytes":261532,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":16219,"totalSpendMs":8334,"convertSpendMs":107,"createdTime":"2021-09-28 21:14:17","host":"europe-22*","referer":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/?p=38235","linkMd5ListStr":"0fa4ad88c6880c170e5e0b185ff79153,0fa4ad88c6880c170e5e0b185ff79153","githubUser":"myreaderx","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.8 MB","destSize":"255.4 KB","compressRate":"14%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
