A new way to spin-up pages and sites with blocks.","link":"https://studiopress.blog/?p=4571","description":"\n<p>The good stuff just keeps coming! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week we rolled out a major release for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-blocks\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis Blocks</a> that introduced a new feature called Collections. Collections are “collections” of sections and full-page layouts, built from blocks, that are all beautifully designed and consistent in style. You’re able to access Collections via the layouts block in your WordPress sites editor when Genesis Blocks is installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-4571\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>This gif here gives you a good overview of how this is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ODcx6OQUerR5SyqjoZhNZRytSgwHEniptVTUSDERIMUzNtcqigcdP5iTN07O_5DsZr3ZSFA71UOXT9Xv9Kh4I_fJOLV7dMf4A261p-zQiLfZZM1UizlBMGS6Nod4OJ9dKv6zvNUe\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever need to spin up a new site and have it close to production-ready, Collections can really <em>really</em> speed this up. You instantly have full pages of content, all looking amazing, that you can go through and tweak to meet your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 3 big things to understand about Collections:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. A new vehicle for demo content</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collections introduce a new “demo content” mechanism for the block editor. If you’ve been around WordPress themeing for a while, the concept of one-click style insertion of demo content on a site is nothing new. In the block context though, Collections gives this a whole new meaning. Expect to see this feature evolve over time to further streamline rapid content and site creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. The library will grow.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Out the door today we have 4 collections. Slate, which is available to all users of Genesis Blocks, as well as Tangerine, Agency, and Monochrome for <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/genesis-pro\">Genesis Pro</a> subscribers. We’ll be adding to this library over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tqQ4GqX-DMwZPYHXFPeFwxJyFqqsSWtLsHrH83vFOpSaSQtxAASCYj_UEccJ12KoKObuK_6wUmpEj9Aiz9gzH4F27Zi5PHG8zCJnNHF44fJ8D8973lu5z_71GB-ebxh4l6oeWhBv\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can explore all the Collections we&#8217;re launching with <a href=\"https://genesisplay.wpengine.com/tangerine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">over here on this demo site.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Extendable by the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We currently support Collections that ship with the plugin, but we are working on making this mechanism something community members can work with to build out their own Collections.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Started</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color\">Collections are ready to go now. Simply update to the latest version of Genesis Blocks.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 19:51:26 +0000","feedId":39262,"bgimg":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ODcx6OQUerR5SyqjoZhNZRytSgwHEniptVTUSDERIMUzNtcqigcdP5iTN07O_5DsZr3ZSFA71UOXT9Xv9Kh4I_fJOLV7dMf4A261p-zQiLfZZM1UizlBMGS6Nod4OJ9dKv6zvNUe","linkMd5":"8021300ab34edd1adacd9402c1a3a722","author":"Rob Stinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ODcx6OQUerR5SyqjoZhNZRytSgwHEniptVTUSDERIMUzNtcqigcdP5iTN07O_5DsZr3ZSFA71UOXT9Xv9Kh4I_fJOLV7dMf4A261p-zQiLfZZM1UizlBMGS6Nod4OJ9dKv6zvNUe":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn94@2020_2/2020/11/15/23-14-21-189_56108f7bf222951c.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tqQ4GqX-DMwZPYHXFPeFwxJyFqqsSWtLsHrH83vFOpSaSQtxAASCYj_UEccJ12KoKObuK_6wUmpEj9Aiz9gzH4F27Zi5PHG8zCJnNHF44fJ8D8973lu5z_71GB-ebxh4l6oeWhBv":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn97@2020_5/2020/11/15/23-12-26-427_9639b4e02e6867ac.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605481823861}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 07:10:23","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 07:10:23","feedId":39262,"fetchDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:10:23 +0000","fetchMs":26,"handleMs":25,"totalMs":244605,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"dedd5ccb1467a2e80e3f6fe114b81f8e","hostName":"europe69*","requestId":"13fd6ebe8f324d03ae4ea7db049bd3c8_39262","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":4053596,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx2":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:16:49","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:32:38","id":39262,"name":"StudioPress","url":"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/studiopress","subscriber":82,"website":null,"icon":"https://studiopress.blog/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn50@2020_2/2020/09/06/21-32-32-703_5da4c4b7e869e924.jpg","description":"The Premier Publishing Resource for Designers, Developers, and Bloggers","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 07:14:28","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 07:14:28","id":null,"feedId":39262,"linkMd5":"8021300ab34edd1adacd9402c1a3a722"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":4053596,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605481823778,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":58,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":25,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":118673,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":123007,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tqQ4GqX-DMwZPYHXFPeFwxJyFqqsSWtLsHrH83vFOpSaSQtxAASCYj_UEccJ12KoKObuK_6wUmpEj9Aiz9gzH4F27Zi5PHG8zCJnNHF44fJ8D8973lu5z_71GB-ebxh4l6oeWhBv","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1135,"destHeight":1500,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn97@2020_5/2020/11/15/23-12-26-427_9639b4e02e6867ac.webp","sourceBytes":557025,"destBytes":144010,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":39262,"totalSpendMs":2025,"convertSpendMs":513,"createdTime":"2020-11-16 07:12:25","host":"us-009*","referer":"https://studiopress.blog/?p=4571","linkMd5ListStr":"8021300ab34edd1adacd9402c1a3a722","githubUser":"myreaderx2","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"544 KB","destSize":"140.6 KB","compressRate":"25.9%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ODcx6OQUerR5SyqjoZhNZRytSgwHEniptVTUSDERIMUzNtcqigcdP5iTN07O_5DsZr3ZSFA71UOXT9Xv9Kh4I_fJOLV7dMf4A261p-zQiLfZZM1UizlBMGS6Nod4OJ9dKv6zvNUe","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1276,"destHeight":714,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn94@2020_2/2020/11/15/23-14-21-189_56108f7bf222951c.webp","sourceBytes":11537696,"destBytes":3909586,"targetWebpQuality":22,"feedId":39262,"totalSpendMs":56091,"convertSpendMs":40469,"createdTime":"2020-11-16 07:13:26","host":"us-009*","referer":"https://studiopress.blog/?p=4571","linkMd5ListStr":"8021300ab34edd1adacd9402c1a3a722,8021300ab34edd1adacd9402c1a3a722","githubUser":"myreaderx25","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"11 MB","destSize":"3.7 MB","compressRate":"33.9%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx2":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
