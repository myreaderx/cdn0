As of this week, you&#8217;ll find all new DALS content over at my brand new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://dinneralovestory.substack.com/subscribe?\" target=\"_blank\">Substack</a> platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are like me, and detest transitions, you will probably need some reassurance right away and so here it is:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing terrible is happening! In fact it&#8217;s the opposite! I will continue to post recipes, news about <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.dinneralovestory.com/some-news/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Weekday Vegetarians</em>,</a> and the &#8220;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.dinneralovestory.com/category/project-pantry-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\">Pantry, Project, Purpose</a>&#8221; series a few times a week, and you can access all that the same way you&#8217;ve always accessed it. The biggest difference is that now my posts will <em>also</em> automatically be delivered to your inbox, newsletter-style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All of this will be FREE as always!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fun part is that this new platform allows me to experiment with new ways to create a tighter community, so if you decide to become a paid subscriber, that means you’ll get content <em>on top of</em> what you&#8217;re used to: additional recipes and subscriber-only access to live chats with me about menu ideas (i.e., Tell Me What’s in Your Fridge), reader Q+A’s, comment threads, podcasts, personalized, insider book previews, detailed daily vacation itineraries, and a lot more I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll come up with as we go along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you’ll also be supporting Dinner: A Love Story as it heads into its next decade — and that means more to me than you can imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After blogging for ten years, all of this feels new and interactive and in spite of my terror, I&#8217;m really fired up to see what we can do with it. As my new favorite person <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexipappas/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Alexi Pappas</a> says, &#8220;Pay attention to when you&#8217;re nervous. It usually means something exciting is happening.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.dinneralovestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FullSizeRender-1-1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-58804\" srcset=\"https://www.dinneralovestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FullSizeRender-1-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.dinneralovestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FullSizeRender-1-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.dinneralovestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FullSizeRender-1-1-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://www.dinneralovestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FullSizeRender-1-1-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://www.dinneralovestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FullSizeRender-1-1-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">If you&#8217;re already a DALS newsletter subscriber</span>, but you want to try out the upgrades, or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if you&#8217;re not a subscriber,</span> you can <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://dinneralovestory.substack.com/subscribe?\" target=\"_blank\">do either of those things here</a> (it takes 2.5 seconds).
