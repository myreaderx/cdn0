What a cutie pie. After a couple goes with actors who looked to be in their early 30s (but in a very handsome way, fellas), we finally got to see what an actual young person might bring to the big screen as Peter Parker. It turns out High School is a good age for Spider-Man. Who knew?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A smaller Spider-Man meant smaller Spider-Man stories, but the MCU had no problem introducing their most famous character as little more than a spice in the Superhero stew that was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captain America: Civil War</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. What would normally be their biggest character introduction ever was more of a charming comedy scene where Iron Man hits on Aunt May, and audiences ate it up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, Spider-Man would eventually get his own movie(s). A character that big, played with the amount of charm wielded by Tom Holland, isn’t something you let go to waste, especially if you’re the MCU. But that doesn’t mean they put their new hero in the middle of a galactic war or anything (that would come with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movie). Instead,</span><strong><i> Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just a little film about a little hero dealing with little things. And through these modest pursuits, it also contains one of the MCU’s most menacing scenes.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642893\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB5HTcFhCso?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><b>The Scene</b></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homecoming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s villain is Adrian Toomes – The Vulture – portrayed here as kind of a wealthy construction worker type by former Batman Michael Keaton. He is not what you’d call a heavy hitter. The Vulture can&#8230; fly. He has a decent business going and some modified alien tech to protect his interests. A napping Iron Man could wipe him out with a drone or something and never even know he was there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes him a good villain for Peter Parker’s first MCU movie. Not too big, not too dangerous, just right for teaching Parker some life lessons. And that’s how most of it goes. Peter’s central conflict is whether or not he’ll adequately impress his father figure Tony Stark (no Uncle Ben business for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Peter Parker). He faces no real physical danger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That safety ends in a surprisingly abrupt fashion, however, when Peter realizes his Homecoming date’s father is also his nemesis, Adrian Toomes. It gets worse as Parker finds himself stuck in a car with Toomes while driving to the big dance. Then it gets even worse than that as Toomes – small-time but not stupid – deduces Parker’s alternate identity. We learn early in the film that Peter enjoys pickles. That is good because he’s in one now.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Why It’s Great</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many young folks have to suffer through a strict talking-to from a date’s father. It’s one of those youthful rights of passage only the lucky among us get to skip. You’re terrified but also can’t look weak; the dad is putting on a show but also needs to make sure you’re not a creep. It’s a tough dance that no one enjoys.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homecoming </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes this quite a bit further as Toomes begins by pulling out a pistol. Sticking with the metaphor, things do begin with an acknowledgment of respect. Toomes knows Spider-Man saved his daughter’s life, and has to admit his appreciation. But then he gets to threatening Peter’s world if he continues messing around in Toomes’ business. He is a villain after all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot goes into this scene’s greatness. It’s well-scripted and not just with the dialogue – the entire scene’s complicated construction deserves praise. Nevertheless, this is all about Michael Keaton’s performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MCU gets a lot of slack for their bad villains. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homecoming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came during an era where that was getting turned around a bit thanks to the likes of Erik Killmonger and, of course, Thanos. Toomes’ smaller scale makes him easy to overlook, but Keaton’s abnormally terrifying here simply by feeling so real and human, as familiar as a friend’s intimidating dad. Toomes may be evil-ish, but you weirdly want Peter to earn his respect. Peter, meanwhile, takes this confrontation in silent embarrassment, never feeling more like a child. He can’t even look Toomes in the eye.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So no, Toomes is not going down as an all-timer MCU villain. But in this one scene, he delivers more genuine menace than these characters usually get. And hey! That’s probably why they chose not to kill the guy.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What If?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter is a hero. So he immediately ditches the dance, ignores Toomes’ warning, and gets back to work foiling his plans. But what if he didn’t? It would be super weird if he just quit being a hero and enjoyed the dance like a normal teenager. Except that’s kind of what I wanted him to do. At least for that night! The whole Toomes thing could have waited until morning. Let Peter off the hook just this once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s one what-if. The other is, hey, what if Peter just grabbed Toomes’ gun in the car and took him out right there and then? Toomes wouldn’t have stood a chance against Parker’s reflexes and speed. It would have been over in two seconds, end of movie! Personally, I choose to believe Parker was too scared to even consider it, which makes me like him – and this scene – even more. But still. 40-year-old Andrew Garfield Spider-Man totally would have snagged that gun. And then given Toomes’ a wedgie or something.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/best-scene-in-spider-man-homecoming/\">The Best Scene in &#8216;Spider-Man: Homecoming&#8217; is a Showcase for Michael Keaton&#8217;s Terrific Villain</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ltOuLUKi3PY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:00:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Best-Scene-in-Spider-Man-Homecoming-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"85a797f4371bc556d086481fc457536e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-30-224_2e6531b96b19216f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":17549,"destBytes":8194,"author":"Evan Saathoff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Best-Scene-in-Spider-Man-Homecoming-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-30-224_2e6531b96b19216f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-15-888_70c64916c5296922.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ltOuLUKi3PY:Hj7hOo4b00M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ltOuLUKi3PY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn10@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-16-866_3ac2fe36b1921611.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609708},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"‘Assassin’s Creed’ Live-Action TV Series in the Works at Netflix, Animated Spin-Offs to Follow","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643101","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643108\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/assassins-creed-1-700x297.jpg\" alt=\"assassin's creed tv series\" width=\"700\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/assassins-creed-1-700x297.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/assassins-creed-1-360x153.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/assassins-creed-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/assassins-creed-1.jpg 1027w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Every few years, Hollywood will attempt yet again to adapt a video game for the screen, and you don&#8217;t even need every finger on one hand to count the number of times it has worked out well. One example of when it did work: Netflix&#8217;s <em>The Witcher</em>, the hit Henry Cavill-led fantasy adventure series based on both the popular video game franchise and books by Andrzej Sapkowski. And it seems like Netflix will be trying to replicate that <em>Witcher</em> magic with a TV series adaptation of Ubisoft&#8217;s <strong><em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-643101\"></span></p>\n<p>Netflix has struck a deal with <strong>Ubisoft</strong> to develop live-action, animated, and anime series based on the international best-selling video game franchise <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>. First up: a live-action <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> TV series.</p>\n<p>Described as an &#8220;epic, genre-bending&#8221; live-action adaptation, per Deadline, the <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> TV series will be executive Ubisoft Film &#38; Television&#8217;s Jason Altman and Danielle Kreinik, and is currently on the hunt for a showrunner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re excited to partner with Ubisoft and bring to life the rich, multilayered storytelling that <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is beloved for,&#8221; Peter Friedlander, Netflix VP, Original Series, said in a statement. &#8220;From its breathtaking historical worlds and massive global appeal as one of the best selling video game franchises of all time, we are committed to carefully crafting epic and thrilling entertainment based on this distinct IP and provide a deeper dive for fans and our members around the world to enjoy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For more than 10 years, millions of fans around the world have helped shape the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> brand into an iconic franchise,&#8221; added Jason Altman, Head of Ubisoft Film &#38; Television – Los Angeles. &#8220;We’re thrilled to create an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series with Netflix and we look forward to developing the next saga in the Assassin’s Creed universe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Netflix made the announcement on Twitter, where it debuted a logo for the <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> series.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Netflix + Assassin&#39;s Creed <a href=\"https://t.co/yI2sItnMgi\">pic.twitter.com/yI2sItnMgi</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; NX (@NXOnNetflix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1321081578697621508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> launched in 2007 and quickly grew into a hit franchise, selling more than 155 million games worldwide and becoming one of the best-selling videogame series of all time. Hollywood was quick to take notice, jumping on the property to adapt it into a feature film directed by Justin Kurzel and starring Michael Fassbender in 2016 (<a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/assassins_creed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to disastrous results</a>).</p>\n<p>Ubisoft has been determined to bring <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> to the screen since the 2016 film flopped both commercially and critically, first signaling plans to turn the franchise into a TV series in 2017. And now, through their deal with Netflix, they&#8217;ve got a whole <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> multimedia universe.</p>\n<p>This could probably be best described as Netflix putting the cart before the horse. The streamer had a surprise hit on their hands with <em>The Witcher</em> (a hyper-violent, hyper-camp series that miraculously worked) and has been eager to farm that success for content — greenlighting anime series, spin-offs, and what have you. And it seems like Netflix thinks it can make lightning strike twice with <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>. But video game adaptations have a spotty track record in Hollywood, and there&#8217;s no way of knowing whether this live-action series could be enough of a hit to warrant a whole franchise.

However, the interior looks exactly how it appeared in the <em>Pacific Rim</em> movies.</p>\n<p>When the <em>Pacific Rim</em> anime was first announced, we heard the series was about an idealistic teen boy and his naïve younger sister who are forced to pilot an abandoned Jaeger across a hostile landscape in a desperate attempt to find their missing parents.

Clearly it&#8217;s been busy destroying some infrastructure, as the smoke lingering behind it indicates. This is quite a beefy kaiju, and the glow underneath the rough, dark skin is a little reminiscent of the creatures from <em>Attack the Block</em>. But instead of the teeth only glowing, it&#8217;s almost as if there&#8217;s a layer of aqua-colored magma covering it.</p>\n<p>So far, this just looks like a <em>Pacific Rim</em> movie with an anime filter on it. That&#8217;s fine, but as an anime, <em>Pacific Rim</em> has an uphill battle to stand out from the rest of the mecha versus kaiju projects that are out there. It might be a nice entry point for <em>Pacific Rim</em> fans to get into anime, but will it be satisfying for longtime fans of the Japanese animation medium?

Netflix will release the series sometime in 2021, but there&#8217;s no specific release date yet.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pacific-rim-anime-photos/\">&#8216;Pacific Rim&#8217; Anime First Look Images Return to the World of Giant Monsters and Robots</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/oLHpXXh_fis\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:30:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pacificrim-theblack-kaiju-frontpage-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e74eeb78be5bdb35e5740885f2e4e193","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn30@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-30-050_1b34d64c986d2844.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":23606,"destBytes":13264,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pacificrim-theblack-kaiju-frontpage-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn30@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-30-050_1b34d64c986d2844.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pacificrim-theblack-insidejaeger-700x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-15-030_578ba52573e01832.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pacificrim-theblack-kaiju-700x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-652_f1154ed4393275c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn51@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-16-250_02bbb022252d612b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oLHpXXh_fis:QUbs81H4Sm4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn85@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-209_dce8b620ac909e25.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/oLHpXXh_fis":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-16-067_134c55956063d364.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609708},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"‘Selena: The Series’ Trailer: A Tejano Star is Born in New Netflix Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642960","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-642969\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer-700x312.jpg\" alt=\"selena the series trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer-700x312.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer-768x342.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Get ready to bidi bidi bom bom your way to Netflix this December for <strong><em>Selena: The Series</em></strong>, the drama series adaptation of the life of <strong>Selena Quintanilla</strong>, the &#8220;Queen of Tejano Music&#8221; whose meteoric career was tragically cut short.

Well first, <strong>Christian Serratos </strong>looks the part of iconic Tejano singer Selena — donning the feathered bangs and signature red lips — but amusingly, almost appears to be doing Lopez doing Selena. Maybe it&#8217;s because of the love that audiences still have for 1997&#8217;s <em>Selena</em>, or because Serratos just happens to resemble Lopez, that this physical similarity is highlighted in the official trailer for <em>Selena: The Series</em>, but it&#8217;s an interesting coincidence.</p>\n<p><em>Selena: The Series</em> is a two-part coming-of-age drama series that follows a young Selena as she rises from unknown Mexican-American child singer to one of the most beloved Tejano divas of all time. <strong>Christian Serratos</strong> (best known for her supporting roles in <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>Twilight</em> franchises) steps into Lopez&#8217;s shoes as Selena Quintanilla, a born star who gets dubbed the &#8220;Queen of Tejano music&#8221; for her crossover success from Mexico to America, before her tragic death in 1995 at the age of 23. Also starring in the series are <strong>Julio Macias, Jesse Posey, Hunter Reese Peña, </strong>and <strong>Carlos Alfredo, Jr</strong>. set as series regulars and <strong>Juan Martinez, Daniela Estrada, </strong>and<strong> Paul Rodriguez, Jr</strong>. in recurring roles.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Selena: The Series</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before she became the Queen of Tejano Music, Selena Quintanilla was a young girl from Texas with big dreams and an even bigger voice. The two-part coming-of-age drama Selena: The Series explores the once-in-a-generation performer’s journey as a young artist, from singing small gigs in Corpus Christi with her family to becoming one of the most successful Latin artists of all time — and the years of grit and sacrifice the Quintanilla family navigated together before Selena’s meteoric rise to fame. From executive producers Jaime Dávila, Rico Martinez, Hiromi Kamata, Suzette Quintanilla, Simran A. Singh and Moises Zamora, Selena: The Series was created by Zamora, with Don Todd (“This is Us”) consulting, and stars Christian Serratos, Gabriel Chavarria, Ricardo Chavira, Noemí Gonzalez, and Seidy López.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Part one of the two-part <em>Selena: The Series</em> premieres on Netflix on <strong>December 4, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/selena-the-series-trailer-official/\">&#8216;Selena: The Series&#8217; Trailer: A Tejano Star is Born in New Netflix Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/TfCuHjdXRCU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:30:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer-700x312.jpg","linkMd5":"e2f29441531aa9845ef8192da55ebbed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-30-122_b7e6313df8fd6c0d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":312,"sourceBytes":15794,"destBytes":7644,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/selena-the-series-trailer-700x312.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-30-122_b7e6313df8fd6c0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn48@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-324_fe2cfc165f307803.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TfCuHjdXRCU:KJ2ND-9r9UU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-431_a4450e1e2ec5a64e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/TfCuHjdXRCU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-806_cc40440730ba49fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"‘Mank’ is Supposed to Look, and Sound, Like a Long-Lost Older Film","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642941","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-642962\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mank cinematography\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>David Fincher</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Mank</em></strong> is headed our way, marking Fincher&#8217;s return to feature filmmaking after 2014&#8217;s <em>Gone Girl</em>. The feature will see Fincher heading back to Hollywood in the 1930s, telling the story of Herman J. Mankiewicz, writer of <em>Citizen Kane</em>. It&#8217;s Fincher&#8217;s first movie in black and white, and in a new interview, Fincher details the work that went into not just making a black and white movie, but making a movie that&#8217;s <em>supposed</em> to look – and sound – old.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642941\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Mank</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSfX-nrg-lI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen <em>Mank</em>, and while I&#8217;m embargoed from telling you what I think of the film, I <em>can</em> tell you that it has a very interesting aesthetic, with Fincher and company attempting to recreate the vibe of an old movie both from the visuals and the sound design. Speaking with <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/10/david-fincher-mank.html\">Vultur</a>e, Fincher talked about how he and his team worked to create that effect. &#8220;Ren Klyce, who is the sound designer, and I started talking years ago about how we wanted to make this feel like it was found in the UCLA archives — or in Martin Scorsese’s basement on its way to restoration,&#8221; the director said. &#8220;Everything has been compressed and made to sound like the 1940s. The music has been recorded with older microphones so it has a sort of sizzle and wheeze around the edges — you get it from strings, but you mostly get it from brass. What you’re hearing is a revival house — an old theater playing a movie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The result: audio that sounds like it&#8217;s echoing off the walls of a cavernous movie theater. That may sound distracting, but it works in the context of the film. &#8220;We went three weeks over schedule on the mix trying to figure out how to split that atom,&#8221; Fincher said. &#8220;[Visually,] our notion was we’re going to shoot super-high resolution and then we’re going to degrade it. So we took almost everything and softened it to an absurd extent to try to match the look of the era. We probably lost two-thirds of the resolution in order to make it have the same feel, and then we put in little scratches and digs and cigarette burns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cigarette burns are the tiny, round blips that are meant to signal the person running the projector to change reels. You don&#8217;t see really them anymore since most movie theaters use automated projectors. But back in the old days, someone had to pay attention to make sure to change the reel over after spotting one of those circles in the upper corner of the screen. Technically, they&#8217;re called &#8220;cue marks&#8221; but the term &#8220;cigarette burns&#8221; was popularized by Fincher himself, in his film <em>Fight Club</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made the soundtrack pop like it does when you do a reel changeover,&#8221; Fincher said of the cue marks in <em>Mank</em>. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most comforting sounds in my life. They’re so little that they’re very difficult to hear until you hear them. It has what we ended up calling patina, these tiny little pops and crackles that happen, and they’re very beautiful.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Mank</em> hits Netflix on <strong>December 4</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mank-cinematography/\">&#8216;Mank&#8217; is Supposed to Look, and Sound, Like a Long-Lost Older Film</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZdT6VcUcViY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:30:51 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"b99a35996c626427e08b7c5b8f050536","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn28@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-44-455_63c1c05a7c3ce33e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":36445,"destBytes":22746,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mank-cinematography-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn28@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-44-455_63c1c05a7c3ce33e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn86@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-15-808_d2f13bcc863ba814.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZdT6VcUcViY:JeUwDmPgzTE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn26@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-14-835_4f910be076d7ab41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZdT6VcUcViY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-15-876_57f2d571d403b333.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609714},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"‘The Spaceman of Bohemia’ Will Unite the Director of ‘Chernobyl’ With Adam Sandler","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642995","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-643038 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Adam-Sandler-space-movie-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Sandler space movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Adam-Sandler-space-movie.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Adam-Sandler-space-movie-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Adam Sandler</strong> is heading to space in his next Netflix movie.</p>\n<p>But despite its somewhat goofy title, <em><strong>The Spaceman of Bohemia</strong></em> will not be a comedy like <em>Hubie Halloween</em>, <em>Murder Mystery</em>, or <em>The Ridiculous 6</em>.

Talk about an unexpected combination of elements.<span id=\"more-642995\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Johan Renck (<em>Breaking Bad</em>, <em>The Walking</em> <em>Dead</em>, <em>Vikings</em>) is set to direct <em>The Spaceman of Bohemia</em>, which is based on Jaroslav Kalfar&#8217;s 2017 novel. Sandler will play an astronaut who is selected to go on a dangerous mission: he must travel to a mysterious cloud of particles called Chopra, suspended between Earth and Venus, and collect samples to find out what it is. (I&#8217;m sensing some shades of &#8220;the Shimmer&#8221; from <em>Annihilation</em>.) But once he leaves Earth, the astronaut &#8220;finds his earthly life falling to pieces and he turns to the only voice who can help him try to put it back together. It just so happens to belong to a creature from the beginning of time lurking in the shadows of his ship.&#8221; Whoa. Yes, please. That sounds amazing.</p>\n<p>For the most part, I have nothing against Adam Sandler&#8217;s comedies. They&#8217;re goofy and dumb, sometimes charmingly so, and they give audiences mainstream Hollywood comedies in an era where those are rapidly disappearing. (They also give Sandler the chance to travel the world and make movies in cool locations with his family and friends, which is pretty much the textbook definition of the phrase &#8220;living the dream.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>But something special happens when Sandler agrees to be in a drama. There&#8217;s spark in the air, jolting through us with flashes of <em>Uncut Gems</em>, <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>, and <em>Funny People</em> to remind us of the potential Sandler has to absolutely crush a role when he puts his mind to it. Again, no shade on those cheesy comedies – it takes a whole separate skill to be able to pull those off the way he does – but as someone who doesn&#8217;t particularly care for the <em>Hubie Halloweens</em> and <em>The Do-Overs</em> of the world, this is something I can get excited about.</p>\n<p>Up-and-coming screenwriter <strong>Colby Day</strong> is writing the script, and <strong>Channing Tatum</strong>, <strong>Reid Carolin</strong>, <strong>Peter Kiernan</strong>, and <strong>Michael Parets</strong> will serve as producers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we prepare for our voyage to Chopra, I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased to have found the perfect partner in Adam,&#8221; Renck said in a statement. &#8220;And now, with the support of the brilliant Netflix family, I am profoundly excited to set off on our impossible journey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/adam-sandler-space-movie/\">&#8216;The Spaceman of Bohemia&#8217; Will Unite the Director of &#8216;Chernobyl&#8217; With Adam Sandler</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/GAgDSlmeiDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 21:30:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Adam-Sandler-space-movie-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"287ad43e216d0fc43f0c49a3c8d7a1bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-09-184_7a3859eb3739f4a5.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33951,"destBytes":21780,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Adam-Sandler-space-movie-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-09-184_7a3859eb3739f4a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn50@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-14-909_53342bef01b2eb01.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GAgDSlmeiDY:eMK0dlH6thY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn14@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-14-759_ef28acf143a53080.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/GAgDSlmeiDY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-16-819_910e8f35f6614b1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"The CW’s New ‘Batwoman’ Gets a New Suit: See Javicia Leslie in the Redesigned Batsuit","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642976","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-642983 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Batwoman-suit-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Batwoman suit\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Batwoman-suit.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Batwoman-suit-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Back in September, we got a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-batwoman-first-look-photo-javicia-leslie/\">first look</a> at <em><strong>Batwoman</strong></em> series star <strong>Javicia Leslie</strong> suited up in costume for the first time. But it turns out that her character, Ryan Wilder, was actually wearing previous Batwoman Kate Kane&#8217;s old suit in that image.</p>\n<p>Now we have a couple of new looks at the new Batwoman suit from The CW TV series, which has been redesigned to better fit Ryan Wilder&#8217;s personality. Check out the character&#8217;s new duds below.<span id=\"more-642976\"></span></p>\n<h2>New Batwoman Suit</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-642985 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Batwoman-suit-2-700x890.jpg\" alt=\"Batwoman suit 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"890\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Batwoman-suit-2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Batwoman-suit-2-360x458.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-642986 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Batwoman-suit-1-700x890.jpg\" alt=\"Batwoman suit 1\" width=\"700\" height=\"890\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Batwoman-suit-1.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Batwoman-suit-1-360x458.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>This has to be a pretty powerful thing for a huge segment of the population to see, since Leslie is the first Black actress to portray Batwoman in live-action. She&#8217;s playing Ryan Wilder, who will take over the mantle from Ruby Rose&#8217;s Kate Kane (Rose shocked the entertainment world when she <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ruby-rose-leaving-batwoman/\">left the show</a> after just one season). Leslie&#8217;s Wilder will wear Kate Kane&#8217;s suit for the first three episodes of season 2, but as she eases into her new role, she decides to redesign the costume to better match her personality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I love the fact that Ryan is becoming her own Batwoman — it&#8217;s her style, her swag, and her moment!&#8221; Leslie said in a statement. &#8220;I felt it was important that viewers could tell by the silhouette that Batwoman was a Black girl. With the form-fitting suit and beautiful Afro, we definitely nailed it!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Maya Mani</strong> is the costume designer responsible for the new look. &#8220;I was asked by [<em>Batwoman</em> executive producer] <strong>Caroline Dries</strong> to design a Batsuit that was unique to the character of Ryan Wilder; as she is a highly skilled fighter, encapsulating her raw, athletic, and passionate nature was imperative,&#8221; Mani said. &#8220;As Batwoman, Javicia Leslie not only brings a fresh perspective, but physical strength to the role. It was important for the new suit to define Javicia&#8217;s commanding presence while showcasing her athleticism and allowing her the freedom to express the physical nature of Batwoman, all while looking ultra-cool in the process!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the description of Leslie&#8217;s new character:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ryan Wilder is about to become Batwoman. She&#8217;s relatable, messy, loyal, a little goofy, and apart from being a lesbian, she couldn&#8217;t be more different than the woman who wore the Batsuit before her, billionaire Kate Kane. Ryan, who we meet living in her van with only her plant for company, has been made to feel trapped and powerless by the system her whole life, and believes the Batsuit is the key to breaking out of it. But what she&#8217;ll come to discover is that it&#8217;s not the suit that makes Ryan Wilder powerful, it&#8217;s the woman inside of it who finds her destiny in changing Gotham City for good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The series is expected to return to The CW in <strong>January 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-batwoman-suit/\">The

Each episode offers a thought-provoking look at how children learn to think, speak and move from birth to five-years-old, and underscores how different our journeys can be but ultimately tells the story of our shared humanity and community when it comes to raising children. The series is produced by Wall to Wall Media and is executive produced by Leanne Klein and Hamo Forsyth.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sounds very pleasant! But since I&#8217;m not a fan of children I&#8217;ll probably skip this.

As the twins&#8217; reunion reinvigorates them both, they realize that the key to fixing their lives just may lie in repairing their own relationship with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Viewing</strong>: In 2014, Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig had only been away from <em>Saturday Night Live</em> for a year or two. Wiig had already found big screen stardom thanks to <em>Bridesmaids</em>, and Hader was on his way thanks to some memorable supporting roles. But the two got a chance to showcase their versatility thanks to the Sundance selected indie <em>The Skeleton Twins</em>, a film that allowed the duo to tap into their comedic skills while effectively stretching their dramatic chops. Though the story follows a familiar festival film formula, it&#8217;s still emotionally engaging and delightfully entertaining.<span id=\"more-643085\"></span></p>\n<p><em>The Skeleton Twins</em> taps into the Sundance trope of following thirtysomethings who have no direction in their life, each barely hanging on by a thread, resenting each other for something in their past. But soon they figure out that what they really need is each other in order to get over this seemingly insurmountable hump in their life. It might take some more missteps for them to figure it out, and that&#8217;s what we get to see as they get their own coming-of-age kind of story.</p>\n<p>These kind of movies can be hit or miss, but thanks to a pair of grounded performances from Wiig and Hader, the movie feels instantly relatable. It&#8217;s a taste of the incredible performances to come from each of them in the years that would follow. There&#8217;s restraint in the comedic side of their performance. Various scenes could have easily been dominated by brilliant improvised one-liners, the kind that you see with extensive outtakes in Judd Apatow movies. While Hader and Wiig undoubtedly threw some of those gags around on set, director <strong>Craig Johnson</strong> knew to keep them firmly in check, putting more attention on the dramatic side of their performance. But at the same time,it never feels like you&#8217;re just watching comedians who are desperately trying to show that they can act. It all feels natural, and that&#8217;s largely because of the chemistry that Hader and Wiig built at Saturday Night Live.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say this movie isn&#8217;t funny though. For every moment of sadness or depression, there are still dry, and occasionally dark jokes. Even the most memorable part of this movie, a stellar lip sync sequence that brings the brother and sister together after a disagreement, isn&#8217;t as flashy as it could have been, and it&#8217;s instead made to feel like an intimate inside gag between the siblings. Watch it below, and then go watch this fantastic indie gem.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0npouzhhZTo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-the-skeleton-twins-showcases-a-dramatic-breakthrough-for-bill-hader-and-kristen-wiig/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;The Skeleton Twins&#8217; Showcases a Dramatic Breakthrough for Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CHwIaYq5dRo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:00:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/skeletontwins-billhader-kristenwiig-lipsync-700x293.jpg","linkMd5":"8d876d325b4653a5261f5d2fa5c8c23f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-30-159_ac6fbf9aecdd7f0f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":293,"sourceBytes":22920,"destBytes":13018,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/skeletontwins-billhader-kristenwiig-lipsync-700x293.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-30-159_ac6fbf9aecdd7f0f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn73@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-15-619_8b20315934ebc432.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CHwIaYq5dRo:jtuqRFtQno4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-982_909296d1eb062b53.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CHwIaYq5dRo":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609715},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"Idris Elba Film ‘Concrete Cowboy’ Will Trot Onto Netflix in 2021","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643041","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-636368 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"concrete cowboy netflix\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Idris Elba</strong> (<em>The Wire</em>, <em>Beasts of No Nation</em>) will be <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-characters-explained/\">appearing as Bloodsport</a> in James Gunn&#8217;s comic book movie <em>The Suicide Squad</em> next year, but he&#8217;ll be headlining a far more low key project in 2021 as well. <em><strong>Concrete Cowboy</strong></em>, a family drama starring Elba and <strong>Caleb McLaughlin</strong> (Lucas from <em>Stranger Things</em>), made its debut on this year&#8217;s film festival circuit and has now been picked up by Netflix.

The boy is sent to live with his old man and soon begins working at the nearby stables, reconnecting with a childhood friend (<em>Moonlight</em>&#8216;s <strong>Jharrel Jerome</strong>) but ultimately being forced to make a decision about the type of person he wants to become.</p>\n<p>/Film&#8217;s Chris Evangelista <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/concrete-cowboy-review/\">reviewed the movie</a> from this year&#8217;s (virtual) Toronto International Film Festival, where he observed that the movie can sometimes feel predictable and occasionally rings false with an overwritten speech or two. But in the grand scheme of things, it works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And yet…<em>Concrete Cowboy </em>succeeds,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Sure, you know where a lot of this is going, but there&#8217;s powerful filmmaking on display here. Cinematographer <strong>Minka Farthing-Kohl</strong> often creates situations where scenes are deliberately underlit, swallowed up in murky shadows. And then there are the daytime scenes, tinged yellow by a burning sun, to the point where we can almost feel the heat radiating off the concrete. A scene where Cole attempts to stand atop a horse while the sun is setting – the sky awash in purples and pinks while all we see of Cole and the horse are their silhouettes – is just breathtaking.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was also happy to read that Chris really enjoyed the central performances, pointing out that &#8220;McLaughlin, so underused on <em>Stranger Things</em>, shows real acting chops here, playing Cole as someone struggling to throw the chip off his shoulder,&#8221; and praising Elba for &#8220;finally finding a great role to suit his talents that have been thus far somewhat wasted by Hollywood.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Ricky Staub</strong>, who wrote the screenplay with <strong>Dan Walser</strong>, makes his feature directorial debut here. Elba and Walser produced the movie with <strong>Lee Daniels</strong>, <strong>Tucker Tooley</strong>, <strong>Jeff G. Waxman</strong>, and <strong>Jennifer Madeloff</strong>. Though no official release date has been locked in yet, <em>Concrete Cowboy</em> will make its debut on Netflix sometime in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/concrete-cowboy-netflix/\">Idris Elba Film &#8216;Concrete Cowboy&#8217; Will Trot Onto Netflix in 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/QemDwTD88uw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 22:30:28 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"778fdbae94299cefbb7732258d5acfb5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-43-169_c3dcd8709b22f04e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":50440,"destBytes":36334,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/concrete-cowboy-review-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-43-169_c3dcd8709b22f04e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-894_5ac9c93140fb019d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QemDwTD88uw:3IPUHXkEG0A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn81@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-176_989011763873a70c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/QemDwTD88uw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-14-824_b27425c5862c4334.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609711},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"The Morning Watch: ‘The Mandalorian’ Becomes an Anime, ‘X-Men: The Animated Series’ Cast Reunion & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643067","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-643070 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-anime-credits-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Anime\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-anime-credits.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-anime-credits-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-morning-watch/\">The Morning Watch</a> is a recurring feature that highlights a handful of noteworthy videos from around the web.

With the election fast approaching, I am stressed as heck, and that&#8217;s severely hampering my mood. I could use a good laugh. Thankfully, the latest <em>Avatar 2</em> behind-the-scenes image came to my rescue. Folks, I&#8217;m not going to blab away here about whether or not anyone cares about an <em>Avatar</em> sequel at this point. For all I know, James Cameron&#8217;s sequel is going to be the best movie ever made. But one thing is clear: the behind-the-scenes imagery is <em>very</em> funny. How could it not be? I mean&#8230;look at that. There you have respected, award-winning actress Kate Winslet wearing what appears to be a cape, her arms spread wide like Batman (or Dracula), strolling across the bottom of a water tank.

PT and running through <strong>November 10</strong>. At the same time, the e-mail also says that these four super limited edition 18&#215;24 linoleum block prints on 20&#215;30 Nepalese Lotka paper with deckled edges only have editions of 75 each, signed, stamped, and hand-numbered by the artist.

But if you&#8217;re craving just a glimpse of new footage, a new <em>Conjuring</em> featurette goes (briefly) behind-the-scenes of the new film, teasing a twist in the familiar <em>Conjuring</em> formula.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642908\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Conjuring 3 Footage</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tS9M-q8vFtc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The above featurette goes behind-the-scenes of <em>all</em> the films in The Conjuring Universe – including the upcoming <em>The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It</em><em>. </em>The footage is brief and almost entirely comprised of behind-the-scenes shots, not actual final footage. But still, it gives us a chance to check in with everyone&#8217;s favorite ghost-hunting couple, Ed and Lorraine Warren, played by<strong> Patrick Wilson</strong> and <strong>Vera Farmiga</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>James Wan</strong>, who directed the first two <em>Conjuring</em> films, isn&#8217;t at the helm this time. Instead, <strong>Michael Chaves</strong> has taken over directing duties, which is something that gives me pause. Chaves is no stranger to The Conjuring Universe – he directed <em>The Curse of La Llorona</em>, and therein lies the problem. <em>La Llorona</em><em> </em>is one of the lesser entries (it&#8217;s not quite as bad as the first <em>Annabelle</em> movie, but it&#8217;s worse than <em>The Nun</em>, and that&#8217;s saying something). I wish the franchise had just let Gary Dauberman, who helmed the surprisingly good <em>Annabelle Comes Home</em>, take over for Wan instead.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m willing to give Chaves another chance – because I love the <em>Conjuring</em> franchise in general, and I&#8217;m also a fan of Chaves&#8217; short horror film <em>The Maiden</em>, which you can watch below. If Chaves can make <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em> more like <em>The Maiden</em> and less like <em>La Llorona</em>, we&#8217;ll be in good shape.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/163109217?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"740\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen title=\"THE MAIDEN - short horror film\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The big reveal from the <em>Conjuring 3</em> footage is the confirmation that the new film is going to change up the formula a bit. The main <em>Conjuring</em> movies, and all of its subsequent spin-offs, have primarily dealt with haunted houses (or haunted old churches). But <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em> isn&#8217;t about a haunting. Instead, it draws inspiration from the true story of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. The real Johnson even shows up in the featurette. Here&#8217;s some background on the case:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On November 24, 1981, in Brookfield, Connecticut, Arne Cheyenne Johnson was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for the killing of his landlord, Alan Bono. According to testimony by the Glatzel family, 11-year-old David Glatzel had allegedly played host to the demon that forced Johnson to kill Bono. After witnessing a number of increasingly ominous occurrences involving David, the family, exhausted and terrified, decided to enlist the aid of self-described demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (noted for their investigation into the famed Amityville Haunting) in a last-ditch effort to &#8220;cure&#8221; David.</p>\n<p>The Glatzel family, along with the Warrens, then proceeded to have multiple priests petition the Church to have a formal exorcism performed on David. The process continued for several days, concluding when, according to those present, a demon fled the child&#8217;s body and took up residence within Johnson. Several months later, Johnson killed his landlord during a heated conversation. His defense lawyer argued in court that he was possessed, but the judge ruled that such a defense could never be proven and was therefore infeasible in a court of law. Johnson was subsequently convicted, though he only served five years of a 10- to 20-year sentence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And here is where I have to throw some cold water on the fire. Look, I love <em>The Conjuring</em> movies, especially the main ones. I love the relationship between Ed and Lorraine, primarily because of the way Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play the characters. But no matter how many times one of these movies slaps a &#8220;BASED ON A TRUE STORY!&#8221; label at the beginning, the fact of the matter is that the real Ed and Lorraine were <em>probably</em> frauds. I say &#8220;probably&#8221; because the afterlife is truly an unknowable quantity, so yeah, sure – maybe this random couple knew exactly how to see, and deal with, ghosts. But it&#8217;s <em>very</em> unlikely. And herein lies the problem: this is the first story in the franchise dealing with a crime.</p>\n<p>Up until now, the Warrens have been handling ghosts and demons that injure a lot of people but don&#8217;t have much of a body count. However, the Arne Johnson story involves a real person – Arne Johnson – murdering another real person, his landlord Alan Bono. And while Johnson is free now, he was convicted of the crime. His defense – that it was demonic possession that forced him to kill – just doesn&#8217;t hold up. Why? Because it&#8217;s not possible. It doesn&#8217;t happen. And to use that as a set-up for a new <em>Conjuring</em> movie feels just a tiny bit gross to me. It would be one thing if the film was just taking inspiration from the Johnson story and fictionalizing it, but the featurette has the real Johnson front and center talking about his experiences. Again: kind of gross. But I&#8217;m willing to give the film a chance when it arrives on <strong>June 4, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-conjuring-3-footage/\">&#8216;The Conjuring 3&#8217; Will Take Viewers Away From the Traditional Haunted House Set-Up</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/R7oo-LtQaSA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 20:00:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-footage-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"bdaf625bd710aa90a7fb3c2fc2f4042a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn5@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-35-934_54c6078d7dd8edd9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":46480,"destBytes":31302,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-footage-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn5@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-35-934_54c6078d7dd8edd9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn100@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-14-747_bbfd4edad0553fac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R7oo-LtQaSA:KwrLepi8PZI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-14-732_e86ceeec4da556af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/R7oo-LtQaSA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn63@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-16-021_0adc15095a9c6104.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609714},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"‘The Midnight Sky’ Trailer: George Clooney is the Last Man on Earth","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643091","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643093\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/PC_0160_dmp_marketingStill_v001_CMYK_f-e1603803712474-700x327.jpg\" alt=\"the midnight sky trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/PC_0160_dmp_marketingStill_v001_CMYK_f-e1603803712474-700x327.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/PC_0160_dmp_marketingStill_v001_CMYK_f-e1603803712474-360x168.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/PC_0160_dmp_marketingStill_v001_CMYK_f-e1603803712474-768x359.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>George Clooney</strong> leads a star-studded space epic that looks to the stars for humanity&#8217;s salvation.

Meanwhile, the crew of the Aether grown concerned about the silence coming from Earth and set a return course, led by mission specialist Sully (<strong>Felicity Jones</strong>), flight commander Adewole (<strong>David Oyelowo</strong>), flight engineer Maya (<strong>Tiffany Boone</strong>), pilot Mitchell (<strong>Kyle Chandler</strong>), and aerodynamicist Sanchez (<strong>Demián Bichir</strong>).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a survival drama meets space epic, and it&#8217;s one of Netflix&#8217;s biggest bids for a holiday tentpole.

Clooney, who also directs <em>The Midnight Sky</em>, appears to be giving his all in his first onscreen role in four years, and his past directorial efforts have mostly been critical darlings.

This post-apocalyptic tale follows Augustine (George Clooney), a lonely scientist in the Arctic, as he races to stop Sully (Felicity Jones) and her fellow astronauts from returning home to Earth, where a mysterious global catastrophe has taken place.

It&#8217;s the teasiest of teasers – 43 seconds of footage that essentially winks at the audience and says, &#8220;Check back with us later!&#8221; In the film, Clooney plays a scientist trying to stop a group of astronauts from returning to Earth because of a global catastrophe.

There&#8217;s David Fincher&#8217;s <em>Mank</em>, there&#8217;s <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em>, featuring Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman (in his final role), and then there&#8217;s <em>The Midnight Sky</em>, directed by and starring George Clooney. The post-apocalyptic film follows &#8220;Augustine (George Clooney), a lonely scientist in the Arctic, as he races to stop Sully (<strong>Felicity Jones</strong>) and her fellow astronauts from returning home to a mysterious global catastrophe.&#8221; The cast also features <strong>David Oyelowo</strong>, <strong>Kyle Chandler</strong>, <strong>Demián Bichir</strong>, and <strong>Tiffany Boone</strong>, and was adapted from the book <em>Good Morning, Midnight</em> by Lily Brooks-Dalton. The book synopsis gives us a bit more insight into what to expect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Augustine, a brilliant, aging astronomer, is consumed by the stars. For years he has lived in remote outposts, studying the sky for evidence of how the universe began. At his latest posting, in a research center in the Arctic, news of a catastrophic event arrives. The scientists are forced to evacuate, but Augustine stubbornly refuses to abandon his work. Shortly after the others have gone, Augustine discovers a mysterious child, Iris, and realizes that the airwaves have gone silent. They are alone.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Mission Specialist Sullivan is aboard the <i>Aether</i> on its return flight from Jupiter. The astronauts are the first human beings to delve this deep into space, and Sully has made peace with the sacrifices required of her: a daughter left behind, a marriage ended. So far the journey has been a success. But when Mission Control falls inexplicably silent, Sully and her crewmates are forced to wonder if they will ever get home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s no official release date at the moment – we just know that the flick will arrive on Netflix in December. And I&#8217;m guessing we&#8217;ll know the official date very soon, because the full <em>Midnight Sky</em> trailer arrives Tuesday, likely bringing that date along with more footage.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-midnight-sky-teaser/\">&#8216;The Midnight Sky&#8217; Teaser Asks &#8220;Is Anyone Out There?&#8221; Ahead of This Week&#8217;s Full Trailer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/hG4yNbUyBgM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:00:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-midnight-sky-teaser-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"4efeb66833627f9a72beda9a1d6314f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn35@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-36-319_dfd6760eed12193b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":25337,"destBytes":13920,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-midnight-sky-teaser-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn35@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-36-319_dfd6760eed12193b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-703_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-715_23f6be96bd29c46e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-16-838_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hG4yNbUyBgM:eH9yOI1m4yg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn77@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-15-634_fe8880e8e41d66c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/hG4yNbUyBgM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn65@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-15-675_0f32d53383fc5201.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817609711},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:29","title":"Richard Pryor Biopic to Be Written and Directed by ‘Black-ish’ Creator Kenya Barris","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642955","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-642974 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Richard-Pryor-biopic-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Pryor biopic\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Richard-Pryor-biopic.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Richard-Pryor-biopic-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>In 2009, Eddie Murphy was set to star in a <strong>Richard Pryor</strong> biopic for <em>Dreamgirls</em> director Bill Condon. Years later, Mike Epps was supposed to play Pryor for filmmaker Lee Daniels. Neither of those versions never ended up happening, but Hollywood is still itching to mine comedic and dramatic glory from Pryor&#8217;s whirlwind life.</p>\n<p><em>Black-ish</em> creator <strong>Kenya Barris</strong> is the latest person to take a swing at a Pryor biopic. A new report says Barris will write the script and make his feature directorial debut with the new movie, which MGM will distribute after winning a &#8220;heated&#8221; bidding war for the film rights.<span id=\"more-642955\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Kenya Barris will write and direct MGM&#8217;s Richard Pryor biopic, which will further immortalize the iconic comedian, writer, and actor. &#8220;A groundbreaking, once-in-a-lifetime talent, Richard Pryor was a masterful storyteller, a multi-talented entertainer, a comic of acerbic wit, and a survivor with no self-pity,&#8221; MGM said in a statement. &#8220;With his raw, honest and deeply personal approach to comedy, Pryor transformed the entire art form through his work, inspiring and influencing the generations of artists to come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pryor was one of the best stand-up comedians in history, loved by just about everyone and widely respected and revered by his peers. He was not only an incredible on-stage performer, but his career blossomed out into writing as well: he wrote or co-wrote episodes of <em>Sanford and Son</em>, <em>The Lily Tomlin Show</em>, and his own stand-up specials, and ended up directing a couple of them – including <em>Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling</em>, in which he reflected on the time he accidentally lit himself on fire while freebasing cocaine. Pryor also co-wrote the screenplay for <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, Mel Brooks&#8217; incredibly funny and controversial western comedy. In front of the camera, he appeared in more than 45 films and TV shows, including <em>Superman III</em>, <em>Uptown Saturday Night</em>, <em>Silver Streak</em>, <em>Harlem Nights</em>, <em>Brewster&#8217;s Millions</em>, and <em>Lost Highway</em>.</p>\n<p>Kenya Barris released a statement about his plans for the biopic: &#8220;The way Pryor did what he did — with truth and specificity that was somehow self-aware and self-deprecating, and said with an unmatched level of vulnerability – that was the power and impact of his work. Pryor had a voice that was distinctly his and, in many ways, comedy since then has been derivative of what he created.

Figures</h2>\n<p>Even though <em>The Mandalorian</em> wasn&#8217;t around when the original Star Wars toys hits shelves in 1978, Hasbro is pretending like they were by giving them Retro Collection action figures. These figures have a simple design, and some of them even come with those terribly vinyl capes and cloaks that characters like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi had. These are a fun faux flashback, and all the key characters are included. These will be available at various retailers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-643001 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-thechild-realmovesplush-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Baby Yoda Plush\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-thechild-realmovesplush.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-thechild-realmovesplush-360x203.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Mandalorian Real Moves The Child</h2>\n<p>If the dozens of other plush toys of The Child out there aren&#8217;t good enough for you, then this latest &#8220;Real Moves&#8221; plush that can be controlled with a wrist remote might be good for you.
