Recently, however, Microsoft has made a surprising move and marked CCleaner as a potentially unwanted application (PUA) for its Windows Defender antivirus.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore why Microsoft made this decision and what it means for you.</p>\n<h2>Why Windows Defender Now Labels CCleaner as a PUA</h2>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that CCleaner has made the news for the wrong reasons. In our article on <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-using-ccleaner-windows/\">why CCleaner isn&#8217;t safe</a>, we cover some of the past scandals that arose with the program.</p>\n<p>CCleaner had a tendency to install updates for itself without telling users, as well as monitoring what users were doing. Even worse, the software did the opposite of its job after a hacker used it to spread malware.</p>\n<p>Despite this troubled history, however, this isn&#8217;t the reason Microsoft has taken action. The company did ban links to it from its forums, stating that it believed registry editors did more harm than good. This recent marking as a PUA, however, is due to how the free version of CCleaner works.</p>\n<p>In a statement to <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-now-detects-ccleaner-as-a-potentially-unwanted-application/\">Bleeping Computer</a>, Microsoft said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our potentially unwanted application protection aims to safeguard user productivity. We detect instances anytime software offers to install other software that is not developed by the same entity or not required for the software to run, no matter the third party.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The free version shows users adverts for third-party programs, thus matching Microsoft&#8217;s definition of a PUA. The paid version of CCleaner has no such ads, and as such, Microsoft does not regard it as a PUA.</p>\n<h2>Should You Continue Using CCleaner?</h2>\n<p>If your Windows Defender flags your copy of CCleaner as a PUA, you can still continue to use it. It&#8217;s not malicious and it won&#8217;t install malware on your computer; it will just try to sell you third-party products.</p>\n<p>However, given the app&#8217;s shady history, you may want to move away from using CCleaner anyway. Instead of trying to make CCleaner work with Windows, you might be better off finding a replacement. In fact, in our guide to <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-way-clean-windows-10-step-step-guide/\">the best way to clean Windows 10</a>, we use tools that come pre-installed with every copy of the operating system.</p>\n<h2>Getting More Out of Windows Defender</h2>\n<p>Windows Defender now flags CCleaner as a potentially unwanted program due to it showing ads for third-party software. If you go to install the free version and Windows Defender stops it, now you know why.</p>\n<p>If you want to enhance your computer&#8217;s PUA-detecting skills, be sure to learn <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/block-third-party-junk-windows-defender/\">how to block third-party junk offers with Windows Defender</a>.</p>\n<p class='appexclude'>Read the full article: <a href='https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/microsoft-labels-ccleaner-potentially-unwanted-application/'>Microsoft Labels CCleaner a &#8220;Potentially Unwanted Application&#8221;</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:45:58 +0000","feedId":14,"bgimg":"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CCleaner-PUP-Featured.jpg","linkMd5":"4cf3a4fc6ce7b9f38b648f33bc593518","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn12@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513716717_b662b8608ec6827b.webp","author":"Simon Batt","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CCleaner-PUP-Featured.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn12@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513716717_b662b8608ec6827b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-04 12:01:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-04 12:01:56","title":"How to Solve Common Google Drive Issues: 10 Simple Solutions","link":"https://www.makeuseof.com/?p=566449","description":"<div><img width=\"1680\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/solve-drive-issues.jpg\" class=\"attachment-featured size-featured wp-post-image\" alt=\"solve-drive-issues\" /></div><p>Google Drive allows you to collaborate with others seamlessly. Also, it is integrated with lots of other services, and files are always accessible. Best of all, you get an ample amount of storage for free.</p>\n<p>Despite Google Drive&#8217;s excellence, there can be problems in accessing the service. You may not be able to clear out storage space, share files, or are unable to access a document. Thankfully, many Google Drive problems are easy to fix.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to offer some typical Google Drive troubleshooting tips that solve some specific Google Drive problems.</p>\n<h2>General Google Drive Troubleshooting Steps</h2>\n<p>These are some simple steps that you should try first. They can help diagnose and fix a variety of problems with Google Drive.</p>\n<h3>1. Check Google Drive&#8217;s Online Status</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/g-suite-status-670x307.png\" alt=\"Google app status\" width=\"670\" height=\"307\" /></p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&#38;v=status\">Google&#8217;s app status dashboard</a>. This lists all of Google&#8217;s services and tells you if there&#8217;s a known problem with them. If you see a &#8220;service disruption&#8221; or &#8220;service outage&#8221; indicator on the app you want to use, you can click on the colored dot to see details about when the service will be back online.</p>\n<p>If the problem with Google Drive is on Google&#8217;s end, unfortunately, the only thing you can do is wait for the outage to be over.</p>\n<h3>2. Disable Your Antivirus and Firewall</h3>\n<p>Antivirus and firewalls cause problems with syncing files or a &#8220;You are offline, some functionality may be unavailable&#8221; error. As such, try temporarily disabling your antivirus and firewall&#8212;just remember to turn them back on later.</p>\n<p>On Windows 10, disable Windows Defender with these steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press <strong>Windows key + I</strong> to open Settings.</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Update &#38; Security &#62; Windows Security &#62; Open Windows Security</strong>.</li>\n<li>Once here, go to <strong>Firewall &#38; Network Protection</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select your active network and slide <strong>Windows Defender Firewall</strong> to <strong>On</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>3. Restart Google Drive</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Google Drive via a web browser, log out, close your web browser, ensure your internet connection is reliable, and then log back in.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re using the Google Backup and Sync tool on the desktop, click the Backup and Sync icon in your system tray, click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon (three vertical dots) and click <strong>Quit Backup and Sync</strong>. Then reopen the app.</p>\n<h2>1. How to Get the Old Version of a File Back</h2>\n<p>Google Drive keeps a detailed edit history of any and all changes made on your document by any user who has editing permissions. To go back to an earlier save, go to <strong>File &#62; Version history &#62; See version history</strong>.</p>\n<p>Your history of changes made to the file should appear along the right-hand side of the document, and you can navigate through all the revisions made.</p>\n<h2>2. How to Recover a File That Has Disappeared</h2>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re the only one with access to the file:<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Check your <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/trash\">Google Drive trash folder</a>, accessible via <strong>Trash</strong> on the left-hand navigation. If you see the file that you&#8217;re looking for, right click it and select <strong>Restore</strong>. Your file will now be available in its original location.</p>\n<p>If your missing file isn&#8217;t in your trash, it&#8217;s possible that the name has been changed or it has been accidentally moved to another file. Thankfully, Google Drive&#8217;s search features are advanced. Try searching for your file using keywords or dates, and see if it&#8217;s in another location than the one you anticipated.</p>\n<p><strong>If there are multiple people working on the file: </strong></p>\n<p>One of the most common mishaps with Google Drive is that if one person deletes a shared file, it deletes the file for everyone. There are a number of factors to consider when <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-tips-managing-shared-files-google-drive/\">using Google Drive to collaborate</a>, but this is one of the most important. Just like with any other file storage system, it&#8217;s imperative that you keep backups of your files in a separate, secure location.</p>\n<div class='youtube-player'><iframe data-src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yyxYQJtedM' class='lazy-load' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-index='1'></iframe></div>\n<p>The owner of the shared file may be able to retrieve it from their deleted files. Otherwise, if you have a Google Drive account under a school or workplace, there may be an administrator who has access to all deleted files within 30 days of their deletion, and who may be able to help you with your situation.</p>\n<h2>3. Google Drive Has Run Out of Storage Space</h2>\n<p>Google Drive&#8217;s storage capacity is not only shared across services like Google Docs and Google Sheets but also Gmail and Google Photos. To see how much space you&#8217;re using across all those Google services, visit the <a href=\"https://one.google.com/storage\">Google One storage page</a>. If you run out of space, you have a couple of options.</p>\n<h3>Delete Data From Google Drive</h3>\n<p>The first is to clear out files you no longer need. On Google Drive, click <strong>Storage</strong> on the left-hand menu. This will show you all your files, which you can sort by <strong>Storage used</strong>.</p>\n<p>To delete something, right click it and select <strong>Remove</strong>. Remember to also remove it from the trash.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-975577 lazy-load\" data-src=\"//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-drive-manage-apps-670x383.png\" alt=\"google drive manage apps\" width=\"670\" height=\"383\" /></p>\n<p>You should also check for any third-party apps that are using storage invisibly. To do this, click the <strong>cog icon</strong> in the top-right and click <strong>Settings &#62; Manage apps</strong>.</p>\n<p>For each app, click <strong>Options</strong> and you can use <strong>Delete hidden app data</strong> if necessary. You can also click <strong>Disconnect from Drive</strong> to remove the app integration entirely.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade Your Google One Storage</h3>\n<p>Google Drive comes with 15 GB of storage space, which you can quickly exhaust if you&#8217;re not careful. If you can&#8217;t find anything to delete, consider paying to upgrade your storage capacity.</p>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://one.google.com/storage\">Google One storage page</a> for pricing, wherein you can pay a reasonable monthly or yearly cost for 100 GB, 200 GB, or 2 TB of data.</p>\n<h2>4. Unable to Print on Google Drive</h2>\n<p>Printers and Google Drive sometimes don&#8217;t play well together, but you have a couple of options to try and troubleshoot the root of your problem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure that your printer software is up-to-date. Because Google Drive is constantly being updated, it can quickly outpace your printer software. This can cause communication problems between the two services, and result in printing errors.</li>\n<li>Similarly, you&#8217;ll want to make sure that the web browser you&#8217;re using is up-to-date too.</li>\n<li>Disable any browser extensions that may be interfering with your ability to print.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re still unable to print directly from Google Drive, it might be worth taking the time to download your file as a PDF and then print it from your PDF software instead of from your browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>5. Can&#8217;t View or Edit a Shared File</h2>\n<div class='youtube-player'><iframe data-src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/25CtYkqamIA' class='lazy-load' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-index='1'></iframe></div>\n<p>This problem often crops up because of the number of choices users have for sharing Google Drive files with others. The person sending you the link to the file may have missed a step in the process or chosen the incorrect option, and therefore you may be unable to see the file at all or be able to see the file without the ability to make any changes.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have access to a file, Google Drive will provide you with a button to &#8220;Request access&#8221; from the file&#8217;s owner, which will prompt them to change the sharing settings on the file.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re the owner of a file and people are having trouble accessing it, double check that you&#8217;ve set the sharing parameters correctly using the video above.</p>\n<h2>6. How to Use Google Drive Offline</h2>\n<div class='youtube-player'><iframe data-src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-ZaUJ44X2s' class='lazy-load' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-index='1'></iframe></div>\n<p>In order to use Google Drive offline, you will need to use either the Google Chrome browser or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987\">install the Google Drive app on your Mac or PC</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On Chrome: </strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Drive settings</a>, and tick <strong>Create, open and edit your recent Google Docs, Sheets and Slides files on this device while offline</strong></li>\n<li>You will need to download the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi\">Google Doc Offline plugin</a>, which it will prompt you to do.</li>\n<li>Note: you are only able to do this with one account per computer, so enable it only on the account that you use most often.</li>\n<li>As well, in order to enable offline syncing, you will need to have an internet connection initially, so it involves some forward planning the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>On your computer: </strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Download <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en-US_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/\">Google Backup and Sync</a> and follow the prompts to set up your account.</li>\n<li>You will need to be connected to the internet initially so that your files can sync to your computer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Can&#8217;t Upload or Sync Files</h2>\n<p>One of the main advantages of using Google Drive is that it syncs your files across all your devices. If that breaks, it&#8217;s a big problem.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve compiled a separate guide to <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/solve-errors-google-drive/\">solve upload errors in Google Drive</a>, so check that out.</p>\n<h2>Do More With Google Drive</h2>\n<p>If the advice here hasn&#8217;t solved your problem, visit the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive help page</a> for more information.

There&#8217;s a lot to be excited about, especially for anyone looking to get their hands on all of the excellent features Pixel devices offer without spending too much money.</p>\n<h2>The Google Pixel 4a Is Coming Soon</h2>\n<p>The bulk of Google&#8217;s announcement on <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel4a-new-helpful-google-phone/\">The Keyword</a> is focused on the budget-friendly phone. Following up on the reasonably-priced Pixel 3a, the company is packing as many features as possible into an affordable phone.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 4a will retain many of the camera features offered by the far more expensive Pixel 4. </p>\n<p>Those features include dual exposure controls, Portrait Mode, Top Shot, Night Sight with astrophotography capabilities, and fused video stabilization. The camera hardware on the 4a isn&#8217;t quite as powerful as the Pixel 4, as it lacks the 16MP shooter. However, both do feature the same 12.2MP lens.</p>\n<p>Taking selfies should be a great experience with the new device, as it also features an 8MP lens on the front.</p>\n<div class='youtube-player'><iframe data-src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_f3Km_eQnw' class='lazy-load' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-index='1'></iframe></div>\n<p>As far as power, the Pixel 4a comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G, which is a 2.2 GHz + 1.8 GHz, 64-bit Octa-Core processor. It also has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. For comparison, the Pixel 4 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, which is a 2.84 GHz + 1.78 GHz, 64-bit Octa-core chip. It also comes with 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage.</p>\n<p>Google promises long battery life with the 3140mAh battery.

It&#8217;s so impressive on paper that it&#8217;s hard to believe the company is selling it for only $349.</p>\n<p>Google is taking preorders for the Pixel 4a starting right now. To secure one, just head to the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4a\">Google Store</a>. It&#8217;s available in Just Black with 128GB of storage.

Now, the company has unveiled a new-look Microsoft Store on Xbox that&#8217;s &#8220;designed to be faster, safer and easier to use than ever before&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s Coming to the Microsoft Store on Xbox?</h2>\n<p>Microsoft announced the new Microsoft Store on Xbox experience in a post on <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/08/03/new-microsoft-store-coming-to-xbox-insiders/\">Xbox Wire</a>. There, the company details all of the new changes coming to the Xbox Store and how they will benefit you.</p>\n<p>First, Microsoft states that the Xbox Store will load faster in general. When you start up the store, it will only take two seconds before you&#8217;re ready to browse. Each game&#8217;s store page also loads faster so that you don&#8217;t need to wait to see the screenshots and trailers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter lazy-load\" data-src=\"//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Xbox-Store-Navigation.jpg\" alt=\"The navigation menu for the new Microsoft Store on Xbox\" width=\"670\" height=\"375\" /></p>\n<p>The new Microsoft Store on Xbox will also be easier to use. </p>\n<p>Microsoft has revamped the wishlist feature so that it&#8217;s easier to add games and check when they go on sale. The update will also make it easier to add games to your shopping cart, as well as managing what&#8217; you have already added to your cart. The new Xbox Store also lets you view, buy, and wishlist games from previous Xbox consoles, all the way back to the original.</p>\n<p>When the update drops, you&#8217;ll need to sign in to use the store. This is because your Xbox will now tailor recommendations to your past purchases and games. This system also protects children from viewing games outside of their age bracket.</p>\n<h2>When Will the New Xbox Store Arrive?</h2>\n<p>For now, Microsoft is pushing this update out only for Xbox Insiders.

Soon after declaring its interest, the US government almost shut down the deal. However, after a discussion, Microsoft has been given the green light to make the purchase.</p>\n<h2>Microsoft&#8217;s Acquisition of TikTok: The Story So Far</h2>\n<p>On Friday, July 31st, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html\">The New York Times</a> reported on Microsoft&#8217;s desire to purchase TikTok. Microsoft was interested despite the service coming under scrutiny by the US government. At the time, the government considered telling the service to separate from its parent company ByteDance, presumably to cut it off from its Chinese roots.</p>\n<p>However, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-bytedance/trump-says-will-ban-tiktok-amid-pressure-on-chinese-owner-to-sell-idUSKCN24W2PN?rpc=401&#38;\">Reuters</a> on the same day, President Trump stated that he planned to ban TikTok from the US. He also claimed he could use an executive order to ban it as soon as Saturday (August 1st). This made Microsoft hesitant to finalize the deal in light of the potential ban.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft to continue discussions on potential TikTok purchase in the United States. <a href=\"https://t.co/mCDeeVPzyX\">https://t.co/mCDeeVPzyX</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Microsoft (@Microsoft) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1290064457612197888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Fortunately, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/\">Microsoft</a> has now reported a breakthrough.
