What you need to do is just stare at the cross in the middle of the screen. </p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wM6lGNhPujE?rel=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The illusion was aptly christened “Flashed Face Distortion Effect”. As is the case with many visual illusions, neither the discoverer or anybody else has a full explanation of why it happens. It seems that the effect is driven by at least 2 phenomena:  </p>\n<p>The first is relative encoding. Which basically means that since the faces are aligned by eye-position, it forces to you to view each face &ldquo;in light of&rdquo; the previous one. Which brings us to the second explanation which is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation\">visual adaptation</a>. Put simply, it means that if we look at something for a while, our eyes &ldquo;get used&rdquo; to seeing it and thus if we look away, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage\">it takes a moment for our brain to revert again</a>. It is similar across all our senses, for example, if you poke yourself quickly once, you will feel it instantly, but if you keep applying constant pressure, your skin will keep adapting and the slow poke will be barely perceptible. What does it have to do with the illusion above? Well, researchers have discovered that visual adaptation goes a long way and, for instance, if you stare for a while at a distorted face that is thin/sad/male, etc. the subsequent neutral face will appear more fat/happy/female. The effect works both ways, of course. In relation to the above illusion, it appears that when viewing faces that differ from each other, you quickly adapt to the current face, thus magnifying the difference between the current face and the next face resulting in these grotesque faces.</p>\n<p>However, this cannot be the whole story. Interestingly, the effect seems to hold even if you pause the video for a while an keep staring at the cross. Which shows that there is much more to it than visual adaptation because the distortion does not fade away quickly. Try it yourself.</p>\n<p>I also wonder if a similar illusion can be created with other familiar objects that have similar perceptual properties as faces do. I mean they would have to be fairly complex (so not just geometrical figures) but also have a certain degree of homogeneity. Also, the viewers would need to have some kind of expertise in whatever class of objects they would be viewing. Which reminds me of the the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble_(psychology)\">Greebles</a>. Greebles are 3-dimensional objects which have a small number of common features (like faces) but can still vary in many minuscule ways (also like faces!). Here are some examples of Greebles:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"257\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/75b78952a7e701d0ee3c98369e89bac1/db729ec397bf98d8-81/s540x810/807b0c7a22c7963b55d8a5aee2ef19be50f39f8c.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"257\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure></p>\n<p>So the question here really is - would you have the same kind of reaction if you were a &ldquo;Greeble expert&rdquo; and were presented with the above video with Greebles in place of faces? My guess is NO.</p>\n<p>On a completely different note - the <a href=\"http://mbthompson.com/research/\">authors</a> say that its discovery was actually an accident - one of them was merely quickly browsing through the faces the on the computer screen, when noticed that some of them appeared grotesque and deformed. Amazing how many scientific discoveries (like for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron\">mirror neurons</a>) result from just accidentally doing the right thing at the right time. I should maybe write a piece about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity\">serendipity</a> and science sometime soon - sounds like a good idea.</p>\n<p>There is also the same version of the video on Youtube, but with faces of celebrities <a href=\"http://youtu.be/VT9i99D_9gI\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The illusion that won the 2012 Contest though, was actually not visual at all but tactile. As the authors succinctly provided the full explanation themselves, I will not try to reinvent the wheel - read it below the video.</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qcm0_QPhLe4?rel=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This multi-sensory illusion uses vision, touch and position sense to create the illusion that the hand has disappeared. The felt positions of the hands are gradually adapted without the participant noticing so that the real locations of the hands end up further outwards than their perceived locations. When the right hand is removed from vision and the participant reaches across to touch it, all they can feel is the empty table. The combined loss of vision and touch creates a powerful illusion that the hand is missing and was designed to simulate loss of awareness in stroke patients.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Finally, just one more illusion (or actually more of a &ldquo;perceptual bias&rdquo;) and one with quite interesting implications:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/ed3bcd389af0c4ceb25f4ae90159bc63/db729ec397bf98d8-7d/s540x810/dea223f77b0b6c296cdd4ecd513b744e0694e40a.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure></p>\n<p>The face on the right seems more female than the one on the left, doesn&rsquo;t it? Actually the faces are almost identical. The only difference is that the left one is slightly darkened and the right one is slightly lightened. The eyes and lips are unaltered. Now take a look at these faces below which look quite similar to the ones above. Again, they are almost identical, but the right one looks more female.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"244\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/161cc5b68f36aec2c466fb450713d198/db729ec397bf98d8-fc/s540x810/0954f9f32e2d0fff8f71094b4b01dc719405d53c.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"244\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure></p>\n<p>This time, the eyes and lips were darkened on the right image and lightened on the left one. Are you beginning to se the pattern here? The effects of image manipulations are exactly the same as the ones that are usually achieved using make-up! I think it shows quite convincingly that we just got used to the that fact that faces with higher contrast between skin and lips/eyes are usually female because of make-up. Talk about how culture changes our perception!</p>\n<p>Images are copyright of R Russel.</p>\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Tangen J M, Murphy S C, Thompson M B, 2011, &ldquo;Flashed face distortion effect: Grotesque faces from relative spaces&rdquo;
