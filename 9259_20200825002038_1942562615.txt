MailJet is one of the most basic email service providers that we researched, especially when it comes to their free email plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} -->\n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\">MailJet Free Email Marketing Tools</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MailJet’s free email marketing features are very, very limited. Like SendInBlue, you won’t have to worry about upgrading your account as your subscribers increase, since you get unlimited contacts. However, also like SendInBlue, they limit you to a certain number of sends per day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other features in the free plan include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>API’s, SMTP Relay, Webhooks</li><li>An advanced email editor</li><li>Advanced statistics</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} -->\n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\">MailJet Email Platform Pros</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pros for the free email platform are few and far between. There’s obviously the unlimited contacts, which is a big plus. They also have a very easy to use drag-and-drop editor which is great for a new user. Outside of that, we didn’t find too many pros that would separate MailJet from the competition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One pro worth noting is a multi-user collaboration feature, which allows multiple users to work together in real-time on the same email. Think Google Docs. However, this is only available on the Premium or Enterprise paid programs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} -->\n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\">MailJet Email Platform Cons</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MailJet is a very basic email service provider with no added benefits outside of email sending. Many of the other email marketing companies we reviewed have extra features such as a landing page builder or pop up builder. These extra features could be important as you look to grow your business and save money in the process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And, as mentioned above, although you can have unlimited contacts, MailJet does limit the number of emails you can send in a day to only 200 or a max of 6,000 per month. You may find it tough to grow your business sending to only 200 a day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"customTextColor\":\"#00539b\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#00539b\">Moosend</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":92012,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESP-moosend-1024x256.png\" alt=\"Moosend logo\" class=\"wp-image-92012\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re looking for a platform with email automation options, but don’t need landing pages as an option for collecting subscribers, then it might be worth checking out Moosend.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} -->\n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\">Moosend Free Email Marketing Tools</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moosend is relatively new when it comes to providing free email marketing services.

Check out the table we put together at the top of this article.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, make sure you choose a provider who has — and will — stand the test of time. While migrating to AWeber from another platform is painless, we can’t promise the same for the other guys.

You took time to <a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/copywriting/write-sales-landing-pages.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">write convincing landing page copy</a>. You’re ready to send your new subscribers value-packed emails. But there’s one problem.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How do you actually get<em> </em>people <em>to</em> your landing page to sign up?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s why we asked three experts to share how they drive traffic to their landing pages, and they shared some of the best strategies to help you begin promoting your own landing page. Read on to learn what they had to say.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Social media is a great way to promote your landing page — as long as you’ve built credibility first.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Sam Flynn, Social Media Trainer &#38; Speaker, Managing Director, Planet Social Media</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Social media is a perfect driver of traffic to your landing page. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step is to make sure you are clear on who your social media audience is. Once you have a good idea, think about what would drive them to want to go to your landing page. Is there a lead magnet that is highly relevant ? And, how can you get this across to them? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In terms of your call-to-action (CTA), you will need more than a simple “click here to get x.” Be more descriptive of the benefits behind this particular lead magnet. Give them value in the post itself, such as one of the points covered on your lead magnet, then direct them to your landing page for more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You could also use video as part of your strategy, sharing a short video elaborating on one point covered in your lead magnet, then directing them to your lead magnet to get the remaining points. If you are speaking to a camera, be sure to include subtitles, for accessibility for all and to cater for those who will listen without audio.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, make sure you build up your credibility with your audience by sharing a range of posts, especially those that demonstrate your expertise. They’ll be far more likely to click through to your landing page if they think they are going to get results from doing so!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>When done right, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the best way to drive traffic to your landing page.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Sean Tinney, Demand Generation Manager, AWeber</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most highly engaged, highest converting customers come from SEO, in my experience.&#160; These are potential customers who are actively searching for a specific product or service.&#160;But in order for SEO to be effective, you need to do your research and add keywords to your landing page that provide the answer to what people are searching for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here at AWeber, we are providing marketing services to help our customers grow their business.&#160;So when I build a landing page using our <a href=\"https://www.aweber.com/landing-page-builder.htm?utm_source=awblog&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=product&#38;utm_content=landingpagebuilder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AWeber landing page builder</a>, I make sure I’m using keywords that potential customers might be searching for.&#160; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The more targeted or specific your keywords, the greater the likelihood of success.&#160;Very popular terms and keywords tend to be highly competitive, so search terms that are more specific tend to be easier to rank for. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Measure, track results, and adjust course.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Cathy McPhillips, VP of Marketing at Content Marketing Institute&#160;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We promote our landing pages a number of ways: blog post calls-to-action (CTAs), banner ads on our website, social media, email promotions, and through our webinar speakers and Content Marketing Institute team members. Each of these tactics has a sourced URL so we’re able to evaluate the effectiveness and the timing promotions.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, if we’re posting on social media four weeks before a webinar, but 90% of our webinar signups through social media happen 28 hours before the event, then we shouldn’t be posting on social media so early.

Even if you’re not based in Europe, if have customers or subscribers in Europe, you must comply with GDPR. And</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it must be clear what your subscribers can expect to receive from you. </span></p>\n<p><b>Buying an email list is a clear violation of GDPR.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Want to learn more about GDPR and what it means for your business? Check out </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/your-gdpr-email-marketing-playbook-how-to-prepare-for-the-new-eu-data-law.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your GDPR + Email Marketing Playbook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are also a few other laws that reinforce why you should never buy an email list. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CAN-SPAM Act </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a United States law that regulates commercial email. While it doesn’t actually prohibit someone from buying and selling email addresses, it does prohibit sending bulk unsolicited emails. And if you’re sending to a purchased email list, that’s exactly what you’re doing. You would be in violation of the law.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, the </span><a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, protects the personal information of California residents. Businesses need to honor requests from California residents to “access, delete, and opt-out of sharing or selling their information.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By purchasing an email list, you can't be sure that a vendor has followed those rules. And, California is only the first state to enact a law like this — others are likely not far behind.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Why you should never buy an email list</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Best Practices team doesn’t only catch bad actors using purchased lists — even well-intentioned businesses can fall into the trap of buying email lists. After all, a purchased list sounds like a great idea in theory; you feel like you can start marketing your product or service right away to a list of subscribers, instead of having to grow your list from scratch, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrong. Simply put, buying an email list will hurt you more than it will help you. </span></p>\n<p>Some companies make money by offering new email marketers a “shortcut” to building their email lists. So they compile email address lists and advertise them as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Targeted\"</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Opt-in\"</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Verified\"</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Clean\" (a clue that purchasing lists is inherently dirty)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Real Time\"</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-87720\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/08212018-Article-Post-3.jpg\" alt=\"company selling purchased email list\" width=\"740\" height=\"630\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83643\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Screen-Shot-2017-05-23-at-4.46.42-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1237\" height=\"558\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When buying a list of email addresses, you don’t have proof of who else may have also purchased those addresses, what list those subscribers signed up for originally, or the date those subscribers signed up. While the company selling the list may say it’s “Opt-In” or “Verified,” you have no idea what content they first signed up for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you send messages to a purchased email list, you don’t have explicit opt-in to be emailing those subscribers. Explicit opt-in — meaning subscribers actively and knowingly gave you permission to email them (i.e. filling out a sign up form on your website) — is required for a quality list, says AWeber’s Best Practices Manager, Josh Smith. “If you don’t have explicit opt-in, you are bound to have problems,” he explains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And fair warning: Confirmation does not equal permission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/204028656-What-is-confirmed-opt-in-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirmation message</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the first emails you send to subscribers when they are added to your mailing list. In it, a subscriber can click on a link to confirm that they requested information from you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you can’t just send a confirmation message to a purchased list — because they never gave you permission to email them in the first place. They never requested to be on your email list. Confirmation can only be used as a second step in order to build a more engaged list.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>So how do email addresses end up on purchased email lists? </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any email address can end up in a purchased email list database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vendors that sell email lists scrape email addresses off old lists, get attendee lists from conferences, and pick them off websites that have nothing to do with your specific business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means the people you’re emailing may not be interested in what you do at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, your purchased list may claim to have opted-in for your gardening tips. In reality, however, those email addresses signed up for sports news and updates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result: The subscribers on your purchased list have no interest in your gardening content. They never open your messages, or, worse, they mark your messages as spam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the vendor collected the email addresses legitimately, none of the subscribers on the purchased list are aware of you or your business. They don’t expect to hear from you, and are more likely to mark you as spam.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How buying email lists will hurt you and your business</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most subscribers know if they have requested specific information from you or not. Sending unsolicited information to subscribers who did not request it can be damaging to your business and your deliverability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet Service Providers (ISPs) — like Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo! — track if a subscriber opens an email, clicks a link, or reports a message as spam in their inbox.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-deliverability/getting-into-the-inbox-why-email-engagement-is-more-important-than-ever-for-email-deliverability.htm?utm_source=awemail&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=blogcontent&#38;utm_content=buyinglistdeliver0605\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engagement is good</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — meaning, a subscriber constantly opens your messages, forwards them, or clicks the links inside — this tells the ISP to route future emails straight to the inbox.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Related: Not sure if your email open or click-through rates are good? </span></i><a href=\"https://www.aweber.com/2020-report/?utm_source=awblog&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=2020research&#38;utm_content=aweberblogpost\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out AWeber’s 2020 Email Marketing Statistics Repor</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t to discover average email engagement.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if a subscriber is unengaged, then an ISP will route your emails to the spam folder. And if a large portion of your subscribers are unengaged — which will most likely be the case with a purchased list — it can </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-deliverability/2-major-reasons-why-you-should-care-about-email-deliverability.htm?utm_source=awemail&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=blogcontent&#38;utm_content=buyinglistsopt0606\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hurt your sending reputation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. All of your messages may end up in the spam folder whether a subscriber wants to read your emails or not.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What to do instead of buying an email list</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other great ways to </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/how-to-get-email-addresses.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow your list</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that don’t involve buying email addresses.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Build a strong brand</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful businesses are built on strong brands that people love. And strong brands are built on exceptional products that solve a problem for your unique audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s the winning formula. Offer a valuable product or service, build and deliver it with care, and look for every opportunity to delight your customers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying an email list skips too many crucial steps in building a strong brand. With a purchased list, unprepared recipients aren’t likely to think, “Oh gosh, I was just hoping for yet another offer from a company I don’t know! Let me click over to their site and buy something!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were hoping to sell to this list, you might want to adjust your expectations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convincing someone to opt in to receiving emails from you means earning their trust, and the only way to do that is by solving their problems, providing value, and treating them with respect. That takes time and hustle.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Create a sign up form for your website. </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collect email addresses from people who visit your website. Make sure your </span><a href=\"https://www.aweber.com/sign-up-forms.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sign up form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is accessible and visible across the site to make it easy for people to find and subscribe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll see higher engagement and better results since your subscribers signed up for the content themselves.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Create a landing page to drive subscribers to.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t have a website? No problem. A </span><a href=\"https://www.aweber.com/landing-page-builder.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">landing page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a fantastic way to promote your business and encourage sign ups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While navigation is limited on a landing page, that’s a good thing for email sign ups. Write your landing page in a way that explains the value of signing up for your email list clearly and highlights your sign up form on the page. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Offer a lead magnet to entice people to sign up for your list.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A lead magnet is a freebie or incentive that encourages people to sign up for your email list.

All you have to do is ask!</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you reach out to people, there are a few best practices you should keep in mind:</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:list --> \n<ul>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Message people you have a relationship with.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That random Facebook person you don’t remember meeting probably isn’t the best fit.</span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Use WIIFM (What’s in it for me?”). </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time you message someone, make sure to tell them how your content, — whether it's a newsletter, email course, case study, or something else entirely — will benefit them or their friend.</span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Be yourself.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tell your story, share your feelings, be vulnerable and real. People will subscribe and share your sign up form because they want to help YOU.</span></li>\n</ul> \n<!-- /wp:list --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} --> \n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Ask friends, family, and colleagues&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the easiest marketing strategies to execute is to ask your current connections to join your list. Leveraging your network is a great way to steadily increase your email list, and often the best place to gain traction, especially in the beginning.</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although some of your connections may not be interested in the material themselves, they might know someone who is. Tell them you’re starting an email list.

Talk like you do in real life — it will help your customers relate to you better.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/new-features/8-new-email-templates-to-help-you-grow-your-business.htm\">Email templates</a> are a great starting point, but be sure to tailor it based on your relationship to the person and how you are asking. Depending on where a conversation is happening, people communicate very differently. When you text someone, you should be more casual than in an email. If you’re talking to someone in person, you shouldn’t be reading from a script you wrote beforehand.</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} --> \n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Ask customers and prospects&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When existing and prospective customers buy something from you or connect with you, verbally ask if they’d like to sign up for your email or newsletter. To entice them, you can provide something that could directly benefit them like a free ebook or kickoff template.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grow your email list by asking customers you’re already speaking with on the phone. Tell them about what they can expect from your emails. It only takes a few seconds to jot down an email address. If you make “the big ask” five times a day for one work week, that’s 25 email addresses you didn’t have before you started, and 100 email addresses in just one month!</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} --> \n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Capture emails from your email signature/closing</span></h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many people do you contact personally via email every day? These contacts might not be on your business email list yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t suggest that they sign up to receive your email newsletter.Include a brief call-to-action and link to a form or </span><a href=\"https://www.aweber.com/landing-page-builder.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">landing page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your email signature.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might not lead to a mountain of new email signups, but it is an easy, passive way to bring awareness if you’re emailing people regularly. Don’t forget to update other email signatures (e.g. a customer service email) and have team members update their signatures.</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} --> \n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Encourage forwarding</span></h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to current subscribers and encourage them to share your email with people they know. Word-of-mouth is one of the oldest and most powerful means of advertising, and email offers the perfect venue for suggesting it to your subscribers. If they’re on your list and getting value from your messages, chances are they know others who would also benefit.</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to make your emails easy to share and subscribe to. Update your template to include social sharing buttons. Devote a section of your newsletter to encourage subscribers to forward your message. Then, include a link to your sign-up page or hosted web form so that new readers can sign up directly from your email.</span></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"customTextColor\":\"#af62ff\"} --> \n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#af62ff\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.

Experiment with Pop Ups</span></h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pop up forms can be a simple yet effective way to bring more attention to your email list.

A low delivery rate could be indicative of two things: poor list quality or the wrong email service provider.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Address your list quality first. If your sends are segmented by the source they signed up for your list (i.e. a form on your social channels or a landing page), see if one source is the reason for the low delivery rate. If the low delivery rate appears across multiple segments, consider <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.zerobounce.net/email-validation-api.html\" target=\"_blank\">cleansing your email list</a>.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":92694,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} --> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic-delivery-rate.png\" alt=\"Delivery rate formula with example\" class=\"wp-image-92694\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<!-- /wp:image --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --> \n<h4>Open Rate</h4> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Your email open rate is directly tied to your subject line and possibly your subheader.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivering the most relevant content to your audience is at the heart of any successful email marketing plan.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending targeted emails to groups or segments of your subscribers isn’t just a great way to deliver more relevant content to those who need it most, it also works. According to ClickZ, when using proper targeting, you can drive </span><a href=\"https://www.clickz.com/are-you-harnessing-the-power-of-the-email-channel/45340/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3x the revenue per email as compared to non-targeted emails</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the number of subscribers you have on your email list, or your experience level with email marketing, email segmentation is something you can and should be doing.</span>\n<h2><strong>What is email segmentation and why is important?</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Segmentation happens everywhere. YouTube and Netflix suggest videos or shows based on your past viewing behavior. Amazon suggests products related to past purchases, searches, or products in your cart.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s actually quite simple. Send people what they want and they are more likely to act.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same is true with email segmentation. When you segment your email marketing, you’ll see:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher open rates</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher click-through rates</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher deliverability rates</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher conversion rates</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More sales</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>16 ways to segment your email list and send targeted emails</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 16 ways you can easily use subscriber segmentation now or start preparing your list for when you’re ready to start sending segmented emails.</span>\n<h3><strong>1. Send different emails based on subscribers’ skill level.</strong></h3>\n<a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/email-courses-101-how-to-use-autoresponders-to-write-an-email-course.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educational email courses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a perfect way to teach others and incentivize them to subscribe to your email list. To create this experience for people of varying skill levels, you can create beginner, intermediate, and expert versions of your course.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When subscribers sign up and select their skill level, you can automatically tag them and send them the right course tailored to their needs.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-92183\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/segment-subscribers-skill-level.png\" alt=\"Segment subscribers based on skill level\" width=\"450\" height=\"485\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As subscribers complete the courses, you can create segments based on their skill level and send them emails to invite them to the next course based on their level of expertise.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to a course, you can also use knowledge of your subscribers’ skill levels in other ways, like inviting them to a webinar or sending them videos and resources based on their needs.</span>\n<h3><strong>2. Send different emails based on your subscribers’ interests.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you send emails that cover a variety of topics, it may be helpful to learn what your subscribers are most interested in. Doing this will allow you to send targeted emails to segments who are more likely to engage with your content.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather this information when a subscriber signs up. Simply ask them what topics they’re interested in learning about, and tag them based on their selections. Then create segments of subscribers with those particular tags, or a combination of tags.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-92185\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-subscribers-interests.png\" alt=\"Segment subscribers based on interests\" width=\"450\" height=\"585\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also gather this information when subscribers click on links in your emails. If you send out an email about a new vegan recipe, you can tag subscribers with the word “vegan” when they click the link for the recipe.</span>\n<h3><strong>3. Send emails with a gift based on subscribers’ birth month.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people love receiving birthday wishes. Send your subscribers a birthday gift or incentive during their birth month.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On your sign up form, ask subscribers to choose their birth month and set up custom fields to apply a tag based on their selection. Each month, send an email with a birthday gift to the corresponding group of tagged subscribers.</span>\n<h3><strong>4. Send emails in subscribers’ native language.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have subscribers from different countries around the world, you might assume that their native language is different from your own. As a result, you can segment these subscribers and send emails in their preferred language.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/5-minute-email-tips-sending-segmented-emails.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">segment and tag subscribers based on their geographic location</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or ask them for their language preference in the sign up form, you can easily deliver content that’s accessible to everyone.</span>\n<h3><strong>5. Send emails based on subscribers’ geographic locations.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run events in different locations? Have an ecommerce shop with a global customer base? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By segmenting subscribers based on their geographic location, you can send contextual emails with content, like upcoming events near them and exclusive discounts for local holidays or seasons. Or share advice and news that would be more relevant to that particular audience.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92186\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-customers-location.png\" alt=\"Segment subscribers based on location\" width=\"1770\" height=\"268\" />\n<h3><strong>6. Send contextual welcome campaigns based on different incentives, sign up forms, or landing pages.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you offer multiple incentives on different sign up forms or landing pages? Make sure your subscribers get </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/welcome-email-campaigns-101-how-to-create-an-awesome-welcome-campaign.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">welcome emails</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that relate to the incentive for which they signed up. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply unique tags to subscribers who sign up to deliver the right incentive to the right person, and create a more personalized email campaign.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92187\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-customers-automated-campaigns-multiple-incentives.png\" alt=\"Segment subscribers based on different opt-in incentives\" width=\"2782\" height=\"1092\" />\n<h3><strong>7. Send an email based on the incentive for which a subscriber signed up.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to sending contextual welcome campaigns to subscribers based on what they signed up for, you can also send targeted broadcasts with content that relates to the incentive. Since you already know they’re interested in a specific topic, you can continue sending them targeted content they’ll enjoy.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92188\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-sign-up-forms-multiple-incentives.png\" alt=\"Segment subscribers based on the incentive they signed up for\" width=\"2822\" height=\"1370\" />\n<h3><strong>8. Send win-back (or re-engagement) emails to inactive subscribers.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People sign up to your email list for all sorts of reasons, so it’s normal that some become inactive over time. But when you continue to send emails to unengaged subscribers, you’re only hurting your email performance and deliverability.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have subscribers who haven’t engaged with your emails in a long time, try to win them back and </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/re-engagement-emails-content.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get them engaged with a targeted broadcast or automated campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92189\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-inactive-subscribers.png\" alt=\"How to create a segment of inactive subscribers\" width=\"1772\" height=\"462\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In your email, explain what they’re missing out on and offer exclusive discounts and incentives to get them to take action. If they click the incentive, keep them on your email list. And if they don’t, simply unsubscribe or remove them. A smaller, more engaged list is generally better than a larger, unengaged list.</span>\n<h3><strong>9. Send a second email or trigger a campaign to subscribers who opened the first email, but didn’t click a link.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice a low click-through rate in your previous email? Create a segment of subscribers who opened your message, but didn’t click. Then send them a second email to encourage them to click through.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92190\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-subscribers-opened-email-not-clicked.png\" alt=\"How to create a segment of subscribers who opened a message but didn't click the link\" width=\"1770\" height=\"364\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider how you might be able to make the message more appealing for this segment of subscribers. This could mean emphasizing the value proposition of the action you want them to take, adding more urgency to your content or even trying new call-to-action copy.</span>\n<h3><strong>10. Send a second email or trigger a campaign to subscribers who clicked a link in an email.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To send emails to subscribers based on actions they </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">did</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> take, create a subscriber segment based on a link they clicked in a previous email. You can send a targeted email to those tagged subscribers for specific products they might be interested in, or you can enter them into a new automated campaign.</span>\n<h3><strong>11. Send emails based on pages subscribers have visited — or not visited — on your website.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to tailor your emails based on the pages your subscribers visit on your website? Use </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/new-features/monetizing-your-web-traffic.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AWeber’s event tracking feature</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to track subscribers’ activity on your website and automatically tag them based on the pages they have visited.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-92191\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-subscribers-website-traffic.png\" alt=\"Create a segment of subscribers based on the web pages they've visited\" width=\"450\" height=\"569\" />\n\n<b>Pro tip:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you’re using AWeber’s landing pages, event tracking is built in.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create segments of subscribers who have visited or not visited specific pages on your site, and send tailored broadcasts or triggers campaigns to those subscribers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to learn why subscribers aren’t making it through the sales funnel? Create a segment of subscribers who visit the first page of your funnel, but not the next one. Send them a broadcast or trigger an automated campaign to invite feedback to learn what stopped them from progressing.</span>\n<h3><strong>12. Send emails to new subscribers or customers.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automated welcome emails are great for engaging your new subscribers. But you can also create segments of new subscribers and send targeted broadcasts to invite them to new-customer events, webinars, and more.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92192\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-new-subscribers.png\" alt=\"How to create a segment of new subscribers\" width=\"1770\" height=\"364\" />\n<h3><strong>13. Send emails to long-time subscribers or customers.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Motista, customers who form an emotional connection with your business have over </span><a href=\"https://www.motista.com/resource/leveraging-value-emotional-connection-retailers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">300% higher lifetime value</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than those who don’t.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reward your most loyal subscribers. Create a segment of long-time subscribers and thank them for their loyalty. Offer them VIP perks, invite them to special loyalty events, get to know them, and gather feedback from them.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92193\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/segment-long-time-customers.png\" alt=\"How to create a segment of long-time subscribers\" width=\"1770\" height=\"366\" />\n<h3><strong>14. Send emails based on survey results.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gathering feedback is critical to any business, entrepreneur, or creator. Survey your audience regularly, and create segments of subscribers who rated you or your products favorably, as well as unfavorably. Follow up with them by sending an email to thank them for their feedback and to gain more insight from their input.</span>\n<h3><strong>15. Send different emails to customers and potential buyers.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/creating-personalized-email-campaigns-for-a-course.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">segmenting subscribers based on whether or not they’re a current customer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can target your promotional messages to include more relevant content.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use customer segmentation to separate your customers and potential clients into separate groups you can speak to differently.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of sending an email to existing customers and asking them to purchase your product or service, you can speak more to their loyalty and promote advocacy and ongoing interaction.</span>\n<h3><strong>16. Send emails about products based on potential buyers’ gender.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalizing the product suggestions for each subscriber can help convert them into customers. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if you’re a retailer that sells clothing products by gender, simply tag subscribers based on their preferences and create segments of customers who are interested in each of these types of products. Then personalize your emails with relevant products based on their gender choice.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use </span><a href=\"https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/aweber-dynamic-email-content-feature.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dynamic email content</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to display the most relevant products for your potential buyer.</span>\n<h2><b>4 bonus ecommerce segmentation strategies</b></h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Send emails based on products customers purchase.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By segmenting your customers based on the products they purchased, you’re able to tailor your emails to invite feedback or reviews on those products. You can also send promotional emails to upsell them on upgrades, cross-sell related products or services, and encourage repeat sales.</span>\n<h3><strong>2. Send emails based on products potential buyers left in their shopping cart.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a segment of subscribers who left something in their shopping cart. You can send an automated cart abandonment campaign to let them know they left something in their cart and encourage them to come back to complete their purchase. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider offering them a discount or other incentive to entice them to click through and complete their purchase.</span>\n<h3><strong>3. Send emails based on products potential buyers expressed interest in, but didn’t buy.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps someone clicked a link in your email to check out your product or service, but didn’t make the purchase. Create a segment of these subscribers and send them an email asking for feedback on their experience. Was there something about the product or service they didn’t like?</span>\n<h3><strong>4. Send emails to subscribers with a minimum purchase amount or purchase price range.</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to connect with your high-value customers? Create a segment of customers who have purchased your highest-value products. Perhaps send them a thank you email, or offer them VIP perks.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use </span><a href=\"https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/204029696-How-do-I-set-up-Sales-Tracking-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AWeber’s sales tracking feature</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to track who makes a purchase after clicking a link to your product or service in your email. Then create a segment of customers who purchased a product with a minimum purchase price or within a price range.</span>\n<h2><strong>Start tagging subscribers today.</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure if you want to send targeted emails right now? You can always start tagging subscribers now in case you want to do so later.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add tags to your sign up form or landing page to ensure every subscriber gets it when they sign up. If you have multiple sign up forms or landing pages on one list, for example, this will allow you to know exactly where your subscribers came from.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, if you decide you want to send subscribers that signed up for your checklist an invite to a webinar on the same topic, you can do so with ease.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haven’t been tagging subscribers and want to go back and tag them anyway?

Approach landing page design with a feeling of respect for the time of the visitor. By making a clear and digestible landing page, you can do more with content because you aren’t forced to slam a loud call-to-action button awkwardly into a crowded space.&#160;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on the Primary Goals of the Campaign</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, everything about your landing page should be geared towards getting the user to convert. This means removing anything that might draw their attention away from your offer.&#160;&#160;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use of White Space</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White space is an important part of email landing page design, so make the most of it. Sometimes, what you leave off the page is as powerful as what you include. White space removes congestion and gives the brain space to think. It also forces the eyes to focus on your offer.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize your Landing Page Space</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make your landing page full width and height, and remove navigation features. This isn’t to say you should scrap scrolling completely, but you should take away any visible arrows or buttons that encourage it.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple Design Landing Page Example</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look at how the </span><a href=\"https://www.aweber.com/?utm_source=awblog&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=blogcontent&#38;utm_content=blogcontent021219webcomhomepage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AWeber</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> landing page keeps things simple and clean.&#160; Your focus goes to the benefit headline and then follows a natural path to the call to action button:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aweber.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91773 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-4-1024x618.png\" alt=\"AWeber simple landing page example\" width=\"640\" height=\"386\"/></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Create landing page headlines that hit home</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The headline on the landing page is the first thing that visitors see, so it needs to capture their attention immediately and convey your unique value proposition (more on this below).

One of the easiest ways to do this is using a relevant image.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Images play a&#160; huge part in converting visitors. They’re the first thing that catches the their eye before they read the headline.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Images are processed 60,000 times faster than text by the brain</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so what the visitor sees will influence their immediate opinions about your brand and offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like headlines, use imagery to grab attention. Make them relevant to your product or service.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re offering a product, your imagery should be of the product</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re offering a service, your imagery should relate to what the service is in a way that paints a positive picture in the mind of the user</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that you don’t have long to make a good first impression. Make sure images are large and high-quality. Try to stay clear of stock imagery — you don’t want to show visitors something they may have already seen.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landing Page Image Example</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teambit is a great example of imagery done well — original illustrations used to capture attention and promote its service:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-88754 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Article-Image-5.jpg\" alt=\"landing page example with strong image example\" width=\"740\" height=\"409\"/></span></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Talk up the benefits&#160;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s face it: the average attention span is shorter than ever – <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/04/our-8-second-attention-span-and-the-future-of-news-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">eight seconds, to be exact</a>. So when you craft large blocks of text, you risk lower engagement and fewer conversions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a result, you want to write copy that’s easily scannable and highlights the most important elements.

Not only do push notifications let you communicate updates to your audience, they enable you to drive traffic to your website or landing page, build your audience, and grow your business. Plus, they work great in tandem with email marketing.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read on to learn all about web push notifications and how you can use them to complement your marketing strategy.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What are web push notifications?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Web push notifications — also known as desktop notifications or simply push notifications — are short, one-time messages that are delivered straight to a subscriber’s desktop when they have a browser open.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Web push notifications are sent to people who have opted-in to receive messages from you. Once they’ve opted-in, subscribers do not have to be on your website in order to receive a push notification.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They usually appear in a corner of your desktop or laptop screen and serve to alert your audience of exclusive deals, offers, promotions, or even freebies.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The goal of push notifications is to drive your audience back to your website or landing page and take the action you want them to take.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":92747,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WPN-Cover-1024x597.png\" alt=\"Where web push notifications appear on a desktop screen.\" class=\"wp-image-92747\"/><figcaption>Web push notifications usually appear in the top right corner of your desktop screen.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What’s the difference between a web push notification, an in-browser notification, and a mobile push notification?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An in-browser notification is another form of online messaging that targets active website visitors when they are actively on your website.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile push notifications are the types of notifications that appear on a mobile device. These messages go to a user’s phone and show up on a lock screen. When a user opens a push notification, it will bring the user to whatever app sent the message. Much like web push notifications, users can opt-in and opt-out of receiving notifications.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But in this guide, we’ll be covering all you need to know about web push notifications. They differ from in-browser notifications and mobile push notifications in that a user does not need to be on the website in order to receive the push notification. This allows marketers to reach users when they’re not actively engaging on a website.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Why marketers should use web push notifications</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Marketers use web push notifications to build, inform, and retain their audience. Web push notifications capture subscribers’ attention, no matter what they’re doing online.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether a person is in their email inbox, scrolling social media, or browsing their favorite ecommerce sites, if they are subscribed to your opt-in messages, they will receive them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the stats speak for themselves. <a href=\"https://www.digitalmarketer.com/blog/web-push-notification-metrics-to-optimize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DigitalMarketer</a> analyzed web push notification metrics and found they maintain a click through rate of 4-6% even when subscriber count is above 25,000. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Web push notifications also offer marketers a more flexible form of communication, allowing subscribers to opt-in and opt-out with more freedom than a typical full page popup <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window\" target=\"_blank\">modal</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are three primary reasons why marketers use web push notifications to elevate their marketing strategy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li><strong>To inform. </strong>Web push notifications are a great way to keep subscribers in the loop with exclusive content, offers, deals and more. Ultimately, subscribers can’t take action if they’re not aware of special deals or new content that you want to send out on push notifications.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":2} -->\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>To engage. </strong>Web push notifications provide a unique opportunity for users to engage with your brand, even when they’re not actively on your website.&#160;</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":3} -->\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>To sell. </strong>Capitalize on subscribers being on their desktop to let them know about an exclusive offer. You never know what they might be looking for online and if you can provide it for them, a push notification is a simple, straightforward way to communicate your value.&#160;</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What do push notifications look like?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While simple in design and layout, these push notifications pack a powerful punch in a little package.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":92749,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.aweber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WPN-Anatomy-1-1-1024x480.png\" alt=\"The anatomy of a web push notification\" class=\"wp-image-92749\"/><figcaption>The anatomy of a web push notification</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see from the image above, there are 4 components of a web push notification — let’s break them down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>Logo. </strong>Including a brand logo on a web push notification provides instant recognition from a user. It’s a highly visual way for a subscriber to recognize that the message is coming from your brand, and can drive them to read the notification and take action</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>B.</strong> <strong>Title. </strong>The title of the web push notification is also called the header text. This is the piece of text that will catch the attention of a subscriber and decide to read on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>C.</strong> <strong>Message. </strong>This vital section is where you can elaborate your message. This is your opportunity to concisely explain the value a subscriber receives from clicking on your push notification and visiting your site. Answer questions like: what will your subscribers receive by visiting your site? How long will the offer last? Keep in mind, however, that web push notifications are meant to be short and sweet.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>D.</strong> <strong>Domain. </strong>This is the URL that the user subscribed to. Including the source link in your message can’t be changed. It not only serves to remind the subscriber of your website, but aids in recognition and awareness of your online presence.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to use push notifications in your marketing strategy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you know the basics about web push notifications and the benefit of using them, let’s get into how to use push notifications as a part of your broader marketing strategy.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Getting started with push notifications as a marketing tactic</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When considering web push notifications as part of your broader marketing strategy, there’s a few things you want to consider:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li><strong>Align your strategy with your business goals.</strong></li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Is your goal to get more website traffic?

The goal of the opt-in prompt is to encourage website visitors to allow you to send them push notifications to their desktop.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Writing a compelling opt-in prompt begins by explaining what a subscriber will receive from you.
