Heat a little olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.<br />\n2. Add a couple of spoonfuls of jarred pesto. Stir it around and cook for a minute.<br />\n3. Add 2 large cans condensed tomato soup along with 2 cans of water.<br />\n4. Add a regular can of diced tomatoes with their juice. (I used tomatoes with oregano and garlic, but plain is fine.)<br />\n5. Stir and bring to a gentle simmer.<br />\n6. Add a generous splash of SHERRY! It is transformative. If you don&#8217;t have sherry, a little splash of white wine will do. (And I actually used cooking sherry, which is sold in supermarkets next to vinegar! Crazytown.) Stir and continue to heat the soup.<br />\n7. Add dried parsley, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Stir.<br />\n8. Add grated parmesan and stir. </p>\n<p>&#160;<br />\n<a href=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520\"><img src=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"520\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-105182\" srcset=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=8256 8256w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=300 300w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=768 768w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=1024 1024w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=1536 1536w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=2048 2048w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=240 240w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=480 480w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0303.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=2340 2340w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>9. Serve with garlic butter croutons and extra Parmesan on top. And guess what I used for the croutons? Frozen Garlic Texas Toast! I just cut the frozen pieces into cubes, sprinkled with grated Parmesan, and baked them according to the regular instructions on the package. They are amazing on the soup, and so crispy and delightful. </p>\n<p>My house is full of people, everyone wants to eat all the time, and I&#8217;m into easy food these days. Canned soup and frozen garlic bread for the win!</p>\n<p>&#8220;Staying Home: Episode 2&#8221; airs on Food Network this Saturday morning at 10am/9c&#8230;and I hope you enjoy the homemade feel of things. (I also hope you get a kick out of my accidentally setting a wooden spoon on fire&#8230;but you&#8217;ll have to tune in to see how that went. Ha.)</p>\n<p>And I hope you&#8217;re all doing okay.

The source of the rumor is an unscrupulous company trying to trick people into buying (you guessed it) facial cream. I have nothing to do with this facial cream (please don&#8217;t buy it!), and more importantly: I am not quitting my Food Network show! On the contrary: I&#8217;m just getting warmed up, man! The past seven years have just been one gigantic dress rehearsal! </p>\n<p>You want recipes, cookbooks, pretty plates, pans, and Basset Hound cookie jars? Head my way! </p>\n<p>You want facial cream? Head to Walmart, Ulta, Sephora, or a department store. Don&#8217;t head to Pioneer Woman. I get my facial cream at Walmart, Ulta, Sephora, and department stores! (Which is to say I rotate a lot. I think it&#8217;s healthier for the skin. Hey, maybe I should sell facial cream! Just kidding.)</p>\n<p>All this to say, it&#8217;s going to be a great fall on my Food Network show, which I ain&#8217;t even close to quittin&#8217;! From now until the end of the year, you&#8217;ll see a brand spanking new episode every Saturday morning at 10 am Eastern/9 am Central. (I think one exception to this is Thanksgiving weekend, but that&#8217;s the only break in new episodes.) I&#8217;m having so much fun with the new shows these days, and hope you&#8217;re loving the recipes! </p>\n<p>Recipe: <a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/ranch-pork-chop-sheet-pan-supper-5399499\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ranch Pork Chop Sheet Pan Supper</a></p>\n<p>&#160;<br />\n<a href=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170\"><img src=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"1170\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-98938\" srcset=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170?w=1200 1200w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170?w=200 200w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170?w=768 768w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170?w=683 683w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/l3a2631.jpg?resize=780%2C1170?w=1024 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Between filming, planning my cookbook (more on this below!), the boys&#8217; football schedule, and a few other things I have going on this fall, that hasn&#8217;t left much time for me to post step-by-step recipes here on my blog.

They&#8217;re a cooking appliance known as a &#8220;Multi Cooker&#8221; which means it has several different functions, its most notable (and useful, in my experience) being a pressure cooker.

I am generally resistant to new electronic cooking appliances, because I&#8217;m old school and love a dutch oven and an iron skillet. But then my BFF Hyacinth, who is an Instant Pot evangelist, gave me one for my birthday last January. I&#8217;ve slowly but surely come to LOVE it, and noticed that I wasn&#8217;t ever putting it away in the pantry.

As I write in my cookbook, they have long been relegated to the snack/chip aisle in the grocery store, but when the low carb/Keto revolution happened, people discovered that, when ground up, they make the most magical stand-in for breadcrumbs. (It gets even more fun when you consider that pork rinds now come in lots of different flavors, like regular chips.) Pork rinds as chicken strip breading is definitely one of those &#8220;who thinks these things up?!?&#8221; scenarios&#8212;kind of like the person who decided to try putting Preparation H. under their eyes to reduce swelling. Note that I did not write that comment about Preparation H. in my cookbook. It&#8217;s a good thing I still have my wits about me in some areas!</p>\n<p>Anyway, I encourage you to give these a try! This pork rind breading can be used to bread pretty much anything you&#8217;d normally coat in breadcrumbs: fish sticks, fried mozzarella, the list goes on. Also, it&#8217;s just really fun to say &#8220;I made pork rind chicken strips&#8221; and watch the confused fascination that appears on the listener&#8217;s face. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to make them!</p>\n<p>&#160;<br />\n<a href=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520\"><img src=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"520\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-103243\" srcset=\"https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=2500 2500w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=300 300w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=768 768w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=1024 1024w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=1536 1536w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=2048 2048w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=240 240w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=480 480w, https://thepioneerwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_4842.jpg?resize=780%2C520?w=2340 2340w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Cut 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts into thin strips.

I think it&#8217;s partly to do with the fact that a full-sized cheesecake is a living, breathing thing, and while I can usually avoid winding up with a big crack down the middle, sometimes a cheesecake does what it wants to do. In addition, a full-sized cheesecake takes so long to chill properly, and by the time you can actually cut a slice and enjoy it, you have now aged 27 years. </p>\n<p>As I said, I just want to get back in bed.</p>\n<p>So mini cheesecakes are where I live!
