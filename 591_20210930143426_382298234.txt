In 2007, we introduced Street View, the first imagery platform to show you panoramic views of streets all over the world — from Tokyo to Tonga. A year later, we let you throw away your printed directions and get real-time navigation directly from your phone. And three years ago, we were the first to launch Live View and bring AR to navigation at scale. Thanks to our deep knowledge about the world and powerful AI advancements, we’ve spent the last 16 years bringing helpful information and experiences just like these to the map. Today at Google I/O, we’re announcing five new updates so you can more easily navigate, explore and get things done.  </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Reduce hard-braking with routing updates</h3><p>Imagine you’re driving to meet a friend. As you approach a busy intersection, the traffic slows suddenly and you have to slam on your brakes. According to research from experts at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, these hard-braking moments — incidents along a route that cause a driver to sharply decelerate — can be a leading indicator of car crash likelihood. Soon, Google Maps will reduce your chances of having hard-braking moments along your drive thanks to help from machine learning and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-ai-helps-predict-traffic-and-determine-routes/\">navigation information</a>.</p><br/><p>Here’s how it works: Every time you get directions in Maps, we calculate multiple route options to your destination based on several factors, like how many lanes a road has and how direct a route is. With this update, we’ll take the fastest routes and identify which one is likely to reduce your chances of encountering a hard-braking moment. We’ll automatically recommend that route if the ETA is the same or the difference is minimal. We believe that these changes have the potential to eliminate 100 million hard-braking events in routes driven with Google Maps each year, so you can rely on Maps to get you from A to B quickly — but also more safely.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Walk this way with enhancements to Live View and detailed street maps</h3><p>If you’re getting around on foot, we’ve got you covered with augmented reality in Live View. If you’re exploring a new neighborhood, you’ll be able to access Live View instantly — right from the map — and see helpful details about the shops and restaurants around you, like how busy they are, recent reviews and photos. We’ll also display helpful new street signs for complex intersections so you know exactly what road you’re on and which way to go. And if you’re traveling, Live View will tell you where you are in relation to places like your hotel — so you can always find your way back to home base.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\" data-component=\"uni-image-carousel\"><div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\"><ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\"><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"A GIF of Live View being used to explore restaurants in a New York City neighborhood\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 \" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Live_View_Information.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">A GIF of Live View being used to explore restaurants in a New York City neighborhood</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Access Live View right from the map to quickly learn more about a place. </p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"A GIF of Live View showing street labels overlaid on Google Maps with augmented reality\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 \" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Live_View_Street_Labels.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">A GIF of Live View showing street labels overlaid on Google Maps with augmented reality</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>See street labels in Live View to help you navigate complex intersections.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"A GIF of Live View showing where you are in relation to a nearby hotel with augmented reality\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 \" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Live_View_Hotel__Landmark_2ANsZrp.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">A GIF of Live View showing where you are in relation to a nearby hotel with augmented reality</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>See where you are in relation to places like your home, work or hotel. </p></div></figcaption></figure></li></ul><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-previous uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - left click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Previous\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-left\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-next uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - right click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Next\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-right\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__navigation\"><div class=\"glue-pagination-page-list uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - dot click\"\n           }'></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><br/><p>Our <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/more-detailed-colorful-map\">detailed street maps</a> feature, which launched last August, will soon be available in 50 more cities by the end of this year — including Berlin, São Paulo, Seattle, and Singapore.

Now, this is expanding to show the relative busyness of an entire area, like whether a neighborhood or part of town is busier than usual. If it’s Saturday morning and you want to explore your city without crowds bogging you down, open up Maps to instantly see busy hotspots to avoid — like the streets near the local farmers’ market.

If you live in New York and open up Maps at 8 a.m. on a weekday, we’ll prominently feature nearby coffee shops — instead of dinner spots — so you can start your day with a caffeine fix. And if you’re on a weekend getaway, it’ll be easier to spot local landmarks and tourist attractions right on the map. Want more options?
