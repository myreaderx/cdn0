Powered by hydrogen fuel cells, the Hyperion XP-1 can hit breakneck speeds of 220mph (354kmh), so all you&#8217;d really see is a blur as it passes you by.</p><p>The car was supposed to debut at the now-canceled New York Auto Show, but Hyperion did deliver on its promise of a reveal by releasing the video above, and images of what the car will look like. The car was designed by Hyperion&#8217;s team of aerospace engineers, a fact that&#8217;s pretty believable considering how the car looks like it could break the sound barrier. The tip of the XP-1 even has a jet-inspired pointed nose to cut across the air as the rest of the automobile&#8217;s aerodynamic surfacing helps guide it forward with as little drag as possible. The car&#8217;s outer body, made from titanium-reinforced carbon-fiber, encloses its “Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Power Module”. This “space-age” hydrogen propulsion system stores energy in cells as opposed to a lithium-ion battery, and delivers power to four motors connected to each of the four wheels. It all sounds futuristic because it most certainly is, and I&#8217;m not surprised that the XP-1&#8217;s ignition sounds like Iron Man&#8217;s repulsors too.</p><p>The Hyperion XP-1 boasts of a stellar 1000 mile range, delivered in part because of the efficient hydrogen propulsion system, but also because the car comes mounted with solar panels on its air blades. The air blades, sitting on each side of the car, act as aerodynamic structures to help cornering at high-speeds, and come mounted with solar panels that can apparently change position to track the sun as you drive. Speaking of driving, the XP1 boasts of an acceleration of 0-60mph in just 2.2 seconds, and a top speed of over 220mph. Moreover, Hyperion even claims that the supercar can fully recharge in under 5 minutes. The company&#8217;s been beating all odds to continue development and production through the pandemic, and they&#8217;re estimating having 300 units of a production version ready by as soon as 2022.</p><p>Designer: Hyperion</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-273297\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/hyperion_xp1_1.jpg\"

waste?","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=273393","description":"<p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273417\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/can-niveas-3d-printed-shower-gel-refill-station-prototype-really-reduce-plastic-packaging-waste/01-nivea_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Brands are consciously moving towards eco-friendly practices and the first hurdle every single one of them has to overcome is plastic packaging waste. NIVEA&#8217;s parent company is German giant Beiersdorf and they are on a mission to reduce packaging waste by minimizing and closing their material cycles. And for NIVEA that meant launching a shower gel refill station! Now it is a good first step and has its pros but also has some cons. The biggest con is that shower gels itself are not good for the environment and there is no way to know how many bottles actually get rinsed clean before they are recycled &#8211; otherwise, it doesn&#8217;t work. Shower gels also need a lot of water to be made, and as climate change makes the world hotter/drier, the water crisis is already a big issue in many countries. A solution to that? Bar soaps! NIVEA makes those too, they use less water and can be packaged in recycled paper &#8211; that is the real solution but if this refill station reduces some plastic waste and sparks a movement for the brand to take bigger steps, then we are here to see it.</p><p>The prototype is going to be tested in select locations where the brand will gather data on how consumers are interacting, feeling, reacting to the concept of reusable bottles. The prototype machine was made with their in-house 3D printers<em>. </em>NIVEA hopes that with this refill station they will make it convenient for consumers to reuse containers and reduce plastic usage. Once they experience that it is easy to make small sustainable lifestyle changes, they will be quicker to adopt it as a habit. The refill station has been carefully designed, developed, and engineered by a cross-functional team within Beiersdorf&#8217;s global packaging and R&#38;D functions. Consumers can refill up to three times before sending their bottles to be recycled and get a new one for hygiene reasons &#8211; this limitation slows down the plastic consumption problem but without longevity in the solution, it will not end the cycle.</p><p>Caroline Zia, Senior Formula Developer at Beiersdorf wanted to make sure that the concept worked for sustainability and for the consumer&#8217;s experience. &#8220;The formulations need to withstand the additional burden of refilling and we had to carefully choose our products after extensive internal testing. Also, the machine had to be programmed for additional cleaning protocols so that we could guarantee multiple filling loops and still meet our safety and sustainability criteria,’ she explains. The machine&#8217;s design had to also account for the retailer&#8217;s interior requirements while providing easy user experience. &#8220;We decided to use light as visual support to guide the users. Whenever one of the dedicated refill-bottles has been filled or a bar code has been printed, the integrated LED lights give feedback to the consumer,&#8221; says Marta Suslow, Concept Designer at Beiersdorf&#8217;s packaging department. Other details include formula choice and refill cycles, sophisticated pumps, color-changing lights, a label printer, and a programmed microcontroller.</p><p>While this is a good start, personal care brands, especially global giants like NIVEA can step up their game to find real solutions that make it a sustainable choice. You already have the product and the presence, pivot to reducing plastic waste at a larger scale as well as reduce water consumption with one &#8216;clean&#8217; move &#8211; soap.</p><p>Designers:

on scans of their feet. Its slip-on design comes with a unique visual and tactile experience, appearing as well as feeling lightweight. The shoe&#8217;s light appearance can be attributed to the fact it looks quite like a feather or leaf wrapped around your foot, and the absence of the traditional thick sole found in shoes and sneakers makes it look/feel sleek and lightweight.</p><p>The slip-on is a combination of multiple materials, including the leather wraparound and an SLS 3D printed nylon sole that fits into it. The sole, designed specifically for each foot, comes with a bespoke pebbled surface that applies pressure on specific areas of the foot to relieve pressure, provide support, and give you a comfortable walking experience without the fatigue. What&#8217;s really unique about the Walk Of Mind footwear is the fact that its monosurface design and transitions seamlessly from sole to foot-cover. This means the shoe could essentially be flat-packed for more efficient shipping, or even have one shoe nested within another to create a much smaller package than with traditional footwear. Would be fun to see a video of a working prototype!</p><p>The Walk Of Mind shoes are a winner of the <a\nhref=\"http://geni.us/adesignawards\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A&#8217; Design Award</a> for the year 2020.</p><p>Designer: Hadar Slassi</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-273142\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-273143\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-273144\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-273145\" /></p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:27:28 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_1.jpg","linkMd5":"6b2645bc972c02e8bac6d72c8f798a31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn21@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-07-39-487_d4d9d3eebb21a626.webp","author":"Sarang Sheth","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn21@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-07-39-487_d4d9d3eebb21a626.webp","https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-07-41-334_4693c127c7fbb9a7.webp","https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn93@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-07-40-934_0f9cedb66bd5fa10.webp","https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-07-42-789_34aafa53be70f214.webp","https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/walk_of_mind_shoes_5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn81@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-07-43-395_cf51686ab94ca4fb.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 05:07:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 05:07:39","title":"These cork headphones are a no screws, no glue, plastic-free sustainable alternative!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=273255","description":"<p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273257\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273255/01-cork_headphones_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Cork is one of the most versatile materials when it comes to sustainable design &#8211; we have a whole list of <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/cork/\">product designs that have used cork</a> to create sustainable alternatives and reduce plastic consumption! These cork headphones are another great addition to that list and show us that gadgets can also go green &#8211; you would be surprised to know how much plastic goes in making a simple pair of headphones.</p><p>Weighing only 64 grams  (0.14 lbs) these headphones are super light! Cork is a versatile material that is being explored to design sustainable products. It is non-allergic, resilient, sound insulating, moisture-proof, and soft to touch. If you are an everyday headphone user, you know that there is a lot of wear and tear that happens and instead of repairing, we usually just upgrade which increases our plastic consumption. Cork headphones are easy to repair and dismiss thanks to an assembly based on the compressibility of the material. There is no glue, no upholstery, no screws involved &#8211; just cork, simple electric parts, steel, and foam.</p><p>Woodturner Jean Yves Lerate crafted the first model in his beautiful workshop located in Auray, France. The cork was supplied by Corticeira Amorim and Pauline made a fully working prototype during a five days workshop at Domaine de Boisbuchet which was led by designer duo Pedrita.</p><p>Desingers:

The clothes designed for you to workout and sweat in, are made in sweatshops&#8230; where kids toil every day, perspiring behind a tailoring machine to create the clothes that you can comfortably perspire in. It’s this disparity that makes the fashion industry so dark and flawed, and the fact that companies like Fox &#38; Robin can exist and deliver the quality activewear that’s ethically made, is something that really gives me hope. Fox &#38; Robin is perhaps the only company that’s transparent enough to declare the wages of their laborers. The company’s strongest value is its desire to be ethical, and that core belief of purity reflects in their clothing too. Fox &#38; Robin’s activewear combines physical comfort along with the mental/moral comfort of knowing that what you’re wearing is responsibly manufactured, and that the labor behind it was rewarded with a fair wage.</p><p>There are two fundamental parts to Fox &#38; Robin’s athletic-wear line. There is the design+quality, and then there is the ethical and transparent supply chain. The company’s activewear line currently comes with four offerings &#8211; shorts, jogger-pants, shirts, and hoodies. The shorts come with a near-perfect fit… the inner liner is a body-hugging soft liner that acts as a second skin while wicking sweat and moisture to keep your legs feeling breezy. The outer fabric acts as a stylish clad, and comes with a pocket on the right side that’s great for stashing things like your keys, cards, phone, or your AirPods case. Designed for practically any indoor or outdoor activity, you can wear the shorts while working out, going on a run, playing a sport, or taking a dip in a pool. The active shirts pair perfectly with the shorts, and are made from a comfortable, moisture-wicking fabric that even resists odor to smell fresh even after being worn multiple times. The joggers and hoodies give you more of a full-body athleisure experience, and are made from the same ridiculously comfortable fabric that you’d expect to wear only while working out, but would probably end up in them for the entire day! All apparel are available in multiple sizes and colors, and are even shipped in biodegradable packaging!</p><p>The Fox &#38; Robin’s business model is truly what defines it and sets it apart as perhaps the only gym-apparel company that’s transparent enough to be open about their labor practices. By not engaging in sub-contracting, and being highly cognizant of the way their clothes are made, the guys at Fox &#38; Robin can ensure that laborers are rewarded for their work, and the factories they operate in are managed with the highest ethical and humanitarian standards. Scroll down on Fox &#38; Robin’s Kickstarter page and you’ll even see a chart showing that they pay their workers nearly double the minimum wage, while even donating 2% of all profits from sales to causes like Educational development and the Environment. The apparel still manages to retain its low price-tag by not charging luxury taxes, brand markups, or by needing to maintain retail outlets. Its direct-to-consumer business model allows this indie company to so effectively lock horns with giants like Lululemon, Nike, and Adidas and still come out with a product that’s the same price and quality, yet much more ethically manufactured.</p><p>Designer: Fox &#38; Robin</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://Yanko.fnd.to/foxandrobin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: Athlete Bundle for $98</strong></a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-08-13T11:00:47+00:00\">$133</del> (26% off).

With multiple scientists presenting evidence to WHO that the COVID-19 virus isn’t particulate-borne but rather is an airborne virus (which makes it much more difficult to deal with), it’s time our masks did more than just trapping particles. The <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/09/ditch-those-dirty-cloth-masks-this-reusable-uv-c-face-mask-makes-it-easy-to-breathe-99-clean-air/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UV Mask</a>, unlike your conventional N95, doesn’t just trap microorganisms… it neutralizes them too, breaking down the genetic materials of coronavirus in milliseconds. Designed by UM Systems, the UV Mask comes with a dual filtration system that delivers the cleanest air quality of any existing face-mask. A preliminary replaceable N95 filter blocks 95% of particles like dust, dirt, debris, up to 0.3 microns. Microorganisms smaller than 0.3 microns then enter the UV-C Sterile Vortex, a helix-shaped filter that blasts microorganisms with UV-C light to destroy 99.9% of the remaining 5% on a DNA level, to give you air that isn’t just clean, it’s medical-grade, sterile-clean, bringing total filtration efficiency to 99.99%.</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273321\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/02-reusable_protective_face_mask_with_replaceable_N99_filters_surreal-future.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273322\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/02-reusable_protective_face_mask_with_replaceable_N99_filters_surreal-future2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1341\" /></p><p\nclass=\"post-without-image\">The <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/05/ditch-those-dirty-cloth-masks-this-reusable-silicone-face-mask-makes-it-easy-to-breathe-99-clean-air-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LMP S2</a> is the product of a new normal, where masks may just be as common as wearing shades because it’s sunny out. Mark Austen&#8217;s LMP S2 improves on the N95 by ditching the fabric construction for silicone, which isn’t just comfortable, it’s easier to clean and is food-grade. Making the entire mask from silicone ensures a perfect, practically air-tight fit every time, while the soft elastomeric material is much easier on the skin, allowing you to wear the mask for longer without feeling any discomfort. The LMP S2’s silicone body takes the shape of faces, ensuring a universal fit, while an internal frame keeps the mask’s shape intact, so it doesn’t buckle and collapse every time you inhale. Fitted onto the front of the LMP S2 are a layered N99 and activated carbon filter that allows you to easily inhale 99% fresh air with every breath you take. The mask even features a dual-valve setup on each side that doubles the amount of air flowing into and out of the mask, effectively preventing the humidity in your breath from getting trapped inside the mask, keeping you fresh at all times. The result is a mask that looks, feels, and performs better than an N95.</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273324\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/03-Blocc_face_shield_covers_eyes_nose_and_mouth_surreal-future.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273325\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/03-Blocc_face_shield_covers_eyes_nose_and_mouth_surreal-future2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"788\" /></p><p>Have you touched your face yet?

Think of the Blocc as a helmet visor sans the helmet. Made from scratch-resistant fog-resistant clear polycarbonate, the Blocc is as easy (and as comfortable) as wearing a pair of specs. Two temple-stems suspend the Blocc by your ears while a nose-bridge allows the visor to rest comfortably against your nose, and roughly an inch away from your face. The Blocc’s material choice makes it practically perfect for a face shield. Made from the same polymer as actual helmet visors (even the ones found in riot gear use PolyCarbonate), the Blocc is perfectly clear, allowing you to see through it with ease, while its resilient physical property prevents it from getting any scratches or scuffs by accident. It sits like an invisible force-field around your face, acting as a constant reminder to not scratch your eye or dig your nose or do anything that would be deemed just plain unhygienic or nasty.</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273326\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/04-RespoLab_valveless_reusable_face_mask_airplane-friendly.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273327\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/04-RespoLab_valveless_reusable_face_mask_airplane-friendly2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1772\" /></p><p><a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/30/this-reusable-face-mask-uses-a-pleated-hepa-filter-to-let-you-breathe-99-9-clean-air-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RespoLab’s</a> innovation lies in its use of a pleated and curved H13 HEPA filter, that covers your entire mouth. It sort of looks like the pleated, zigzag cabin air filters you see inside cars and air-conditioning systems. In both those cases, the job is pretty simple… to constantly filter air while easily trapping all sorts of microparticles into its pleats/folds. The filter exceeds the N99 standards, trapping even the finest particulate matter including viruses, allergens, pollen, and bacteria to deliver 99.97% clean air to your nose and mouth. The mask comes with a modular, multi-part design featuring an external plastic cover made from recycled ABS, and an oronasal mask made from TPE/TPU that provides the perfect seal around your face in a way that feels comfortable. The RespoLab’s design is engineered to control the airflow so that the inside of your mask never gets hot or humid, and the presence of a large filter makes sure you’re never struggling to be heard. The geometry of the filter allows sound waves to propagate and transmit through the mask more readily, further improving usability.</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273329\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/05-gado_and_ken_facemask-and-purifier-concept_surreal-future.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/8ce93595681201.5eb439fc577c5.gif\" alt=\"Faceshield\" width=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273330\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/05-gado_and_ken_facemask-and-purifier-concept_surreal-future2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p\nclass=\"post-without-image\">The <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/12/why-this-mask-shield-is-different-from-everything-youve-seen-so-far/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gādo</a> mask doubles up as a face shield so that no bacteria enters your eye and comes with an accessory-like sanitizer so you won’t have to search your bags or have an oddly-shaped pocket. Designer Fulden Dehneli calls the mask Gādo (ガード) and the sanitizer Ken (剣) because she views these as complementary products that will become necessities in a post-pandemic world. Gādo means ‘guard’ and Ken means ‘sword’ in Japanese which is such a poetic way to describe tools – they guard us and kill the germs! Gādo and Ken were specifically designed for seamless integration into our lives. Gādo combines the benefits of a mask and a face shield with a simple sliding mechanism- a folded textile structure hidden under the shield which enlarges when the shield is slid up. This way you don’t have to constantly wear the traditionally obtrusive face shield but can ‘guard up’ if you’re among people and can’t maintain distance. Along with head straps that ensure comfort and fit, it also keeps the mouth visible to keep the window of human expression open, something we crave so deeply and will not take for granted when this ends. Ken is a sanitizer spray bottle that is ergonomically designed to be more portable and accessible than its predecessors.</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273332\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/06-AIRPOP-Mask_Oliver-Perretta_Face-Mask-designs-Surreal-Future2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273331\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/06-AIRPOP-Mask_Oliver-Perretta_Face-Mask-designs-Surreal-Future.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Inspired by the AIRPOP pollution masks, designer Oliver Perretta has created this trendy multifunctional mask.

This mask is titled Summer Wave and the designers believe that if we have to go through wave#2 of COVID, at least let there be sunny days!</p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://i.imgur.com/a1ify5S.gif\" alt=\"Ex Apple designer\" width=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273336\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/08-Ex-Apple-Designers-Mask_Paseman-and-Duong_Surreal-Future2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p\nclass=\"post-without-image\"> The idea for a DIY hack came to Paseman around the time when the country was facing a severe shortage of N95 masks, forcing doctors and nurses to wear readily available loosely-fitted surgical masks. Paseman first tried scouting her area for N95 masks, hoping to donate them to medical facilities, and when she couldn’t find any N95 masks available in her vicinity, she decided to create a life-saving lifehack to make standard surgical masks more functional by ensuring a tighter seal/fit. The solution? A simple DIY seal that closes all air gaps around your nose and mouth so there’s no air leakage anywhere caused by a loosely fitted mask. Paseman and Duong’s first iteration of the <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/28/an-ex-apple-designers-lifehack-lets-doctors-turn-surgical-masks-into-secure-n95-masks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fix The Mask</a> solution involved the MacGyverian use of a handful of rubber bands that could be strung together to create a tight brace to secure the mask’s fit. A few iterations later, the two developed a more robust solution by cutting into rubber sheets to create a better, more effective harness. The harness design is available on the Fix The Mask website as a free resource, to allow health professionals and regular citizens to get the most out of their face-gear while remaining safe from the virus.</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273337\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/09-c_mask_auto-translating-languages_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273338\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/09-c_mask_auto-translating-languages_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"703\" /></p><p>Designed by Japan-based Donut Robotics, the <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/31/this-smart-face-mask-auto-translates-languages-as-you-speak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C-Face mask</a> is a universal mask-cover that fits on top of your standard face mask. Switch it on, and the C-Face mask connects to your smartphone, giving you a wide variety of smart features. Not only does it enable you to answer calls and talk to people without holding your phone’s mouthpiece near your mouth, it auto converts speech to text, allowing you to reply to messages, verbally type out emails, or ask your smartphone’s voice AI queries without having to take off your mask and talk to it. Currently, the C-Face even possesses the ability to translate between Japanese and 8 other languages, but multi-language support is merely an app update away! The voice-to-text feature even means less unnecessary touching of your smartphone’s screen to type out messages. Just say what you need and the dedicated app converts speech into text that you can copy and paste in messages, chat boxes, or mail drafts. The app even possesses the ability to auto-translate between a total of 9 languages, allowing you to seamlessly communicate with people regardless of language barriers. It’s almost as if the C-Face gives you the ability to speak in multiple dialects!</p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273339\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/10-Cannula-Mask_protective-element_skeleton-face-mask_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273340\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/10-Cannula-Mask_protective-element_skeleton-face-mask_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273317\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273286/10-Cannula-Mask_protective-element_skeleton-face-mask_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"633\" /></p><p>The <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/13/this-3d-printed-structure-prevents-your-face-mask-from-collapsing-as-you-breathe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cannula mask</a> by BDCI avoids this problem with its reinforcing endoskeleton. A thin plastic grille, this skeleton gives the mask its defining structure, preventing it from pressing against your face the same way a hanger prevents clothes from getting crushed by retaining its shape. Designed to be worn by people with respiratory difficulties, the endoskeleton even comes with a hollow spine that allows you to plug a nasal cannula to it, letting you direct fresh oxygen right to the wearer’s nose; effectively allowing them to inhale and exhale freely without worrying about a flimsy mask smothering them every time they try to breathe.</p><p>Whether you choose to wear a mask or not impacts not just your health &#8211; but those susceptible around you who trust you to take care of them.

Even when it does open, it isn&#8217;t the first place that we would go to as we all have become super comfortable with extensive Netflix binges at home without overpriced popcorn and fighting your neighbor for the armrest. As more and more movies release on streaming platforms instead of theatres, it is worth investing in an audiovisual set like the Cinera Edge which brings the cinematic experience home to you!</p><p>This is the world&#8217;s first personal cinema HMD that features dual 2.5K micro-OLED and a Dolby Digital® certified headphone with 5.1 channels of surround sound &#8211; it is the closest thing you can get to having your own movie theatre without buying multiple appliances or doing construction. The combination of those visual and audio elements is elite! It truly gives you a complete theatrical immersive experience with high-quality video and audio which makes the Cinera Edge a mobile cinema. It is not just for watching movies or your favorite shows, you can integrate it with your TV and gaming systems to take your everyday entertainment to the next level.</p><p>&#8220;Using the latest technology like micro OLED, we managed to dramatically reduce the form factor while packing the same amount of pixels as in Cinera v1. Cinera Edge unlocks over the predecessor multiple significant advancements: integrated headphones, true mobility, long-session comfortableness, and more,&#8221; says the team. &#8220;An OLED screen responds super fast. As a result, motion blur is mostly eliminated when displaying fast-moving objects. It also helps reduce motion sickness when watching VR content,&#8221; they add. Both the screens deliver sharp images at 2560&#215;1440 pixels, which is significantly higher than most other products in the market. It also uses the same DCI-P3 color standard in its screen that is widely adopted by the projection systems used in movie theaters so you really are getting to experience the visuals as you would in a theatre.</p><p>Cinera Edge has a native 3D display so you don&#8217;t need to wear those 3D glasses to have an immersive experience. One of the most outstanding features is the Dolby Digital® certified headphones so it lets the device flawlessly decode the high-quality soundtracks from Blu-rays and video streaming platforms. It has 4 drivers on each side and simulates cinematic 5.1 surround sound and delivers straight into your ears. The headphone is designed to finely modulate clear human voices, deliver high spatial accuracy, and ample bass for the ultimate audio experience without having a home theatre sound system. When Dolby certifies it, you already know its the best in the game.</p><p>The device itself is very ergonomically built and makes it comfortable to wear for long sessions. It smartly shifts more weight to its sides, taking the pressure off the front part so you can turn on your binge mode without any issues. It is compatible to be used with your mobile phones and can also play content using WiFi, USB drive, or micro SD card. Cinera Edge really has an &#8216;edge&#8217; over other VR devices because of its superior sound and visual tech that let you live the movies you would otherwise merely watch.</p><p>Designer: Cinera Edge</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://cinera-edge-a-5k-oled-hmd-with.kckb.st/03c83b12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click Here to Buy Now: $499</a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-08-10T07:36:47+00:00\">$799</del> (45% off).

That’s what you get when watching a movie or playing a video game using Cinera Edge.</p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Great Leap with Next-Gen M-OLED</h4><p><a\nhref=\"https://cinera-edge-a-5k-oled-hmd-with.kckb.st/03c83b12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273117\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/this-headset-brings-you-the-ultimate-experience-with-2-5k-micro-oled-dolby-digital-certified-sound-images/06-Cinera-Edge_5K-OLED-HMD_Dolby-digital_immersive-media.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p><p><a\nhref=\"https://cinera-edge-a-5k-oled-hmd-with.kckb.st/03c83b12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img\nloading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273130\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/this-headset-brings-you-the-ultimate-experience-with-2-5k-micro-oled-dolby-digital-certified-sound-images/19-Cinera-Edge_5K-OLED-HMD_Dolby-digital_immersive-media.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p><p><a\nhref=\"https://cinera-edge-a-5k-oled-hmd-with.kckb.st/03c83b12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img\nsrc=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/649/666/1898b0c18346c91a62f7a02b653df5da_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1593516903&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=bc49772d4657127edb075d0c3b25e89f\" alt=\"Next Gen M-OLED\" width=\"1050\" /></a></p><p>Cinera Edge is using the latest technology &#8212; micro OLED.

DCI-P3 color space has a much more full gamut of color than the conventional sRGB so that Cinera Edge can reproduce more colors with more accuracy. Think about an Apple Pro Display (Cinera Edge) vs. a regular monitor in your office (Others).</p><p><strong>3515 PPI:</strong> Each screen packs 3.6 million (2560&#215;1440) pixels into a 0.83’’(2cm) area, giving it seven times more dense image than the iPhone 11 Pro’s display. Cinera Edge’s micro OLED screen is the critical breakthrough of Cinera Edge’s new screen technology, as it makes ultra-high resolution possible in a goggle.
