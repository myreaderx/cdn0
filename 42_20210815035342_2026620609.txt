The plates should fit nearly perfectly when implanted thanks to the new approach. The researchers have also developed an improved surgical technique, the TOKA (Tailored Osteotomy for Knee Alignment), which they claim should improve the fit of the HTO on the knee and significantly speed up HTO surgery from two hours to approximately 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Knee osteoarthritis is a major health, social and economic issue and does not receive as much attention as it should. A quarter of women over 45 have it, and about 15 percent of men, so it&#8217;s a significant burden that many live with,” said Richie Gill, a researcher involved in the study, in a press release. &#8220;Knee replacement is only useful for end-stage osteoarthritis, so you can be in pain and have to live with a disability for a long time, potentially decades, before it&#8217;s possible. We hope that the new TOKA process we&#8217;ve developed will change that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/knee-implant.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517412\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/knee-implant.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/knee-implant-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/knee-implant-768x554.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin the procedure, patients undergo a 3D CT scan of the knee, and these data are then used to manufacture a personalized HTO and surgical guide that fit their shin bone perfectly. The 3D-printing process relies on a metal printing technique that results in medical-grade titanium-alloy plates. The manufactured surgical guide helps to simplify and speed up the surgery. As the implants fit the patient perfectly, they are intended to reduce discomfort post-surgery and can be implanted in earlier stage patients. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The HTO surgery has a long clinical history and it has very good results if done accurately. The difficulty surgeons have is achieving high accuracy, which is why we have created the TOKA method, which starts with a CT scan and digital plan,” said Gill. &#8220;3D-printing the custom knee implant and doing the scanning before operating means surgeons will know exactly what they&#8217;ll see before operating and where the implant will go. In addition to a surgeon being able to precisely plan an operation, a surgical guide (or jig) and a plate implant, each personalized to the patient, can be 3D-printed automatically based on the scanning data. Importantly this type of treatment relieves the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis while preserving the natural joint.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a virtual trial, where the researchers used <em>in silico</em> modeling with CT data from 28 patients to assess the potential of the technique, the device has got the go-ahead for a real-life trial in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an animation showing some of the differences between the TOKA implants and conventional ones:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Structurally optimised Toka compared to generic plate\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/277102258?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>Communications Medicine</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-021-00001-7\">Personalised high tibial osteotomy has mechanical safety equivalent to generic device in a case–control in silico clinical trial</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/personalised-3d-printed-knee-implant-could-bring-relief-to-thousands-of-arthritis-sufferers/\">University of Bath</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=DkYiN8k5y6w:ZCAC-i9jp_w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=DkYiN8k5y6w:ZCAC-i9jp_w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=DkYiN8k5y6w:ZCAC-i9jp_w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=DkYiN8k5y6w:ZCAC-i9jp_w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/DkYiN8k5y6w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Aug 2021 20:40:00 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TOKA-system.png","linkMd5":"6fcd14ddd170e9ac048cfd176f656e79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-22-380_bcb905843d7d6411.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":531,"sourceBytes":189912,"destBytes":16010,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TOKA-system.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-22-380_bcb905843d7d6411.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/knee-implant.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-284_d1af8f480a976c5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=DkYiN8k5y6w:ZCAC-i9jp_w:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn57@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-220_2554bf8b08e02376.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/DkYiN8k5y6w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-057_e99ebf25c4d55637.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Low-Cost Nanobodies from Alpacas are Highly Potent Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1517196","description":"\n<p>Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, Germany, engineered mini-antibodies, called nanobodies, against SARS-CoV-2. The team’s nanobodies are stable up to 95 degrees Celsius (203 F) and are cheaper and less complex to produce than conventional antibodies. So far, the nanobodies have shown impressive efficacy against the virus and its variants in the lab, and the researchers are preparing to conduct a clinical trial to see if they could be a viable treatment for COVID-19 patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517268\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies-768x467.jpg 768w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies-265x160.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /><figcaption>Two of the newly developed nanobodies (blue and magenta) binding to the receptor-binding domain (green) of the coronavirus spike protein (grey), thus preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. <br>Credit: Thomas Güttler / Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Antibodies are an important defense against viral invaders in our bodies. These protein structures bind and neutralize a wide variety of pathogens, and are an important part of the immune response generated following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. They also represent a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients, whereby lab-produced antibodies can be administered to such patients to help them to combat the virus. However, producing antibodies is costly and complex, and it is not currently possible to create enough supplies to treat everyone who needs them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, nanobodies, which are more easily manufactured, could be a viable alternative. This latest creation is shaping up to be a promising drug candidate for COVID-19. “For the first time, they combine extreme stability and outstanding efficacy against the virus and its Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta mutants,” said Dirk Görlich, a researcher involved in the study, in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alpaca-inhibitors-of-covid-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517266\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alpaca-inhibitors-of-covid-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alpaca-inhibitors-of-covid-1-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /><figcaption>The three alpaca mares&#160;Britta, Xenia, and Nora provided the starting point for the COVID-19 nanobodies. <br>Credit: Carmen Rotte / Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Max Planck team use Alpacas to produce the nanobodies by immunizing them against the viral spike protein and then isolating the nanobodies from the blood before further purification and testing. “Our nanobodies originate from alpacas and are smaller and simpler than conventional antibodies,” said Görlich. “The overall burden on our animals is very low, comparable to vaccination and blood testing in humans.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strikingly, the new nanobodies have a very high heat tolerance, something that is important for their stability in the body and which can be a sticking point for many biological treatments. “Our nanobodies can withstand temperatures of up to 95 °C without losing their function or forming aggregates,” said Matthias Dobbelstein, another researcher working on the project. “For one thing, this tells us that they might remain active in the body long enough to be effective. For another, heat-resistant nanobodies are easier to produce, process, and store.” &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers are planning a clinical trial of the technology, which may have potential as an inhaled treatment for COVID-19 patients. “Our single nanobodies are potentially suitable for inhalation and thus for direct virus neutralization in the respiratory tract,” said Dobbelstein. “In addition, because they are very small, they could readily penetrate tissues and prevent the virus from spreading further at the site of infection.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>The EMBO Journal</em>: <a href=\"https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embj.2021107985\">Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by highly potent, hyperthermostable, and mutation-tolerant nanobodies</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/17995736/pr_2117\">Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=JZeLGO23peM:ybOLlFv46AA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=JZeLGO23peM:ybOLlFv46AA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=JZeLGO23peM:ybOLlFv46AA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=JZeLGO23peM:ybOLlFv46AA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/JZeLGO23peM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 17:18:03 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies.jpg","linkMd5":"37f83985e18c649799bc06a936d6225a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn21@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-10-236_48178eab98b3d024.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":468,"sourceBytes":258949,"destBytes":52784,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nanobodies.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn21@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-10-236_48178eab98b3d024.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alpaca-inhibitors-of-covid-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn48@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-27-697_71666cad653ee4b4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=JZeLGO23peM:ybOLlFv46AA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn96@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-27-131_3f700bd803fe487f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/JZeLGO23peM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-26-996_5618048865225a15.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Ultrasound Patch Monitors Blood Flow","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1516513","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ultrasound-patch.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516812\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ultrasound-patch.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ultrasound-patch-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ultrasound-patch-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the University of California San Diego created an ultrasound patch that can measure blood flow in vessels as deep as 14 cm within the body. The stretchy patch can be applied to the skin and may help clinicians to monitor and diagnose various conditions, including blockages that could cause an infarct. The patch contains an array of ultrasound transducers that can measure blood flow in vessels directly beneath it and the ultrasound beam can also be steered to assess vessels that are nearby, but not directly below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monitoring blood flow in specific vessels can help clinicians to diagnose various cardiovascular diseases. For instance, measuring changes in blood flow in the carotid artery could show that someone is at a risk of stroke, and help to initiate treatment before a stroke occurs. However, current technology to accurately measure blood flow can be inconvenient, invasive, requiring a qualified technician to use an ultrasound probe to investigate the target vessel.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/flexible-ultrasound-patch-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516816\" width=\"350\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/flexible-ultrasound-patch-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/flexible-ultrasound-patch-1-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This patch is conceived as a more convenient alternative. &#8220;Just stick it on the skin, then read the signals. It&#8217;s not operator dependent, and it poses no extra work or burden to the technicians, clinicians or patients,&#8221; said Sai Zhou, a researcher involved in the study, via a UCSD press release. &#8220;In the future, patients could wear something like this to do point of care or continuous at-home monitoring.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flexible device contains a 12 x 12 grid of tiny ultrasound transducers embedded in a stretchy polymer. The transducers can be controlled to activate together, allowing the researchers to investigate vessels that are as deep as 14 cm beneath the skin. In another mode, the transducers will activate at different times, causing the ultrasound beam to be steered, which allows the user to investigate vessels that do not lie directly beneath the patch. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the phased array technology, we can manipulate the ultrasound beam in the way that we want,&#8221; said Muyang Lin, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;This gives our device multiple capabilities: monitoring central organs as well as blood flow, with high resolution. This would not be possible using just one transducer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested the patch and have shown that it is as accurate as a commercial ultrasound device. At present, the device is tethered to wires that provide power, but the research team hopes to develop a wireless version in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vantage-64.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516819\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vantage-64.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vantage-64-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vantage-64-768x520.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00763-4\">Continuous monitoring of deep-tissue haemodynamics with stretchable ultrasonic phased arrays</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/soft-skin-patch-could-provide-early-warning-for-strokes-heart-attacks?_ga=2.19694333.470734708.1627033130-394872704.1620298008\">University of California San Diego</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=1Ckpk5xYemA:cIP_haT5KGE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=1Ckpk5xYemA:cIP_haT5KGE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=1Ckpk5xYemA:cIP_haT5KGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=1Ckpk5xYemA:cIP_haT5KGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/1Ckpk5xYemA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:35:52 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ultrasound-patch.jpg","linkMd5":"fc9ac9eb28fe676dbb83d3f77844d5a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-26-396_04346e7e3880ffad.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":239592,"destBytes":39682,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ultrasound-patch.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-26-396_04346e7e3880ffad.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/flexible-ultrasound-patch-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn60@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-41-433_c2851bd4b44b250e.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vantage-64.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-412_475d41d5e56d89e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=1Ckpk5xYemA:cIP_haT5KGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-27-193_f3ce8749dc758948.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/1Ckpk5xYemA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn67@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-058_c6f9eaa8b78ccc55.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Wireless Light Implant for Optogenetics Without Skull Damage","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1517188","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Low-Res_IMG_4125.jpg.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517254\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Low-Res_IMG_4125.jpg.png 700w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Low-Res_IMG_4125.jpg-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the University of Arizona have overcome a major limitation of optogenetics with their wireless and battery-free implant that can shine light through the skull. The small device, which is implanted under the skin, could provide a light source for optogenetics that doesn’t require damage to the skull or brain. While optogenetics is currently an experimental technique that lets researchers learn more about neural circuitry in the brain, it may also one day be a viable therapeutic option for neurological disease.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optogenetics involves modifying specific neurons with a light-sensitive protein, so that when they are illuminated with light they fire. At present, the technique is invaluable for researchers seeking to understand the complexities of the brain and nervous system, and typically it is used in experimental animals. So far, so good, but the technique is pretty invasive, requiring penetration of the skull and brain so that a light source can be present at the correct location to activate the neurons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the technique has huge potential to treat diseases with a neurological basis, such as chronic pain, the invasive nature of the current methodology is a major stumbling block. The light source developed at the University of Arizona aims to change that, and bring us a little closer to clinical optogenetics.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/optogenetic-light-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517256\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/optogenetic-light-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/optogenetic-light-1-278x300.png 278w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This technique means we can use optogenetics without having to penetrate the skull or brain tissue, making it much less invasive,&#8221; said Jokubas Ausra, a researcher involved in the study, via a University of Arizona announcement. The tiny device has a diameter smaller than a dime and is as thick as a sheet of paper, allowing it to be implanted under the scalp without too much inconvenience.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is significant because when optogenetics become available for humans, we have technology that enables seamless light delivery to neurons in the brain or spine,&#8221; said Gutruf, who is also a member of the university&#8217;s BIO5 Institute. &#8220;This means we have a precursor technology that could someday help manage conditions like epilepsy or chronic pain without invasive surgery and chronic use of drugs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the technology could make things easier for optogenetics-based research, requiring less invasive procedures in experimental animals. &#8220;This tool allows scientists to do a wide range of experiments that were previously not possible,&#8221; said Gutruf. &#8220;These possibilities enable the scientific community to make faster progress to uncover the working principles of the brain and develop and test treatments in accurate environments. This is important for many areas – for example, enabling drug-free pain therapies to beat the opioid crisis.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>: <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/30/e2025775118\">Wireless, battery-free, subdermally implantable platforms for transcranial and long-range optogenetics in freely moving animals</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.arizona.edu/story/tiny-wireless-device-illuminates-neuron-activity-brain\">University of Arizona</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=bhPd2ry7zb0:W4Rlx2Zg0lU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=bhPd2ry7zb0:W4Rlx2Zg0lU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=bhPd2ry7zb0:W4Rlx2Zg0lU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=bhPd2ry7zb0:W4Rlx2Zg0lU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/bhPd2ry7zb0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:14:10 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Low-Res_IMG_4125.jpg.png","linkMd5":"aa6ba0d4bf7270b18c0763e05611b39d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-10-298_6bd72edc540326eb.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":467,"sourceBytes":400677,"destBytes":12660,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Low-Res_IMG_4125.jpg.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-10-298_6bd72edc540326eb.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/optogenetic-light-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn81@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-999_aa99faa85375e5d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=bhPd2ry7zb0:W4Rlx2Zg0lU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn62@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-348_9d0a6638e177a7cf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/bhPd2ry7zb0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn54@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-016_e69a805d6177a556.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Bladder-on-a-Chip and Bladder Organoids Reveal Dynamics of UTIs","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1517111","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/organoid-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517133\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/organoid-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/organoid-1-300x272.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland developed two complementary benchtop bladder models that could help in understanding the mechanisms behind recurring urinary tract infections (UTIs). The first involves bladder organoids, which allow the researchers to study bacterial-bladder cell interactions under realistic conditions, which include the 3D multi-layered architecture of the bladder wall. The second is a bladder-on-a-chip, which includes additional features that mimic the bladder environment, including the mechanical effects of bladder filling and voiding and bladder vasculature.     </p>\n\n\n\n<p>UTIs are a common infection, which can frequently reoccur, even after treatment using antibiotics. The infections are typically caused by a type of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria. With drug-resistant bacteria on the rise, understanding how and why UTIs reoccur is important. To date, researchers have been aware that persistent microbial communities can reside in the bladder, and when they begin to proliferate they can invade and kill so-called umbrella cells that line the bladder. The bacteria can then penetrate deeper into the bladder wall, helping them to hide from antibiotics and cause recurrent UTIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying these processes in detail is difficult in experimental animals or using standard tissue culture techniques. “Infection dynamics are difficult to capture from static imaging of tissue explants at serial time points,” said Kunal Sharma, a researcher involved in the project, in a press release. “Thus far, in vitro models have not recapitulated bladder architecture with sufficient fidelity to study the time course of these events.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new complementary bladder models are intended to assist researchers in gaining new insights into infection dynamics in the bladder. The first model includes bladder organoids that mimic the epithelial architecture of the bladder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“By generating organoids from a mouse with a fluorescent label incorporated within cell membranes, we could use live-cell confocal imaging at EPFL’s BioImaging &#38; Optics Core Facility to identify specific bacterial niches within the organoid with a high spatial resolution,” said Sharma. “By imaging multiple organoids, we managed to identify heterogeneity and diverse outcomes of host-pathogen interactions. This proof-of-concept system has shown promising potential for follow up studies on bacterial persistence to antibiotics and the dynamics of immune cell responses to infection.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second model is a bladder-on-a-chip that includes endothelial cells and umbrella cells that grow together under conditions that closely mimic the bladder, including a simulated urine flow and mechanical forces to simulate the expansion and contraction the bladder experiences as it fills and empties of urine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Microphysiological models bridge the gap between simple cell culture systems and animal models,” said Vivek Thacker, another researcher involved in the study. “The two models complement each other well and are tailored to study specific aspects of the disease. We hope they will serve as a resource for the wider microbiology community and advance the synergies between the tissue engineering and infectious diseases communities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>eLife</em>: <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/66481\">Dynamic persistence of UPEC intracellular bacterial communities in a human bladder-chip model of urinary tract infection</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/924021\">EPFL</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=vMu18t-HCrc:LxtBXzERBFQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=vMu18t-HCrc:LxtBXzERBFQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=vMu18t-HCrc:LxtBXzERBFQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=vMu18t-HCrc:LxtBXzERBFQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/vMu18t-HCrc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 03 Aug 2021 15:39:07 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/organoid-1.png","linkMd5":"26f41fd723c6dbb4d6172fb6db77232b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-22-561_0493545f2f9f911f.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":422,"sourceBytes":218879,"destBytes":19806,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/organoid-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-22-561_0493545f2f9f911f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=vMu18t-HCrc:LxtBXzERBFQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-246_fbcc77ccf2d58e2b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/vMu18t-HCrc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-098_e5081312da7791d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Breath Test Predicts Treatment Regimen for Epilepsy Drugs","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1517234","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/epilepsy-breath-test.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517407\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/epilepsy-breath-test.jpg 680w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/epilepsy-breath-test-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-seizure medication must be tailored for individual patients, as the difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic one is quite small. Now, researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland have developed a breath test that can rapidly provide information on the optimal drug treatment approach for epilepsy patients. Their test provides information on drug levels in the body, as well as drug metabolites and other metabolic hallmarks, that can help clinicians to predict whether someone is responding appropriately to a medication or whether they need a modified dose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epilepsy patients who take anti-seizure medication must tread a fine line. “Slightly too little and it isn’t effective. Slightly too much and it becomes toxic,” said Pablo Sinues, a researcher involved in the project, in a press release. To make matters more complicated, patients respond to therapy differently, depending on how they metabolize the drug molecules in their body, meaning that clinicians need to tailor the dose for each patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of children, who experience changing metabolism as they grow, this may require regular monitoring and dose adjustment. At present, blood tests are used to identify how much of a drug compound is present in the blood, but this doesn’t show the whole picture. Moreover, children are not big fans of needles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The philosophy behind this new technology is breath before blood, and it consists of a highly sensitive secondary electrospray ionization–high-resolution mass spectrometry system that can measure breath metabolites in real time. The results are instant, and do not require laboratory analysis, providing an indication of the metabolites present on someone’s breath in tiny quantities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You can think of it as being like the alcohol test that police use when they stop drivers,” said Sinues. “Because alcohol is present at high concentrations in breath, one only needs a small device. But we’re searching for a droplet in 20 swimming pools.” The technique not only offers an indication of drug levels in the body of the user, but also provides information on how they are responding to the therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the study found that certain amino acid metabolic pathways are active in patients who suffer drug side-effects, and also identified a metabolic signature for patients who don’t achieve a good therapeutic effect from the drug. The technology is not yet suited for general use, but the researchers are working to develop it further so that it can become clinically available. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>Communications Medicine</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-021-00021-3\">Personalised therapeutic management of epileptic patients guided by pathway-driven breath metabolomics</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Breath-test-to-determine-correct-treatment-for-epilepsy.html\">University of Basel</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=uaXQEQChpX4:n3cwM4tAlyM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=uaXQEQChpX4:n3cwM4tAlyM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=uaXQEQChpX4:n3cwM4tAlyM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=uaXQEQChpX4:n3cwM4tAlyM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/uaXQEQChpX4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Aug 2021 16:27:10 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/epilepsy-breath-test.jpg","linkMd5":"66d66ac2bdf89c85f5605b633c24f78c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-24-467_f4228585ca7aa257.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":385,"sourceBytes":179359,"destBytes":33512,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/epilepsy-breath-test.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-24-467_f4228585ca7aa257.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=uaXQEQChpX4:n3cwM4tAlyM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn27@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-244_ce7c9ff84839bac0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/uaXQEQChpX4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-27-063_55354c273b8654bb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Remote Monitoring for Cardiac Patients: Interview with Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1516187","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516919\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biotricity.com/\">Biotricity</a>, a medtech company based in California, developed the <a href=\"https://www.biotricity.com/bioflux-2/\">Bioflux</a> system, a mobile cardiac telemetry device. The system is a three channel ECG monitor, and it enables continuous data collection and data transmission to a call center in the case of anomaly detection. If the detected issue is considered to be serious, a clinician can contact the patient to check up and make a call about whether to intervene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote cardiac monitoring has made it easier to spot intermittent issues such as arrhythmias, and it allows clinicians to build up a long term picture of someone’s cardiac health as they go about their daily lives. The Bioflux system involves patients wearing a holter and three leads, and allows them to move and perform daily activities without too much hassle. The device has an integrated cellular modem for data transmission and features a 30 day wear duration. The company recently announced the launch of Biotres, a three lead device for ECG and arrhythmia monitoring that is intended for lower risk patients. The device focuses on comfort for long-term wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Medgadget </em>had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Chairman, CEO, and Founder of Biotricity abut this technology. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conn Hastings, Medgadget:</em></strong> <strong><em>Please give us an overview of cardiac disease, and the burden it poses for society and patients.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Waqaas-Al-Siddiq-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516916\" width=\"225\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Waqaas-Al-Siddiq-1.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Waqaas-Al-Siddiq-1-193x300.png 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Biotricity:</strong> Cardiac disease is the number one killer in almost every country in the world for both men and women. Beyond the impact on lives, it also has the largest impact on healthcare costs, in almost every country. Cardiac disease is an ongoing issue, requiring persistent intervention and management. Incorrect management of a cardiac condition can also lead to problems that develop into other conditions, causing individuals to have more than one chronic condition. As such, timely intervention and management of cardiac issues can improve patient lives while also reducing costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <strong><em>What role does remote monitoring play in cardiac treatment?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waqaas Al-Siddiq:</strong> Cardiac issues are notoriously difficult to diagnose due to their intermittent nature. Arrhythmias in particular are difficult as they are mostly intermittent and asymptomatic. Did you know that 1 in 18 Americans suffer from cardiac arrhythmia? As such, long term monitoring is required to pick up these issues for further diagnoses. Monitoring is used to collect long term data that are then analyzed to determine the patient’s condition. After which, a treatment decision is made. But this all begins with monitoring. Monitoring is also used post procedure and post diagnostics to manage the patient, determine if the intervention was successful, and if needed, make adjustments to medications or treatment approaches. As such, monitoring is used in the beginning for diagnosis but also on a continuous basis to support the direction of treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <strong><em>Please give us an overview of the Bioflux device and its features.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view-biotricity.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516921\" width=\"350\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view-biotricity.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view-biotricity-300x294.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waqaas Al-Siddiq:</strong> The Bioflux is primarily used for initial diagnosis and for ongoing check-ins to determine if the patient is stable or if changes are needed. The device is a 3 channel ECG monitor that is worn by the patient underneath their clothes for a prescribed period of time. The device continuously collects the patient’s ECG and analyzes it for anomalies. If an anomaly is detected, the data are transmitted in real-time to a call center for review. If an anomaly is within a range that a physician deems urgent, they will recall the patient or intervene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <strong><em>Is the device easy to use? How have patients found it?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waqaas Al-Siddiq:</strong> The Bioflux device is pretty simple to use. The patient wears it continuously and pushes a button if they feel a symptom or issues. Outside of that the data are continuously collected and the patient just has to charge the device once a day. Patients have found the device easy to use but there is some discomfort in wearing it. As this is a medical device and it needs the most accurate data, it uses three different contact points on the chest to collect data, which requires sticky electrodes and a wire. Overall, patients don’t mind as this is about their care and collecting enough data. Most importantly, the device can transmit in real-time so if there is an issue detected, the data can be reviewed remotely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of how clinicians receive and analyze the data</em></strong> <strong><em>provided by the Bioflux device.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waqaas Al-Siddiq:</strong> Physicians and their staff receive the data in our portal. Data are provided in two ways, a final summary and ongoing data based on device detection. These data are then reviewed by the physician&#8217;s nursing staff to determine if enough data are there, if there is an issue that needs to be addressed, or if something needs to be escalated to the physician. A data review is performed on a daily basis by the physicians staff for ongoing data and summary data is reviewed at the completion of the study time (duration the device was prescribed for).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of Biotres, a 3-lead patch device for ECG and arrhythmia monitoring, that Biotricity is planning to introduce later this year.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waqaas Al-Siddiq:</strong> This Biotres device is a simplified version of our Bioflux device. It is designed to just continuously record the patient’s data as opposed to recording and analyzing followed by transmission in case of anomaly detection. The Biotres device is a compact version that is designed for comfort and long-term wear for lower risk patients. In this case, physicians do not expect patients to have an anomaly that would require intervention so they can use a simpler, more compact device that optimizes usability. As such the Biotres device records data continuously and uploads at the completion of the prescribed monitoring time. Comparatively, Bioflux records data continuously while simultaneously analyzing it for anomalies, at which point it will transmit the data in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a Biotricity video about the Bioflux device:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Bioflux Device\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrpnH8rfks8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/divider-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516917\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.biotricity.com/\">Biotricity homepage&#8230;</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=ckfPsqSEvsc:bZiw3apDbkA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=ckfPsqSEvsc:bZiw3apDbkA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=ckfPsqSEvsc:bZiw3apDbkA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=ckfPsqSEvsc:bZiw3apDbkA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/ckfPsqSEvsc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 20:19:49 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view.jpg","linkMd5":"a9079a8dc307610f1a5a1a12b2cfb14c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-24-399_50491c2cb585a238.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":280837,"destBytes":38764,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-24-399_50491c2cb585a238.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Waqaas-Al-Siddiq-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn68@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-310_248755c506dbaf3d.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecg-view-biotricity.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-667_9e81bc4c086a4abe.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/divider-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn99@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-240_fe22dc19ac5d059c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=ckfPsqSEvsc:bZiw3apDbkA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn44@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-278_46556416149578b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/ckfPsqSEvsc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn50@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-26-998_2dbadf76c8e82d7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Wearable Sensor Monitors Myoclonic Jerks","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1517339","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/myoclonic-jerk-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517559\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/myoclonic-jerk-sensor.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/myoclonic-jerk-sensor-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/myoclonic-jerk-sensor-768x415.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the University of Eastern Finland have developed a wearable surface electromyography and three-dimensional accelerometry system that can measure the occurrence and severity of myoclonic jerks, which are sudden muscle movements experienced by patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy. The muscle jerks can be unpleasant, but can also cause accidents and falls. The researchers hope that the new sensors could help them to understand progressive myoclonic epilepsy a little better, and eventually assist with developing new treatments and allow patients to track their progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Myoclonic jerks can be stimulated by movement, and can either be positive or negative. A positive myoclonus typically results in spontaneous muscle contraction, whereas a negative myoclonus results in impaired muscle activation. These symptoms can be unpredictable and unpleasant, but can also cause falls and accidents, meaning that they pose a hazard to patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how, why, and when these symptoms occur would be useful for clinicians and researchers in understanding the condition and in developing new treatments. Yet, methods to provide objective data are limited. At present, the severity of myoclonic jerks are assessed through visual measurements performed by an experienced clinician. This is time consuming, somewhat subjective, and only provides details about the condition over a short space of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients can provide some guidance as to the severity of their symptoms, but it would be helpful for patients and clinicians alike to allow technology to shoulder the burden of disease monitoring. This latest device aims to provide data on myoclonic jerks and appears to be suitable for at-home monitoring. It consists of wearable surface electromyography and three-dimensional accelerometry sensors that are worn on the arm, and which provide data on jerk frequency and severity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested the technology in volunteers who wore the sensors for 48 hours each. The sensors provided good agreement with the results reported by the patients themselves and showed differences in symptoms between day and night.

The test uses a simple spit sample, and provides results that can be read using a smartphone app within an hour. With access to a 3D printer and commonly available components, the device can be created for approximately $15, and the researchers hope that it could provide a viable testing option for countries without easy access to centralized laboratories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While vaccination campaigns have made a dent in the spread of COVID-19 in many countries, the need for testing is as urgent as ever, particularly with the rise of more transmissible variants. Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have also formed a huge stumbling block in our fight against SARS-CoV-2, meaning that testing will be here for some time to come. While this news is gloomy, the pandemic has had some silver linings, particularly in terms of the scientific response and the acceleration of new technologies, which have been impressive to say the least.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/side-device-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517498\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/side-device-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/side-device-1-263x300.png 263w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest technology is no exception. Emerging from the labs of Harvard and MIT, this low-cost testing device is geared towards regions where access to sophisticated labs is not a given. “miSHERLOCK eliminates the need to transport patient samples to a centralized testing location and greatly simplifies the sample preparation steps, giving patients and doctors a faster, more accurate picture of individual and community health, which is critical during an evolving pandemic,” said Helena de Puig, a researcher involved in the study, via a Wyss Institute announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one likes inserting a nasopharyngeal swab, and the new test dispenses with this in favor of a simple spit sample. “Simple things that used to be ubiquitous in the hospital, like nasopharyngeal swabs, were suddenly hard to get, so routine sample processing procedures were disrupted, which is a big problem in a pandemic setting,” said Rose Lee, another researcher involved in the study. “Our team’s motivation for this project was to eliminate these bottlenecks and provide accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 with less reliance on global supply chains, and could also accurately detect the variants that were starting to emerge.” &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reaction-chart.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517499\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reaction-chart.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reaction-chart-300x142.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reaction-chart-768x364.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The device relies on CRISPR-based technology called “specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking” (SHERLOCK) to cut a gene in SARS-CoV-2 resulting in a fluorescent signal that can be identified using a smartphone app. The researchers have also designed the assay to recognize and identify three variants of the virus (Alpha, Beta and Gamma), but it could be adapted to include the Delta variant in future versions. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When the miSHERLOCK project started, there was almost no SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring happening. We knew that variant tracking was going to be incredibly important when evaluating the long-term effects of COVID-19 on local and global communities, so we pushed ourselves to create a truly decentralized, flexible, user-friendly diagnostic platform,” said Jim Collins, a third researcher involved in the project. “By solving the sample prep problem, we’ve ensured that this device is virtually ready for consumers to use as-is, and we’re excited to work with industrial partners to make it commercially available.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a video with more about the new testing technology:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"miSherlock - Detecting COVID-19 Variants from Saliva\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/579998319?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963&#38;h=27383a9a88\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>Science Advances</em>: <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/32/eabh2944\">Minimally instrumented SHERLOCK (miSHERLOCK) for CRISPR-based point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/a-test-that-detects-covid-19-variants-in-your-spit/\">Harvard Wyss Institute</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=8CdazrpgS2s:E-4sf7qsGrs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=8CdazrpgS2s:E-4sf7qsGrs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=8CdazrpgS2s:E-4sf7qsGrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=8CdazrpgS2s:E-4sf7qsGrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/8CdazrpgS2s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 21:30:42 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-positive.png","linkMd5":"23884be16f478fecf42f996db47a265d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-24-375_e75c7833b72ec329.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":516,"sourceBytes":288593,"destBytes":20878,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-positive.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-24-375_e75c7833b72ec329.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/side-device-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-993_11087e894de1ddfe.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reaction-chart.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-27-709_31cdaf9e89c76155.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=8CdazrpgS2s:E-4sf7qsGrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn59@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-198_2bf91fbabfc51a59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/8CdazrpgS2s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn74@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-090_3f312292902ad5ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Sensing Glove to Aid in Stroke Recovery","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1517307","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517482\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at MIT created a sensing glove that can detect small pressuref changes along its surface when a wearer grasps something. The glove is threaded with tiny pressure sensors, which are studded with micropillars that create changes in an electrical signal when they bend and deform. This provides an incredibly sensitive measurement of tactile pressure and the glove even detects the wearer’s pulse. The researchers hope that the technology could assist in motor function retraining in patients who have experienced a stroke, and also result in wearables that can measure vital signs more accurately and conveniently than existing devices, such as smart watches.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MIT-TouchyGlove-Movie-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517485\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology works thanks to tiny pressure sensors that are incorporated into the fabric glove. These sensors are encrusted with thousands of &#8220;micropillars,&#8221; which are microscopic gold filaments that deform in response to pressure and provide a corresponding change in an electrical signal that the device can measure. The individiual sensors are highly sensitive, and when applied over a wearer’s fingertip not only provide a measurement of pressure applied to external objects through grasping but also a measurement of the pulse. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The simplicity and reliability of our sensing structure holds great promise for a diversity of health care applications, such as pulse detection and recovering the sensory capability in patients with tactile dysfunction,&#8221; said Nicholas Fang, a researcher involved in the study, in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-full.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517483\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-full.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-full-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-full-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary application for the pressure sensing glove is as an aid during stroke rehabilitation, which allows a wearer to fine tune their hand strength and grip, and track progress. So far, the researchers have characterized the readings from the glove while users perform a variety of everyday tasks that require different degrees of dexterity and grip at different points on the hand, from gripping a glass to holding a balloon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some fine motor skills require not only knowing how to handle objects, but also how much force should be exerted,&#8221; Fang says. &#8220;This glove could provide us more accurate measurements of gripping force for control groups versus patients recovering from stroke or other neurological conditions. This could increase our understanding, and enable control.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the team is also interested in incorporating the sensors into other wearables, such as flexible patches, that can measure physiological parameters such as pulse and blood pressure more accurately than existing health-focused wearables. &#8220;Pulse is a mechanical vibration that can also cause deformation of the skin, which we can&#8217;t feel, but the pillars can pick up,&#8221; said Fang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Communications</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24946-4\">Skin-electrode iontronic interface for mechanosensing</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/glove-sensor-pressure-stimuli-0805\">MIT</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_l6Edn_ziAw:9pNHeeaKE1Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_l6Edn_ziAw:9pNHeeaKE1Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_l6Edn_ziAw:9pNHeeaKE1Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_l6Edn_ziAw:9pNHeeaKE1Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/_l6Edn_ziAw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 20:58:34 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove.jpg","linkMd5":"7cfa21ff181f46d73de4a7028b252449","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-10-315_ec01b2000187ebf2.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":170817,"destBytes":18058,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-10-315_ec01b2000187ebf2.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MIT-TouchyGlove-Movie-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn79@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-31-259_94175aa104e18c5b.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pressure-glove-full.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn75@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-27-330_1e156ed72b7992dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-27-043_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-158_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_l6Edn_ziAw:9pNHeeaKE1Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn72@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-27-227_ed7129045639de88.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/_l6Edn_ziAw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn66@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-066_a30d82a1d4037be3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999589070},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:09","title":"Levita Robotic Platform: Interview with Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro, CEO of Levita Magnetics","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1516292","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Levita-Robotic-Platform.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517140\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Levita-Robotic-Platform.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Levita-Robotic-Platform-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Levita-Robotic-Platform-768x509.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.levita.com/\">Levita Magnetics</a>, a California-based company that specializes in laparoscopic systems, has recently announced that its Levita Robotic Platform, a surgical robot that is still in development, has been used to perform surgery on a patient for the first time in a hospital in Chile.

Levita reports that the new system reduces the number of assistive personnel required by a surgeon during a procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video below showing an animation of the handheld system in action during a prostate removal procedure:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"MKT1460A - Magnetic Surgery in a prostatectomy procedure (prostate removal)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrXidzB1YVM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Medgadget </em>had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro, founder and CEO of Levita Magnetics, about the technology.       </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conn Hastings, Medgadget: Please give us a quick overview of laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgery, and the benefits it provides for patients and surgeons.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alberto-Rodriguez-Navarro.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517141\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alberto-Rodriguez-Navarro.jpg 333w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alberto-Rodriguez-Navarro-242x300.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro, Levita Magnetics:</strong> Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure performed by surgeons to treat patients with abdominal conditions and diseases indicated for surgery. The technique employs a camera, known as a laparoscope, that enables the surgeon to have a view inside the abdominal cavity and to use multiple incisions in the abdominal wall to introduce the surgical instruments needed to complete the surgery. It’s a common alternative to open surgery, which results in more severe pain, longer recovery and large scars. Laparoscopic procedures provide a less invasive procedure for patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What is the Levita Magnetic Surgical System, and how does it work?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro:</strong> The Levita Magnetic Surgical System, our first commercial product, is a first-of-its-kind system designed to further minimize the footprint of laparoscopic surgery. Our magnetic technology enables laparoscopic procedures with even fewer incisions, with proven patient benefits that include less pain, faster recovery and less scarring. It is the first FDA-cleared magnetic surgical system designed to magnetically grasp and retract the target tissue in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, bariatric, prostatectomy and colorectal surgical procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magnetic system facilitates improved access and visualization internally at the surgical site, and enables a reduced number of incisions and trocars during laparoscopic procedures. The system, which consists of a handheld external magnet placed on the skin that controls a shaftless detachable grasper, enables instruments to move without the constraints of a fixed-position pivot point through an incision in the abdomen. The system has been clinically proven to reduce pain and the number of scars, and quicken recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What advantages does the system provide over other laparoscopic surgical technology?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro:</strong> Laparoscopic surgery has been conducted for approximately 40 years without major changes. In recent years, laparoscopic surgeons have searched for ways to reduce the number of incisions, or ports, to further improve the potential patient benefits verses open surgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, port reduction can be associated with technical challenges during surgery. As a practicing surgeon myself, I’ve seen this first hand over the last decade. In conventional laparoscopic procedures, shafted surgical instruments are introduced by fixed-position trocars inserted through incisions in the abdomen. Shafted instruments can impair surgeon visualization by cluttering the operative field, causing instrument collisions and restricting movement. The use of trocars can risk injury to the major bowel and vessels and cause incisional pain, bleeding, scarring, hernias and infections. Magnetic retraction is a very elegant solution to this problem, as it enables the traction, or movement, of intra-abdominal organs without the restriction of a fixed incision. It is a very versatile technology that improves the capability of movement, control and visualization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/levita-robot.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1517142\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/levita-robot.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/levita-robot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/levita-robot-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please talk us through the latest technology developed by Levita Magnetics, the Levita Robotic Platform, and the features it offers.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro:</strong> The Levita Robotic Platform is taking our proprietary magnetic technology to the next level. It was designed with patients, surgeons and hospitals in mind. We consider it a triple impact technology, as it provides benefits to the patients, surgeons and hospitals. For patients, it includes delivering the established clinical benefits of the Levita Magnetic Surgical System, including less pain, faster recovery and less scarring; for surgeons, improving visualization and maintaining control of all laparoscopic instruments; and for hospitals, increasing overall hospital efficiency with fewer assistants required to conduct the procedures. We specifically designed the platform for high volume abdominal surgeries, such as bariatric surgeries and gallbladder removals. Our robotic platform is also designed to be compatible with ambulatory surgical centers as our technology helps enable same-day discharge from the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of the robot itself adapts the handheld model of the Levita Magnetic Surgical System to a fully robotic and single-operator platform. Unlike the traditional robotic model, where the surgeon is displaced from the patient at a console to control the robot, the Levita robot employs a different operating model where the surgeon is next to the patient through the duration of the procedure. It is designed to allow the surgeon to remain entirely hands-on at the procedure site during surgery with less surgical assistance required in the operating room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe the combination of all these benefits will increase the volume of high-quality, efficiently performed procedures that finally will improve patient access and reduce the waiting times for the surgeries they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: The Robotic Platform recently treated its first patient. Please give us an overview of the trial and how it went.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro:</strong> Our first clinical study of our Levita Robotic Platform is currently being conducted in Chile, my native country, and is designed to further optimize the system based on surgeon feedback. The first surgery using the platform was for a patient who needed their gallbladder removed. As a part of the study, this patient received a reduced-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by Dr. Ignacio Robles, a minimally invasive surgeon at Clínica INDISA in Santiago. The patient was able to return home in less than 24 hours without pain and had no complications reported at 30 days of follow up. Since then, two more patients with acute conditions were entered in the study and had their surgeries completed the day they were enrolled. We believe the Levita Robotic Platform was well-suited to the currently constrained health care environment, with hospital infrastructure and health care providers under significant stress due to ongoing COVID-19 challenges. While the pandemic conditions are unfortunate, it has had the unplanned effect of highlighting the potential for the Levita Robotic Platform to increase accessibility and improve the quality of surgery for those in need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What are the next steps for the new system? When do you anticipate that it might be available, pending positive results?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rodriguez-Navarro:</strong> Following the completion of the study, we will submit the Levita Robotic Platform to the FDA for clearance by the end of 2021. We are anticipating launching commercially in the first half of 2022, and we already are in discussions with highly regarded centers in the U.S. that will be the first to receive a Levita Robotic Platform. After this limited U.S. launch, our objective is to reach hospitals nationally across the U.S. before launching internationally to bring this technology to as many patients as possible. Our goal is to change the way surgery is performed at a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img
