Pratt&#8217;s Star-Lord/Peter Quill will appear in the <strong>Taika Waititi</strong> sequel, which makes sense since <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> concluded with Thor jetting off with the Guardians of the Galaxy. That said, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> doesn&#8217;t have an official release date yet, so it&#8217;s not exactly clear how all of this lines up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645810\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has revealed that Chris Pratt has joined the <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em> cast, reprising his <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> role of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Pratt joins returning players Chris Hemsworth as Thor, <strong>Tessa Thompson</strong> as Valkyrie, and <strong>Natalie Portman</strong> as Jane Foster, as well as Marvel newcomer <strong>Christian Bale</strong>, who is reportedly playing the film&#8217;s villain (although we don&#8217;t know which villain he&#8217;s playing just yet).</p>\n<p>Having Star-Lord in a <em>Thor</em> sequel makes sense since <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> had Thor palling around with the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, and even ended with the character joining the Guardians as they set out in search of Gamora. However, the timeline here is a little fuzzy. There&#8217;s no official date locked for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em>, but <em>Thor: Love and Thunder </em>is set to open on <strong>February 11, 2022</strong>. So how does all of this lineup, timeline-wise? I don&#8217;t know yet, but we&#8217;ll be seeing <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em> before <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em>. <em>Guardians</em> director James Gunn is working on his <em>Suicide Squad</em> spin-off TV series <em>Peacemaker</em>, so he might not get started on <em>Guardians</em> for a while.</p>\n<p>And as of now, Marvel has locked down the following release dates for unannounced films: October 7, 2022, February 17, 2023, May 5, 2023, July 28, 2023, and November 3, 2023. If <em>Love and Thunder</em> holds its February 2022 date, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> will arrive in October of that year at the earliest. Anyway, this is all speculation, and we don&#8217;t even know how big Pratt&#8217;s role is going to be in <em>Love and Thunder</em>. It might just be a cameo – it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the first time one MCU character popped up in another MCU character&#8217;s movie.</p>\n<p><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em> will be helmed by <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> director Taika Waititi, and will see Natalie Portman&#8217;s Jane Foster becoming the Mighty Thor while Valkyrie, the new ruler of Asgard, searches for her queen. Not much more is known beyond that, but Waititi worked on the script with <strong>Jennifer Kaytin Robinson</strong>, writer of this year&#8217;s <em>Unpregnant</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/thor-love-and-thunder-cast-chris-pratt/\">&#8216;Thor: Love and Thunder&#8217; Cast: Chris Pratt to Return as Star-Lord</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/50xHnkyOdOQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 20:58:07 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thor-love-and-thunder-cast-chris-pratt-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"023867d22a01b63d9820e08ecfc1e5e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-37-720_dd3b30e97a1c711d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":29812,"destBytes":17108,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thor-love-and-thunder-cast-chris-pratt-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-37-720_dd3b30e97a1c711d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-45-403_c94bacd22417382c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=50xHnkyOdOQ:MqAyJdzY7ws:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-179_56e75c51cae6727a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/50xHnkyOdOQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn59@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-031_f384255b4e8848d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117285},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"‘The Mysterious Benedict Society’ Series Moves From Hulu to Disney+ with Tony Hale in Lead Role","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645787","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-645798 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Mysterious-Benedict-Society-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Mysterious Benedict Society\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Mysterious-Benedict-Society.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Mysterious-Benedict-Society-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tony Hale</strong> has found his next leading role.</p>\n<p>The <em>Arrested Development</em> and <em>Veep</em> actor will star in <em><strong>The Mysterious Benedict Society</strong></em>, a live-action television adaptation of author Trenton Lee Stewart&#8217;s bestselling books which follow a group of orphans who go undercover at a boarding school. The series was originally developed at Hulu, but has since shifted to another platform under the Disney umbrella: according to a new press release, the show will air on Disney+ next year. Get more details below.<span id=\"more-645787\"></span></p>\n<p>Stewart has written four books in the series, and the original novel serves as the inspiration for the eight-episode first season of this adaptation. Here&#8217;s the logline:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Placed undercover at a boarding school known as The Institute, a group of orphans must foil a nefarious plot with global ramifications while creating a new sort of family along the way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hale plays Nicholas Benedict, an eccentric man who gathers a guild of assistants in an effort to stop his evil twin brother, the wonderfully named Ledroptha Curtain, from using a rival band of assistants to brainwash the population and take over the world. The official Disney+ press release only mentions that Hale is playing Benedict, but <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tv-bits-21/\">an earlier report</a> said Hale would be playing both roles.</p>\n<p>Hale will be joined on screen by <strong>Kristen Schaal</strong>, <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, <strong>MaameYaa Boafo</strong>, <strong>Gia Sandhu</strong>, <strong>Seth Carr</strong>, <strong>Emmy DeOliveira</strong>, <strong>Mystic Inscho</strong>, and <strong>Marta Timofeeva</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dana Walden</strong>, the chairman of entertainment at Walt Disney Television, said that she has already seen the first few episodes of the show and determined that its family-friendly nature made it a perfect fit for Disney+. <strong>Matt Manfredi</strong> and <strong>Phil Hay</strong>, who co-wrote films like <em>Destroyer</em>, <em>The Invitation</em>, <em>Ride Along</em>, and <em>R.I.P.D.</em>, are the writers and creators of the series, and the showrunners will be <strong>Todd Slavkin</strong> and <strong>Darren Swimmer</strong>, who were writer/producers of <em>Smallville</em>, <em>No Ordinary Family</em>, and the Freeform series <em>Shadowhunters</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are so thrilled that Disney+ will be the home for our show,&#8221; Manfredi and Hay said in a joint statement. &#8220;What a great place to be! It&#8217;s a beautiful thing to feel as supported and inspired as we have, every step of the way, by our entire team at 20<sup>th</sup>, Hulu and the Disney family; and we are honored and gratified by the belief in the show this represents. From the moment Jamie and Karen brought us these fantastic books, through our collaboration with Todd, Darren, Tony and our amazing cast and crew, we&#8217;ve felt very lucky. Certainly feeling that way today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Slavkin and Swimmer issued their own statement: &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to help bring Trenton Lee Stewart&#8217;s wonderful book and Matt and Phil&#8217;s exquisite adaption to Disney+.

But the streaming service changed their mind as we learned back in September that <strong>Henry Cavill</strong>, <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>, <strong>Gal Gadot</strong>, and <strong>Ray Fisher</strong> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-justice-league-scenes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">would be coming back</a> as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg to shoot footage for the director&#8217;s cut of the DC Comics superhero movie. That made us think the reshoots would be fairly substantial, but according to Zack Snyder himself, the reshoots will only add four minutes or five minutes of new footage.<span id=\"more-645862\"></span></p>\n<p>Zack Snyder sat down for an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsY_bdXTmJ8&#38;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beyond the Trailer</a> (via <a href=\"https://collider.com/how-much-new-footage-is-in-the-snyder-cut-justice-league-zack-snyder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a>), and he explained how much new footage there will be in his cut of Justice League from these reshoots. Snyder said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I will say that in the end it’s going to probably be about four minutes or five minutes of additional photography for the entire movie. In the four hours that is Justice League, maybe four minutes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Back in September, we learned that these reshoots would cost roughly $70 million. Did HBO Max really spend that much money for just a few minutes of footage? What exactly did they reshoot that would cost that much money and take up such little screen time? Was it merely so expensive because it required bringing back the primary cast to shoot new scenes? These are all questions that we don&#8217;t have answers to yet, and we may never get them.</p>\n<p>Even though Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher were the only members of<em> Justice League</em> said to be coming back for these reshoots, it turns out <strong>Ezra Miller</strong> also shot some footage as The Flash. But he wasn&#8217;t actually on set with Zack Snyder to complete those reshoots. Instead, Snyder directed Miller&#8217;s scenes remotely, and they were shot on the set of <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> across the pond. Snyder explained (via <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2558742/wow-ezra-miller-shot-new-flash-scenes-for-justice-league-on-the-fantastic-beasts-3-set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CinemaBlend</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I had to get a pick-up shot of Ezra when we were doing this little bit. You know, he’s on <em>Fantastic Beasts</em>, and that’s in London, and we weren’t going to travel to London, unfortunately. I would have loved to have done that… So what we did was we picked him up on a Zoom, and the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> crew, I sent them these drawings. I was like, ‘Ok, this is what he has to do, this is where he is.’&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As we previously heard, Snyder also brought back <strong>Jared Leto</strong> as Joker for some new footage. When the<em> Suicide Squad</em> version of Joker returns to the big screen, he&#8217;ll look a little different from the last time we saw him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wanted to of course honor what had been created with him because I thought it was really cool. But also, in this, I’m not going to tell you what happens in the little scene, but some water has gone under the proverbial bridge between when last we saw Joker and this appearance. So he’s made some…he’s a road-weary Joker, I guess that’s a way of saying it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;re not exactly sure what that means or why this scene is so integral to the director&#8217;s cut of <em>Justice League</em> when it wasn&#8217;t something that Zack Snyder originally shot when he was still in charge of the production. It was always said by the The Snyder Cut&#8217;s strongest supporters that the movie was complete with the exception of unfinished visual effects, but clearly there was more that Snyder wanted done to complete his vision.

The upcoming inspirational sports drama is &#8220;inspired by the empowering true story of former Clemson University football safety Ray McElrathbey, a young man facing a series of challenging circumstances, whose dedication and persistence help him to triumph over repeated adversities. Aided by his teammates and the Clemson community, he succeeds on the field while simultaneously raising and caring for his 11-year-old brother Fahmarr.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Directed by <strong>Reginald Hudlin</strong> (<em>Marshall</em>) from a screenplay by <strong>Nick Santora</strong> (<em>The Most Dangerous Game</em>,   <em>The Fugitive</em>), <em>Safety</em> stars <strong>Jay Reeves</strong> (<em>All American</em>, <em>The Tax Collector</em>) as Ray and newcomer <strong>Thaddeus J. Mixson</strong> as his brother Fahmarr. The cast is rounded out by <strong>Corinne Foxx</strong>, <strong>Matthew Glave</strong>, <strong>Hunter Sansone</strong>, <strong>Amanda Warren</strong>, <strong>Miles Burris</strong>,<strong> Isaac Bell</strong>, <strong>Elijah Bell</strong>, and<strong> James Badge Dale</strong>.  It is and produced by Mark Ciardi (<em>Secretariat</em>) and Gordon Gray (<em>The Rookie</em> ) with Douglas S. Jones and Campbell McIinnis serving as executive producers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement, Hudlin said, &#8220;<em>Safety</em> is a movie about brotherhood and coming together for the greater good, which is a message our society needs right now.  It’s the story of a young man stuck in a situation where failure is not an option. Through sheer force of will, he does the impossible, which inspires the whole community around him to do the same.  It’s a movie I can’t wait to watch with my family on Disney+ on December 11th, and for families everywhere to do the same.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Producer Mark Ciardi added, &#8220;For over a decade, I’ve dreamed of bringing Ray’s incredible story to the screen, and now that it’s ready, I’m thrilled that Disney+ is making it available for families to enjoy together during the holidays.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film looks like a good, old-fashioned inspirational sports drama, which means it&#8217;s perfect for the family-friendly base that Disney+ caters to. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m personally all that interested in <em>Safety</em>, but there must be some intersection of Disney fans and Clemson fans for whom this movie is specifically made.</p>\n<p><em>Safety</em> will debut exclusively on Disney+ on Friday, <strong>December 11, 2020.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/safety-trailer-disney/\">&#8216;Safety&#8217; Trailer: Disney+ Debuts an Inspirational True-Life Football Drama</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/YeGpjUFus-c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 00:30:02 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SAF-00609-e1605296711125-700x351.jpg","linkMd5":"96f128c0f2781a260566bd6b65525ae3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-37-837_5c77875949f3e095.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":351,"sourceBytes":77807,"destBytes":63704,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SAF-00609-e1605296711125-700x351.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-37-837_5c77875949f3e095.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-18-43-752_ba621437320a1614.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YeGpjUFus-c:7Cnhgz-ijek:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn64@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-44-149_9ce61b61f76d6ed9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/YeGpjUFus-c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-18-44-175_bd5aadaa7cbbeed6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117303},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"‘Paranormal Activity’ Reboot Writer Hints at an “Exciting” Mystery Director","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645763","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-322027 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/paranormal-activity-movies-ranked-2-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"paranormal activity reboot director\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/paranormal-activity-movies-ranked-2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/paranormal-activity-movies-ranked-2-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/paranormal-activity-movies-ranked-2-435x186.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Writer/director <strong>Christopher Landon</strong> has carved out a nice corner of the genre space for himself over the past few years with the <em>Happy Death Day</em> movies and the new body swap horror film <em>Freaky</em>, which was just released in theaters today. But he&#8217;s returning to a familiar franchise as the writer of the upcoming <strong><em>Paranormal Activity</em> </strong>reboot, and now he&#8217;s teasing that the new film will be led by an &#8220;exciting&#8221; director who he describes as a &#8220;get.&#8221; Who could it be?<span id=\"more-645763\"></span></p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/356091/interview-director-christopher-landon-on-inspiration-for-freaky-and-creating-the-fiercely-brilliant-kills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dread Central</a>, Landon was asked about his upcoming projects and he responded like this: &#8220;I&#8217;m writing the new <em>Paranormal Activity</em> movie; we&#8217;re rebooting that franchise. I&#8217;m super excited about the director, but I can&#8217;t say who it is because they won&#8217;t let me [laughs]. He&#8217;s a get. He&#8217;s awesome! I think people are going to be really surprised by where we&#8217;re taking this thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>First off, we have to pause and acknowledge that based on those comments, the unequivocal funniest person to direct this would be Landon himself. I would not only find any filmmaker talking himself up like that to be absolutely hilarious, but I would also respect the hell out of him laying the groundwork for it to be some big reveal, only for him to be announced as the guy a few weeks down the line when all of the paperwork has been finalized. And it would make sense, as Landon himself did direct <em>Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones</em>.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s my goofy guess. Let&#8217;s assume that the most hilarious option will not come true in this case. Who might be a contender to become the <em>Paranormal Activity</em> reboot director? It has to be someone with a fair amount of clout or notoriety since he&#8217;s apparently a &#8220;get.&#8221; My first thought was that Sam Raimi would be a cool choice, but he&#8217;s tied up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe directing <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>, and the <em>Paranormal Activity</em> reboot&#8217;s 2022 release date might make the timing too tough to overcome.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe it&#8217;s not someone with any significant ties to the horror genre. Based on Landon&#8217;s comments about how people will be surprised with the direction they&#8217;re taking the franchise, it might actually be more likely that the person is not entrenched in horror. So who comes to mind? Leigh Whannell? Rian Johnson? David Lowery? I want to read your own guesses in the comments below.

Netflix doesn&#8217;t often take long to renew their hit shows, but in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it seems like maybe some numbers needed to be crunched to figure out whether the show was worth bringing back for a second season. That&#8217;s probably why the series will be moving production to Vancouver instead of Los Angeles now that Netflix has officially ordered <em>Space Force</em> season 2.<span id=\"more-645857\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/space-force-renewed-for-season-2-at-netflix-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> exclusively reported news of<em> Space Force</em> season 2 getting ordered at Netflix. Since this is a high-concept series focusing on the workplace antics of the new branch of the military tasked with establishing a presence on the moon, it&#8217;s more expensive than your average comedy series. Considering how much more pricey it is to shoot shows in Los Angeles right now as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the United States, the second season shooting in Vancouver is a smarter and safer decision all around.</p>\n<p>Though there was a lot of hype around the first season of <em>Space Force</em>, critics were not impressed. The show garnered a 38% critical score on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/space_force\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, but others weren&#8217;t so disappointed with the show earning a 75% audience score. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/space-force-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what I wrote in my review</a> back in May:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Veep</em> is clearly the show that <em>Space Force</em> seems to be trying to emulate the most. But the show isn’t quite sharp or clever enough in its comedy to match the consistent and frequent gut-busting laughs that come from the <em>Veep</em>‘s snappy dialogue and venomous insults. That’s not to say the show doesn’t come with a lot of laughs, because there are some truly great lines and recurring gags here and there. But it still falls short of having hitting as hard or being as memorable as other comedies in the same vein, such as <em>Silicon Valley</em> or even the unfortunately short-lived <em>Enlisted</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It appears that even the producers of the show realized that they needed to make some changes behind the scenes. <strong>Norm Hiscock</strong> is being added to the series as a co-showrunner along with <em>The Office</em> creator Greg Daniels. The two have a history working together with Hiscock&#8217;s previous efforts including <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, <em>People of Earth</em>, and <em>King of the Hill.</em> On top of that, cast member <strong>Jimmy O. Yang</strong> is joining the writing staff. It&#8217;s hoped that the series will be able to find itself and settle into a groove in the same way that Daniels finessed <em>The Office</em> when it returned for a second season, especially since Daniels has plans to keep the show going <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/space-force-season-2-and-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for at least a few seasons</a>.</p>\n<p>The first season also starred <strong>John Malkovich</strong>, <strong>Ben Schwartz</strong>, <strong>Tawny Newsome</strong>, <strong>Diana Silvers</strong>, and <strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong>, and presumably they&#8217;ll all be returning since they&#8217;re part of the primary ensemble. The finale left everyone in a precarious position with a couple big dangling plot threads, and hopefully a second season can pick them up and take the series in a more engaging direction that allows the comedy and the high-concept premise to co-exist more harmoniously.</p>\n<p><em>Space Force</em> season will start shooting next year, but it&#8217;s not clear when it will arrive on Netflix.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/space-force-season-2-ordered-at-netflix/\">&#8216;Space Force&#8217; Season 2 Officially Ordered for Blast Off at Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EKE3qKrzMGw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 19:00:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/space-force-trademark-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"9c4971e10f5e8832ed491d13f805e2dd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn92@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-18-42-503_0951d40d5eb1edde.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":41266,"destBytes":26134,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/space-force-trademark-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn92@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-18-42-503_0951d40d5eb1edde.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-19-01-907_ffcea4e57297c6b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EKE3qKrzMGw:rGmgbOTg-3k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-45-064_0f971658df60a604.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EKE3qKrzMGw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn76@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-45-174_3486116eb387b242.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117295},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"Michel Gondry to Direct ‘As She Climbed Across the Table’, a Love Triangle Involving a Black Hole","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645703","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-645712 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/michelgondry-directing-assheclimbedacrossthetable-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"As She Climbed Across the Table Movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/michelgondry-directing-assheclimbedacrossthetable.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/michelgondry-directing-assheclimbedacrossthetable-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Countless fictional romances have been built around love triangles. But what about a sci-fi romance focusing on a love triangle between a particle physicist, her ex-boyfriend, and a black hole? Director <strong>Michel Gondry</strong> (<em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>) is slated to tackle that story with an adaptation of <strong>Jonathan Lethem</strong>&#8216;s novel <strong><em>As She Climbed Across the Table</em></strong>, which is set up at Amazon Studios and Chernin Entertainment.<span id=\"more-645703\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/michel-gondry-mindhunters-creator-tackling-she-climbed-across-the-table-for-amazon-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has the news on the film. If this is the first time you&#8217;re hearing of this strange book published back in 1997 by the writer of <em>Motherless Brooklyn</em>, here&#8217;s the official synopsis from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004JN1CWE/?tag=film-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alice Coombs is a particle physicist, and she and her colleagues have created a void, a hole in the universe, that they have taken to calling Lack. But Lack is a nullity with taste—tastes; it absorbs a pomegranate, light bulbs, an argyle sock; it disdains a bow tie, an ice ax, and a scrambled duck egg. To Alice, this selectivity translates as an irresistible personality. To Philip, it makes Lack an unbeatable rival, for how can he win Alice back from something that has no flaws—because it has no qualities?</p></blockquote>\n<p>That sounds exactly the kind of strange romance that is perfect for Michel Gondry, who gave us the unique but tragic romance of <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and the quirky French love story in <em>The Science of Sleep</em>. Gondry&#8217;s last feature film was the French comng-of-age film <em>Microbe &#38; Gasoline</em>, though he&#8217;s kept busy with short films and episodes of <em>Kidding</em> on Showtime. My big question is this: will he bring in is penchant for unique practical special effects using various in-camera tricks, or will he rely on modern visual effects technology?</p>\n<p>Scripting <em>As She Climbed Across the Table</em> will be <strong>Joe Penhall</strong>, the creator of Netflix&#8217;s crime drama <em>Mindhunter</em>. Leave it to the guy who got inside the mind of serial killers to figure out how to personify a black hole enough to bring it into a love triangle with a man and woman.</p>\n<p>Chernin Entertainment will be producing with Raffi Adlan executive producing. It&#8217;s clear when Amazon hopes to begin production or when the movie might be released, but this will definitely be a project that we keep our eyes on.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/as-she-climbed-across-the-table-movie/\">Michel Gondry to Direct &#8216;As She Climbed Across the Table&#8217;, a Love Triangle Involving a Black Hole</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/31Iup5MEF5o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 22:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/michelgondry-directing-assheclimbedacrossthetable-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ec1da1f33f51639d8e9b59f8aa51bee6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-38-010_ae9eb8e3f8f84563.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":47827,"destBytes":32424,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/michelgondry-directing-assheclimbedacrossthetable-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-38-010_ae9eb8e3f8f84563.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn67@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-18-44-007_a2d1572fcaaebea5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=31Iup5MEF5o:zSNSgoxNHfM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-43-757_a94005150587e9cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/31Iup5MEF5o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn79@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-367_599524b055d3a894.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117303},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"Live-Action ‘Lilo & Stitch’ Film to be Directed by ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ Helmer Jon M.

A remake has actually already been kicking around for <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lilo-and-stitch-live-action-remake/\">a little over two years</a>, but now it seems to have found a director in <strong>Jon M. Chu</strong>, the filmmaker behind <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> and the upcoming <em>In the Heights</em>.<span id=\"more-645813\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jon-m-chu-in-talks-to-direct-live-action-lilo-stitch-movie-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> says Chu is in negotiations to direct a live-action <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> remake, which may or may not be released theatrically but could just as easily end up going directly to Disney+.</p>\n<p>Mike Van Waes, who wrote the upcoming <em>The Crooked Man</em> spin-off of <em>The Conjuring 2</em>, wrote the current draft of the screenplay, but the report says a new writer will be hired to work with Chu on the script. Chu (<em>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</em>, <em>Step Up 2: The Streets</em>, <em>Now You See Me 2</em>) recently made headlines by <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/willow-tv-series/\">signing on to direct the <em>Willow</em> TV series</a> for Disney+, so he has a relationship with the studio already. If they <em>must</em> go ahead with a remake of this movie, he strikes me as a solid choice to direct it.</p>\n<p>Here is the original 2002 movie&#8217;s synopsis, for anyone who missed the movie when it came out originally:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A tale of a young girl&#8217;s close encounter with the galaxy&#8217;s most wanted extraterrestrial. Lilo is a lonely Hawaiian girl who adopts a small ugly &#8220;dog,&#8221; whom she names Stitch. Stitch would be the perfect pet if he weren&#8217;t in reality a genetic experiment who has escaped from an alien planet and crash-l<span class=\"yZlgBd\">anded on Earth. Through her love, faith and unwavering belief in ohana, the Hawaiian concept of family, Lilo helps unlock Stitch&#8217;s heart and gives him the ability to care for someone else.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Lilo and Stitch</em> was not a box office smash, and while it has some vocal advocates, it&#8217;s arguably one of the studio&#8217;s lesser movies of this century. (Its watercolor backgrounds were a bold choice, but I personally thought it made the movie feel a little cheap in comparison to some of the other Disney titles being released around that time.) But the characters are unquestionably cute, and character design like that goes a long way when it comes to selling toys and merchandise, which <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> has done in a major way since its release.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan Lin</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Eirich</strong>, who produced Disney&#8217;s billion-dollar live-action remake of <em>Aladdin</em>, are producing this film as well.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9OAC55UWAQs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lilo-and-stitch-remake-jon-m-chu/\">Live-Action &#8216;Lilo &#038; Stitch&#8217; Film to be Directed by &#8216;Crazy Rich Asians&#8217; Helmer Jon M.

Spyglass Media Group is developing the remake, with <strong>Eduardo Cisneros</strong> and <strong>Jason Shuma</strong>n tapped to handle the script. In the original movie, an experimental military robot is struck by lightning and gains a human-like intelligence.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645790\"></span></p>\n<p>Hey kids, do you remember <em>Short Circuit</em>? It was a sci-fi comedy from 1986 that featured lovable robot Johnny 5 and actor Fisher Stevens in brownface. It was a hit and even spawned a sequel. And now, it&#8217;s getting a remake. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/short-circuit-latinx-remake-spyglass-1234831398/\">Variety</a> reports that Spyglass Media is developing a <em>Short Circuit</em> remake and that writers Eduardo Cisneros and Jason Shuman to bring Latin-American/Hispanic-American elements to the story. Cisneros and Shuman&#8217;s credits include the screenplay for the upcoming comedy <em>Half Brothers</em>, which is set to arrive in December.</p>\n<p>In the original <em>Short Circuit</em>, &#8220;When one of an experimental range of military robots is hit by lightning, it is given consciousness. It escapes from the military and befriends a young woman, Stephanie Speck. Its creator, Newton Crosby, is desperate to find it, or his entire project may be scrapped.&#8221; Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens, Austin Pendleton, and G. W. Bailey, starred, with Tim Blaney as the voice of the robot, who was <em>officially</em> named Number 5 but eventually given the nickname Johnny 5. <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> director John Badham helmed the film.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time talk of a <em>Short Circuit</em> sequel has surfaced. Back in 2008, Dimension Films scored the rights to the material and planned a remake, with <em>Robot Chicken</em> writer Dan Milano handling the script. In 2009, <em>Paul Blart: Mall Cop</em> director Steve Carr signed on to direct the project. But Carr eventually left the project, and by 2012, it was announced that Tim Hill (<em>Hop</em>) was writing and directing a remake that was going to age down the main character into a pre-teen. Needless to say, none of these remakes made it passed the drawing board.</p>\n<p>Project X Entertainment&#8217;s James Vanderbilt, Paul Neinstein, and William Sherak will produce this new attempt at a remake, with Rehab Entertainment&#8217;s John W. Hyde, who executive produced the original film, serving as executive producer along with Terissa Kelton. This isn&#8217;t the only remake/reboot on the docket for Spyglass and Project X – they&#8217;re also handling the new <em>Scream</em> movie, which is currently in production.</p>\n<p>Do people still care about <em>Short Circuit</em>? Is it the type of property audiences are itching for? I really don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I even heard someone bring it up. But hey, maybe there&#8217;s an entire world of <em>Short Circuit</em> enthusiasts out there just waiting for this news.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/short-circuit-remake-new/\">&#8216;Short Circuit&#8217; Remake Being Developed Yet Again</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/RUqOoH6w_fI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 23:30:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/short-circuit-remake-new-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"fcdb7985051d7f378e5886db780ebb4d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn24@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-39-856_ea5ec50bf9b9a856.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":36110,"destBytes":23040,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/short-circuit-remake-new-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn24@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-39-856_ea5ec50bf9b9a856.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn1@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-18-43-996_5ba0ef636befe70a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RUqOoH6w_fI:n23Wz3SmVCo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-03-770_c8194c8d4037201e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/RUqOoH6w_fI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn60@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-44-249_546e262320386cbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117303},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"Kate Mara Did Not Have a Good Time on ‘Fantastic Four’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645762","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645766\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fantastic-four-1-e1605291172130-700x325.jpg\" alt=\"fantastic four kate mara\" width=\"700\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fantastic-four-1-e1605291172130-700x325.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fantastic-four-1-e1605291172130-360x167.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fantastic-four-1-e1605291172130-768x357.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Most everyone who worked on <strong>Josh Trank</strong>&#8216;s 2015<strong> <em>Fantastic Four</em></strong> has, at some point, wished they could forget about the whole thing. From Trank, who has been open about his <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-sue-storm/\">clashes with studio execs</a> behind the scenes, to the cast members, all of whom came out of the box office bomb relatively unscathed, and even bigger stars in some cases. One of those cast members is <strong>Kate Mara</strong>, who recently revealed that she had a &#8220;horrible experience on <em>Fantastic Four</em>,&#8221; apart from meeting her now-husband Jamie Bell. But she doesn&#8217;t want to forget it happened, because it was a &#8220;good learning experience&#8221; for the actress.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645762\"></span></p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.emmys.com/news/features/facing-wrongs-embracing-rights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emmy Magazine</a>, <b>Kate Mara</b> admitted that she &#8220;had a horrible experience on <i>Fantastic Four</i>&#8220;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never talked about it before. I married one of my costars, so I don&#8217;t regret doing that movie at all . But do I wish I had responded differently to certain things? Yes, definitely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mara added that she had two &#8220;horrendous experiences&#8221; working with male directors and elaborated, &#8220;Have I not gotten along with a female director? Absolutely. And was it not the greatest work experience? Sure. But there was never a time that I felt, ‘This is happening because I’m a woman.’ Where with the male directors, it 100 percent was only happening with me; it was a power dynamic thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mara doesn&#8217;t explicitly mention director Josh Trank or his treatment toward her in particular, but expanded on what she meant to <a href=\"https://collider.com/fantastic-four-kate-mara-regrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a>, explaining that she often felt that she &#8220;let [things] slide&#8221; far too often on the set of <em>Fantastic Four</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think that the thing that I always go back to on that one is that I think I should have followed my instincts more. Like when my gut was telling me, ‘You probably shouldn’t let that slide, what that person just said,’ or if you’re feeling a certain way about what an energy is like and how that is affecting your performance. You’re being paid to do a certain thing and if something is in the way of that, you have the right to speak up and say, ‘I’m actually not able to do what I am here to do because of X, Y and Z.’&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>But Mara said that while she has regrets over her experience on <em>Fantastic Four</em>, she doesn&#8217;t regret having done the film, as it was &#8220;a good learning experience.&#8221; Through her time on the superhero blockbuster, Mara revealed that she learned to speak up for herself.</p>\n<p>“I think that speaking up is something that I think that we all probably learn it over and over again, to follow your instincts and if you’re feeling a certain thing that is uneasy or whatever, there’s a reason for it. But, because it was such a big movie and again, usually, except in this case, when you’re in a big superhero movie they usually do incredibly well, like almost always. So even if it’s challenging, or this or that, or not everything’s perfect, it’s probably good for you to do it. That was sort of what I was being told and also was telling myself. And I don’t regret doing it at all, but do regret not having stood up for myself. I regret that for sure,&#8221; Mara said.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to keep pinpoint exactly what went wrong with <em>Fantastic Four</em>, which failed on a multitude of levels. Trank was the fall-guy for the box office failure of the film, though he left during principal photography and has famously distanced himself from the project in the years since. The cast members rarely reference it either. Bu in Mara&#8217;s case, the star of Hulu&#8217;s new series <em>A Teacher</em> is doing all right in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fantastic-four-kate-mara/\">Kate Mara Did Not Have a Good Time on &#8216;Fantastic Four&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i-A99ytFaYk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 21:30:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fantastic-four-1-e1605291172130-700x325.jpg","linkMd5":"d6fab04bc991f15f4230894edf67921d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn55@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-39-914_ecaff53709215125.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":325,"sourceBytes":24430,"destBytes":14646,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fantastic-four-1-e1605291172130-700x325.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn55@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-39-914_ecaff53709215125.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-45-490_d7b7e2cf259196e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i-A99ytFaYk:Upb54x947B8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn7@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-595_0a23538af2e89146.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i-A99ytFaYk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn48@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-18-43-722_e6655065254d2446.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117303},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"‘The Guilty’ Remake Cast Grows, Adding Ethan Hawke, Peter Sarsgaard, Riley Keough, and More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645761","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-guilty-cast.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645788\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-guilty-cast-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the guilty remake cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-guilty-cast-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-guilty-cast-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-guilty-cast-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-guilty-cast.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Antoine Fuqua</strong> is directing a remake of the Danish thriller <strong><em>The Guilty</em></strong> for Netflix with <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> set to star. So far, so good. But now a surprisingly large cast has been added around Gyllenhaal, including <strong>Peter Sarsgaard</strong>, <strong>Paul Dano</strong>, <strong>Ethan Hawke</strong>, <strong>Riley Keough</strong>, and more. And that&#8217;s where things grow slightly confusing. To be clear: these are all good actors, but their addition here suggests that <em>The Guilty</em> remake is going to be <em>very</em> different than the original. Because the original film is almost entirely a one-man show.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645761\"></span></p>\n<p>In the original <em>The Guilty</em>, &#8220;Alarm dispatcher and former police officer Asger Holm answers an emergency call from a kidnapped woman. When the call is suddenly disconnected, the search for the woman and her kidnapper begins.&#8221; The plot of the remake is mostly same, although the main character&#8217;s name has been changed to the more American sounding Joe Bayler. While there are a few background players here and there, the original <em>The Guilty</em> is a very self-contained movie, with star Jakob Cedergren almost entirely on his own. When a remake was announced and Jake Gyllenhaal was cast, it was assumed that the same scenario would be true – Gyllenhaal, alone in a room, talking on the phone.</p>\n<p>But now, Netflix has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1327295420624633857\">announced</a> a full lineup of actors around Gyllenhaal: Peter Sarsgaard, Riley Keough,<strong> Byron Bowers</strong>, <strong>Da’Vine Joy Randolph</strong>, <strong>David Castañeda</strong>, <strong>Christina Vidal</strong>, Paul Dano, Ethan Hawke, <strong>Adrian Martinez</strong>,<strong> Bill Burr</strong>, <strong>Beau Knapp</strong>, and <strong>Edi Patterson</strong>. So what&#8217;s going on here? Either one of two things. One is that <em>The Guilty</em> remake is going to be a huge departure from the original film and have Gyllenhaal&#8217;s character surrounded by supporting players. The other – and I think more likely – scenario is that all of these actors will be voice-only performances. The main character talks to a lot of characters on the phone in the original.</p>\n<p>Based on the line-up here, I really do think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on. Many of these people – Bill Burr in particular – have very distinct voices, so it would make sense to have them as voice-only actors in the film. Plus, with the coronavirus still a real problem, it will be pretty easy to have these actors record voice-over performances. They probably don&#8217;t even need to leave their houses – all the recording equipment could be sent directly to them.</p>\n<p>Still, when I saw this long list of names I was more than a little surprised. Mainly because the original film is pretty damn great and I would hate to see a remake squander what made the original so special. The fact that <em>The Guilty</em> is so self-contained, and focused on one guy alone in a room, is what makes it so tense. I guess what I&#8217;m saying is, please don&#8217;t muck it up. Antoine Fuqua is helming the remake for Netflix, with a script from <em>True Detective</em> creator <strong>Nic Pizzolatto</strong>.

They were the ones who help bring the wonderful <em>The Biggest Little Farm</em> to the big screen, and this feels like a spiritual successor. Rawer than <em>Little Farm</em>, but no less interesting, I&#8217;m struck by the bold strategy to lead off with a lengthy thirty-second celebration of the movie by director Paul Thomas Anderson. It&#8217;s quiet, welcoming, soothing, and, ultimately, one of the softest sells I&#8217;ve seen all year.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uan6MDxf3wU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles</strong></h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Laura Gabbert</strong>, who made the incredible documentary 2015&#8217;s <em>City of Gold</em>, has turned her attention from regional eats to delicious pastries.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Documenting the collaboration between world renowned chef Yotam #Ottolenghi (Plenty, Simple) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, OTTOLENGHI AND THE CAKES OF VERSAILLES follows five visionary pastry makers.

Other than feeling like it borders on the bougie, the stories of how some world-renowned pastry makers prepare for a major global event plays like visual comfort food. It&#8217;s cute, it&#8217;s nonthreatening, you could probably watch this with the entire family, and it looks like a lot of fun. In a year when the fun has been in short supply, this may very well be some soothing viewing for anyone in need of it.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7_0cdhi2WY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Baby God</strong></h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Hannah Olson</strong> looks into a truly sinister individual.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For more than 30 years, Dr. Quincy Fortier covertly used his own sperm to inseminate his fertility patients.

The story of a man who violated dozens upon dozens of unsuspecting women and families is found in the stories of those who share a common father. The trailer doesn&#8217;t suppose to know how one would internalize this kind of knowledge if presented with it right then and there during an interview. But knowing you have hundreds of brothers and sisters out in the wild, with the only variable being the mother, this is where the story digs in.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxzczuDg_qs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Tiger</h2>\n<p>Directors <strong>Matthew Heineman </strong>and<strong> Matthew Hamachek</strong> have made this a two-part story.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A look at the life, success and scandals of golf legend Tiger Woods.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Normally, I would skip something like this but Heineman was nominated for an Oscar in 2015 for his intense documentary, <em><strong>Cartel Land</strong></em>. However, the story&#8217;s pedigree, on the surface at least, feels less tabloid-ish and more like a serious biographical exploration. It&#8217;s interesting that nearly the first minute of a minute-fifteen second trailer lets us linger on the Tiger Woods of the past. It&#8217;s not until we get towards the last beats it hints we&#8217;re also getting the Tiger who was unceremoniously, and mercilessly, dragged by the media and public for his private indiscretions.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePFl4iWzVow?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>We Are The Champions</h2>\n<p>The ultimate in post-election pleasure viewing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Explore an array of unique competitions, from the quirky to the bizarre, and meet their passionate communities in this docuseries from executive producer Rainn Wilson</p></blockquote>\n<p>I will not suppose that this series is anything less than the equivalent of cold pizza. It&#8217;s not nutritious, in any way, but it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s easy, and it will get the job done. Documentaries like this are the pinnacle of what Netflix succeeds at: making mildly interesting content that is just good enough. Whether you&#8217;re putting together a Weber grill or some piece of Ikea furniture, watching handfuls of people cartwheeling by the force of simple gravity as their bodies tumble down a grassy hill is my jam.

She&#8217;ll play Ferrell&#8217;s character&#8217;s sister in what sounds like a more modern riff on the Bill Murray comedy <em>What About Bob?</em>. Here&#8217;s the description of the series:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The Shrink Next Door</em> is a dark comedy inspired by true events that detail the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist to the stars Dr. Isaac &#8220;Ike&#8221; Herschkopf and his longtime patient Martin &#8220;Marty&#8221; Markowitz. Over the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly takes over Marty&#8217;s life, even moving into Marty&#8217;s Hamptons home and taking over his family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an unprecedentedly exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QfSHx6k1KIo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the trailer for the upcoming HBO Max comedy special <em><strong>Colin Quinn &#38; Friends: A Parking Lot Comedy Show</strong></em>, which lands on the streaming service on <strong>November 12</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.

And it would have only been the beginning. Guadagnino revealed that he originally intended <em>Suspiria</em> to be the first part of a story, with a planned sequel that would have been even more off the walls than the film were <strong>Dakota Johnson</strong> rips open her chest and summons a demonic incarnation of Death. But sadly, it&#8217;s a <em>Suspiria</em> sequel we&#8217;ll never see, due to the first film&#8217;s poor box office performance.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645708\"></span></p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://thefilmstage.com/luca-guadagnino-talks-we-are-who-we-are-loving-your-actors-and-the-suspiria-sequel-that-wont-happen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Film Stage</a>, Guadagnino revealed that <em>Suspiria</em> was originally titled &#8220;<em>Suspiria: Part 1</em> in the script and in the slate. That&#8217;s true,&#8221; the <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> filmmaker said, following the wrap-up of his new HBO series <em>We Are Who We Are</em>.</p>\n<p>But when asked if we would ever get to see Part 2, Guadagnino replied, &#8220;How? How, my dear? The movie made absolutely nothing. It was a disaster at the box office. I know that people are liking it more and more now. I loved making that movie. It’s very dear to me. But writer David Kajganich and I had really conceived it as the first half of a bigger story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what would the <em>Suspiria </em>sequel have been about? Guadagnino revealed his plans, which sounds like it would have carried on with the tone of his 2018 film&#8217;s lurid and insane second half:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with <em>Suspiria</em>, I can tell you that in part two the storyline was layered in five different time zones and spaces. One of these was Helena Markos being a charlatan woman in the year 1200 in Scotland and how she got the secret of longevity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Guadagnino telling a story of satanic witches in 1200s Scotland? With <strong>Tilda Swinton</strong> reprising her role as Helena Markos in an origin story that would have allowed the ethereal actress to vamp and chew the scenery even more in a film that bends space and time? That would have been a delicious follow-up to the 1977-set <em>Suspiria</em>, and sounds like it would have been like Guadagnino&#8217;s take on Robert Eggers&#8217; chilly paranoid horror film <em>The Witch</em>, with a dash of the cosmic.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s truly a loss that we&#8217;ll never get to see it after <em>Suspiria</em> disappointed at the box office, grossing $7.6 million worldwide. But to be fair, Amazon Studios gave it an extremely limited release, opening the film only in New York and Los Angeles, and expanding to roughly 300 theaters at most. But Guadagnino is at least not lacking for work, recently boarding BBC&#8217;s new adaptation of <em>Brideshead Revisited</em> with quite a <a

And that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening with young buck <strong>John Mulaney</strong>. The stand-up comedian is going straight from his first communion to the writing staff of <strong><em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em></strong>, giving him a lot less time to see if <em>Addams Family Values</em> is available at Blockbuster Video. <span id=\"more-645718\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em> showrunner Mike Shoemaker announced the news on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Mulaney likes to work so this week he officially joined Late Night with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sethmeyers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SethMeyers</a> as a staff writer.  I hope he stays for 100 years but I will settle for &#34;as long as John wants&#34;.<br />Here&#39;s the 1st sketch from rookie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LateNightSeth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@latenightseth</a> writer John <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mulaney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Mulaney</a>:<a href=\"https://t.co/IMZ4DHbOAJ\">https://t.co/IMZ4DHbOAJ</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Mike Shoemaker (@shoemakermike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shoemakermike/status/1327070777695473669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 13, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Mulaney officially joined the staff this week. It might seem like a step down for such a high profile comedian, but there aren&#8217;t exactly a lot of stand-up shows happening, so Mulaney is clearly looking to stay sharp by joining a writers room with his friends. He&#8217;s joining comedians such as <strong>Amber Ruffin</strong>, <strong>John Lutz</strong>, <strong>Sal Gentile</strong>, <strong>Karen Chee</strong> and <strong>Jenny Hagel</strong>, as well as head writer <strong>Alex Baze</strong>. Shoemaker serves as producer and writer, and he previously worked <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, as well as <em>The Tonight Show</em> with former <em>SNL</em> cast member Jimmy Fallon. These guys are a tight-knit group.</p>\n<p>Not only did Mulaney join the staff, but he also appeared on the series with a bit where he theorized the place that ghosts had in the 2020 Presidential Election, specifically the late Senator John Lewis and Senator John McCain. That&#8217;s the bit that Shoemaker is referencing above, where Mulaney is wearing the trench coat that was gifted to him by The Strokes lead singer Julian Casablancas after the recent episode of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> they appeared on together.</p>\n<p>As a writer, Mulaney already has a long history with Seth Meyers. Both were at <em>Saturday Night Live</em> together, and Meyers is famously tied to the <em>SNL</em> character Stefon, which Mulaney co-created with Bill Hader. In fact, when Hader left <em>SNL</em>, Meyers and Stefon famously got married. So Mulaney and Meyers have a tight friendship and a great collaborative dynamic.</p>\n<p>Speaking of marriage, there&#8217;s a hilarious extended interview between Mulaney and Meyers that didn&#8217;t make it to air on NBC, but did end up online as a digital exclusive. During Mulaney&#8217;s appearance on the show following <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, the comedian asked Meyers a lot of &#8220;hard-hitting questions,&#8221; including some about the wedding of Colin Jost and Scarlett Johansson. Mike Shoemaker knew immediately this wouldn&#8217;t make it to TV, but thankfully, we still get to enjoy it all:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yXPxaO9Xcs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;m hoping any appearance that John Mulaney makes on <em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em> from here on out features him in this jacket and sunglasses.

The original show ran from 1991-1992 and featured Drake Mallard/Darkwing Duck as he balanced his home life with his crimefighting. While the series was assumed by everyone (including me) to be a spin-off of <em>DuckTales, </em>creator <strong>Tad Stones</strong> said in 2016 that he believes the shows exist in different universes, because nothing makes sense anymore. That said, Darkwing Duck appeared as a character in the recent <em>DuckTales</em> reboot, so I guess they <em>do</em> exist in the same universe now? Maybe? Someone help me here.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645837\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/darkwing-duck-reboot-disney-plus-1234830283/\">Variety</a> is reporting the news that Disney+ is developing a <em>Darkwing Duck</em> reboot. <strong>Seth Rogen</strong>, <strong>Evan Goldberg</strong>, <strong>James Weaver</strong>, and <strong>Alex McAtee</strong> of Point Grey Pictures will executive produce the series, with McAtee overseeing the project. The original <em>Darkwing Duck</em> ran for 91 episodes between 1991 and 1992 and followed Drake Mallard, who was raising his adopted daughter Gosalyn by day and fighting crime by night as the superhero Darkwing Duck. The character was aided by his sidekick Launchpad McQuack, a character who also appeared in the 1980s series <em>DuckTales</em>.</p>\n<p>Because of this character crossover, many assumed <em>Darkwing Duck</em> was a <em>DuckTales</em> spin-off. But back in 2016, series creator Tad Stones revealed that wasn&#8217;t the case, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/darkwing-duck-connected-to-ducktales/\">stating</a>: &#8220;Because Launchpad appeared in <em>DuckTales</em> and we used Roboduck as the Superman character, the hero who gets all the glory as opposed to Darkwing, fans try to connect the two realities. They are two different universes in my book. We work in the alternate Duckiverse.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to lie: I didn&#8217;t know this until this very moment, and it&#8217;s kind of blowing my mind and making me think my entire life has been a lie up until this point.</p>\n<p>In 2017 there was a <em>DuckTales</em> reboot and that show also featured Drake Mallard and Gosalyn. However, there was a twist – in the <em>DuckTales</em> reboot series, <em>Darkwing Duck</em> is a fictional character, and Drake Mallard is the head of the Darkwing Duck fan club. He eventually starts dressing up as Darkwing Duck himself to fight crime. Yes, that&#8217;s right, the mythology surrounding a cartoon superhero duck is needlessly complicated.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no writer attached to the <em>Darkwing Duck</em> reboot just yet, and Disney+ hasn&#8217;t even ordered it to series. But this certainly seems like the type of nostalgic title that the streaming service would want on their platform in the future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/darkwing-duck-reboot/\">&#8216;Darkwing Duck&#8217; Reboot Might Be Headed to Disney+ With Executive Producer Seth Rogen</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jabAZ8n3DYw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 23:00:04 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/darkwing-duck-reboot-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"80638deb63d5185cef1739b46c4533fb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn30@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-37-832_3e9b0ce3db5fd812.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":36225,"destBytes":20886,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/darkwing-duck-reboot-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn30@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-37-832_3e9b0ce3db5fd812.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-651_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-45-147_9a2c146c95799b85.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-45-495_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jabAZ8n3DYw:ERsHc6vtQfU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn44@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-45-082_21808414bf98d69d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jabAZ8n3DYw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn84@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-44-354_b55f114d521fa1cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421117303},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:37","title":"‘Ip Man: Kung Fu Master’ Trailer: The ‘Ip Man’ Series Will Never End","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645819","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ip-man-kung-fu-master-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645832\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ip-man-kung-fu-master-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"ip man kung fu master trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ip-man-kung-fu-master-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ip-man-kung-fu-master-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ip-man-kung-fu-master-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ip-man-kung-fu-master-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>There have been more than a few movies based on the life of Ip Man, the grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun who counted Bruce Lee among his students. The films are meant to be biographical, but like most movies based on real-life figures, they play fast and loose with the truth. That&#8217;s fine. I doubt at this point anyone is coming into an <em>Ip Man</em> movie looking for facts. The latest entry is <strong><em>Ip Man: Kung Fu Master</em></strong>, which goes back to Ip&#8217;s early days during the Communist Revolution of 1949. Watch the <em>Ip Man: Kung Fu Master</em> trailer below.<span id=\"more-645819\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Ip Man: Kung Fu Master Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5qZqaVjm4Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>So far there have been 5 <em>Ip Man</em> movies. The most recent title was titled <em>Ip Man 4: The Finale</em> (even though it&#8217;s the fifth movie in the series), but don&#8217;t let that <em>The Finale</em> subtitle fool you – there&#8217;s already a new entry in the series. It&#8217;s called <em>Ip Man: Kung Fu Master</em>, and it&#8217;s skirting around that &#8220;finale&#8221; thing by being a prequel. Here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>IP MAN: KUNG FU MASTER harks back to Ip’s early days before the Communist Revolution in 1949. Ip, portrayed by Dennis To for the third time as the martial artist who famously tutored Bruce Lee, was then a police captain who was framed for the murder of a ruthless but honorable mobster, and targeted for vengeance by his dangerous daughter. Forced to quit the force, Ip soon also has to contend with the arrival of the Japanese army in Guangzhou.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Liming Li</strong> directs the film and co-writes with <strong>Shi Qingshui</strong>. <em>Ip Man: Kung Fu Master</em> stars <strong>Dennis To</strong>, <strong>Yuan Li Ruoxin</strong>, <strong>Tong Xiaohu</strong>, <strong>Yue Dongfeng</strong>,<strong> Chang Qinyuan</strong>,<strong> Zhao Xioguang</strong>, <strong>Ren Yu</strong>, and <strong>Michael Wong</strong>. Donnie Yen played Ip Man in four out of the other five films (the fourth title, <em>Master Z: Ip Man Legacy</em>, doesn&#8217;t actually feature Ip Man as a character, so Yen didn&#8217;t appear – but he did produce), but he doesn&#8217;t have any involvement with this title. Which begs the question: does this film even count as part of the official <em>Ip Man</em> series, or is this a completely different thing? Discuss among yourselves and take notes, there will be a quiz on all of this later (no there won&#8217;t).</p>\n<p>Magnet Releasing will release <i>Ip Man: Kung Fu Master </i>in theaters and On Demand on <strong>December 11, 2020</strong>.
