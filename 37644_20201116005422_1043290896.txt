More drivers will be added in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Client-Side FLE provides amongst the strongest levels of data privacy available today. By expanding our native KMS support, it is even easier for organizations to further enhance the privacy and security of sensitive and regulated workloads with <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/multicloud-data-distribution\">multi-cloud support</a> across ~80 geographic regions.</p>\n<h2>My databases are already encrypted. What can I do with Client-Side Field Level Encryption?</h2>\n<p>What makes Client-Side FLE different from other database encryption approaches is that the process is <strong>totally separated</strong> from the database server. Encryption and decryption is instead handled exclusively within the MongoDB drivers in the client, <strong>before</strong> sensitive data leaves the application and hits the network.</p>\n<p>As a result, all encrypted fields sent to the MongoDB server – whether they are resident in memory, in system logs, at-rest in storage, and in backups – are rendered as ciphertext. Neither the server nor any administrators managing the database or cloud infrastructure staff have access to the encryption keys. Unless the attacker has a compromised DBA password, privileged network access, AND a stolen client encryption key, the data remains protected, securing it against sophisticated exploits.</p>\n<p>MongoDB’s Client-Side FLE complements existing network and storage encryption to protect the most highly classified, sensitive fields of your records <strong>without:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developers needing to write additional, highly complex encryption logic application-side</li>\n<li>Compromising your ability to query encrypted data</li>\n<li>Significantly impacting database performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By securing data with Client-Side FLE you can move to managed services in the cloud with greater confidence. This is because the database only works with encrypted fields, and <strong>you control</strong> the encryption keys, rather than having the database provider manage the keys for you. This additional layer of security enforces an even finer-grained separation of duties between those who use the database and those who administer and manage the database.</p>\n<p>You can also more easily comply with “right to erasure” mandates in modern privacy legislation such as <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/global-data-privacy-gdpr-ccpa-beyond\">the GDPR and the CCPA</a>. When a user invokes their right to erasure, you simply destroy the associated field encryption key and the user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is <strong>rendered unreadable and irrecoverable</strong> to anyone.</p>\n<h3>Client-Side FLE Implementation</h3>\n<p>Client-Side FLE is highly flexible. You can selectively encrypt individual fields within a document, multiple fields within the document, or the entire document. Each field can be optionally secured with its own key and decrypted seamlessly on the client.</p>\n<p>To check-out how Client-Side FLE works, take a look at this handy animation.</p>\n<figure>\n<div class=\"fl-center\">\n<img src=\"https://webassets.mongodb.com/kh3my641zd4ucowj9-FLE-s7oxojve2n.gif\" alt=\"The flow of a query submitted by an authenticated client using FLE\"  title=\"The flow of a query submitted by an authenticated client using FLE\"/>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>Client-Side FLE uses standard  NIST FIPS-certified encryption primitives  including AES at the 256-bit security level, in authenticated CBC mode: AEAD AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm with HMAC-SHA-512 MAC.</p>\n<p>Data encryption keys are protected by strong symmetric encryption with standard wrapping Key Encryption Keys, which can be natively integrated with external key management services backed by FIPS 140-2 validated Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Initially this was with Amazon’s KMS, and now with Azure Key Vault and Google Cloud KMS in beta. Alternatively, you can use remote secure web services to consume an external key or a secrets manager such as Hashicorp Vault.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To learn more, download our <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/field-level-encryption\">Guide to Client-Side FLE</a>.
