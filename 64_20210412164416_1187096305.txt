Relying on bone-conducting technology, the headset really doesn&#8217;t sit in your ear&#8230; instead, it rests on your sideburns, sending music directly into your inner ear by relaying audio vibrations to your temporal bone. The result is an audio experience that feels like sounds &#8220;are playing inside your mind&#8221;, according to one reviewer. The obvious benefit is that you don&#8217;t have to place physical earphones inside your ear and block out external sounds. Moreover, prolonged listening won&#8217;t cause any ear fatigue or eardrum damage, since the audio bypasses your eardrum and travels directly into your inner ear! In some instances, bone conducting technology even allows people with certain hearing disabilities to hear again. It&#8217;s sort of like having a brain implant that plays audio directly inside your brain&#8230;</p>\n<p>Bone conducting audio devices aren&#8217;t new, although the Sentien Audio is one of the first to bring AirPods-style features to it. The headset comfortably rests around your head and against the front of each ear. It sports a touch-sensitive panel that lets you tap and swipe to do things like skip tracks, play-pause music, increase-decrease volume, and even summon your phone&#8217;s voice-assistant. Unlike AirPods and other TWS earphones, the Sentien Audio boasts of a whopping 24-hour battery, allowing you to practically wear it all day and go about listening to music, answering calls, or asking Google Assistant or Siri random questions without worrying about battery life. Coupled with that is a unique adjustable titanium headband that comfortably places the headset on your head in a way that lets you naturally go about your day without worrying about it falling off or causing discomfort. Besides, since the Sentien Audio don&#8217;t rest &#8216;in&#8217; your ears, you can still hear sounds from the world around you, keeping you aware and alert.</p>\n<p>The Sentien Audio comes as a single wearable device that fits around your head, resting on your ears in a way that still allows you to wear spectacles comfortably. An adjustable headband made from titanium ensures a secure fit while Sentien, the company, claims that their bone-conducting drivers can privately play music without sound leaking out to people around you&#8230; something that&#8217;s been a common problem for bone-conducting headphones in the past. Like most TWS earphones, the Sentien Audio is equipped with Bluetooth 5.0 for seamless connectivity, along with double touch-surfaces that support multiple gestures. Sentien, additionally, lets you even program your gestures using third-party applications like IFTTT. The headset is outfitted with two noise-canceling microphones that work perfectly for calls as well as for summoning your phone&#8217;s voice assistant, and the Sentien Audio is built to be compatible with all major voice AI&#8217;s, from Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa to even the more niche Cortana and Bixby. The headset is even built with IP55 water and dust resistance (so you can comfortably wear the Sentien Audio while working out or in mild rain), and it&#8217;s worth noting that they don&#8217;t come with a charging case&#8230; or to put it another way, they don&#8217;t NEED a charging case because with a 24-hour battery life, you&#8217;ll realistically be able to get through your entire day without charging them&#8230; and some more!</p>\n<p>Designer: Sentien</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sentien/sentien-audio?ref=dsx114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $229</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-04-11T13:46:16+00:00\">$300</del> ($71 off).

you still have your phonebook? You will need it with this redesign of the classic retro office phone by Martin Poon!</p>\n<p>We use retro products all the time to create an aesthetic, and while the &#8220;90&#8217;s vibe&#8221; has become more of a photography filter, we love to see designers breathing life back into some of our favorite nostalgic items. Not long also we knew phone numbers by heart and had an address book, this simplified desktop phone brings back all of the good memories without any of the bad UI! The new/old phone has debossed buttons that won&#8217;t wear out like the silkscreen print, soft ear pads, and a single-piece keypad that makes it easier to clean &#8211; no crumbs! We love talking about the good old days but certainly don&#8217;t remember contact numbers like we used to so this phone comes with a cloud contact list that lets you reminisce without feeling old. The most futuristic (and probably extremely important) thing about it is that it comes with USB ports to charges other devices. So now your phone or iPhone will never be at 1% again.</p>\n<p>This design invokes nostalgia, memories you have kept for your memory box &#8211; some of them have such a strong emotional value attached to their design making it a worthy addition to every desk!</p>\n<p>Designer: Martin Poon</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-310468\"

Designed by Yan Zaho, the odd-looking origami-inspired contraption dubbed &#8216;SharkMan&#8217; is only for the bold ones to actually use in a shopping mall or maybe at the beach. It is still worth the experiment at home since it cocoons you in complete privacy, although you might look a little funny.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The deformable soft furniture morphs into several different configurations based on your needs for a &#8220;me space&#8221; when things get too distracting. Whether you are reading a book, working on your laptop, or simply want to take a quick nap – the SharkMan is an odd-looking solution that makes the cut. You can use it while standing, sitting, or even lying down – as three of these configurations don&#8217;t reveal your face to the world – so you don&#8217;t have to worry about the embarrassing part of using SharkMan in public.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">That said, these configurations of the wearable furniture are not recommended for claustrophobic people (not that I&#8217;m recommending it to others too) as it might get a bit too encapsulated for comfort.</span></p>\n<p>Designer: Yan Zaho</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-310355\"

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/bugatti/\">Bugatti</a> has created a niche for itself in the high-performance automobile market with iconic supercars that the best of the best swear by. So how about taking a detour for a change, and see what a Bugatti performance bike of the future would look like? The brainchild of designer Patrick Pieper, this is the Bugatti Vitesse <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/motorbike/\">superbike</a> that’s in a league of its own. Why I say that, well, first of all, the looks are unlike anything seen thus far. Secondly, the core design idea behind this two-wheeled monster ride imbibes in a story of its own. Virtually merging a “classic look with the latest technology and a lot of attention to detail,” as Patrick told us.</p>\n<p>According to him, it all began when he took up the <em>#bugatticonceptbikechallenge</em> on Facebook for a motorbike challenge done by Bugatti enthusiasts around the globe. At that time, he made a 2D side view of the concept bike. Then after a very long lull, he decided to update it as a 3D Model with a vision to set the story on the salt flats of the Bonneville Speedway. According to Patrick, the core idea for this unique creation is to fuse the modern aesthetics of Bugatti with the nostalgic elements of the 1930’s race cars and bikes. Inspiration for the Bugatti Vitesse design comes from the 2015 Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo Concept as the c-shaped rear of the car now takes the form of the bike’s front cover. Patrick also emphasized the inspiration of the contoured aesthetics from the Mallard steam locomotive which apparently holds the speed record for steam locomotives to date. By looking at the design, it brings to mind a whale, or a large aquatic creature, worthy of the ruler of the seas!</p>\n<p>The middle section of Vitesse done in light blue highlights the heritage of classic Bugatti race cars from the 1930s – the air vents and chrome fuel cap clearly adopt those traits. Moving on to the fuel tank and the seat column, they are milled from a single piece of aluminum – much like the taillight of the Chiron. The rear wheel is held in place by the carbon fiber clasps, and the apparent long wheelbase ensures a balanced smooth ride at high speeds. Overall, the concept bike is a true example of what a Bugatti superbike of the future could be like!</p>\n<p>Designer: Patrick Pieper</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309815\"

internet looking for plausible vacation destinations I can fly off to once this pandemic comes to an end. Though physically I am sitting in my home, mentally I am halfway across the world, lounging on a beach resort in the Caribbeans! I love this newfound pastime of mine, it fills up any free time I may have throughout the day, and oh how wonderfully it fills it up! During one of my getaway hunts, I came across Miroslav Naskov&#8217;s &#8216;Yacht Hub&#8217;, though this exquisite resort is still a concept at the moment, I couldn&#8217;t help but go completely gaga over it!</p>\n<p>Naskov intends for Yacht Hub to be a hospitality resort, floating on an artificially planted forest canal! Tucked amongst lush greenery, and casually placed upon a serene waterbody, the resort is inspired by the form of a Yacht! Aerial images of the structure display how similar it is to a yacht &#8211; from its sleek curves to the white sheen of its body. The resort will feature a yacht station, wherein the yachts that take you to the resort can dock. Though the main area of the resort, where the guests will stay, is placed upon the banks of the waterbody, the guests can walk and stroll around on the floating platforms. It&#8217;s as close to the water you can get, without actually dipping into it. The vast variety of plants and greenery add on to the tranquil and peaceful environment of the resort.</p>\n<p>Naskov&#8217;s Yacht Hub is the ultimate getaway from this modern and hectic world! The waterbody and the surrounding forest area will be artificially created, which will in turn build a completely private space for the resort. Far away from the outside world, this sleek and futuristic resort is a luxurious haven, and I would love to see it become a reality someday!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.i-mind.uk/\"

The only thing they can’t do is buy cat litter and tin cans filled with wet salmon puree or chicken. All they need is a <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/16/this-diy-paper-cat-house-makes-a-quirky-hiding-place-fit-for-your-feline-friends/\">tiny home</a> to call their own and they’ll be set. Luckily enough, designers at PaiPai Pets created a sort of tiny home for cats to play inside of and where their humans can stow away the litter box.</p>\n<p>PaiPai Pets’ double basin cat kennel is a cat tower and console storage cabinet in one. Looking at the kennel head-on, two wide doors border a narrower middle door, which opens up to the kennel’s storage unit and jungle-gym interior. On the left and right sides of the kennel, there’s enough space to fit two large litter boxes, which are always accessible through the middle door’s open porthole.</p>\n<p>Behind the kennel’s center cabinet, storage shelves can be found where cat owners can stow away smaller items like cans of wet cat food and litter scoopers. Painted in bright white, with natural wood accents along the perimeter, the kennel can remain discreet even in busier home spaces like the living room or den. Along the sides of the kennel, smaller portholes allow for plenty of airflow as well as a fun way for you to play whack-a-mole with your cat.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons people stay away from adopting kittens and cats is due to the smell of cat litter and the hassle that comes with taking care of that– if only cats could take care of their business and its smell too. PaiPai Pets’ double basin cat kennel provides a way for you and your cat to have your tuna and eat it too. With enough space to house two litter boxes and all the feline accessories you might need, PaiPai Pets takes care of the dirty business that we wish our cat could.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>In honor of the debut of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/volvo/\">Volvo’s</a> first <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/electric-vehicle/\">pure-electric vehicle</a>, the new XC40 Recharge, Volvo Cars Canada, and the Interior Design Show Toronto have chosen a winner for their New Garage Design <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/competition/\">Challenge</a>. Canadian designers were told to rethink the function and design of the garage to then be judged based on criteria gathered by Maru/Blue. Reimagining the garage space as an interactive family space and biophilic greenway, Montreal designer Tiam Maeiyat’s Parking Parc was chosen as the winning concept for merging clean design with sustainability.</p>\n<p>Parking Parc was inspired by the pun in its own name– Maeiyat reinterpreted the garage as both a space for parking the vehicle and as an actual greenway that resembles a children’s park. Shaped like a rolling hillside, Parking Parc provides a storage area for parked vehicles that rests beneath the garage’s grassy, recreational exterior. As currently conceptualized, photovoltaic panels punctuate the taller regions of the garage’s exterior, providing clean energy for Volvo’s XC40 Recharge to well, recharge, and enough energy to sustain the rest of the garage&#8217;s inside operations. Describing the design in his own words, Maeiyat notes,</p>\n<p>&#8220;The garage may be the last place in a house one might consider for gathering or entertainment, which is exactly why my design celebrates light and transparency and links the inside and outside of the garage. By doing so, there are new possibilities around quality family time, regardless of time or season.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the functionality of garages cannot be argued, they’ve largely stayed the same in design and structure while the vehicles that remain parked inside of them have changed drastically over the years. The New Garage Design Challenge aimed to introduce a new way of looking at garages that fits the contemporary and energy-efficient nature of today&#8217;s vehicles. Tiam Maeiyat’s reinterpretation of the traditional garage turns to biophilic design and green roofing to help maintain the home’s natural landscape and grassy surroundings.</p>\n<p>Designer: Tiam

it&#8217;s affecting the way we live and function. Although the irony is that the world is drastically changing because of our unhealthy practices and us! It&#8217;s now imperative to live more sustainably, carefully, and consciously. Integrating sustainability into our day-to-day lives has become crucial! And we can do this in various ways. Designers and creators are coming up with sustainable alternatives for almost everything! Every product that is necessary and utilized by us in our everyday routine has an eco-friendly alternative to it. Replacing our usual mass-produced designs with these greener options will make a huge difference to the environment and Mother Earth! From reusable totes made from fruit skins to the world&#8217;s first disposable paper razor, we&#8217;ve curated a whole collection of sustainable products that will have major functionality in our daily lives. It&#8217;s time to go green!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/worlds-first-disposable-paper-razor-unveiled-in-japan/kai_disposable_paper_razor_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/worlds-first-disposable-paper-razor-unveiled-in-japan/kai_disposable_paper_razor_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">This gives a completely new meaning to the word ‘papercut’! Say hello to the Paper Razor, a sustainable alternative to the disposable plastic razor. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/09/worlds-first-paper-disposable-razor-unveiled-in-japan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Paper Razor,</a> as its name suggests, comes with an all-paper body and sports a metal blade-head on top. Designed to be flat-packed, the single-use razor comes completely unfolded and can easily be put together in a matter of seconds by merely folding in the sides and the top to create a rigid, ergonomic razor with a grippy handle. Its origami-inspired design gives it as much strength and maneuverability as a plastic razor while minimizing the use of plastic by as much as 98%. The result? A razor that can be easily flat-packed and shipped, used and then disposed of… safely, of course.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/310090/15_sonnet155_johannahehemeyercu%CC%88rtenlobkebeckfeld_sustainablepaperbag.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/auto-draft/02_sonnet155_johannahehemeyercu%CC%88rtenlobkebeckfeld_sustainablepaperbag.jpg\" />Using totes instead of single-use shopping bags can help reduce your carbon footprint even further if they’re made of sustainable materials. To offer a sustainable alternative, designers Johanna Hehemeyer-Cürten and Lobke Beckfeld made Sonne155, a reusable tote and sustainable alternative to the paper bag. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/10/these-reusable-totes-made-from-fruit-skins-is-a-green-alternative-to-paper-bags/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonnet155</a> is entirely made from biodegradable materials to ensure that each bag can break down into water or soil. Hehemeyer-Cürten and Beckfeld constructed the tote bags from the composite of two raw materials: cellulosic production waste from the textile industry and pectin, which partially mimics the gelling effects of gelatin. Cellulosic production waste comes from cellulose, the structural cell wall found in plants, while pectin is a plant-based polysaccharide derived from the skin of fruits.</p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/the-james-dyson-sustainability-award-winner-harvests-solar-energy-by-absorbing-uv-lights-using-crop-waste/04-aureus_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/the-james-dyson-sustainability-award-winner-harvests-solar-energy-by-absorbing-uv-lights-using-crop-waste/05-aureus_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Designed by Carvey Ehren Maigue of Mapua University, these panels can be crafted into windows or walls which will harvest solar energy and convert it into electricity. Three things that made me instantly fall in love with this design are 1) clean renewable energy 2) using crop waste and 3) lower electricity bills. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/11/20/james-dyson-award-winning-window-uses-crop-waste-to-capture-uv-light-for-renewable-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AuRUES</a> was inspired by the phenomenon of the aurora lights which is a whimsical natural process that occurs when luminescent particles in the upper atmosphere absorb energy from UV and gamma radiation and emit it as visible light. The panels mimic this process by embedding similar luminescent particles in resin so that when the sunlight hits the panel it absorbs the UV and produces visible light. The light is then directed towards the edges of the panel where regular photovoltaic cells collect the energy to turn it into electricity. The colors of the luminescent particles come from dyes that were made from waste crops which makes this a closed-loop system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/draft-this-instant-noodles-water-soluble-packaging-becomes-its-sauce/dissolvable_noodle_packaging_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/draft-this-instant-noodles-water-soluble-packaging-becomes-its-sauce/dissolvable_noodle_packaging_4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/07/this-instant-noodles-water-soluble-packaging-becomes-its-sauce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Dissolvable Noodle Packaging</a> finds a unique, no-waste packaging solution for instant-ramen. Instead of wrapping the noodles in layers of plastic (with an extra plastic sachet filled with the tastemaker powder), Holly decided to develop an edible, spice-infused biofilm to package the noodles in. When you want to cook yourself some ramen, just insert the pre-packaged noodle cake into hot water and the biofilm dissolves in the water, turning it into a flavored broth! “The packaging becomes the sauce”, says Holly, who managed to design and develop her solution right in her own kitchen! The biofilm uses simple, edible ingredients like potato starch, glycerin, and water. “The ingredients are blended and heated until the mixture is at the right thickness. At this point, I add the spices and flavorings before pouring it into a mold to set for 24 hours”, Holly mentions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/organic_notebook_made_from_herbs.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/this-notebook-was-designed-to-be-so-sustainable-its-virtually-carbon-neutral/organic_notebook_made_from_herbs_04.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Based out of Geneva, theGVA (The Green Value Attitude) is trying to perfect the ‘business model of paper’.<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/15/this-notebook-was-designed-to-be-so-sustainable-its-virtually-carbon-neutral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> theGVA’s notebooks</a> aren’t just sustainably grown, each notebook’s purchase actually adds back to the environment more than it took from it. The ‘eco-friendly’ notebook comes with FSC paper, grown under internationally certified sustainable conditions, made from a combination of virgin wood pulp (cultivated responsibly from well-maintained and managed forests), as well as recycled paper. The cover of the notebook comes crafted from a uniquely tactile and smooth bamboo ply. Given how rapidly bamboo can be cultivated, the bamboo harvested for the notebook covers can be well accounted for within just a few months. The covers are left bare, giving you the freedom to either color in your own cover, or etch out your company’s graphic. The notebooks are all hand-bound and hand-stitched with leather spines, and complete with an elastic band to hold it all together.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/unocup-waiting-for-sales-to-clear/10-unocup_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/217/530/9f7d54043e71a8b3ec00f5df8d979ce5_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1573762861&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=82b711faedce1482224c04ffc03e32d8\" alt=\"unocup1\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Not-so-fun fact: New York City alone generates enough plastic lid waste to cover the entire earth THREE times. To solve this issue and keep coffee from spilling on your clothes, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/11/this-ergonomic-paper-cup-was-designed-to-reduce-plastic-waste-generated-by-to-go-coffees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unocup</a> designed an ergonomic paper cup that folds into itself to create a spill-proof lid! Just fold over each flap and insert the tab to close the “lid”. To open, it is a simple press of a button that will gently open the flap instead of trying to carefully pop off the lid – praying for you if you attempt that with long nails. This cup has a unique shape that fits into your palm, the uniform structure creates a strong and consistent body that will not cave under pressure, unlike traditional paper cups. The drinking curved spout is specifically designed to fit your lips naturally as opposed to the otherwise flat plastic lids. You can also fold flaps backward and drink from the rim just like a normal drinking glass.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/this-biodegradable-prescription-pill-bottle-is-an-open-source-design-made-from-paper-its-child-proof/4-paperpillbottle_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/this-biodegradable-prescription-pill-bottle-is-an-open-source-design-made-from-paper-its-child-proof/1-paperpillbottle_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/03/this-biodegradable-prescription-pill-bottle-is-an-open-source-design-made-from-paper-its-child-proof/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Prescription Paper Pill Bottle</a>, a first of its kind, is 100% compostable and biodegradable. Its open-source design adheres to FDA regulations for durability, light, water, and child resistance. It’s available to any pharmacy for filling prescription tablets and capsules. Once used then emptied, the paper bottle can be tossed into any compostable bin with its Rx label to decompose and be reused as fertilizer to safely replenish the soil in fields, gardens, and landscapes,” says the team. Tikkun Olam Makers made it an open-source design which means anyone anywhere in the world can use their method and make their own paper pill bottles by downloading the .stl file that contains the attendant images and assembly instructions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/auto-draft/1-p0_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/auto-draft/2-p0_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Gabriel Steinmann created P0 (pronounced pio like the letter and number) which stands for ‘project zero’  – a storage and shopping solution for food that aims to reduce consumption emissions. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/07/this-sustainable-storage-container-shopping-bag-reduces-your-consumption-emissions-and-food-waste/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">P0</a> helps us to switch to and maintain a plant-based diet and reduce the amount of food waste. The design blends organic and sustainable materials with an earthy aesthetic to invoke warmth and a more personal relationship with the items we use. Its ceramic body and textile lining help encourage a deeper appreciation for the food we consume and make us more aware of how much food we actually need to minimize wasting it. It is also a practical and attractive utensil in your kitchen – “a symbol of change, of becoming a little bit more human,” as rightly described by Steinmann.</p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/suitcase/1-rhita_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/suitcase/3-rhita_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Not-so-fun-fact: suitcases are not recyclable and end up in the landfill 9 out of 10 times. To combat this waste that stems from our love for traveling, a team of designers created <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/27/this-sustainable-suitcase-uses-70-lesser-parts-is-easier-to-assemble-disassemble-than-ikea-furniture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RHITA</a> – a suitcase that is super easy to assemble and disassemble which makes it easier to repair or recycle. RHITA’s simplified structure reduces the number of parts used in production by 70% when compared to traditional suitcases. Even the space needed for transportation has been reduced by 33%. It features an innovative hinge system and a unique installation method – no glue or rivet for fixation, no sewing of the inner lining, maximizing the space inside as well as a quick fasten and loosen wheel mechanism.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/these-shoes-made-of-wood-cork-and-corn-is-a-great-example-of-modern-sustainable-footwear-design/Element_0_the_most_versatile_and_sustainable_shoe.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/sustainable-unisex-sneakers-that-are-made-from-recycled-plastic-bottles-and-fishnets/Element_0_the_most_versatile_and_sustainable_sneakers_02.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Element 0 is altering how shoes are designed and manufactured by making sustainability just as important as comfort. This means re-engineering the shoe’s materials in a way that benefits your feet as well as the environment. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/28/these-shoes-made-of-wood-cork-and-corn-is-a-great-example-of-modern-sustainable-footwear-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Element 0’s sneakers</a> sport a unisex design built from both naturally sourced as well as recycled materials (the company is even transparent about where and how they source their materials). The shoes rest on an outsole that’s made from rubber as well as recycled cork, quite literally putting a spring in your step; while an insole crafted from a combination of wool, corn-fiber, wood, and natural latex gives your foot a comfortable surface to rest on that’s also water-absorbent and anti-odor. To cap things off, Element 0’s outer body balances aesthetics with breathability as well as sustainability. The fabric on the outer body is woven from plastic yarn sourced from recycled PET bottles as well as discarded fishing nets.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

I know I should, but somehow it hurts my pride because I&#8217;d rather just not get sick instead. Here&#8217;s what hurt my pride even more, though&#8230; I tested positive last week, and I was sick for 2-3 days before my test but I never had a thermometer around me to check. On any given year, the idea of a portable thermometer would sound like prepper-behavior, but in 2021 it seems like a portable thermometer is a perfect product to have around you at home or on your person&#8230; sort of like a bottle-opener.</p>\n<p>You know how you feel like an absolute caveman in a house without a bottle-opener? You&#8217;re constantly looking for counters with edges to pop your bottle against, or worse, you try opening the bottle with your teeth, risking chipping them because you refuse to own a metal apparatus that opens bottles. Today, it&#8217;s rather easy to carry a bottle-opener around with you&#8230; some of them are even small enough to fit on your keychain. That&#8217;s sort of the approach that TEMPMi takes towards thermometers too. The TEMPMi isn&#8217;t a bulky gun-shaped thermometer or a fragile mercury-filled glass thermometer. It&#8217;s a tiny, battery-sized device that weighs a mere 8 grams (as much as a key) and is designed to be the kind of thermometer you carry around with you as EDC. It uses a thermopile and infrared sensor to accurately gauge temperatures without contact, working just like a contactless thermometer-gun would, but at a mere fraction of the size.</p>\n<p>The TEMPMi&#8217;s compact size isn&#8217;t just another feature, it actually allows the device to be smart too. It comes without a battery or display, and operates by plugging into your smartphone. This enables the TEMPMi device to record your readings for you, turning the thermometer into a smart one. All temperature readings are displayed on your smartphone screen in a legible font, and in the unit of your choice. Readings are recorded within the app, allowing you to scan back and look at readings by time and date (a feature that lets you really keep track of your symptoms too). Just plug the device into the charging port on your smartphone (iOS or Android) and you&#8217;ve got yourself a smart-thermometer on your hands. The TEMPMi reads temperatures from distances of up to 1.6-inches, and its medical benefits aside, you could even use it in the kitchen to measure your oven temperature, gauge how hot your frying oil is, or how cold your beer is. Each TEMPMi comes with a keyring that lets you easily attach it to your keychain or suspend it on your bag. Measuring a little over 2-inches in length, the TEMPMi can easily fit into pockets too, making it a great (and pretty valuable) addition to your EDC!</p>\n<p>Designer: Lucas</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1683805836/tempmi-the-worlds-smallest-tritium-keychain-thermometer?ref=82pkno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $39</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-04-11T12:59:10+00:00\">$80</del> (51% off).

About 8.25 million tons of plastic waste enter the ocean each year and these take a million years to decompose causing significant damage to the oceans and marine life. Not-so-fun fact: New York City alone generates enough plastic lid waste to cover the entire earth THREE times. To solve this issue and keep coffee from spilling on your clothes, <a href=\"https://www.unocup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unocup</a> designed an ergonomic paper cup that folds into itself to create a spill-proof lid!</p>\n<p>Just fold over each flap and insert the tab to close the &#8220;lid&#8221;. To open, it is a simple press of a button that will gently open the flap instead of trying to carefully pop off the lid &#8211; praying for you if you attempt that with long nails. This cup has a unique shape that fits into your palm, the uniform structure creates a strong and consistent body that will not cave under pressure, unlike traditional paper cups. The drinking curved spout is specifically designed to fit your lips naturally as opposed to the otherwise flat plastic lids. You can also fold flaps backward and drink from the rim just like a normal drinking glass. The first prototype was developed in 2015 and it has been refined 800 times since then to create the perfect final version that is as strong as your coffee. Unocup has been optimized for mass-production using existing cup-making machinery which will yield significant cost and energy savings in manufacturing, storage, and transportation while not requiring new machinery or investment.</p>\n<p>One of the co-founders and designers of Unocup, Tom Chan, was just a sophomore when he came up with the original concept &#8211; a single unit with an origami-like lid that you fold into place to seal liquid inside, eliminating the need for single-use plastic lids. After countless coffee-shop interviews and more than hundreds of prototypes later, he and long-time friend Kaanur Papo founded Unocup, in 2019. It is a 100% plastic-free, compostable beverage cup that replaces the traditional lid with paper folds that seal the drink tightly. “When people think of sustainable solutions they think of certain compromises that have to be made. What’s really exciting about this is that it’s a sustainable and practical solution at the same time,&#8221; says Papo. It helps coffee drinkers want a cup that they feel will contribute to waste reduction, while still keeping the convenience factor.
