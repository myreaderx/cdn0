So long as the law applied equally to everyone, regardless of whether someone is religious or not, then everyone had to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"ubuT6g\">As the Court held in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/494/872#writing-USSC_CR_0494_0872_ZO\"><em>Employment Division v. Smith</em></a> (1990), religious objectors must follow “neutral law[s] of general applicability.” </p>\n<p id=\"u5ZHAN\">Ever since Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the Court last fall, however, the Supreme Court has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett\">rapidly dismantling <em>Smith</em></a>. On Friday night, the Court fired a bullet into <em>Smith</em>’s heart. It ruled that people of faith who want to gather in relatively large groups in someone’s home must be allowed to do so, despite the fact that California limits all in-home gatherings to just three households.</p>\n<p id=\"hOFi38\">Although the Court’s new 5-4 decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a151_4g15.pdf\"><em>Tandon v. Newsom</em></a> doesn’t explicitly overrule <em>Smith</em>, the decision makes it so easy for many religious objectors to refuse to comply with the law that <em>Smith</em> is basically a dead letter.</p>\n<p id=\"leb9wM\">The Court’s new majority has accomplished what amounts to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett\">revolution in its approach to religion and the law</a>, entirely through cases brought by churches and other religious actors seeking exemptions from public health rules intended to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>\n<p id=\"6MUJDU\">The Court is serious about giving religious conservatives broad immunity from the law — so serious, in fact, that it is literally willing to endanger people’s lives in order to achieve this goal.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"OuBXsd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"CJUGqP\">What happened in <em>Tandon v. Newsom</em>?</h3>\n<p id=\"Du1jIB\"><em>Tandon </em>is the latest in a series of decisions brought by houses of worship — or, in this case, specific worshipers — who wish to defy public health rules limiting the number of people who can gather for religious activity.</p>\n<p id=\"JRezOO\">California limits gatherings in people’s homes to members of just three households. This is a blanket rule, applying to people who gather in a home for any reason, regardless of whether they do so to pray, to quilt blankets that they plan to sell on Etsy, or just to socialize with friends. So, under <em>Smith</em>, this rule would be lawful because it treats religious and secular actors exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"7TvlHu\">Nevertheless, a majority of the Court concluded that people who wish to gather in someone’s home for religious activity must be exempted from California’s public health rule. And, although the <em>Tandon</em> opinion does not explicitly repudiate <em>Smith</em>, it defines what qualifies as a “neutral law of general applicability” so narrowly that the term is basically meaningless. </p>\n<p id=\"I3fS4D\">“Government regulations are not neutral and generally applicable,” the five most conservative justices write in an unsigned opinion “whenever they treat <em>any</em> comparable secular activity more favorably than religious exercise.” But the Court also defines what qualifies as “comparable secular activity” very broadly. (Although no justice signed their name to the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented. So we know that the remaining five justices formed the majority.)</p>\n<p id=\"AkD9u8\">“California treats some comparable secular activities more favorably than at-home religious exercise,” the majority opinion in <em>Tandon</em> claims, “permitting hair salons, retail stores, personal care services, movie theaters, private suites at sporting events and concerts, and indoor restaurants to bring together more than three households at a time.”</p>\n<p id=\"hqI3j1\">As Justice Kagan explains in her dissent, there are three very good reasons why a state might treat these secular activities differently than a gathering in people’s homes. First of all, “when people gather in social settings, their interactions are likely to be longer than they would be in a commercial setting,” and the people at social gatherings are “more likely to be involved in prolonged conversations.”</p>\n<p id=\"cmMLhC\">Additionally, “private houses are typically smaller and less ventilated than commercial establishments,” and “social distancing and mask-wearing are less likely in private settings and enforcement is more difficult.”</p>\n<p id=\"0ANrpx\">But, ultimately, none of these distinctions mattered to the Court’s majority. The practical impact of <em>Tandon</em> is that, so long as many religious objectors can cite <em>any</em> secular activity that is treated differently than a religious activity — no matter how distinct those two activities may be — this Supreme Court is very likely to grant the objector an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"zisEbt\"><em>Tandon</em> is not an especially surprising decision — the Court reached a similar conclusion last November in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a87_4g15.pdf\"><em>Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo</em></a><em>, </em>a decision that I described at the time as a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett\">revolutionary victory</a>” for religious conservatives.</p>\n<p id=\"zaahfY\">Even after <em>Roman Catholic Diocese</em>, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a151_4g15.pdf\">two Republican-appointed judges</a> — Judge Milan Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, and Judge Bridget Shelton Bade, a Trump appointee — concluded that California’s across-the-board restriction on in-home gatherings should remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"ouba9n\">The <em>Tandon </em>decision, in other words, is a signal that even conservative lower court judges need to be more protective of religious objectors — even when those objectors seek legal exemptions that could help spread a deadly disease.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BybnBa\">It’s not clear how <em>Tandon</em> will apply to faiths the Court’s majority disapproves</h3>\n<p id=\"yvDP4C\">In theory, the decision in <em>Tandon</em> should apply to all religious objectors, regardless of which faith motivates such objections. In practice, however, the Supreme Court has not always been protective of people of faith who are unpopular in the Republican Party.</p>\n<p id=\"pUQksw\">In <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3257432787056243348&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Dunn v. Ray</em></a> (2019), for example, the Court rejected a request from a Muslim inmate on Alabama’s death row to have an imam comfort him during his final moments. At the time, Alabama permitted Christians to have a pastor present during their execution, but not Muslims. So <em>Dunn</em> involved a straightforward case of religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"ygQgKg\">In fairness, the Court recently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22279878/supreme-court-death-penalty-religious-liberty-dunn-ray-smith-elena-kagan-amy-coney-barrett\">backed away from its decision in <em>Dunn</em></a>, after the decision triggered a widespread backlash even from many conservative commentators (the National Review’s David French labeled it a “<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-supreme-court-upholds-a-grave-violation-of-the-first-amendment/\">grave violation of the First Amendment</a>”). But, at the very least, <em>Dunn</em> shows that this Court is instinctively less protective of Muslims’ religious liberty than it is of Christians.</p>\n<p id=\"6UYes2\">The clearest example of this kind of religious preference is <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16062632215534775045&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Trump v. Hawaii</em></a> (2018), which upheld a Trump-era policy prohibiting nationals from several majority Muslim nations from entering the United States. The Court did so despite the fact that Trump and his inner circle repeatedly bragged about their plans to target Muslims, in violation of the Constitution’s ban on policies <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">“prohibiting the free exercise” of religion</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"lIN6NT\">In fairness, the Court based its decision in <em>Hawaii</em> largely on concerns that courts should be reluctant to interfere with a president’s decisions <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/7/22370085/mcconnell-cancel-corporations-punish-first-amendment-unconstitutional-delta-georgia-voting-rights\">relating to national security</a>. But it’s hard to imagine how the risk of allowing an immigrant from Yemen to enter the United States poses more of a danger to Americans than Covid-19 — and, indeed, before Justice Barrett joined the Court, a majority of the justices tended to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/30/21275379/supreme-court-churches-roberts-kavanaugh-south-bay-united-pentecostal-newsom\">defer to public health officials</a> for much the same reason they defer to elected officials on matters relating to national security.</p>\n<p id=\"hXzcuq\">As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5226635228340381841&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom</em></a> (2020), a case decided before Barrett joined the Court, public health decisions typically “should not be subject to second-guessing by an ‘unelected federal judiciary,’ which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.”</p>\n<p id=\"YkXWKA\">As the Court’s about-face in the <em>Dunn</em> case suggests, there is some nuance to the Court’s approach to Muslim civil rights. The Court does sometimes rule in favor of Islamic plaintiffs in religious liberty cases. In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-6827_5h26.pdf\"><em>Holt v. Hobbs</em></a> (2015), for example, a unanimous Supreme Court agreed that Muslim prison inmates should be allowed to grow a half-inch beard if their faith requires them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"RgpCf2\">But decisions like <em>Dunn</em> and <em>Hawaii</em> also suggest that the Court is more reluctant to grant relief to Muslims than they are to grant such relief to Christians. It remains to be seen, in other words, whether the hyper-protective rule laid out in <em>Tandon </em>will apply equally to all people of faith — or whether certain favored religions will receive special treatment.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 16:20:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TeSOJ6Yt5AcgKmxCexHO9ci7Uc=/0x0:4165x3124/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113634/1229490344.0.jpg","linkMd5":"f4863c9b021199dab3ba6b4083c5cf60","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn63@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-06-704_b3b83bdc81b550a9.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":136689,"destBytes":71226,"author":"Ian Millhiser","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TeSOJ6Yt5AcgKmxCexHO9ci7Uc=/0x0:4165x3124/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113634/1229490344.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn63@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-06-704_b3b83bdc81b550a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245845655},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","title":"70 years of cop shows taught us to valorize the police","link":"https://www.vox.com/culture/22375412/police-show-procedurals-hollywood-history-dragnet-keystone-cops-brooklyn-nine-nine-wire-blue-bloods","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ia2dBOwuIcWCj76KUwbiXarwUaE=/273x0:2753x1860/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112951/GettyImages_1211486024.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Los Angeles Airport police officers observe protesters gathering on Century Boulevard near LAX on April 30, 2020. | Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>Early Hollywood treated the cops as incompetent fools. Then everything changed.</p> <p id=\"PmKUIk\">In 2019, polls found that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/us/trust-congress-military-police.html\">the police were one of the most trusted public institutions in America</a>, more trustworthy than Congress or journalists or religious leaders. </p>\n<p id=\"1VQQNP\">But in 2020, after George Floyd died at the hands of police and wave of protests against police brutality spread across the US, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/31/21275994/police-violence-peaceful-protesters-images\">police drove their vans into crowds of protesters</a>, shot paint canisters at people standing on their own porches, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">fired rubber bullets at reporters and arrested other reporters live on television</a>, and pulled down protesters’ masks to pepper spray them in the face in the midst of a respiratory pandemic. </p>\n<p id=\"BOBwDK\">There is a gap between the ways in which the police behave and the ways in which the public perceives them. And for a long time, police have behaved as though they think pop culture is responsible for that gap.</p>\n<p id=\"z0uy5G\">In 1910, the International Association of Chiefs of Police was moved to adopt <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=spY83dW-3SEC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+police+are+sometimes+made+to+appear+ridiculous%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lopqyPrtto&amp;sig=ACfU3U0gG28MQMs0H2LfHhJFEmC611lz8g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf2aadu9zpAhUQmHIEHW-aAzkQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cthe%20police%20are%20sometimes%20made%20to%20appear%20ridiculous%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\">a resolution condemning the movie business for the way it depicted police officers</a>. The movies, the IACP complained, made crime look fun and glamorous. Meanwhile, the police were “sometimes made to appear ridiculous.” </p>\n<p id=\"uJPzk1\">It was true: The movies <em>did</em> tend to make the police look ridiculous in the 1910s. From 1912 to 1917, the incompetent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Cops\">Keystone Cops</a> bumbled their way across the silent screen. From 1914 to 1918, animated <a href=\"http://brayanimation.weebly.com/police-dog.html\">Police Dog</a> shorts showed a police force unable to prevent adorable Officer Piffles (a good dog) from getting his owner into one scrape after another. And in 1917’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Street_(film)\"><em>Easy Street</em></a>, Charlie Chaplin’s tramp-turned-police-officer was only able to save his girl from a mob of criminals after accidentally sitting on a drug addict’s needle and picking up superpowers from the force of the inadvertent injection. </p>\n<p id=\"BBdkyW\">Police in popular culture of the 1910s were inept buffoons to be mocked and, well, ridiculed.  And the real-life police reacted with outrage. How could the police do their jobs if people thought of them as losers who could be foiled by a cartoon dog?</p>\n<p id=\"wzjegR\">Today, the police of popular culture have no such problem. Our screens are filled with depictions of heroic cop after heroic cop. We’ve got <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2014/12/blue-bloods-starring-tom-selleck-the-nypd-white-viewers-and-black-new-yorkers.html\">reactionary heroic cops</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2015/02/can-brooklyn-nine-nine-ever-accurately-portray-the-nypd.html\">liberal heroic cops</a>; <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2Fshows%2Fncis-new-orleans%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fculture%2F22375412%2Fpolice-show-procedurals-hollywood-history-dragnet-keystone-cops-brooklyn-nine-nine-wire-blue-bloods\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">white heroic cops</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4085022/\">Black heroic cops</a>; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justified_(TV_series)\">heroic cops who will work outside the system</a> when the situation calls for it and never face a problem because they are always right, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order\">heroic cops who never have to work against the system</a> because the system itself is always right. </p>\n<p id=\"3xjH0H\">We live in a world in which police frequently respond to peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets.

Right, Jack Webb as <em>Dragnet</em>’s heroic Joe Friday, pictured here on the DVD case.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"MaJubV\">The ridiculous police of 1910s pop culture didn’t come out of nowhere. The police of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were widely understood to be a corrupt gang, and not without reason. The infamous <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/reforming-new-york-police\">Lexow Commission</a> of the 1890s, which ran more than 10,000 pages long, found that the police extorted $10 million from the public each year in New York State alone, and that they regularly harassed the citizenry rather than trying to protect them. That report drove <a href=\"https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/50819_ch_1.pdf\">30 years of police reform efforts</a> and gave a young Theodore Roosevelt the chance to build his reputation on <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/reforming-new-york-police\">cleaning up the New York City Police Department</a> — but for much of the public, the police’s reputation as a pack of hired goons at worst and incompetent bumblers at best had already been set.</p>\n<p id=\"Nhm9H4\">Decades of reform helped change the public’s perception of the police. But it also helped that the movie industry, eager to escape police censorship, began to police itself. Studios needed police cooperation to cover up their stars’ misdeeds. They also needed to get shooting permits. They had plenty of motivation to play nicely with the police. So the policeman as incompetent bumbler began to fade away from the movies.</p>\n<p id=\"tvRCID\">But what cemented the idea of the hero cop in the American imagination was the modern cop show, starting with 1951’s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043194/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3\"><em>Dragnet</em></a>. And as many critics have already shown — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/opinions/2016/10/24/how-police-censorship-shaped-hollywood/\">including, notably, Alyssa Rosenberg in her in-depth study at the Washington Post</a> — the modern cop show was the result of a close relationship between Hollywood and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"e9RjPc\">The premise of <em>Dragnet</em> was that it was revealing to the world the authentic truth of what it is like to be a police officer, fighting crime. “Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true,” showrunner, star, and narrator Jack Webb promised at the beginning of every episode. And as Webb’s character, the stalwart LAPD detective Joe Friday, went about his work, he was surrounded by real cop cars and real cops acting as extras in the background of his scenes. Famously, the LAPD checked Webb’s scripts for authenticity. </p>\n<p id=\"h0TSR5\">But <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/opinions/2016/10/24/how-police-censorship-shaped-hollywood/\">as Rosenberg laid out</a>, the LAPD’s help came at a cost. Webb submitted every script to the LAPD’s Public Information Division for approval before shooting, and any element they disliked, he would scrap. </p>\n<p id=\"i57I6f\">The politics of Webb’s <em>Dragnet</em> were not neutral. “What <em>Dragnet </em>offered the American public,” as the pop culture scholar Roger Sabin writes in his book <em>Cop Shows</em>, “was a vision of the police force as a ‘stabilizer’ in society, made up of honest men (mostly men) dedicated both to keeping the bad guys in their place, and to the more abstract values of law and order.” <em>Dragnet</em> presented the police to the public the way the police wanted to be seen: as aspirational heroes. </p>\n<p id=\"ltZ7X9\">In 1951, the same year that <em>Dragnet</em> premiered, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Christmas_(1951)\">multiple members of the LAPD assaulted seven civilians</a>, leaving five Latino men and two white men hospitalized with broken bones and ruptured organs. Racially motivated violence against civilians was and still is part of the reality of the police force. But Webb and his collaborators at the LAPD deliberately elided that reality, giving us the fantasy of the hero cop instead.</p>\n<div id=\"szwcox\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0MAfMdRcc3xgL6KDM89ZFX\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div>\n<h3 id=\"2XW0Ch\"></h3>\n<h3 id=\"qHN9ys\">Today, it’s impossible to critique the police procedural without using the genre the police built</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8cImqMrhMVZe29Nqgjs0ScJQWE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9505205/b99.jpg\">\n      <cite>Fox</cite>\n      <figcaption>The cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine: from left, Andre Braugher, Andy Samberg, and Melissa Fumero.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"EfKTru\">After the success of <em>Dragnet</em>, law enforcement departments across the country began setting up eager collaborations with Hollywood, ready to shape the narrative of the police officer in the public’s eyes. <em>Highway Patrol</em> followed quickly in its footsteps, and then <em>F.B.I.</em>,  <em>Columbo</em>, <em>Hawaii Five-0</em>, <em>Hill Street Blues</em>, and the mothership: <em>Law &amp; Order</em> and all the series it would spawn. Today, it’s de rigueur for cop shows to have cop experts on consult, ready to apply a patina of authenticity to the stories Hollywood tells us about police. </p>\n<p id=\"qnjVGt\">It is also de rigueur for some of the 21st century’s cop shows to argue that there are serious problems in contemporary police forces. Not all cop shows choose to critique their systems: <em>Law &amp; Order</em> and its various spinoffs tend to place their unfailing trust in the system. CBS’s <em>Blue Bloods</em> aired an episode in 2014 in which <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2014/12/blue-bloods-starring-tom-selleck-the-nypd-white-viewers-and-black-new-yorkers.html\">a Black suspect throws himself out of a third-floor window</a> to frame a blameless white officer for police brutality, the implication being that criticisms of the existing system do nothing but make life easier for criminals and harder for our heroic boys in blue.</p>\n<p id=\"pjt5gr\">But the 21st-century police shows that tend to be highly critically acclaimed and beloved by liberal audiences, like <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> and <em>The Wire</em>, do try to use their police expertise to critique the institutions in which they take place. <em>The Wire</em> features sympathetic individual cops, but it also depicts police brutality against sympathetic and well-developed civilians, and it argues that police departments are structured to encourage that brutality. And <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> develops much of its conflict by pitting its well-meaning progressive protagonist cops against the more conservative members of the NYPD. </p>\n<aside id=\"S1SPl0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Cop shows won’t just disappear.

And by the time <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> premiered in 2013, gentle criticism of the police as an institution felt like more or less what a respectable liberal viewer could expect from a respectable liberal TV show. The idea that a police show was inherently incapable of being politically progressive barely registered in mainstream criticism. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thrasherxy/status/995281712757268480\">When the journalist and academic Steven Thrasher suggested as much in 2018</a>, calling <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> “some GOOD propaganda,” he faced widespread backlash. </p>\n<p id=\"FVvEj7\">But regardless of whether a police show codes itself as conservative or progressive, the police officer is always the protagonist. He might be troubled, she might be working within a corrupt system and trying to change it from within, but it is always through their eyes that we see the world. And that’s because the police built the genre that we use to talk about them. So today, even shows that are trying to self-reflexively critique the inherent flaws of the cop show find themselves doing so using the framework that the police built.</p>\n<p id=\"xBt9dl\">It’s for that reason that some actors who have played police officers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamstephbeatz/status/1267730471670050823?s=21\">including <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>’s Stephanie Beatriz</a>, began publicly donating to bail relief funds for protesters as calls to defund the police came to dominate headlines in 2020. The donations were an act of restitution for making their living by glamorizing cops. </p>\n<div id=\"vmGbnu\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m an actor who plays a detective on tv. <br><br>If you currently play a cop? <br><br>If you make tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in residuals from playing a cop?<br><br>I’ll let you do the math.

A writer from <em>S.W.A.T.</em> and <em>Chicago P.D.</em> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/dick-wolf-craig-gore-fired-law-and-order-spinoff-controversial-facebook-posts-1234623190/\">was fired from then-forthcoming <em>Law &amp; Order</em> spinoff <em><strong>Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime</strong></em></a> for making social media posts that jokingly threatened protesters.) </p>\n<p id=\"gmdM7O\">Part of the central joke of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> is that Andy Samberg’s character Jake is obsessed with ’70s detective procedurals and that he became a detective because he wanted to be the star of his own TV show. But Jake isn’t any different from the rest of white America in the way he sees the world. We all grew up on cop shows. And we all reflexively know that when we are presented with a cop story, the cop is the hero. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ILOPFu\">What will the future of the cop show look like?</h3>\n<p id=\"dgyzhy\">Pushing back against such a deeply ingrained cultural understanding is difficult. Samberg himself acknowledged as much when he <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/andy-samberg-says-brooklyn-nine-nine-figuring-out-how-to-exist-amid-current-events/\">told People</a> in July 2020 that he and the cast and creative team of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> were “all in touch and kind of discussing how you make a comedy show about police right now, and if we can find a way of doing that that we all feel morally okay about.” Samberg’s co-star Terry Crews had previously said that four unproduced episodes of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> had been scrapped and <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2020/06/23/brooklyn-nine-nine-spoilers-season-8-episodes-police-violence-protests/\">would be rewritten</a>. At the time, the show was between seasons; in February 2021, not long before it went back into production, news broke that <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2021/02/11/brooklyn-nine-nine-ending-season-8-delayed-nbc/\">its upcoming eighth season will be its last</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"Q1htN1\">In the months since the George Floyd protests, different police procedurals have taken different paths in wrestling with this new narrative of the cop show as copaganda. <em>Law &amp; Order: SVU</em> featured an episode where Olivia Benson has to face the question of whether or not she unconsciously racially profiled a suspect. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cops-quietly-resumes-production\"><em>Cops</em> was outright canceled</a> (it went back into production last fall to fulfill overseas obligations). <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/14/cbs-police-shows-black-lives-matter/\">CBS has brought in criminal justice reform advocates</a> to work as consultants on its many police procedurals, in the same way that cop shows have traditionally used police officers as consultants. </p>\n<p id=\"1Fp2vp\">And police officers have reacted to this development in much the same way they did to the Keystone Cops a century ago: with outrage. The new CBS shows “will be stories engineered to further diminish public opinion of police officers,” Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/14/cbs-police-shows-black-lives-matter/\">told the Washington Post last fall</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"SJqFQT\">But if working with new consultants appreciably changes the cop show, it will only be the latest change in a long and fraught evolution.</p>\n<p id=\"dfSHI0\">Cop shows are where America thinks about how we see the police and how we would like to see them. These shows are shaped by our beliefs about the police, and they shape our beliefs in turn. A summer of watching police respond violently to protests against police brutality necessarily changed the way thousands of Americans think about the police — and that, in turn, means the cop shows will have to change, too.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:40:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ia2dBOwuIcWCj76KUwbiXarwUaE=/273x0:2753x1860/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112951/GettyImages_1211486024.0.jpg","linkMd5":"dd0b51606601b534b5008128d1e18491","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-647_05c7b4d89192714c.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":283096,"destBytes":236758,"author":"Constance Grady","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ia2dBOwuIcWCj76KUwbiXarwUaE=/273x0:2753x1860/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112951/GettyImages_1211486024.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-647_05c7b4d89192714c.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgupKF-tRsFxj_C--DnYIul7QjM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015276/headshots_1591132413993.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-13-725_4af7b452d932b18c.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8cImqMrhMVZe29Nqgjs0ScJQWE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9505205/b99.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-13-176_0e2e121c94cb1e16.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245845757},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","title":"Montana lawmakers are pushing misinformation to justify a new assault on wolves","link":"https://www.vox.com/22371558/montana-wolves-hunting-deer-elk-moose","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"An illustration of howling wolves and a map of Montana.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzwzPfALgJhtMuYeasPOdANAnfQ=/428x0:4428x3000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113168/greywolves_draft.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Amanda Northrop/Vox</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n  <p>Four new hunting bills in the Big Sky State are reigniting a centuries-old debate.</p> <p id=\"9oFtay\">Late this winter, Greg Gianforte, Montana’s recently elected Republican governor, trapped and shot a male wolf just outside the boundary of Yellowstone National Park at a private ranch owned by his pal Robert E. Smith, a director of the conservative Sinclair Broadcasting Group (a former campaign donor).</p>\n<p id=\"ImGzA1\">Hunting wolves is legal in Montana, and Gianforte later told the <a href=\"https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/gianforte-says-he-made-mistake-trapping-wolf-without-certification-class/article_220c5e44-4f02-516f-a8db-210a1fcbb0c4.html\">Helena Independent Record</a> that he’d been after one for five years. “I put a lot of time in over many, many years and not every sportsman is fortunate to ultimately harvest a wolf,” said Gianforte, who added that he planned to mount it on his wall. </p>\n<p id=\"Kc2j95\">Not everyone who initially knew about the governor’s trophy was impressed, apparently. In the weeks after the hunt, someone <a href=\"https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/montana-governor-given-written-warning-after-trapping-killing-yellowstone-wolf#stream/0\">tipped off a reporter</a> with the Mountain West News Bureau that not only had the governor killed one of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/wolves.htm#:~:text=An%20estimated%20528%20wolves%20resided,94%20wolves%20in%20the%20park.\">94 wolves</a> that frequent Yellowstone, but he’d also failed to comply with a state regulation requiring hunters take a wolf-trapping course before catching an animal. </p>\n<p id=\"uJrxFw\">Nate Hegyi, the bureau reporter, also learned that the wolf had a name, “1155.” It had worn a radio collar <a href=\"https://missoulacurrent.com/outdoors/2021/03/gianforte-wolf-2/\">since 2018</a> when National Park Service biologists began to track his movements in and out of the park. </p>\n<p id=\"XKTeMV\">The timing of the governor’s hunting protocol gaffe was disconcerting to conservationists already worried about the fate of Montana’s wolves. Gianforte, the first Republican governor in 16 years, would soon be deciding on several hunter-friendly bills to relax restrictions on killing wolves. </p>\n<p id=\"JKHxhA\">The argument behind those bills — which seek to legalize a range of new hunting methods and offer reimbursement to trappers for their expenses — is that wolves in Montana are killing too many game species like elk and deer, which people like to hunt. As of 2019, there were almost 1,200 wolves in Montana, according to the state’s Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Department. (The agency hasn’t yet released numbers for 2020.)</p>\n<p id=\"quHj32\">“Wolf numbers need to be reduced,” Paul Fielder, a Republican state representative behind two of the four bills, told Vox. One of them legalizes the use of snares, which catch and choke animals to death.</p>\n<p id=\"1glbAN\">“Allowing the snaring of wolves in Montana by licensed trappers will give wildlife managers another tool to reduce wolf numbers — especially in areas where ungulate populations are stressed by wolves,” Fielder said at a state hearing in February. </p>\n<p id=\"1Mz0Au\">There’s just one problem: This isn’t true. Parks department data doesn’t indicate that hoofed wildlife populations are stressed by wolves. Many wildlife biologists — and even the Montana Wildlife Federation, a pro-hunting conservation group — agree. </p>\n<p id=\"QjxpK6\">“The truth is, we have record numbers of elk in the state of Montana, including in areas with wolves,” said Nick Gevock, the federation’s conservation director. What’s more, critics of the bills say hunting methods like snares are cruel and indiscriminate. </p>\n<p id=\"LQ83t1\">On this highly charged issue with a complex history, the governor appears sympathetic to wolf hunters, many of whom have ties to his party. Gianforte recently <a href=\"https://mtstandard.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/gianforte-signs-bills-allowing-wolf-snaring-extended-seasons/article_98ab3a5e-2cee-51df-8f1a-3b9db6716f85.html\">signed</a> Fielder’s two wolf bills into law. </p>\n<p id=\"AkAq0P\">“I think trapping is an important tool for predator control and for wildlife management,” he told the Independent Record in March. “I’m proud to be a trapper.” </p>\n<p id=\"XZHYfa\">But the wolf debate doesn’t seem to have much to do with science-based management. Instead, it comes down to how people view wolves across the state — and how their politics inform those views.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orLTQAzjP-z6o4yrwDKN4rBXtGY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433408/wolf_secondary.jpg\">\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"Gn8a4a\">The rise and fall and rise of the gray wolf, briefly explained</h3>\n<p id=\"ephYhg\">Indigenous communities had, of course, been living with wolves for centuries before European settlers arrived. </p>\n<p id=\"O9erHL\">“Traditionally, in the tribal views, when you look upon wolves, we look at them as kin, as helpers,” Letara Lebau, a resident of Wyoming’s Wind River Indian Reservation, said last October during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1lBoSopPI\">presentation</a> about human-carnivore coexistence. “We really look at the wolves as deserving of respect.”</p>\n<p id=\"5S6Wvi\">Settlers and their early descendants held a vastly different view. </p>\n<p id=\"RFfaSF\">They saw wolves as villains that posed a threat to valuable livestock. And so in the 19th and 20th centuries, the US led a campaign to exterminate them. It was <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/home/feature/2007/gray_wolf_factsheet-region2-rev.pdf\">wildly effective</a>: By the mid-20th century, only two populations of wolves remained in the lower 48 states. </p>\n<p id=\"OOSwMh\">In the decades that followed, we learned about the animal’s integral role in ecosystems — a fact Indigenous people already knew — causing attitudes toward the predator to shift. What started as a campaign to eradicate wolves became a campaign to save them. And in 1974, they were added to the newly minted Endangered Species Act, setting the stage for their recovery. </p>\n<p id=\"pe8J74\">Twenty years later, that recovery got a huge boost: Biologists reintroduced <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/wolf-restoration.htm#:~:text=Wolves%20arrived%20in%20Yellowstone%20National,truck%20on%20January%2012%2C%201995.&amp;text=In%20the%201800s%2C%20westward%20expansion,native%20predator%20and%20prey%20species.\">31 gray wolves from Canada</a> into Yellowstone National Park (and some more into Idaho). It remains one of the most significant moments in the history of carnivore conservation in the US. </p>\n<p id=\"KyKItD\">The recovery worked, and Montana was central to its success. By 2009, there were enough breeding pairs for the wolf to be delisted in Montana and in a few other regions, though the wolf remained on the federal ESA for another decade. (The <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-returns-management-and-protection-gray-wolves-states-and-tribes\">Trump administration delisted it</a> last year, much to the chagrin of environmental groups, citing a “successful recovery.”)</p>\n<p id=\"hz4f1n\">“The restoration of the gray wolf in the Northern Rockies is arguably the most successful wildlife reintroduction in United States history,” said Gevock. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ot_dFd_yul6CWSv26IWbmPrl3z4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433736/pDhU1_estimated_wolf_population_in_montana_nbsp___1_.png\">\n      <cite>Tim Williams/Vox</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"rvkmai\">It’s still not easy to stumble upon a gray wolf in Montana — there are about 1,160 of the animals across the Big Sky State, just a fraction of their historic population. Yet the number is safely above the federally mandated minimum, set at 15 breeding pairs and 150 wolves. </p>\n<p id=\"fW4CeH\">Fielder, the state representative who sponsored the two bills that Gianforte signed and a retired wildlife biologist, says that to maintain 15 breeding pairs you need about 285 wolves, because not all packs have breeding pairs. So, in his view, 1,160 is way too many. </p>\n<h3 id=\"UoET21\">Critics say the anti-wolf bills hearken back to the extermination campaign </h3>\n<p id=\"nqTicK\">The bills, in short, would make it easier to kill more wolves. </p>\n<p id=\"U02zN8\"><a href=\"https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/SB0267.pdf\">One of them</a>, sponsored by State Sen. Bob Brown, would provide reimbursement for trapping expenses — which critics call a bounty. The Senate bill is currently making its way through the House. </p>\n<p id=\"2hVgxl\">“Montana’s territorial legislature first offered a wolf bounty in <a href=\"https://mhs.mt.gov/research/collections/newspapers/extra/wolves#:~:text=Key%20dates,bounty%20for%20a%20full%20wolfskin.\">1883</a>, and the goal was to reduce the wolf population,” said Jennifer Sherry, an environmental scientist and wildlife advocate at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. “Here we are over 100 years later talking again about the need for a wolf bounty to reduce the wolf population.”</p>\n<p id=\"Ej6sPY\"><a href=\"https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/SB0314.pdf\">Another bill</a>, also sponsored by Brown, allows individual hunters to shoot an unlimited number of wolves and legalizes nighttime hunting using spotlights that temporarily blind the animals, with the intent of reducing the wolf population. Brown did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p id=\"ZE5caQ\">The other bills — both of which Fielder sponsored and the governor signed — extend the trapping season and allow hunters to use snares. (Montana allows for the snaring of some other animals, including bobcats.) </p>\n<p id=\"AQPbUB\">The reasoning that Fielder and Brown use to justify their bills is simple: Wolves in some parts of the state are eviscerating deer, elk, and moose populations. “Wildlife is suffering,” Fielder said in the hearing. </p>\n<p id=\"5YGftj\">But the data tells a different story. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzaexjJg2OgKia_JwGKAAKQtB60=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431934/elk_secondary.jpg\">\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"uvpDDo\">Elk and most other game species are doing just fine across Montana — and throughout the West</h3>\n<p id=\"WTSHvo\">“The numbers don’t add up,” Sherry said. “Elk numbers are consistently strong across the state. Hunter success rates are consistently strong.” </p>\n<p id=\"LPK2K6\">In fact, the number of deer and elk killed by hunters across Montana has actually gone up overall in the past decade, according to Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Department hunting estimates.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJG3T-MSlVKHVnWoXOL3FsQwKd4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433753/SaKfO_elk_killings_by_hunters_in_montana__4_.png\">\n      <cite>Tim Williams/Vox</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"pMH7NA\">“These are good times for elk hunters, as Montana elk populations continue to be strong across most of the state,” said the agency’s <a href=\"https://fwp-brm.mt.gov/buy-and-apply/news/2020-big-game-hunting-forecast#:~:text=White%2Dtailed%20deer%20densities%20continue,2019%20survey%20of%209%20percent\">2020 hunting forecast</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"mT2VZw\">Moose are an exception — their numbers are trending down — but there’s no evidence that wolves are to blame. The state commissioned a <a href=\"https://fwp.mt.gov/binaries/content/assets/fwp/montana-outdoors/moose.pdf\">10-year study</a> in 2013 to pinpoint a culprit.</p>\n<p id=\"OkXnq0\">“Despite widespread speculation that adult moose are being killed by wolves and other carnivores, the study shows that the main culprits are health related,” Tom Dickson, the editor of the parks department’s newsletter<em>, </em><a href=\"https://fwp.mt.gov/binaries/content/assets/fwp/montana-outdoors/moose.pdf\">wrote</a> in 2019, in reference to the study.</p>\n<p id=\"QC3hDi\">Fielder, however, argues that the problem is most severe in western Montana — where wolves are, by far, most abundant. But again, the evidence is sparse to tie the predator to any ungulate decline. </p>\n<p id=\"i5cChh\">If you zero in on the northwest, home to the highest densities of wolves, you find that deer kills by licensed hunters have hovered around 2,000 a year for more than a decade (though they were much higher if you go back to 2004), according to parks department data. And while elk harvest numbers have fluctuated, there doesn’t seem to be a clear downward trend in the last decade either. </p>\n<p id=\"4Izpt4\">“White-tailed deer numbers have been on an upward trend in general,” the hunting forecast says about deer in the West.</p>\n<p id=\"Z98PPs\">Not surprisingly, the number of moose killed by hunters in the northwest is falling, but again, that may not have much to do with wolves. For one, the population of wolves isn’t growing, at least through 2019, the most recent year for which there’s data; it’s actually about the same as it was a decade ago. Plus, there are several other factors that shape the population of game animals, including forest fires and weather. </p>\n<p id=\"1KAkEP\">“Fire and winter have a much more significant impact than all the predators combined,” said Diane Boyd, a renowned wolf biologist and former parks department wolf specialist in Northwest Montana. Prey have other predators, too, such as bears and mountain lions.</p>\n<p id=\"yIBjK1\">Parks department spokesperson Greg Lemon said the agency provided information to the legislature but declined to comment on aspects of the legislation.  </p>\n<p id=\"tSLwaV\">“We find these bills to be based on misinformation about wildlife, misinformation about the effects of predators on prey species, and a lack of understanding about the complexity of natural environments in Montana,” residents and wildlife biologists, including Boyd and 16 former parks department employees, wrote in a March 16 letter to the state legislature and governor. “These bills are not based on science.” (Fielder disputes this claim.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"TAClPO\">So if the bills aren’t based on science, what are they based on? </h3>\n<p id=\"6ijGGi\">That’s a more challenging question to answer. Boyd, a hunter herself, pointed to politics. Far-right conservatism has surged in the last few years, she said, emboldening lawmakers with anti-wolf views. The stance among some conservatives on issues like gun and property rights often conflict with wildlife protections, she added. </p>\n<p id=\"0FF8TG\">But the relationship between<strong> </strong>far-right ideology, which flourished in the US in the Trump years, and wolf conservation isn’t so clear cut. One survey from 2012 found that while hunters <a href=\"https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Wildlife/Sportsmen/2012PollSlides.ashx\">tend to lean</a> Republican or Independent, and support gun rights, they also highly value conservation and access to the outdoors. To say conservative values are aligned with these bills would be an oversimplification. </p>\n<p id=\"WDIkoV\">“We’re really not sure why this extreme anti-wolf sentiment is here,” Gevock said, adding that he believes much of it comes from far-western Montana. Both Brown and Fielder hail from Thompson Falls, a small town about two hours northwest of Missoula. </p>\n<p id=\"mInZcj\">Others say the new push to kill wolves with more brutal measures is rooted in antiquated views of these predators. Some influential lawmakers simply don’t believe in the inherent value of wolves, said Mike Phillips, a retired Democratic state senator and director of the Turner Endangered Species Fund, who was involved in reintroducing wolves in Yellowstone. </p>\n<h3 id=\"CmxMKe\">All four bills are likely to become law, but that doesn’t mean Montana’s wolves are headed off a cliff</h3>\n<p id=\"u1Y0wb\">Gianforte has already signed two of the wolf bills, another is headed to his desk, and the fourth is still going through the legislature. Gevock says all four bills are likely to become law, whether or not Gianforte puts his signature on them. </p>\n<p id=\"Ry8zvc\">“The governor will carefully consider any bill that the legislature sends to his desk,” Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement to Vox. </p>\n<p id=\"B5LVgQ\">But as Gevock and others point out, that doesn’t necessarily mean wolves are imperiled across the state, even if their numbers fall. As history has demonstrated, wolves are highly resilient animals.</p>\n<p id=\"koicVJ\">“Wolves are a very elastic species, meaning they can take some pretty extreme measures and survive,” Gevock said. “Yes, we will kill more wolves, but they can bounce back quickly. They can take a pretty aggressive hunt.” </p>\n<p id=\"lRA35A\">What’s harder to stomach, at least for Phillips, is what he calls a “disregard for life.”</p>\n<p id=\"QNA6Xa\">“This is a moment defined by people of authority who don’t value large carnivores much at all,” Phillips said. “Why would we ever sanction needless killing?” </p>\n<p id=\"6W2Og0\">  </p>\n<p id=\"17wGxv\"></p>\n<p id=\"pY4YIB\"></p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:20:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzwzPfALgJhtMuYeasPOdANAnfQ=/428x0:4428x3000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113168/greywolves_draft.0.jpg","linkMd5":"46ee2fb7606ccbb105ecc8e4af3caeb2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-755_9bdefe2e776fd2ed.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":103073,"destBytes":71386,"author":"Benji Jones","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzwzPfALgJhtMuYeasPOdANAnfQ=/428x0:4428x3000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113168/greywolves_draft.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-755_9bdefe2e776fd2ed.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orLTQAzjP-z6o4yrwDKN4rBXtGY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433408/wolf_secondary.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-323_2d77f39f6c4e1417.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ot_dFd_yul6CWSv26IWbmPrl3z4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433736/pDhU1_estimated_wolf_population_in_montana_nbsp___1_.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn89@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-13-449_5ecc1fe50a5a9c58.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzaexjJg2OgKia_JwGKAAKQtB60=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431934/elk_secondary.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn88@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-12-979_d48320e378ad26b8.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJG3T-MSlVKHVnWoXOL3FsQwKd4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433753/SaKfO_elk_killings_by_hunters_in_montana__4_.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-591_abf9c1e45c62fa4b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245845755},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","title":"The “natural-born citizen” ceiling","link":"https://www.vox.com/22379697/natural-born-citizen-immigrants-president","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Ted Lieu at a judiciary committee hearing on impeachment. \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52LbCCkB9JRgcIffqnpKbHtl6zg=/334x0:5667x4000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113234/1187432318.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Rep.

By 1:10 pm that day, after former President Donald Trump issued his call for thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol, anyone who was paying attention knew that something dangerous was about to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"q99M7D\">Within a matter of minutes, at the other end of the National Mall, a Capitol police officer banged on the door of Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA). “You need to evacuate immediately,” Lieu recalls the officer saying before urging him to remove the lapel pin that identified him as a member of Congress and directing him down five flights of stairs to a secure location.</p>\n<p id=\"5NHhw6\">From that room, as Lieu and Reps. David Cicilline (D-RI) and Jamie Raskin (D-MD) witnessed the events, they decided that they had to draft an article of impeachment right then and there. </p>\n<p id=\"EL8H7A\">By 3:09 pm, Lieu had seen enough. He sent a text message to every Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee to start gathering support: “If we don’t do anything besides send strongly worded press releases, then we are complicit in battering lady justice and our Constitution,” the text <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-13/sheltering-in-a-capitol-office-a-california-lawmakers-frantic-text-got-the-impeachment-ball-rolling\">read</a>. Before they left the Capitol that night, the recipients of that text had resoundingly agreed to impeach Trump again.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"EVppte\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"bbEYT6\">Lieu ultimately served as an impeachment manager, laying out the constitutional provisions and principles that he argued should disqualify Trump from ever again holding the presidency as the trial unfolded in Congress and in the court of public opinion. But among the nine impeachment managers, Lieu stood alone as the only one who would not be allowed to hold that office under the Constitution’s natural-born citizen requirement in Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"2r0I8T\">That constitutional clause requires that anyone holding the presidency be born a citizen of the United States — either born on US territory or, if born abroad, the child of at least one US citizen. Tens of millions of immigrants who live in the United States, including 18 who serve in Congress, are thus categorically disqualified from holding the country’s highest office. Never amended since the Constitution’s adoption, the clause implies that naturalized Americans, who affirmatively chose to be part of this country, are inherently unsuited as stewards of its political institutions while those born on US soil are automatically better ones.</p>\n<p id=\"rps1Yv\">But in the aftermath of the Capitol insurrection, it was those would-be disloyal subjects who foregrounded their immigrant experiences to make the nation confront the high stakes of letting democracy slip away. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2021/01/pramila-jayapal-surviving-capitol-riots.html\">told</a> the Cut, after contracting Covid-19 while being in close contact with maskless Republican members of Congress that, as “an immigrant woman of color,” she understood that this event “was going to be terrible and consequential. And that it would not be fixable quickly.”</p>\n<div class=\"p-fullbleed-block\"><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Rep.

Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2014. Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria, spurred a brief flurry of interest in removing the natural-born citizen clause.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"ELuMPn\">Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, said the insurrection reminded him of Kristallnacht, the night the Nazis in Germany torched synagogues, vandalized Jewish-owned homes and businesses, and killed close to 100 Jews as Adolf Hitler consolidated power in 1938. “Wednesday was the ‘day of broken glass’ right here in the United States,” the Austrian-born actor said in a Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1348249481284874240\">video</a> that has been watched close to 40 million times. The insurrectionists “did not just break down the doors of the building that housed American democracy,” he said. “They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded.”</p>\n<p id=\"KOOpfP\">Those who incited and directed this insurrection, meanwhile, would face no constitutional bar to becoming president. Nor would natural-born citizens, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/01/ted-cruz-and-josh-hawley-arent-sorry\">denounced</a> the violence but opposed efforts to hold Trump accountable while downplaying their own roles in firing up the riotous mob. </p>\n<p id=\"NQ2Pgk\">As the country tries to make sense of the attack with a sweeping congressional investigation <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/25/house-review-jan6-insurrection-478108\">launched</a> March 25, many now question exactly how to define loyalty to the republic and the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"asaw6z\">“Where you happen to be born,” Lieu told me in an interview, “is irrelevant to how much you love America and whether you are a patriot.” And yet, the Constitution restricts nearly <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/\">21 million naturalized citizens</a> (and 25 million other foreign-born US residents who may at some point gain citizenship) from running for the presidency.</p>\n<p id=\"TnNyLE\">The Framers gave the country a constitutional architecture that presumes patriotism from a segment of the population, whose only reason for pledging allegiance to the flag is the accident of birth. This is the immigrant loyalty paradox.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ZShb9n\">Equating birthplace with allegiance dates back to feudal times </h3>\n<p id=\"3SB40J\">Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution explicitly states that “no Person except a natural born Citizen […] shall be eligible to the Office of President,” among other age and residency requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"905ocd\">The clause has been the subject of much contemporary <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2016/1/14/10772734/is-ted-cruz-citizen\">debate</a> since Trump peddled false, racist conspiracies about former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate in the run-up to the 2008 election. Similar baseless doubts have been raised about Cruz’s qualifications given his birth in Canada to an American mother, and more recently, about whether Kamala Harris could <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902362014/trump-and-his-campaign-amplify-birther-conspiracy-against-kamala-harris\">hold</a> the vice presidency as the daughter of immigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"p1vfso\">The Supreme Court has stated that properly understood, the definition of “natural-born” covers anybody who was a US citizen at birth, meaning they did not have to go through naturalization at a later time. In the 1898 case <em>United States v. Wong Kim Ark</em>, the Court explained that, in British common law, “natural-born British subject” meant “a British subject who has become a British subject at the moment of his birth. […] Any person who (whatever the nationality of his parents) is born within the British dominions is a natural-born British subject.” </p>\n<p id=\"yvlpZL\">Because the Court adopted this definition, it has never had to rule on the issue of an immigrant president — even if the prospective commander in chief had lived here the overwhelming majority of their life. </p>\n<p id=\"6Ib4Ru\">Lieu, for instance, was born in Taiwan but arrived in Cleveland, Ohio, with his family when he was three years old, first taking up residence in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ted-lieu-is-out-tweeting-trump-and-its-making-him-a-political-star/2017/03/30/a087d670-fec2-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html\">basement of a woman’s home</a> as his parents cobbled together a livelihood reselling flea market purchases. The sole accident of his birth disqualifies him from ever rising to the country’s highest office.</p>\n<p id=\"RD5ei8\">The idea that Lieu might be more loyal to Taiwan, which he left as a young child, than to the country where he was educated, trained as a lawyer, and has served for years as a public servant, might seem absurd in 2021. But birthplace has long been seen as synonymous with loyalty, going to ancient concepts of British common law, said Stephanie DeGooyer, a Burkhardt fellow at the University of California Los Angeles and the co-author of “<a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2424-the-right-to-have-rights\">The Right to Have Rights</a>.”</p>\n<p id=\"tQAQVu\">In 1608, the King’s Bench in England issued a seminal decision in <em>Calvin’s Case</em>, establishing that a person who was born in Scotland after the unification of the crowns of England and Scotland was a subject of the British king and entitled to all the benefits of English law. </p>\n<p id=\"XnM8mo\">“Before we’re talking about citizenship, we’re really talking about allegiance to the prince or the crown … and they’re obligated to be responsible for you,” DeGooyer told Vox. In feudal times, allegiance mattered because it determined which lands an individual could own — and in <em>Calvin’s Case</em>, inherit. But it also cut the other way, she said, determining which individuals received protection from the king. </p>\n<p id=\"21Il5C\">However, the intent of the Framers does not seem to have been to exclude individuals with a demonstrated commitment to American systems of government. Rather, their preoccupation was with the control of the US military by a foreign commander. “Permit me to hint,” John Jay wrote in a letter to George Washington during the Constitutional Convention of 1787, “whether it would not be wise &amp; seasonable … to declare expresly that the Command in chief of the American army shall not be given to, nor devolve on, any but a natural <em>born</em> Citizen.” If the president had no other allegiances, their logic went, the US Army could not be directed to act against any other interests <em>but</em> American ones.</p>\n<p id=\"LXmXeS\">But the security failures at the Capitol highlight that a natural-born president, too, can have other interests that the military can be commanded to serve. On March 3, DC National Guard chief William Walker <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/973292523/dod-took-hours-to-approve-national-guard-request-during-capitol-riot-commander-s\">told</a> senators that the Pentagon’s top brass delayed the approval of military assistance to the Capitol Police because “they didn’t like the optics” and the presence of uniformed troops would “inflame” the rioters. </p>\n<p id=\"m3vO3k\">It was in those three hours and 19 minutes of delay that Capitol Police shot Ashli Babbitt as she tried to enter the Speaker’s Lobby.</p>\n<h3 id=\"skih8w\">Ideas about citizenship have evolved, but the Constitution hasn’t</h3>\n<p id=\"eSeu43\">The association of birthplace with loyalty is what underlies US <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlh/vol9/iss1/2/\">birthright citizenship</a>, a concept that Trump sharply <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/31/18047964/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-14th-amendment\">criticized</a> as president despite his father being its <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/donald-trump-father-mother-ancestry\">beneficiary</a>. By the 19th century, however, modern nation states began instituting their own methods of becoming a citizen other than through birthright, according to DeGooyer. </p>\n<p id=\"iyNHZL\">“We’ve long accepted that you can change allegiances and change citizenships,” she said. “But what we remain attached to is the feudalistic thinking about perpetual allegiance — that you can only be under one.” Even if an American acquires citizenship from another country, the allegiance at birth still predominates: For instance, natural-born Americans who later become dual citizens are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2020/10/28/time-for-new-rules-in-washington-dealing-with-dual-citizenship/?sh=1e19aa256fe8\">not barred</a> from the presidency.</p>\n<p id=\"3TL0BI\">“Why should somebody just born here have an automatic higher sense of belonging or loyalty than somebody who begins that journey at five?” DeGooyer asked.</p>\n<p id=\"MSKEFj\">This suspicion of immigrants’ “true loyalties” has permeated our politics throughout time. <a href=\"https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/birthright-citizens-a-history-of-race-and-rights-in-antebellum-america-by-martha-s-jones\">Debates</a> about what precisely birthright citizenship entails predate the Civil War. Asian Americans, who themselves have been the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22336317/atlanta-georgia-shootings-racism-misogyny-targeting-asian-women\">targets</a> of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/31/983273270/san-francisco-man-who-threatened-asian-woman-in-bakery-arrested-for-hate-crime\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/nyregion/asian-attack-nyc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">violence</a>, have withstood being characterized as threats to the nation throughout history. During World War II, US officials segregated Japanese Americans in internment camps using <a href=\"https://www.du.edu/behindbarbedwire/loyalty_questions.html\">loyalty questionnaires</a> that asked respondents to “swear unqualified allegiance to the United States” and “forswear any form of allegiance or disobedience to the Japanese Emperor.”</p>\n<p id=\"FFVAEn\">More recently, immigrant public servants have faced attacks to their loyalty because of this distinction, primarily from Trump and his supporters. Ukrainian-born Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, known for his role in the first impeachment of Trump, was smeared after his testimony because of his heritage. </p>\n<p id=\"4mcwOb\">After his October 29, 2019, hearing in the House, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani tweeted: “A US gov. employee who has reportedly been advising two gov’s? No wonder he is confused and feels pressure.” Vindman and his family escaped from the Soviet Union as Jewish refugees when he was 3, and the “dual loyalty” charge has been historically deployed as an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/jews-disloyal-trump.html\">anti-Semitic dog whistle</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"p-fullbleed-block\"><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Rep.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN), a refugee of Somalia’s civil war, for telling “us how to run our country,” though she had been elected to do exactly that. </p>\n<p id=\"B5yv9K\">And even before the most recent bout of far-right xenophobia, immigrant politicians have had to make their loyalties resoundingly clear to avoid having their judgment questioned. In March 2000, while visiting her native Czech Republic, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had to publicly turn down an overture from then-President Vaclav Havel to succeed him as head of state.</p>\n<p id=\"qmeYHO\">“I am not a candidate and will not be a candidate. […] My heart is in two places, but America is where I belong,” Albright <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/03/08/havel-has-an-albright-idea/1d4d9b5d-9504-429e-b4e8-2eff111a8615/\">said</a> in a televised interview next to Havel, adding that while she felt “an unshakable pride in my native land,” she also had “an unshatterable commitment to my adopted one.”</p>\n<p id=\"6IUhC5\">At the US State Department, however, Asian American diplomats have been restricted from assignments in foreign countries of their heritage to “lessen foreign influence,” according to an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/18/asian-americans-state-department-477106\">internal policy manual</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MCjzmJ\">The immigrant caucus remains excluded as some call for change </h3>\n<p id=\"KcbChW\">An entire generation of high-ranking public officials have been denied the opportunity to run for president because of their status as naturalized citizens. Among them are obvious rising stars, such as Lieu, Jayapal, Omar, Indian-born former US District Attorney Preet Bharara and Japanese-born Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI).</p>\n<p id=\"xXCkGK\">But the last time the political class had any serious interest in passing an amendment to allow immigrants to run for president, it was from the Republican side. In 2003, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2011/04/28/arnold_amendment_foreign_born/\">introduced</a> an amendment to remove that obstacle from the Constitution, calling it “an anachronism that is decidedly un-American.” Instead, it would have required candidates to have been naturalized for 20 years and residents for 14.</p>\n<p id=\"LIxVbb\">At the time, Schwarzenegger, Gov. Jennifer Granholm (R-MI), and even former Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao were seen as the amendment’s most immediate beneficiaries. (Some even dubbed it “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-arnold-amendment/\">the Arnold Amendment</a>.”) The effort eventually <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2004/05/19/hatch-puts-hold-on-arnold-08/\">fizzled</a> out, and in 2016 a CBS News <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-should-us-presidents-be-natural-born/\">poll</a> found that only 21 percent of Americans supported a constitutional change.</p>\n<p id=\"v8Ojy8\">More recently, some <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/columnists/will_bunch/mazie-hirono-profile-kavanaugh-confirmation-can-immigrant-run-for-president-20181004.html\">opinion columnists</a> and law professors have also pushed for change. Harvard Law’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-04-24/end-the-natural-born-citizen-requirement-for-presidents\">Noah Feldman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/09/18/immigrants-president-repeal-natural-born-citizen-clause-column/5805710002/\">Randall Kennedy</a> have advocated for repealing the natural-born citizen requirement, arguing that it would send a pro-immigration message to combat xenophobia. Besides, these commentators argue, this requirement does not apply to any other high political offices in Congress or the judiciary. </p>\n<p id=\"sWvfH0\">Lieu put it this way: “What makes America great is that we judge you on your character — not on your bloodline, or your last name, or your race or ethnicity or gender.”</p>\n<p id=\"Xz6Vi4\">Kevin Walsh, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law and former clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, took these efforts a step further in 2019. After publishing a law review <a href=\"https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2522&amp;context=law-faculty-publications\">article</a> proposing an “’Irish Born’ One American Citizenship Amendment,” he also sent letters to the offices of Republican Sens. Mike Lee (Utah), Mitt Romney (Utah), Ben Sasse (Nebraska), John Cornyn (Texas), and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In a 2019 email exchange, he shared a set of “FAQs” that he forwarded to those offices advocating the change.</p>\n<p id=\"6nqfhy\">“Any proposed constitutional amendment must overcome a powerful status quo bias,” Walsh wrote. “This amendment will also need to overcome the opposition of ‘blood and soil’ white nationalists. It’s worth picking a fight with such people. Patriots hold the high ground here, not nativists.”</p>\n<p id=\"Hum2ob\">It is unclear if Republicans responded privately to this proposal, and Walsh did not respond to requests for comment from Vox.</p>\n<p id=\"Svcucr\">The Democratic majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee would likely be amenable to a similar proposal today. Still, any amendment would require a virtually unachievable two-thirds majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, or approval in a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.</p>\n<p id=\"86E9Vl\">Hirono, the only immigrant in the Senate, sits on that committee, and she recognizes a subtler equalizing effect of the <em>Wong Kim Ark</em> decision. In a copy of her forthcoming memoir obtained by Vox, Hirono writes that this decision “established the Fourteenth Amendment as overriding existing naturalization law, thereby nullifying constraints on non-whites becoming citizens.” </p>\n<p id=\"AUGQxT\">Hirono, of course, was also forced to evacuate the Senate floor during the siege on the Capitol, kept in a secure location and told not to share details with family and friends who wanted to know if she was safe. “I did not doubt that if the insurrectionists found any of us, they would physically hurt us,” she writes.</p>\n<p id=\"tEvQNg\">Unlike Trump, Hirono had to take the Oath of Allegiance in 1959 upon becoming a US citizen, pledging to “defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The Capitol overrun, she could not help but think that this domestic attack could have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"CpK87t\">“As I contemplated the sorry end to what had been an unremittingly disastrous presidency,” she writes, “I lamented, not for the first time, how much carnage would have been avoided if only Republicans had been brave enough to remove the corrupt president from office during his first impeachment trial.”</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"emd3eU\">\n<p id=\"F3PmbP\"><em>Jesus A.

Intact ecosystems also play a major role in mitigating climate change.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac22I7\">As conservationists have recognized the importance of protecting rich ecosystems before they’re bulldozed, drained, deforested, or abandoned, “30 by 30” has become a rallying call for the movement’s most influential organizations, political leaders, and advocates. </p>\n<p id=\"maA34L\">“This effort goes to the heart of our mission to protect the wonder of our world,” Jill Tiefenthaler, CEO of the National Geographic Society, a group backing the target, said in a <a href=\"http://ourdailyplanet.com/story/interview-of-the-week-jill-tiefenthaler-ceo-national-geographic-society/\">2020 interview</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"9GckjW\">So, what makes 30 percent the magic number? Is it some kind of biological threshold, above which nature will flourish and we will avert total ecological collapse? </p>\n<p id=\"YJrrab\">Not exactly. </p>\n<p id=\"l5fUxe\">As it turns out, “there’s no scientific basis for 30 percent,” Eric Dinerstein, the lead author of a <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/4/eaaw2869\">widely referenced academic paper</a>, “A Global Deal for Nature,” which calls for putting 30 percent of land in protected areas, told Vox.<strong> </strong>“It’s arbitrary.” (Disclosure: I briefly worked with Dinerstein several years ago when I was a research analyst at the World Resources Institute.)</p>\n<p id=\"F0F9kV\">Given the urgency of the situation, there’s an acute tension around how ambitious to be in conservation goal-setting. Often, targets laid out by scientists are at odds with what governments will find palatable. And for any goal to be successful, for that matter, many argue the world needs a new paradigm for conservation altogether — one that doesn’t exclude Indigenous people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"OqtPLt\">Why targets for protecting land and oceans are essential</h3>\n<p id=\"mNj66v\">As the human population has expanded, we’ve destroyed all kinds of habitats to construct housing, extract commodities like timber or gold, and grow food. That’s left us with rapidly shrinking patches of intact ecosystems that can — and do — support biodiversity, but with a fading effect. </p>\n<p id=\"6nJUSb\">To avert catastrophe, we’ll need to roll back that pattern and dedicate more land to support healthy, functioning ecosystems. And long ago, the conservation movement realized that to get there, countries would need to push each other to both make and keep commitments. </p>\n<p id=\"xghJ0Q\">There are existing targets for the coverage of protected areas, set under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). CBD is an intergovernmental agreement, much like the Paris Agreement, but for biodiversity. In 2010, it set a number of conservation <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/\">targets</a> — including those that called<strong> </strong>for the protection of 17 percent of global land and 10 percent of oceans by 2020. </p>\n<p id=\"fXORjU\">The reality, however, is that those smaller percentages simply aren’t enough, said Brian O’Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature, a group spearheading the global 30 by 30 push. (The group is funded by the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss and works in partnership with the National Geographic Society.)</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yE_SjuaRE2Qc38nJ2OFFuzhrX0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430570/GettyImages_598597392.jpg\">\n      <cite>Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the Hawaiian Islands region, seen from Air Force One. Protections for this deepwater habitat were expanded by President Obama in 2016.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"p3jpBZ\">30 by 30 is by no means the first effort to protect a large chunk of Earth for the sake of biodiversity. In his 2016 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Half-Earth-Our-Planets-Fight-Life/dp/1631492527\"><em>Half-Earth</em></a><em>, </em>renowned ecologist Edward O. Wilson argued that “only by committing half of the planet’s surface to nature can we hope to save the immensity of life-forms that compose it.” (The concept of protecting 50 percent of the planet emerged <a href=\"https://naturebeyond2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Woodley-et-al-Targets-PARKS-25.2-proof-3.pdf\">decades earlier</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"uGwFi2\">But 30 by 30 <em>is</em> the first effort of its kind to gain such broad support. </p>\n<p id=\"7Tusfe\">While the target has been kicked around for years, it reached a milestone in January when a coalition of more than 50 countries led by Costa Rica, France, and the UK, called the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, <a href=\"https://www.hacfornatureandpeople.org/\">announced a commitment</a> to 30 by 30. </p>\n<p id=\"L3p9Mt\">“We know there is no pathway to tackling climate change that does not involve a massive increase in our efforts to protect and restore nature,” said Zac Goldsmith, the UK’s minister for Pacific and the environment, <a href=\"https://www.hacfornatureandpeople.org/50-countries-announce-bold-commitment-to-protect-at-least-30-of-the-worlds-land-and-ocean-by-2030\">when the commitment was announced</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"y46Qek\">The US is notably not part of that pact. But in his first full week in office, President Joe Biden signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/\">a sweeping climate-related executive action</a> that gave the Department of the Interior 90 days to come up with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22251851/joe-biden-executive-orders-climate-change-conservation-30-by-2030\">a plan to conserve 30 percent of American land and water</a>. The department is set to deliver the report to the White House later this month. </p>\n<p id=\"OsJJYQ\">“There is growing scientific consensus that we must conserve more land and water, with 30 percent representing the minimum that experts think must be conserved in order to avoid the worst impacts of nature loss to our economies and well-being,” Tyler Cherry, a spokesperson for the agency, told Vox. “President Biden has set an ambitious but achievable goal that will lift up a wide range of locally supported conservation and restoration actions, with the support of a broad range of stakeholders.” </p>\n<p id=\"dJBpS6\">So, 30 has no shortage of followers. Which brings us back to the debate over whether or not it’s the right number.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Cj8R7u\">Why some conservationists think the 30 percent target should be higher</h3>\n<p id=\"UUEF7T\">If this were the 1950s, 30 percent as a target would be fine, said Dinerstein, who’s now the director of the Biodiversity and Wildlife Solutions program at Resolve, a Washington, DC,<strong> </strong>nonprofit. Back then, there was more time to avert an extinction crisis, and there were plenty of intact ecosystems left outside of protected areas, he said. </p>\n<p id=\"M9oxcI\">Now, he says, “we don’t have that luxury.” What we really need, Dinerstein believes — echoing E.O. Wilson — is to protect half of the planet. </p>\n<p id=\"sjJ3ww\">But 50 percent is a big number to stomach, especially when only 16 percent of land worldwide currently has that status (that number is much smaller for oceans). Instead, the authors of the “Global Deal for Nature” paper called for putting 30 percent in protected areas and another 20 in what they called “climate stabilization areas” — less strictly protected areas that would help draw down emissions.</p>\n<p id=\"OKqDJL\">“The inside story is that we thought that 50 percent by 2030 would just be unpalatable,” Dinerstein said of the target. </p>\n<p id=\"IYpn9v\">By contrast, 30 percent, and the catchy “30 by 30” phrase, could attract the backing of lawmakers, even if it’s not some kind of precise threshold. Indeed, such a universal threshold doesn’t exist. </p>\n<p id=\"s0nXgi\">“There’s no threshold where suddenly you’re going to get a magic response,” said Corey Bradshaw, a professor of ecology at Flinders University. “You’ve got to play the politics with respect to assigning particular values to targets or thresholds. At the end of the day, it has nothing to do with biology.”</p>\n<p id=\"TAygKm\">O’Donnell, however, argues that <a href=\"https://www.campaignfornature.org/science-page\">a floor of 30 percent is justified by science</a>. What the research seems to show is that 30 percent is not a hard threshold — no one number applies across all regions. But reaching it would, indeed, benefit biodiversity, given that<strong> </strong>less than half of that is protected today. Scientists tend to agree that anything much below 30 percent is not sufficient as well. (Bradshaw also points out that a focus on percent coverage alone obscures other important aspects of conservation planning, like connectivity among areas, which can have huge impacts.)</p>\n<p id=\"qh8JeG\">This debate is especially relevant now. The <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/parties.shtml\">CBD’s 196 members</a> are preparing to convene in October, at which point they’ll consider upping the target for protected areas to 30 percent. (Absent from that member list? You guessed it — the US.) </p>\n<p id=\"KvE0lM\">In a statement, Johan Hedlund, an information officer at CBD, told Vox that while the “location of protected areas and their effective and equitable management is more important than simple [percentage] of land or sea area,” the 30 percent target is in line with the convention’s vision for 2050. Yet, he added, the target is still under negotiation. </p>\n<h3 id=\"x3E59t\">Indigenous activists are more concerned with avoiding “fortress conservation” than numbers</h3>\n<p id=\"M5ZsOI\">The simple catchphrase “30 by 30” belies the many challenges to establishing acres and acres of new protected areas (PAs). </p>\n<p id=\"E1z7DP\">For one, effective networks of PAs require careful planning. It’s important that they represent different ecosystems and provide pathways for animals to disperse, said Bradshaw. While the US protects 22 percent of its oceans, for example, most of the PAs are in one region — around Hawaii — leaving other important ecosystems at risk. </p>\n<p id=\"0n9AdN\">Protected areas are also not loved by all. In fact, many Indigenous communities initially opposed 30 by 30 because they worried it would put their land rights at risk, said Andy White, a coordinator at Rights and Resources Initiative, a nonprofit that advocates for land rights. </p>\n<p id=\"ba3qT1\">“Fundamentally, the problem is not so much the number as it is the approach,” White said. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUrnnSn1XvqpS5wInTnD7AR-aO0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430558/AP_21098724206985.jpg\">\n      <cite>Rick Bowmer/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland tours Bears Ears National Monument near Blanding, Utah, on April 8. <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SecDebHaaland/status/1380219354378342404\" target=\"_blank\">Referencing her trip on Twitter</a>, she wrote, “The earth holds so much power.

And the mainstream conservation movement appears ready to get behind this approach. </p>\n<p id=\"A5G5Qc\">“We need more financial investments into securing land tenure rights,” O’Donnell said. “[Indigenous peoples’] rights and their approaches need to be at the forefront of 30 by 30.”</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRaSkrrWWu0xpAu5FkBI7r0NbZY=/300x0:2700x1800/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111988/30_draft.0.jpg","linkMd5":"9b1e5bc9628ba34fb3b57277c6582f4e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-561_1e932cc899af8252.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":307715,"destBytes":271362,"author":"Benji Jones","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRaSkrrWWu0xpAu5FkBI7r0NbZY=/300x0:2700x1800/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111988/30_draft.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-561_1e932cc899af8252.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yE_SjuaRE2Qc38nJ2OFFuzhrX0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430570/GettyImages_598597392.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn1@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-27-527_ab674d10a4bdaba6.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUrnnSn1XvqpS5wInTnD7AR-aO0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430558/AP_21098724206985.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-12-925_786939382dcb08ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245845741},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","title":"Why the Chauvin trial feels so momentous","link":"https://www.vox.com/22372672/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-momentous-trauma-pain-police-reform","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"A dense, but socially distanced crowd carries paintings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor behind a line of masked protesters who, together, are carrying a banner that reads, “I can’t breathe, justice for George Floyd, justice for all stolen lives.”\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TukPLwt7rTqRIXltwcrAAc7VnHk=/150x0:2817x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112098/GettyImages_1231993838.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>People march outside Hennepin County Government Center, honoring George Floyd and other victims of police brutality, in Minneapolis on March 28. | Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n  <p>Whether Derek Chauvin is convicted or not, his trial will have an important legacy. </p> <p id=\"CFfAIM\">If the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murdering George Floyd, feels momentous, it’s because it is.</p>\n<p id=\"j9M4ai\">It’s been nearly a year in the making, ushered into being by nearly 365 days of activism and anger, and by the millions who chanted Floyd’s name while vowing to honor his memory. </p>\n<p id=\"49wl2Z\">It’s not that we haven’t seen many people killed by police before. Their last moments have become familiar: A confused jumble of body camera, security, and bystander footage heavy with struggle and fear, pleading and uncertainty, the noise of shots. Security and body camera footage often possess a cold, official veneer, while bystander clips are often shot from a distance. This can create a kind of remove, as does the fact these videos often unfold quickly, dense with movement until the moment the person killed slumps and falls.</p>\n<p id=\"gERDoI\">But the video of Floyd’s death was different. Millions of people across the United States and the world watched intimate cellphone footage, clear and close, of a death that was painfully slow. To watch that clip is to watch a person’s life slipping from their body a little at a time.</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\"><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"On a tree lined street, a crowd so dense it looks like a river of people.

To relive it through this trial is to have that still-fresh wound scraped raw.</p>\n<p id=\"q3kd3s\">But through the pain of recollection, the trial offers a way to begin healing some of that damage. And it’s this opportunity that gives the proceedings some of the ponderous weight they possess. </p>\n<p id=\"HFZsaP\">What form that healing might take varies given the individual. For some, a conviction would be restorative; for others, the attention being paid to police misconduct is a reason for hope; and for others still, the trial feels full of promise — as if it could be an important step toward creating a more just existence. </p>\n<p id=\"cPbDhL\">Should Chauvin be acquitted and be allowed to continue on with his normal life, some would find themselves in despair, convinced that oppressive systems are impossible to change; others might resolve to devote more time and energy to activism. An acquittal, however, would invite everyone to once again question whether there ought to be any limits on police conduct — and to struggle further with how race and policing intertwine. </p>\n<p id=\"3lNOZO\">All this makes the Chauvin trial feel different; that, no matter the outcome in a few weeks, it will have a significant effect on how police are viewed, as well as how we choose to be policed. After it ends, remnants of the feelings it engendered will remain, and those feelings must be embraced as we look for ways to prevent more deaths like Floyd’s. </p>\n<h3 id=\"XI1zt3\">The Chauvin trial is a reflection of our collective grief and powerlessness</h3>\n<p id=\"f1oxja\">That Chauvin is on trial at all is not the norm. </p>\n<p id=\"89NkNm\">While there’s no good national data on police killings, a database of police shootings does exist, and as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21497089/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-trial-police-prosecutions-black-lives-matter\">Vox’s German Lopez</a> has explained, those seldom result in prosecution: Slightly less than 2 percent of officers face manslaughter or murder charges following on-duty shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"eQErpN\">“Even having an officer be placed on trial is a small victory, when you look at the lack of accountability that we have seen when police kill Black people,” Seft Hunter, director of Black-led organizing for the social justice organization Community Change, told me.</p>\n<p id=\"j9H7V5\">Its rarity amplifies something true of all trials: that they are rituals meant to create closure and healing. Through familiar rites, trials are meant to interrogate the past, and, if necessary, correct a wrong. And as any ritual does, the trial provides a platform for expression and for reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"DZYiYt\">That there was a wellspring of angst to express was evident in the testimony the prosecution’s witnesses gave. After having been sealed away for nearly a year, pain and guilt and rage and sadness came rushing out, as those who lived Floyd’s final moments alongside him were able to at last publicly release their feelings. All those watching at home who were wounded by Floyd’s death had an opportunity for release as well — to see their emotions manifested live, to share in the pain of the witnesses, and to be reminded that their feelings were valid.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Nelson, in a dark suit, blue shirt, and red tie, looks at a computer as he sits at a table with a microphone.

When he found words, all McMillian could say as he wiped away tears was, “Oh my God.”</p>\n<p id=\"gST9VA\">Another witness, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JPCMdMcfcY\">Christopher Martin</a>, now 19, worked at Cup Foods, the store where Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. He told the jury he watched Floyd struggle to breathe beneath Chauvin’s knee with “disbelief and guilt. If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided.”</p>\n<p id=\"HDdCQm\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-GKW8ScdKQ\">Darnella Frazier</a>, 18, recorded the now-famous video of Floyd’s final moments. She too spoke of guilt, saying amid tears, “It’s been nights I’ve stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more, and not physically interacting, and not saving his life.”</p>\n<p id=\"Io10VI\">Those tears, and the others shed by witnesses, were shared not just by Philonise Floyd, but by so many watching — as was the sense of helplessness. There was nothing anyone who has seen Frazier’s video could do; Floyd was already dead. There was nothing those who stood in front of Cup Foods could do; police officers were pushing them back, demanding they not interfere. </p>\n<p id=\"htnT0f\">Those who have watched Floyd die, in person or on video,<strong> </strong>are unified in their despair. The trial has been yet another opportunity to grieve the loss of that life, and the loss of all the other lives taken under similar circumstances. It has created a space for collective mourning. It has also been a reminder of the erratic nature of grief, with all of its bursts of anger and melancholy and weariness. The trial has caused new traumas that will need to be addressed after it ends; this ritual may make a place to gather in grief, but it cannot, on its own, end it.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A fisheye view of the scene outside Cup Foods as Floyd died; Frazier and other bystanders film; Martin looks on.

Frazier spoke of the particular pain of seeing in Floyd her father, her brothers, cousins, uncles, and friends, saying, “I look at how that could have been one of them.” It very well could have. One <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\">2019 study</a> found that Black men have about a one in 1,000 chance of being killed by police.</p>\n<p id=\"KfSG7U\">On May 25, 2020, Floyd was that one in 1,000. But on any given day, it could be anyone else. It could be me. This trial becomes an opportunity to pause and ponder whether this sort of statistic is acceptable, to ask whether anyone should die at the hands of police and to contemplate whether Chauvin’s actions were appropriate. </p>\n<p id=\"L3CDgA\">Floyd used some of his final words to say that they were not, telling the officers around him, “I’m about to die today.” Chauvin’s tactics were also condemned by onlookers, ordinary people who demanded the former officer get off of Floyd before beginning to plead for him to give Floyd some relief, shouting, “He’s not moving,” and, “Check his pulse,” and, “He’s not responsive right now.” Several called the police on the police, hoping some officer might be able to get Chauvin off of Floyd and show him some compassion, even though they doubtless knew it was fruitless.</p>\n<aside id=\"eFrqZ9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Trial by trauma \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/5/22367967/derek-chauvin-trial\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"DgHfRu\">The trial exemplifies not just a collective grief but also a collective powerlessness. What can we do to stop this from happening now, tomorrow, ever again? It can feel as though the public has no control over the police, and that the police have absolute control over the public. But that dynamic must be altered in order to ensure deaths like George Floyd’s don’t continue to happen. There have been loud calls for change, and from them have come nascent but promising plans for true reform.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ZQTxoI\">The Chauvin trial is a reminder of the burgeoning reform movement</h3>\n<p id=\"gZh6Da\">The Chauvin trial comes as the United States has reflected more deeply in the past year on how race and policing are intertwined, reflection that has been a direct result of Floyd’s death.</p>\n<p id=\"mdPC6Y\">The protests animated by the<strong> </strong>horrifying video of Floyd’s death<strong> </strong>were massive — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">early estimates</a> suggested that as many as 26 million people participated — and brought together a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2020/07/08/the-diversity-of-the-recent-black-lives-matter-protests-is-a-good-sign-for-racial-equity/\">broad coalition of identities</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"2XAhVT\">As they progressed, polling found Americans becoming more contemplative about race; a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/08/survey-higher-percentage-us-agree-black-people-face-discrimination/3143651001/\">Democracy Fund/UCLA Nationscape</a> poll taken the week after Floyd’s death found that 96 percent of Americans believed Black Americans face racial discrimination. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/june-2-7-2020-washington-post-schar-poll/6b811cdf-8f99-4e28-b8f1-c76df335c16a/\">Washington Post/George Mason</a> poll taken around the same time found that 81 percent of Americans believed the police need to make changes to ensure all Americans were treated equally by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"YEtgZB\">Whether these opinions mark a permanent change or are fleeting remains to be seen. More recent data is inconclusive. For example, while a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/e/22136383\">Vox/Data for Progress</a> poll taken April 2 to April 5, 2021, found 52 percent of likely voters believe police officers are more likely to use deadly force against Black Americans, a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipsos.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fct%2Fnews%2Fdocuments%2F2021-03%2Fusat-ipsos_racial_injustice_topline_030421.pdf&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F22372672%2Fderek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-momentous-trauma-pain-police-reform\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">USA Today/Ipsos</a> poll taken March 1–2 found that same percentage of Americans believe police misconduct is composed of “isolated incidents by a few officers.” </p>\n<aside id=\"pIwi4o\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Minneapolis vowed to dismantle its police department. Is change finally coming? \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/22360315/minneapolis-defund-police-chauvin-trial-george-floyd\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"Cc9hwO\">That reflection happened at all, though, has created conditions in which change does feel possible. Now, Ati, the president of the social justice group By Any Means Necessary, told me, “there’s a fire ignited in this nation. … I hate that it had to take the continual deaths of Black and brown people, but I do believe that we’re making progress in the right direction.”</p>\n<p id=\"5nNtWB\">This new reality is evident in the trial itself. The prosecution’s case turns in part on clarifying the role racism played not just in Floyd’s death but in how the defense usually portrays Black victims: It brought Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, to the stand to provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities of addiction in a manner that attempted to rebut the stereotypes surrounding Black drug addicts; it has had Black witnesses who refused to allow themselves to be cast as angry and out of control; and it has worked hard to humanize the man who died, beyond the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/22373806/george-floyd-trial-derek-chauvin-minneapolis-black-lives-matter\">racist tropes the defense has employed</a>. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Ross, in a back suit jacket, red and black blouse, and red and black hair, lists her glasses to wipe tears from her eyes as she sits on the witness stand.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44-KX9z05wKoF4D7TAr5qOwIlF8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433417/AP_21091533016603.jpg\">\n      <cite>Court TV/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Courteney Ross, George Floyd’s girlfriend, answers questions on the witness stand on April 1.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"sJr5RX\">Bowling Green State University criminal justice professor and former police officer Philip Matthew Stinson once told me that “many, many police officers are afraid of Black people.” Body camera footage played during the trial certainly shows officers treating Floyd as a danger, with former police officer Thomas Lane pointing a gun at him shortly after approaching his vehicle, and telling him to “Put your fucking hands up right now.” Later, three officers wrestled him to the ground as he’s in handcuffs and speculate — as the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/01/21/defense-attorneys-rodney-king-pcp-crazed/7ca52f4f-fa10-43b5-8133-1af27215f98b/\">officers who beat Rodney King</a> incorrectly did 30 years ago — that “He’s gotta be on something ... PCP or something.” </p>\n<p id=\"CAu67t\">Thus far, the defense has worked to suggest that Chauvin’s use of force might be justified and that even a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/trial-over-killing-of-george-floyd/2021/04/02/983755183/watch-live-day-5-of-testimony-in-the-derek-chauvin-trial\">handcuffed suspect might still pose a threat to officers’ safety</a>. But in the telling of Ross and the other witnesses, Floyd was not a scary Black man requiring an aggressive response, but a man like any other — someone deserving of aid, not violence. </p>\n<p id=\"64UDT6\">Most people want those in distress to get aid — a desire that is at the core of the movement to defund the police. Defunding was a somewhat niche concept before Floyd died, and even as it became a rallying cry during 2020’s protests, many rejected it as<strong> </strong>something that sounded<strong> </strong>ridiculous. </p>\n<p id=\"Gncs6C\">Now, however, with some time and understanding,<strong> </strong>there appears to be broad support for the idea — that money should be subtracted from police department budgets and added to the budgets of departments providing social and health services — even if many still don’t like the term. </p>\n<p id=\"dQfQJD\">The recent Vox/Data for Progress poll, for instance, found 63 percent of respondents saying they support moving some money from police departments to other groups tasked with handling things like mental health crises or addiction. Such a reallocation of resources could also conceivably mean giving business owners someone else to call when they suspect a customer is trying to buy something with a fake $20 bill — rather than an armed police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"GIGfj6\">This shift in thinking has already led to change in the wake of Floyd’s death.<strong> </strong>A number of cities have begun experimentation into what defunding — and other structural police reforms — might look like. </p>\n<p id=\"FAJddh\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21549019/measure-j-police-abolition-defund-reform-black-lives-matter-protest-2020-election-george-floyd\">Los Angeles voters</a> approved a defund measure in the 2020 election, and the <a href=\"https://abc7.com/defund-the-police-lapd-black-lives-matter-los-angeles-city-council/10384293/\">city council</a> there recently approved the transfer of $32 million to programs that provide alternatives to policing as well as public health initiatives.

Ithaca, New York, <a href=\"https://www2.tompkinscountyny.gov/files2/2021-04/Master%20Final%20Document%20City%20of%20Ithaca.pdf\">recently approved plans</a> to replace the city’s current police department with a “department of public safety” that encompasses police officers and unarmed officials who will be tasked with responding to “certain non-violent” calls. Minneapolis has embarked on a similar project following a pledge by the majority of its city council to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22360315/minneapolis-defund-police-chauvin-trial-george-floyd\">“dismantle” the police department</a> and replace it with a new department with a broader skill set — an initiative voters are expected to weigh in on during November’s municipal elections.</p>\n<p id=\"70tomF\">Still other cities have begun to invest in a more expansive public health infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/1/20677523/mental-health-police-cahoots-oregon-oakland-sweden\">Eugene, Oregon’s Cahoots program</a> — which sends mental health and medical professionals to certain emergency calls instead of police — drew intense interest in the months following Floyd’s death; now other localities, <a href=\"https://denverite.com/2021/02/02/in-the-first-six-months-of-health-care-professionals-replacing-police-officers-no-one-they-encountered-was-arrested/\">like Denver</a>, have begun to pursue similar programming. </p>\n<p id=\"ChDz3r\">The federal government hopes to encourage other local governments to adopt this model as well: The <a href=\"https://eugeneweekly.com/2021/03/10/cahoots-funding-on-the-way-to-bidens-desk/\">American Rescue Plan</a> contains a provision called the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr1319/BILLS-117hr1319enr.pdf\">State Option to Provide Qualifying Community-based Mobile Crisis Intervention Services</a>, essentially giving federal funding to assist local governments in creating mobile response units focused on providing emergency assistance to those experiencing mental and substance health crises.</p>\n<p id=\"D5glx6\">Such major policy changes would not have happened if were not for Floyd’s death. They simply were not being discussed with the urgency they are now. </p>\n<p id=\"hs2AyH\">There are also ideas that go beyond these policies, including calls to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2020/08/the-abolition-movement\">abolish the police</a> completely; supporters of that concept argue that policing is too corrupt to be reformed and that there is no place in modern society for armed security forces with little accountability. If there is not complete agreement on how far to go, it is clear that it is time to start moving, and the magnitude of Chauvin’s trial is indicative of that need. </p>\n<h3 id=\"3aMZUZ\">The Chauvin trial is not the final battle in the fight against police violence</h3>\n<p id=\"FN09PD\">If Chauvin is found guilty, it will feel momentous, given how few misconduct cases even go to trial. It would seem as though there was a sudden shift in who the judicial system gives advantage to. </p>\n<p id=\"jAT9T7\">But as important as the Chauvin trial is, it must also be said that it is no synecdoche for police violence and misconduct. It is one case. </p>\n<p id=\"D2gEok\">Should Chauvin be convicted, and there is no guarantee he will be, that won’t mean justice for all other families and communities that have lost loved ones to police violence, or who have seen someone dear to them lose time through improper imprisonment or assault. It will mean the government has closed a single case of misconduct, that what Chauvin did was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"IQRSDx\">“What we cannot do is rest all of our hopes on the trial when, in essence, what we’re talking about is a system that makes this behavior permissible in the first place,” Hunter told me. “That system will remain intact after this trial is over, irrespective of what the outcome ultimately ends up being.”</p>\n<p id=\"VBuDOR\">That the trial is focused on a single act doesn’t mean that it can’t have a broader impact, though. </p>\n<p id=\"COmMeK\">As Minister JaNaé Bates, communications director for advocacy groups ISAIAH and Faith in Minnesota, told me, “We’ve seen way too many police be able to kill Black people and not be held accountable. So this is a way for us to actually take some real bold steps for making sure this doesn’t happen again and again and again.”</p>\n<p id=\"foqNva\">Depending on the jury’s decision, there are likely to be very different initial responses.<strong> </strong>If Chauvin is convicted, many will celebrate, feeling — as <a href=\"https://www.fox9.com/news/rev-al-sharpton-to-lead-noon-prayer-with-floyd-family-outside-hennepin-county-courthouse\">George Floyd’s brother Philonise Floyd</a> recently said — that they are at last “able to breathe.” Should Chauvin be acquitted, there is likely to be an outpouring of anger and people taking to the streets. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Flanked on either side by Black men in light colored suits, Philonise — wearing sunglasses, a black suit, white shirt, and a tie with brown, blue, and white stripes — holds bouquet of yellow and red flowers.

<figcaption>US President Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House. | Doug Mills/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>Fed up with skyrocketing housing prices, voters support strong federal action. </p> <p id=\"YjJqVg\">Voters, frustrated by astronomical rents and home prices, might be ready to force local governments to do something about the state of the housing market. </p>\n<p id=\"ICau7n\">Whether President Joe Biden feels the same is another question.</p>\n<p id=\"JDWcD3\"><a href=\"https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/4/dfp-vox-infrastructure-spending-housing.pdf\">According to a new poll</a> by Vox and Data for Progress, a majority of likely voters say they’d support withholding federal money from cities and states that prevent more affordable types of housing from being built. </p>\n<p id=\"pf3QBN\">More specifically, 54 percent back withholding infrastructure dollars from local governments unless they “stop making it illegal to build multifamily housing,” while just 32 percent wouldn’t. In other words, the idea is popular by a 22-point margin.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjTXoG7MbRHCJnFpLt-8P1hfhP0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430041/image__10_.png\">\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"972K9y\">That’s a big deal, because local governments, through zoning laws and ordinances, dictate where and what homes can be built. And many of them are wielding this power to artificially constrain the supply of housing, thereby driving up rents and home prices for everyone. </p>\n<p id=\"wpUou6\">Bans on duplexes, fourplexes, accessory dwelling units, and apartment buildings ensure that the only homes that get built are single-family residences that are necessarily more expensive. The laws that dictate this are referred to as “exclusionary zoning.” To estimate the impacts of these policies, one <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3472145\">study</a> looked at Silicon Valley, where demand to live surged starting in the 1970s (but population between 1970 and 2010 “grew at less than half the rate that California did”). At the time, house prices there were only slightly above the national median. But its suburbs undertook a “multifaceted” effort to restrict the types of homes that could be built and “limit further densification.” Now, half a century later, house prices in Silicon Valley are “commonly ten times the national median.” </p>\n<p id=\"CmX4HD\">The poll — which surveyed 1,207 likely voters and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points — found 63 percent of renters are in favor of withholding the money if governments don’t adopt “policies that encourage the building of new housing.” And while 50 percent of homeowners supported the policy, enough homeowners oppose development in their neighborhoods that it often doesn’t get built. The importance of federal or state policymaking on issues like these is that it would ensure that policies with large economic benefits but small numbers of empowered opponents at the local level don’t get derailed. </p>\n<p id=\"n62gay\">In the poll, the greatest degree of opposition comes from Republicans, but even that is a minority opinion — just 44 percent said they opposed the policy. </p>\n<p id=\"nEtlbC\">Despite the popularity of this approach, it’s one the Biden team (so far) has not elected to take. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ykHKUL\">Biden’s plan for dismantling exclusionary zoning is too nice</h3>\n<p id=\"nUWQQU\">Biden has taken a major step forward in defining exclusionary zoning as a problem. But his plan doesn’t engage with how baked in these laws are in some communities. </p>\n<p id=\"ftKAR8\">As part of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/31/22357179/biden-two-trillion-infrastructure-jobs-plan-explained\">$2 trillion infrastructure package</a> the administration introduced last week, Biden proposed a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22369761/biden-infrastructure-american-jobs-act-housing-prices-rents-bubble-race-to-the-top\">“purely carrot and not stick”</a> program to allocate $5 billion to a new competitive grant program that “awards flexible and attractive funding to jurisdictions that take concrete steps to eliminate such needless barriers to producing affordable housing.”</p>\n<p id=\"MsMi4N\">The approach is similar to President Barack Obama’s Race to the Top program for education, which also set aside a few billion for states to compete over. And in some ways, modeling zoning reform similarly to education reform makes sense — both have been designated as local issues, and a lot of the infrastructure for direct reform exists at the local level. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XXZtEsGTdmR7wGP4BWSe_twC-ZE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432633/AP_10072918650.jpg\">\n      <cite>J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo</cite>\n      <figcaption>President Barack Obama highlights his “Race to the Top” education agenda in a speech to the National Urban League conference in Washington on July 29, 2010.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"Bb8oNp\">However, while with education everyone has the same goal of “better schools” or “better-educated children” even if they disagree on methods, not everyone agrees with the goal of ensuring abundant housing. </p>\n<p id=\"fUUGqw\">At the local level, cities and suburbs (often with a high proportion of Democratic voters) have enacted policies and procedures that drive up the cost of housing, often due to aesthetic preferences for single-family homes and the people who usually reside in them. </p>\n<p id=\"8kizBC\">“I don’t think that this grant program is going to lead to very many meaningful things,” Michael Andersen, senior researcher at the Sightline Institute, told Vox. </p>\n<p id=\"awJIGu\">The reason? Many of the most exclusionary localities are uninterested in the extra money changing these rules would give them. After all, they’ve already left potentially billions on the table: According to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21154/w21154.pdf\"><strong>study</strong></a> by University of Chicago economist Chang-Tai Hsieh and UC Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti, researchers find that because metropolitan areas have made it prohibitively expensive for middle- and low-income Americans to move to high-productivity areas, US aggregate economic growth was lowered by more than 50 percent from 1964 to 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"2r1a0K\">“It doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea; it just means that it’s limited in its ability to impact change,” Yonah Freemark, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, told Vox. “The fundamental problem we’re facing is the cities and suburbs that are most interested in excluding people are also the ones that are least needing of additional grants to pay for things.”</p>\n<p id=\"l6OrZW\">If Biden and his administration want to truly “eliminate exclusionary zoning,” as they claim, they’ll need a stick to go along with their carrot.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"8JWRKV\">The stick</h3>\n<p id=\"vY92hk\">The idea for the “stick” is pretty straightforward: Rather than just telling states and localities they can get access to an extra pot of money if they choose to reform, tell them they’ll miss out on a much bigger pot, and one they may routinely count on, if they don’t. </p>\n<p id=\"rTLhv8\">In short,<strong> </strong>places that are intentionally restricting growth and discriminating based on economic status should have transportation funds withheld until they change them. </p>\n<p id=\"7qgpEG\">The idea of using transportation funds to incentivize zoning changes is not foreign to the Biden team. On the campaign trail, the now-president <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/housing/\">endorsed</a> making large annual<strong> </strong>grants like the Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) contingent on developing “a strategy for inclusionary zoning.” STBG allocated over <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/fastact/factsheets/stbgfs.cfm\">$12 billion</a> to grantees in 2020. </p>\n<p id=\"jh4iwL\">It wouldn’t be a panacea: There are concerns that it’s actually the cities that are more open to home building that are more dependent on these grants, so a policy like this would miss out on the biggest offenders. </p>\n<p id=\"0BfBuZ\">For example, many experts have proposed making receipt of the popular Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) contingent on reforming local zoning codes. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/hud-cant-fix-exclusionary-zoning-by-withholding-cdbg-funds/\">Research</a> by Jenny Schuetz at the Brookings Institution casts doubt on how effective this will be. She looks at both California and New Jersey and finds that in the former, “only 17 percent of the most exclusive communities receive any CDBG funding.” And New Jersey? Zero of the most exclusive communities receive CDBG funding. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oyz_ZAsbXBE0l6saw6_4WANfejQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432634/cdbgbrookings.png\">\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"Q7QDsc\">But now Biden is poised to allocate billions in transportation funding to states. Even if the localities within these states don’t care if they receive funding, individual states sure as hell do. </p>\n<p id=\"egmWOx\">States care a lot about the general economic outlook and growth of their metro regions, whereas local officials are sometimes captured by the interests of local homeowners to the detriment of the broader region. Creating incentives and showing states how they are allowing localities to inhibit growth could spark a lot of change through state legislatures.</p>\n<p id=\"oO9geW\">“Exclusionary zoning is a product of [the permissiveness of]<strong> </strong>state law, and if we can get states to address that through funding incentives, I think that that could lead to some real change at the local level,” Phil Tegeler, executive director of the civil rights group Poverty and Race Research Action Council, told Vox. “Local governments have no inherent authority that’s not granted to them by state government.”</p>\n<p id=\"EqqVar\">Politically, doing something like this could be dicey. While Biden has staked out a clear opposition to exclusionary zoning, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22335749/housing-prices-connecticut-segregation-zoning-reform-democrats-adu-parking-minimum\">many of the most exclusive places</a> are run by Democrats who disagree or have their hands tied by empowered homeowners. For example, in California, the lobbying arm of some homeowners <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/sb50-california/604786/\">helped block a bill that would have removed bans on fourplexes near transit stations</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"aKEw9q\">“No single local government could even solve [the housing crisis] if it wanted to and therefore has no incentive to try because it’s politically difficult to try,” Andersen tells Vox. “Whereas at the state level or at the federal level, we can start to say this is an economic problem for everybody, so we should be taking actions at the state and federal levels to move the scale.” </p>\n<p id=\"gJGIZU\"></p>\n<p id=\"iV4iEY\"></p>\n<p id=\"3RNeW3\"></p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_P5n66nV4w66rEEHH7TNmB35_g=/334x0:5667x4000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112410/GettyImages_1230804840.0.jpg","linkMd5":"37c78f6a54e251d0b91f8cff69cab2db","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn75@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-06-299_9a354f2a288fdf52.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":90632,"destBytes":46616,"author":"Jerusalem Demsas","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_P5n66nV4w66rEEHH7TNmB35_g=/334x0:5667x4000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112410/GettyImages_1230804840.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn75@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-06-299_9a354f2a288fdf52.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjTXoG7MbRHCJnFpLt-8P1hfhP0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430041/image__10_.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn11@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-13-348_8ff43685d25cc77c.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XXZtEsGTdmR7wGP4BWSe_twC-ZE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432633/AP_10072918650.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn83@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-241_db33281e035ddc69.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oyz_ZAsbXBE0l6saw6_4WANfejQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432634/cdbgbrookings.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-13-572_da98aa9a4609b6be.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245845756},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:44:05","title":"Breaking down the 2021 Best Picture nominees","link":"https://www.vox.com/22374044/oscars-2021-best-picture-nominees-reviews-roundtables","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XokqpeAldFoWjYBMiNMnwa0l2po=/100x0:1700x1200/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113602/headshots_1617909999945.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Daniel Kaluuya in <em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em>, Alan Kim in <em>Minari</em>, Gary Oldman in <em>Mank</em>, and Anthony Hopkins in <em>The Father</em>. | Warner Bros; A24; Netflix; Sony Pictures Classics</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n  <p>The merits, demerits, and awards chances of each film in a weird year at the Oscars. </p> <p id=\"O9qI1Y\">The most prestigious award at the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/oscars\">Oscars</a> is the Best Picture trophy, and every year, between five and 10 movies compete for the prize.

There’s a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22205072/promising-young-woman-review-carey-mulligan\">biting and satirical revenge thriller</a> in the mix. And finally, two films explore the promise and peril of the American Dream: one about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22274856/minari-review-yeun-chung\">a family of Korean-Americans in 1980s Missouri</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22289457/nomadland-review-zhao-mcdormand-streaming-hulu\">one set in the contemporary West</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"FZ4uLd\">In the run-up to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22213752/oscars-2021-coronavirus-date-streaming\">delayed-by-two-months Oscars on April 25</a>, the Vox staff is looking at each of the Best Picture nominees in turn.

demonstrator outside the Georgia Capitol building in early March holds a sign that reads “Georgia Voters Matter.” | Megan Varner/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>Brands have taken to weighing in on social issues. Now, corporate America is starting to take a hard stance against voter suppression laws. </p> <p id=\"SJDiy9\">Corporate America is, once again, weighing in on politics, and Republicans aren’t happy. After the passage of Georgia’s restrictive new voting law, which was signed by Gov. Brian Kemp on March 25, more than 100 executives and business leaders met to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/11/companies-voting-bills-states/\">discuss how to combat similar voting bills</a> proposed in state legislatures across the country. Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have advised companies that have made public statements condemning the Georgia law and others like it to “stay out of politics.” </p>\n<p id=\"4GbRhe\">Recent history suggests that corporate leaders are unlikely to do so. And this latest meeting, with attendance from executives representing Starbucks, Target, and major US-based airlines, is further proof of that. The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/11/companies-voting-bills-states/\">reported</a> that executives have considered pausing donations to politicians who support the bills and withholding investments in states like Georgia that have passed such measures.</p>\n<p id=\"oZWuSg\">The Georgia law, known as SB 202, will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22352112/georgia-voting-sb-202-explained\">increase voting restrictions</a> for Georgians by requiring identification for mail-in ballots, shrinking the window for early and absentee voting, limiting the number of ballot drop boxes, banning the provision of food and water to voters waiting in line, and shifting control over local election rules to the state legislature, among other changes. (SB 202 does expand voting access to rural areas, according to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/03/georgia-voting-law-explained/\">Washington Post analysis</a>, but the added restrictions draw on a long history of voter suppression, specifically directed toward Black voters.)</p>\n<p id=\"fQkGeD\">Prior to the Georgia bill’s passage, few major companies directly commented on the bill, with the exception of<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/business/corporate-america-voting-rights.html\"> Salesforce and Patagonia</a>. Some, like Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, and Home Depot, were reticent due to their <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/advice/largest-companies-in-georgia/\">employment ties</a> to the region; their corporate operations are often affected by decisions made by Georgia’s legislative body. In the past week, however, prominent American brands — from Major League Baseball to Coca-Cola — have publicly condemned the law’s passage and, more broadly, general efforts of voter suppression. The MLB also declared it will relocate the 2021 All-Star Game and the MLB draft <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/3/22365408/why-the-mlb-pulled-the-all-star-game-from-atlanta-briefly-explained-voter-suppression-bills\">out of Atlanta</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"tqLiSG\">The corporate outcry to Georgia is partly a response to the collective action by voting rights activists and a letter penned by a group of prominent Black business executives. Led by Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive at American Express, and Kenneth Frazier, a chief executive at Merck, 72 Black business leaders signed on to a letter that urged corporate America to “publicly and directly oppose new laws that would restrict the rights of Black voters,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/voting-rights-georgia-corporations.html\">according to the New York Times</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"45HKNK\">The letter didn’t lob criticism at any specific company or executive, and some of the corporate signers themselves previously did not take a public stance on the law. Yet Frazier told the New York Times that he hoped the letter would encourage companies to speak out against dozens of similar bills in other states. “The Georgia legislature was the first one,” he said. “If corporate America doesn’t stand up, we’ll get these laws passed in many places in this country.” </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"Wc1jNJ\"><q>“If corporate America doesn’t stand up, we’ll get these laws passed in many places in this country”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"elIqQ5\">It’s not unusual for brands to make their thoughts known on major political events and tragedies, or even <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/9/18/20870798/walmart-shootings-open-carry-kroger-cvs\">alter corporate policy</a> as a direct response. In a few cases, significant corporate blowback has led to a repeal or a reconsideration of unpopular laws: North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/24/529888031/nba-says-2019-all-star-game-will-be-in-n-c-after-partial-bathroom-bill-repeal\">partially repealed</a> its “bathroom bill” in 2019, after the NBA threatened to host that year’s All-Star Game elsewhere. Voting rights advocates have also pushed for a national consumer boycott of brands that didn’t take an active stance against the Georgia legislation. While companies did state their support of general “voter rights” when pushed, few made explicit statements until it was too late. Coca-Cola and Home Depot, the largest employer in the state, previously told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/15/georgia-voting-business/\">the Washington Post</a> that their companies are “aligned” with the statement issued by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce in mid-March, which expressed concern over the restrictions proposed in the SB 202 bill. </p>\n<p id=\"l9ODBy\">Meanwhile, Delta, which bases its largest hub in Atlanta, has found itself in a bind between consumer and legislative interests. The hashtag #BoycottDelta began trending in late March after it was revealed that the airline had<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeidasTouch/status/1375889645574090752\"> a role</a> in crafting SB 202 with the help of its lobbying team. CEO Ed Bastian had also praised the law’s passage before walking back his initial statement. In a <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/ed-bastian-memo-your-right-vote\">revised public statement</a>, Bastian emphasized that “the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values,” adding that the “entire rationale for [SB 202] was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections.” </p>\n<div id=\"ZalxQi\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our co-founder Ben Meiselas received a tip from a confidential insider and broke the story of the abhorrent statement from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Delta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Delta</a> praising the Georgia voter suppression bill and stating that the company worked to craft the bill. We are calling on everyone to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottDelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BoycottDelta</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/W6QRXbY5Hp\">pic.twitter.com/W6QRXbY5Hp</a></p>— MeidasTouch.com (@MeidasTouch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeidasTouch/status/1375889645574090752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 27, 2021</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"YfEUeb\">In response to this widespread corporate condemnation, outspoken members of the Republican Party lambasted the brands for siding with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorWicker/status/1377641699044904960\">“the woke left.”</a> “They like our public policy when we’re doing things that benefit them,” said Georgia state House Speaker David Ralston, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/business/delta-ceo-calls-georgia-voting-legislation-unacceptable/HZYG2CTB3RH5JBD5EDWVE52KDM/\">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>. “You don’t feed a dog that bites your hand. You gotta keep that in mind sometimes.”</p>\n<p id=\"SRTPyF\">Delta is now being treated like a biting dog; the Georgia GOP-controlled House has voted to revoke the company’s jet fuel tax break, something it also did in 2018 as political retribution, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/01/politics/georgia-voting-law-house-delta-tax-breaks/index.html\">CNN reported</a>. According to the Hill, some Republican legislators have also called to ban all Coca-Cola products from their offices in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bluestein/status/1378491232155021316/photo/1\">letter </a>to the Georgia Beverage Association, citing Coke’s “choice to cave to the pressure of an out of control cancel culture.” </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"g5YXV0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:9574455\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"TcmeZw\">Such is the dilemma faced by corporate America, which has to cater not only to stakeholders and local officials, but also to the greater political standard maintained by consumers. For big and powerful companies like Coca-Cola and Delta, consumer outrage and boycotts (aspects of “cancel culture” that Republicans frequently denounce) don’t often have major economic impacts. Brands care about public perception and demonstrating consistency in their liberal values. That’s why so many remained mum on the Georgia bill until it became necessary to condemn its passage, thanks to the work of state activists and some high-profile Black business leaders. Coca-Cola doesn’t fear cancellation. Its reputation could be sullied on Twitter for a few days, but the company’s products are mainstays in grocery stores nationwide. What’s important is that the public remembers Coke spoke out against SB 202, even if it was a little late to the punchline.</p>\n<p id=\"QyIqP3\">The Trump presidency has facilitated an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/10/7/20894134/consumer-activism-conscious-consumerism-explained\">era of consumer activism</a>, coupled with conscious consumerism, that increasingly demanded corporate accountability and transparency. Under Biden, there might now be fewer outrageous national issues that require public comment, but stateside policy, as illustrated by Georgia’s restrictive voting law, still could have an outsize impact on future elections. </p>\n<p id=\"9wb6zF\">The pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests last summer have renewed Americans’ sense of activism. Many companies have since pledged to incorporate anti-racist messaging and ideology into their workplaces and policies. </p>\n<p id=\"ufZZlY\">In early April, executives of nearly 200 major companies including HP, Target, and United Airlines signed on to a statement that denounced voting bills in state legislatures similar to SB 202. “There are hundreds of bills threatening to make voting more difficult in dozens of states nationwide,” <a href=\"https://www.civicalliance.com/votingaccess/\">read the statement</a>, which was organized by Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan organization focused on voter engagement. While the intention behind the 157-word statement was political, its message still came across as vague. No specific states or bills were mentioned. </p>\n<p id=\"1m8Hap\">The latest Zoom meeting on April 10 established grounds for corporate unification, an attendee <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/11/companies-voting-bills-states/\">told the Washington Post</a>, between companies that had been publishing individual statements about voting legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"GkQifV\">For voting rights advocates, the next battleground over restrictions is <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/02/Tribcast-Texas-legislature-considers-voting-restrictions/\">Texas</a>, where a number of bills have been introduced that would ban overnight early voting and drive-through early voting and require absentee voters to actively request ballots, rather than have them automatically sent.

Will it win? </p> <p id=\"O9qI1Y\">This year, eight films are in the running for Best Picture, the most prestigious award at the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/oscars\">Oscars</a>. That’s a lot of movies to watch, analyze, and enjoy! So in the days before the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22213752/oscars-2021-coronavirus-date-streaming\">ceremony on April 25</a>, Vox staffers are looking at each of the nominees in turn. What makes this film appealing to Academy voters? What makes it emblematic of the year? And should it win?</p>\n<p id=\"kXt3Og\">Below, Vox film critic Alissa Wilkinson, The Goods editor Meredith Haggerty, and culture writer Aja Romano discuss <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21515051/trial-of-the-chicago-7-review-sorkin-netflix\"><em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em></a>, Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama based on real events from 1968 and 1969.</p>\n<aside id=\"ODgfVR\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"In Netflix’s The Trial of the Chicago 7, Aaron Sorkin tackles an all-too-relevant court case\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21515051/trial-of-the-chicago-7-review-sorkin-netflix\"}]}'></div></aside><h3 id=\"ZwW31j\">For better or worse, <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7 </em>is peak Sorkin</h3>\n<p id=\"PTNmef\"><strong>Alissa Wilkinson:</strong> I think <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> may be the most “Hollywoody” of this year’s Best Picture nominees — to the point that I would have expected it to land in this category no matter when it came out. Partly that’s because there seems to be some cosmic rule that if Aaron Sorkin makes a thing, it gets nominated for awards. </p>\n<p id=\"DsNPgO\">But there’s something else going on here. I personally liked watching <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em>, whatever its flaws are, because it taps into a very particular cultural moment and crafts it into a story. (At times it messes with the particulars to make the story fit more of a classic inspirational courtroom drama mold; sometimes that works and sometimes, as with the ending, it does not.) And it feels to me that the world we live in today echoes the time they were living through, but in a way that’s digestible to the large sector of the Academy that actually remembers that time.</p>\n<p id=\"7mQXWd\">When you were watching the film, what were you thinking about? What stuck out to you?</p>\n<p id=\"haMbUl\"><strong>Meredith Haggerty: </strong>This is not in the cinema spirit, but all I was thinking about during this film was what Aaron Sorkin was getting right and wrong, factually. I’m terrible at watching works about history without spending the whole runtime on Google trying to figure out what really happened — I cannot watch <em>The Crown</em> at all, for this reason. And since <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> debuted on Netflix during a pandemic and<strong> </strong>didn’t have the advantage of being a theater film, and <em>The Newsroom</em> created in me a particular frustration with Sorkin’s smug approach to the past, I was especially on my fact-checker horse. </p>\n<p id=\"5TXVrK\">I was particularly obsessed with the prosecutor Richard Schultz, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was slotted into the Sorkin classic role of principled opposition. (Turns out, he doesn’t need or want <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-7-prosecutor-dick-schultz-seminar-20201020-xlabkrtwrfgk3mezgraswhqkxq-story.html\">the hero edit</a>.) </p>\n<p id=\"cwIg5V\">All that, and Sacha Baron Cohen’s absolutely hurtful Boston accent. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Two men in hippie garb stride through a courtroom rotunda.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SuIHgRCiQ0e6pzAsnCcjve2D7NI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438080/chicago7.jpeg\">\n      <cite>Netflix</cite>\n      <figcaption>Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong as Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin in <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7.</em>\n</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"ODAOqr\"><strong>Aja Romano: </strong>Mer, you just went straight for the jugular regarding the Aaron Sorkin treatment, so I might as well unload it all upfront. I had the typical seesaw experience with this film that I feel for every Sorkin film: an initial begrudging admiration for the sheer craft and quality of the writing and the deftness with which he presents characters, careening ever more steadily into unease at the Sorkiny Sorkinness of it all, and ending up somewhere between contempt for Aaron Sorkin’s entire method of Sorkinese and self-loathing because I fell for it once more. </p>\n<p id=\"HB8Z2a\">He’s an expert by now — has been since <em>The West Wing</em> — at manipulating the audience by structuring his writing as a series of set-ups for feel-good speeches that always make it seem like you and the characters are triumphantly winning a game. But it’s a game whose stakes he’s entirely constructed and controlled from the start. He doesn’t <em>just</em> give you these dramatic, monologic scenes of grandstanding and proselytizing, he also does so alongside his personalized smug condescending version of the narrative — in this case, his version of the historical narrative. </p>\n<p id=\"xWr8jx\">When I wasn’t sure what part of the narrative was false or not, I decided to assume false — and so much of <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> is so classically Sorkin (like the “I did it all for a hot girl” theme, the noble opponent, etc.) that it ceases to be about history at all. The film isn’t even purely the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21305967/hamilton-debate-controversy-historical-accuracy-explained\"><em>Hamiltonian</em></a> refraction of history through a modern lens — although I think Sorkin wanted it to be. I think he <em>wanted</em> this film to be a reframing of the civil protests and civil disobedience of 1968 through the lens of the civil protests of the 2010s (<em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> was filmed in 2019, before the 2020<strong> </strong>protests that followed the death of George Floyd, but after the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/31/17937764/ferguson-missouri-protests-2014-michael-brown-police-shooting\">2014 Ferguson protests</a> and subsequent movements around the country). </p>\n<p id=\"gM0KVr\">Yet to have that kind of truly effective framing, you’d have to have a writer/director less self-aggrandizing, less front-and-center, less sure of yourself and your absolutist version of the narrative than Sorkin. Sorkinese as a worldview is basically a precursor to the flattening of nuanced political arguments into a series of viral “gotcha!’ tweets, where the goal is smug point-scoring that validates the audience in the moment, but the result is the skewing and gamification of political discourse. And with a narrative as malleable as the Chicago 7 trial, that entire setup ultimately feels like a cheapening of the facts and an insultingly simplified version of the real thing.</p>\n<p id=\"Pgi2Uk\">And even with all that said I’m pretty sure I liked it. Ugh. <em>Sorkin!</em></p>\n<p id=\"oOHsrZ\"><strong>Alissa:</strong> I have a strong affection for Sorkin’s particular brand of silliness; I think a lot of this may be because I never got into <em>The West Wing</em>, so everything I’ve seen from him has been acknowledged as goofy right off the bat. (Yes, I know there are critics who didn’t like <em>The West Wing</em>! Don’t send me email!) What I think of as Sorkinese, when he swerves into politics, is the phrase “right side of history,” in the sense that he thinks he knows what it is and that being on it absolves one of all kinds of other evils, including berating or humiliating female colleagues. </p>\n<p id=\"2Q7C8J\">Then again, the man can write a zinger. I love a zinger.</p>\n<p id=\"S4uclv\">I think maybe this movie is best watched as, like, a .... mood? I think that’s the right word. It sort of evokes a time and a feeling without actually accurately recounting it. I did really feel the panic and strangeness of what happened and the frustration of the weird band of defendants who are kind of all on the same side, and kind of not.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5oJR25\">Does <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7 </em>have a real shot at winning Best Picture?</h3>\n<p id=\"TTtqdf\"><strong>Alissa: </strong>I think this is why I can easily imagine the Academy going for this movie: It’s zippy, it feels like a movie, and it definitely leaves the audience feeling like they too are on the right side of things, even if they aren’t, or wouldn’t be, or even weren’t at the time. (There are a lot of people in the Academy who remember these events!)</p>\n<p id=\"omRSvi\">What would it say to you if this movie were to win Best Picture? Would you be surprised? And, if there’s one thing you could change about it to feel better about that Best Picture win, what would it be? (I would remove that triumphantly swelling theme song from the end!)</p>\n<p id=\"vK0wBQ\"><strong>Aja:</strong> It wouldn’t surprise me at all if this film won. It’s like so many films before it, like an <em>English Patient</em> or a <em>King’s Speech</em> that almost seem algorithmically calculated to punch voter buttons even though everyone knows they’ll basically vanish from the cultural landscape within a few years, and be replaced by the much more culturally significant films from that year that often never even got nominated. In previous Oscar eras, I’d have said that the only thing keeping <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> from winning is that <em>Mank</em> is even <em>more</em> likely to win, because the only thing the Academy loves more than a stirring “right side of history” political drama is a navel-gazing “right side of history” political drama about Hollywood.</p>\n<p id=\"l3PiSb\">There are so many things I’d change, Alissa! Find some more real women who were impacted by the trial and actually make them characters, instead of resorting to the Sorkin stock character of the Exasperated Woman Who Shows Up Long Enough to Yell At A Quirky Man before promptly disappearing from the film. </p>\n<p id=\"PZgIpf\">Tell the whole story from Bobby Seale’s perspective. Retitle it <em>The Chicago 8th</em>. Why not just end the film the moment he finally walks out of the courtroom, because what better way to show how clearly everything else about this trial was window-dressing for a political bitchfight that ultimately marginalized all the protesters and accomplished nothing? </p>\n<p id=\"nPxKX3\">However, I wouldn’t change a thing about lovely Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his pained morally conflicted little face. Historically accurate or not, what matters here is my heart.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A set for The Trial of the Chicago 7.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3YMOHJEzTUdRtf4NKXDA8n-54GU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21961827/C7_02675_r2.jpg\">\n      <cite>Niko Tavernise/Netflix</cite>\n      <figcaption>Bobby Seale gets short shrift in <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7.</em>\n</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"mubXvl\"><strong>Meredith: </strong>The Bobby Seale stuff, as I frantically Googled, really got me. You know what could be cinematic, if done correctly? Not half a scene of Seale bound and gagged in the courtroom wherein everyone — but mostly JGL — immediately realizes How Wrong This Is, but the truth of him bound and gagged <em>for several days</em> while supposedly upstanding people looked on, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/drawing-justice-courtroom-illustrations/about-this-exhibition/political-activists-on-trial/bobby-seale-bound-and-gagged/\">which is what actually happened</a>.<strong> </strong>To take a pass on the drama and gravity of that actual historical detail in favor of a big fake Tom Hayden moment at the end of the film ... sometimes I think Aaron Sorkin would just be a better trial consultant than filmmaker. </p>\n<p id=\"KnXLk2\">There’s a question that runs under the movie — “What is this trial all for?” — and I don’t feel like Sorkin had a good and satisfying answer, because life didn’t have a good and satisfying answer. I agree with Aja that it would have been preferable to admit as much, rather than pretend that Tom Hayden made one final brave gesture, reading the names of the dead, that moved everyone in the courtroom. Nothing against Hayden, I’m interested in all of Jane Fonda’s exes! I just don’t think reality made for a very good Aaron Sorkin movie, which means Aaron Sorkin didn’t have something specific to say about reality.</p>\n<p id=\"dfFVdS\">It might surprise me if this movie won Best Picture, but I have proven through many an Oscar pool that I have no sense of the Academy. I would say I think <em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em> might be a more stylish and affecting pick about the same time period that speaks to the current moment without such hammy fists. I don’t know how anyone types with two balled-up hands, slick with old pork juice, but Sorkin really does it. </p>\n<p id=\"i7BOns\">Also, I’ll note: I did still cry, when David Dellinger punched the bailiff. But I’m easily manipulated! </p>\n<p id=\"qbbHek\">The thing I would change to make me happy with the prospect of this movie winning Best Picture would be what year it is now. Make it 2007 and I am really quite bowled over with the revolutionary politics here. </p>\n<p id=\"qVyxmk\"><strong>Alissa Wilkinson: </strong>I totally agree on the politics! (Worth noting that Bobby Seale makes a cameo — by way of being mentioned, not actually appearing — in <em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em>, which is just terrific.)</p>\n<p id=\"s4MbDn\">By the way, shout-out to John Carroll Lynch as Dellinger, who absolutely steals my particular heart — especially with that punch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"YbkP4R\">So, you’ve watched <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em>. What should you watch next?</h3>\n<p id=\"EKZD8Z\">So given everything we’ve said about <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em>: if someone really loved this movie, what would you tell them to watch next? What has the same vibe, or scratches the same itch, or covers similar territory — other than <em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em> — but is a little less hamfisted?</p>\n<p id=\"oMuWHD\"><strong>Aja: </strong>Is it too cliché to say something like <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em>? I guess it really depends on what you’re coming for. If you want the stirring courtroom drama then there’s always <em>12 Angry Men</em>, <em>A Few Good Men</em>, or <em>And Justice For All</em> (“No, <em>you’re</em> out of order!”). If you want the counterculture vibe, there’s always <em>Taking Woodstock</em>, <em>Almost Famous</em>, or <em>Hair</em>. And if you want to learn more about the radical revolutionists at the heart of this moment in history, try the excellent documentaries <em>Black Power Mixtape</em> and <em>The Chicago 10</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"zYU8qh\"><strong>Meredith:</strong> If you want see Sacha Baron Cohen do a voice <em>and</em> a woman having more than two lines, there’s always<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21528751/borat-2-subsequent-moviefilm-rudy-giuliani-review-cohen-white-noise\"><em>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</em></a>. (Which, truly, I loved.)</p>\n<p id=\"8FhhPw\"><em>A Few Good Men</em> is really the standard of Sorkin courtroom drama, and he does work so much better for me when he’s not taking on history. I’m personally more of a <em>My Cousin Vinny </em>girl, or even a <em>Legally Blonde</em>, but when I want courtroom drama I turn to TV (especially <em>The Goods </em>both<em> Wife</em> and <em>Fight</em>). There’s always the Grishams, I suppose — especially <em>The Firm</em>, which is crazy long but enjoyable. They do satisfy in their way. </p>\n<p id=\"j9aHyh\">And if you enjoy revisionist history by well-regarded white male auteur types, there’s always <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/23/18633841/once-upon-time-hollywood-tarantino-review-cannes-pitt-dicaprio-robbie\"><em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em></a>. Not to spoil it, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/25/8906839/tarantino-once-upon-time-in-hollywood-spoilers-ending-manson\">Tarantino tweaks the ending, too</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"K9aKyN\"><strong>Alissa Wilkinson: </strong>Oh, I love all of these suggestions — what great films, a veritable education in movies right there. I’d throw in Agnes Varda’s half-hour film <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Black-Panthers-H-Rap-Brown/dp/B077YVDD9N\"><em>Black Panthers</em></a>, and I quite liked the documentary <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/10/3/13081784/best-of-enemies-gore-vidal-william-buckley-pbs\"><em>Best of Enemies</em></a>, which gets at the ideas animating (and exploding at) the political conventions that summer of 1968. And if what you really want is more Sorkin, then there are better films: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/\"><em>Charlie Wilson’s War</em></a>, for instance, is one of my favorites, and he also worked on the screenplay for <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/\"><em>Moneyball</em></a>. </p>\n<p id=\"1dF3vo\">But the best courtroom drama of the last year is <em>Mangrove</em>, the first installment in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21563837/small-axe-review-amazon-mangrove-lovers-rock-red-white-blue-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen’s <em>Small Axe</em> quintet of films</a> (which are all streaming on Amazon Prime Video). Hits all the same notes but is far better in every way. Just watch it. You’ll see.</p>\n<p id=\"chnpUH\">The Trial of the Chicago 7 <em>is</em> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81043755\"><em>streaming on
