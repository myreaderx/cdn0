That grainy, transcendent photograph of our “mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam” became the central poetic image of his now-iconic <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/12/10/pale-blue-dot-motion-graphics/\"><em>Pale Blue Dot</em></a> meditation on our cosmic place and destiny, which in turn inspired Maya Angelou&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/09/a-brave-and-startling-truth-maya-angelou/\">&#8220;A Brave and Startling Truth&#8221;</a> &#8212; the staggering poem  that flew to space aboard the <em>Orion</em> spacecraft, inviting a fractured humanity to reach beyond our divisive ideologies and see ourselves afresh &#8220;on this small and drifting planet,&#8221; to face our capacities and contradictions, and finally see that &#8220;we are the possible, we are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A generation later, this spirit comes ablaze anew in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Come-Earth-Sophie-Blackall/dp/145213779X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>If You Come to Earth</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/if-you-come-to-earth/oclc/1197984236&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/sophie-blackall/\">Sophie Blackall</a> &#8212;

a particular child named Quinn, whom Sophie met while traveling around the world with UNICEF and Save the Children, and whose uncommon imagination fomented hers &#8212; the story is populated by drawings of other real-life children she met on her travels in India, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, a particular class of twenty-three kids she befriended in a Brooklyn public school, and her own real-life friends and neighbors. Animated by the children&#8217;s wild, wondrous, touching ideas about the most important things to communicate about our improbable, miraculous world to a visitor from another, the book radiates the

She invited people in her world &#8212; friends, neighbors, readers &#8212; to suggest color names. Being the storytelling animals we are, this seemingly simple invitation unloosed miniature memoirs of soulful, funny, tender, profoundly human moments in human lives, concentrated and consecrated by a particular color-memory. Among those shared by readers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sophieblackall/\" target=\"_blank\">her Instagram</a> &#8212; which is its own lighthouse of delight &#8212; was this story by an early childhood educator named <a href=\"https://www.berkshiremontessori.org/joey-chernila\" target=\"_blank\">Joey Chernila</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I was in high school, my grandmother Nettie came to live at my father&#8217;s house. It was just the three of us. Nettie, who was immensely kind and very funny, had begun to show signs of Alzheimer&#8217;s. She always worked with her hands and was a wonderful knitter. She&#8217;d knit sweaters, scarves, and espcailly caps. Her favorite color was an unearthly pink. Somewhere between the flesh of a wild salmon and an anorak put on a child who we don&#8217;t quite trust not to run away into the woods. </p>\n<p>As her attention span grew shorter, so too did her caps. They resembled yarmulke or the caps Marvin Gaye wore in the 70s. She could finish one in a day, and would give them out to all my teenager friends who were always about the house. Soon my small high school halls were dotted with people wearing these garishly colored tiny knit caps. Did the teachers worry that the kids were being pulled into a new kind of religious sect? </p>\n<p>In a way, we were. Nettie would pull us aside and berate us with her fiercely humanist maxims. Chief among them was this:</p>\n<p><em>Just be a human being.</em></p>\n<p>We got to hear that one a lot, because she didn&#8217;t know if she had told us that before and was old enough to not really care too much. Anyway&#8230; &#8220;Nettie&#8217;s Cap&#8221; is a nice name for a color.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Come-Earth-Sophie-Blackall/dp/145213779X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Paint_Colors.jpg?resize=680%2C851&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"851\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72168\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Paint_Colors.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Paint_Colors.jpg?resize=240%2C300&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Paint_Colors.jpg?resize=320%2C401&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Paint_Colors.jpg?resize=768%2C961&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Paint_Colors.jpg?resize=600%2C751&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>And so <em>Nettie&#8217;s Cap</em> became one of &#8220;the colors you need to paint everything in the world,&#8221; perched on the edge of the page just below the burnt-orange of <em>Mars</em>, opposite the forlorn algae-green of <em>Second Place</em>, and several chromatic continents northeast of <em>Slug Belly</em>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Come-Earth-Sophie-Blackall/dp/145213779X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE_blackall30.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72172\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE_blackall30.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE_blackall30.jpg?resize=240%2C160&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE_blackall30.jpg?resize=320%2C213&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE_blackall30.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE_blackall30.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>In her author&#8217;s afterword about the making of the book, Sophie reflects on our place in the cosmic scheme &#8212; a rocky planet orbiting a single star in a particular solar system, within a galaxy populated by billions of stars, within a known universe populated by billions of galaxies &#8212; and writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are lots of things I don&#8217;t know.

fortunate platform of old age, the eighteen-year-old Sylvia Plath &#8212; who never reached that fortunate platform, her life felled by the same conspiracy of chance and choice &#8212; contemplated these indelible forces in the guise of free will, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/27/sylvia-plath-journals-privilege-free-will/\">writing in her journal</a> that &#8220;there is such a narrow crack of it for man to move in, crushed as he is from birth by environment, heredity, time and event and local convention.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Two generations later, <strong>Maria Konnikova</strong> entered this eternal conundrum via an improbable path half chosen and half chanced into, emerging with insights into the paradoxes of chance and control, which neither strand alone could have afforded. </p>\n<p>Having devoted five years of doctoral work, with the creator of the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment\" target=\"_blank\">Marshmallow Experiment</a> as her advisor, to designing and performing psychology experiments probing how people&#8217;s perception of control in situations dictated by pure chance shapes decision-making and outcomes, she was suddenly life-thrust into a much more intimate empiricism. A period of successive losses rendered her the sole bread-winner of a family as a mysterious malady savaged her body without warning, gnawing at the fundaments of consciousness. </p>\n<p>In the midst of this maelstrom, she became interested in the world of poker. She entered it as a psychologist on a philosophical inquiry &#8212; how often are we actually in control when we think we are, how do we navigate uncertain situations with incomplete information, and how can we ever separate the product of our own efforts from the strokes of randomness governing the universe? She emerged an unexpected master of the game, master of her own mind in an entirely new way. </p>\n<p>The record of that experience became <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Bluff-Learned-Attention-Master/dp/052552262X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Biggest Bluff: How I Learned to Pay Attention, Master Myself, and Win</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/biggest-bluff-how-i-learned-to-pay-attention-master-myself-and-win/oclc/1178899093&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; an inspired investigation of &#8220;the struggle for balance on the spectrum of luck and control in the lives we lead, and the decisions we make,&#8221; partway between memoir, primer on the psychology of decision-making, and playbook for life. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_56849\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/02/salvador-dali-alices-adventures-in-wonderland/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/salvadordali_alice8.jpg?resize=680%2C978&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Queen’s Croquet Ground\" width=\"680\" height=\"978\" class=\"size-full wp-image-56849\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/salvadordali_alice8.jpg?w=1260&#38;ssl=1 1260w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/salvadordali_alice8.jpg?resize=240%2C345&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/salvadordali_alice8.jpg?resize=320%2C460&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/salvadordali_alice8.jpg?resize=768%2C1105&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/salvadordali_alice8.jpg?resize=600%2C863&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of Salvador Dalí&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/02/salvador-dali-alices-adventures-in-wonderland/\">forgotten folios</a> for a rare edition <em>Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having previously written about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/12/the-confidence-game-maria-konnikova/\">the psychology of confidence through the lens of con artists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/07/mastermind-maria-konnikova/\">the psychology of creativity through the lens of Sherlock Holmes</a>, she takes the same singular approach of erudition and perspicacity to the improbable test-bed of poker, lacing her elegant primers on probability and game theory with perfectly illustrative invocations of Dostoyevsky, Epictetus, Dawkins, Ephron, Kant. </p>\n<p>More than half a century after W. I. B.

You can’t calculate for dumb bad luck&#8230; My reasons for getting into poker in the first place were to better understand that line between skill and luck, to learn what I could control and what I couldn’t, and here was a strongly-worded lesson if ever there were: you can’t bluff chance.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Real life is not just about modeling the mathematically optimal decisions. It’s about discerning the hidden, the uniquely human. It’s about realizing that no amount of formal modeling will ever be able to capture the vagaries and surprises of human nature.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/30/tove-jansson-alice-in-wonderland/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tovejansson_alice10.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Moomins creator <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/12/tove-jansson-letters-tuulikki-pietila/\">Tove Jansson</a> from her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/30/tove-jansson-alice-in-wonderland/\">1966 edition</a> of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Drawing on the decision-making experiments she had conducted for her graduate work, she offers an empirical echo of neuroscientist Sam Harris&#8217;s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/25/sam-harris-free-will/\">our free-will experience of choice is only the illusion of choice</a>, recounting her utterly unexpected finding in these experimental investment scenarios:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over and over, people would overestimate the degree of control they had over events &#8212; smart people, people who excelled at many things, people who should have known better&#8230; The more they overestimated their own skill relative to luck, the less they learned from what the environment was trying to tell them, and the worse their decisions became&#8230; The illusion of control is what prevented real control over the game from emerging &#8212; and before long, the quality of people’s decisions deteriorated. They did what worked in the past, or what they had decided would work &#8212; and failed to grasp that the circumstances had shifted so that a previously successful strategy was no longer so. People failed to see what the world was telling them when that message wasn’t one they wanted to hear. They liked being the rulers of their environment. When the environment knew more than they did &#8212; well, that was no good at all. Here was the cruel truth: we humans too often think ourselves in firm control when we are really playing by the rules of chance.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/07/best-illustrations-alice-in-wonderland/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aliceinwonderland_zwerger13.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Lisbeth Zwerger for a <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/07/best-illustrations-alice-in-wonderland/\">special edition</a> of <em>Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>This cognitive glitch, she reasons, is not a personal failing of the individual but a fossil of the evolutionary history of our species &#8212; a species that survived by dealing with the immediate threats of particular environments, mistaking those isolated incidents for statistically representative distributions of common experience, mistaking in turn anecdote for data &#8212; a misapprehension that scars us modern humans with everything from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/08/04/walter-lippmann-public-opinion-stereotypes/\">the mental machinery of stereotypes</a> to the crooked inner calculus of gambling. She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The equation of luck and skill is, at its heart, probabilistic. And a basic shortcoming of our neural wiring is that we can’t quite grasp probabilities. Statistics are completely counterintuitive: our brains are simply not cut out, evolutionarily, to understand that inherent uncertainty. There were no numbers or calculations in our early environment &#8212; just personal experience and anecdote. We didn’t learn to deal with information presented in an abstract fashion, such as <em>tigers are incredibly rare in this part of the country, and you have a 2 percent chance of encountering one, and an even lower chance of being attacked</em>; we learned instead to deal with brute emotions such as <em>last night there was a tiger here and it looked pretty damn scary</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Millennia of evolution have hardly allayed our preference for anecdote over probability &#8212; a failure to internalize mathematical rules known in psychology as the <em>description‐experience gap</em>, leading to what the Nobel-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman has memorably described as our tendency to draw our confidence in our beliefs <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/30/daniel-kahneman-intuition/\">not from the quality of the evidence but from the coherence of the story we have constructed</a>. Numberless studies have demonstrated that the human distaste for numbers leads people to make decisions based not on the data they are shown but on the pattern-recognition of non-representative past experience we call intuition, gut feeling, hunch. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/04/the-big-green-book-robert-graves-maurice-sendak/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/thebiggreenbook_gravessendak9.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Maurice Sendak for <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/04/the-big-green-book-robert-graves-maurice-sendak/\"><em>The Big Green Book</em></a> by Robert Graves</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A central paradox magnifying our ineptitude at parsing probabilities is that, in everyday life, we only tend to notice chance when the dice roll counter to our expectations &#8212; we are congenitally blind to the silent tilling work of randomness for as long as it smooths reality in our favor. But the moment life grows rough and the topography of reality becomes unfamiliar, we begin coloring chance with emotional interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some of us imbue probability with emotion. It becomes luck: chance that has suddenly acquired a valence, positive or negative, fortuitous or unfortunate. Good or bad luck. A lucky or unlucky break. Some of us invest luck with meaning, direction, and intent. It becomes fate, karma, kismet &#8212; chance with an agenda. It was meant to be. Some even go a step further: predestination.

Picking up the gauntlet the titanic mathematician and computing pioneer John von Neumann threw down nearly a century ago with his revolutionary illumination of behavioral economics through game theory, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our experiences trump everything else, but mostly, those experiences are incredibly skewed: they teach us, but they don’t teach us <em>well</em>. It’s why disentangling chance from skill is so difficult in everyday decisions: it’s a statistical undertaking, and one we are not normally equipped to deal with. Which brings me to poker: Used in the right way, experience can be a powerful ally in helping to understand probabilistic scenarios&#8230; The correct systematic learning process can help you unravel chance from everything else in a way that no amount of cramming numbers or studying theory ever will.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Poker, unlike quite any other game, mirrors life. It isn’t the roulette wheel of pure chance, nor is it the chess of mathematical elegance and perfect information. Like the world we inhabit, it consists of an inextricable joining of the two. Poker stands at the fulcrum that balances two oppositional forces in our lives &#8212; chance and control. Anyone can get lucky &#8212; or unlucky &#8212; at a single hand, a single game, a single tournament. One turn and you’re on top of the world &#8212; another, you are cast out, no matter your skill, training, preparation, aptitude. In the end, though, luck is a short‐term friend or foe. Skill shines through over the longer time horizon.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The intricacies of the relationship between chance and skill, and how it shapes our experience of the world, is what <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Bluff-Learned-Attention-Master/dp/052552262X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Biggest Bluff</em></strong></a> goes on to examine through the curious universe of poker: how mathematics can depersonalize chance and furnish the emotional forbearance necessary not to let small fluctuations of fortune derail us; how the fascinating psychology of locus of control (whether we attribute our life-outcomes to external factors of chance or internal endowments of skill) affects those outcomes; how to wrest from our lack of agency a rational toolkit for not just surviving but thriving in uncertainty; how to live with the awful, humbling fact that however great our skill and however much it can mitigate the work of chance, it can never be enough to entirely undo it &#8212; and how to make of that fact not a sinkhole of helplessness but a portal of possibility. </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.

As a child, he told his stepsister that an ant&#8217;s life is as sweet to the ant as ours is to us and ardently chided the other boys for setting sea turtles on fire with that unthinking cruelty children at play can have. As a teenager, he defied his family&#8217;s tradition of considering basic literacy sufficient education for their line of work, sneaking away from his farm duties to read and study, so that a cousin would later remember him as &#8220;very lazy&#8230; always reading &#8212; scribbling &#8212; writing &#8212; ciphering &#8212; writing poetry &#038;c. &#038;c.” As a young adult, he came to see himself as cursed with the &#8220;peculiar misfortune&#8221; of dreaming dreams too large not to explode with disappointment. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abrahamlincoln.jpg?resize=680%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"abrahamlincoln\" width=\"680\" height=\"505\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55273\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abrahamlincoln.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abrahamlincoln.jpg?resize=240%2C178&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abrahamlincoln.jpg?resize=320%2C238&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abrahamlincoln.jpg?resize=768%2C570&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abrahamlincoln.jpg?resize=600%2C446&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abraham Lincoln</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Five years after leaving his father&#8217;s farm, the first detonation of depression shook the young man&#8217;s world. His legal studies strained him beyond capacity. Reading day and night, he grew emaciated. Meanwhile, a typhoid epidemic swept the land with a tidal wave of death, taking with it the life of Ann Rutledge &#8212; a young woman who uniquely understood Lincoln&#8217;s sensitivity and about whom he had come to care deeply &#8212; so deeply that no one around them quite understood the nature of their bond, though generations have taken the liberty of qualifying it, manufacturing an entire romantic mythos around a brittle skeleton of spare facts. </p>\n<p>Whatever the private reality of the relationship, it was in this period of strife and loss, surrounded by widespread death and stretched beyond his own creaturely limits, that Lincoln came to think seriously of suicide. The idea grew so intrusive, so actionable, that he no longer trusted himself to carry a pocket knife. Friends and neighbors watched his mental unraveling with growing concern, so alarmed to see him wander the woods aimlessly with his gun that they set up a suicide watch. </p>\n<p>Lincoln lived. But from that point on, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/13/keats-depression/\">like Keats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/19/tchaikovsky-letters-depession/\">like Tchaikovsky</a>, he suffered frequent visitations of deadly despair, the character-shaping power of which Joshua Wolf Shenk explores in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lincolns-Melancholy-Depression-Challenged-President/dp/0618551166/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Lincoln&#8217;s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/violet-the-life-and-loves-of-violet-gordon-woodhouse/oclc/855379939&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>\n<p>After that first rather public episode of suicidal depression, Lincoln learned to hide his heavy heart behind his famous humor, behind a facade of such cheerful levity that even those working most closely with him would never see him despondent or ill-tempered. But it spilled out obliquely, through the cracks of compassion: Reaching out to salve a friend&#8217;s savaging depression with his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/03/13/letters-of-consolation/\">great gift of consolation</a>, he wrote with a poignant familiarity of “that intensity of thought, which will some times wear the sweetest idea thread-bare and turn it to the bitterness of death.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64213\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/thoughts-silent-thoughts-of-time-and-space-and-death_framed-print?sku=s6-8967472p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=680%2C915&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"915\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64213\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=240%2C323&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=320%2C430&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=768%2C1033&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=600%2C807&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time and Space and Death.&#8221; Art by Margaret C.

It would take scholars 139 years to identify his authorship. With its haunting story-framing epigraph and its dramatic narration by a fictional character, it was Lincoln&#8217;s way of safely rehearsing in the darkest recesses of his imagination what it might be like to enact the central pull of suicide &#8212; the tempting illusion that total self-erasure is the only way to terminate the mental anguish nothing else has allayed. </p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>THE SUICIDE&#8217;S SOLILOQUY</strong></p>\n<p><em>The following lines were said to have been found near the bones of a man supposed to have committed suicide, in a deep forest, on the flat branch of the Sangamon, some time ago.</em></p>\n<p>Here, where the lonely hooting owl<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sends forth his midnight moans,<br />\nFierce wolves shall o&#8217;er my carcase growl,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or buzzards pick my bones.</p>\n<p>No fellow-man shall learn my fate,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or where my ashes lie;<br />\nUnless by beasts drawn round their bait,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or by the ravens&#8217; cry.</p>\n<p>Yes! I&#8217;ve resolved the deed to do,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And this the place to do it:<br />\nThis heart I&#8217;ll rush a dagger through,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though I in hell should rue it!</p>\n<p>Hell! What is hell to one like me<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who pleasures never knew;<br />\nBy <em>friends</em> consigned to misery,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By <em>hope</em> deserted too?</p>\n<p>To ease me of <em>this</em> power <em>to think</em>,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That through my bosom raves,<br />\nI&#8217;ll headlong leap from hell&#8217;s high brink,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And wallow in its waves.</p>\n<p>Though devils yell, and burning chains<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May waken long regret;<br />\nTheir frightful screams, and piercing pains,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will help me to <em>forget</em>.</p>\n<p>Yes! I&#8217;m prepared, through endless night,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To take that fiery berth!<br />\nThink not with tales of hell to fright<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Me, who am damn&#8217;d on earth!</p>\n<p>Sweet steel! come forth from your sheath,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And glist&#8217;ning, speak your powers;<br />\nRip up the organs of my breath,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And draw my blood in showers!</p>\n<p>I strike! It quivers in that heart<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which drives me to this end;<br />\nI draw and kiss the bloody dart,<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My last &#8212; my only friend!</p></blockquote>\n<p>This blackest despair was more than a poetic image for Lincoln. Three years later, when another acute episode of depression subsumed him and he came to see himself as the most miserable man on Earth, he arrived at the ultimate equation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He did get better. He did remember what we so frequently and dangerously forget when pressed under the leaden lid of depression &#8212; that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/02/27/bloom-depression/\">the light of being returns</a>. Like any great artist of life, Lincoln learned to transmute his suffering into fuel for building a more beautiful and light-filled world, turning the private anguish of his suicidal depression into a powerful political metaphor to mobilize his nation&#8217;s spirit. “If destruction be our lot,&#8221; he declaimed in one of his most powerful speeches, &#8220;we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” (Whitman &#8212; who reverenced Lincoln as &#8220;the greatest, best, most characteristic, artistic, moral personality&#8221; &#8212; echoed the sentiment with redoubled conviction across the epoch-stride of the Civil War in his prescient essay <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/24/walt-whitman-democratic-vistas/\"><em>Democratic Vistas</em></a>: “America, if eligible at all to downfall and ruin, is eligible within herself, not without.&#8221;) </p>\n<p>Living with his own depression, Lincoln understood intimately that what is true of the spirit of a person is true of the spirit of a people &#8212; our undoing always serves an invitation to learn new modes of making: making beauty, making meaning, making the life we want to live and the world we want to live it in. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66896\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AbrahamLincoln_AbrahamByers_1858.jpg?resize=680%2C898&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"898\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66896\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AbrahamLincoln_AbrahamByers_1858.jpg?w=931&#38;ssl=1 931w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AbrahamLincoln_AbrahamByers_1858.jpg?resize=240%2C317&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AbrahamLincoln_AbrahamByers_1858.jpg?resize=320%2C423&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AbrahamLincoln_AbrahamByers_1858.jpg?resize=768%2C1015&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AbrahamLincoln_AbrahamByers_1858.jpg?resize=600%2C793&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abraham Lincoln (Photograph by Abraham Byers)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Couple with two centuries of great writers &#8212; including Keats, Whitman, Thoreau, Carson, and Hansberry &#8212; on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/14/nature-depression/\">the surest salve for depression</a>, then revisit Tim Ferriss on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/12/08/tim-ferriss-tools-of-titans-depression/\">how he survived suicidal depression</a>, Mary Oliver&#8217;s spare and splendid <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/09/18/i-go-down-to-the-shore-mary-oliver/\">antidote to melancholy</a>, William Styron&#8217;s classic interior tour of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/09/depression-william-styron-darkness-visible/\">what depression is really like</a>, and this <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/10/29/the-shadow-elephant/\">tender illustrated meditation</a> on what it takes to unblue our sadnesses. </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.
