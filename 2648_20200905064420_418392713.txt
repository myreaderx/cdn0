My mom, <a href=\"https://studio7310.com/\">Cecelia Feld</a>, is an artist, and I have been around contemporary art my entire life. We prefer non-representational art from living artists. While we have paintings, sculptures, and photographs from artists who live all over the world, many of the artists are from the Western United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first met <a href=\"https://www.juliemaren.com/\">Julie Maren</a> through a gallery in Boulder on the Pearl Street Mall called MacLaren Markowitz Gallery. When the Internet and telecom bubble collapsed, the gallery ran into trouble, so Amy and I invested in it to help support it and keep it open. We met many artists in the ensuing years and expanded the Colorado artists we were collecting. MacLaren Markowitz ultimately closed, but many friendships remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve been slowly putting new art in our Aspen house. We didn&#8217;t want to fill it quickly, but rather savor the space and get comfortable with contemporary artists from the area, along with ones from the Western United States that we already collected. We have several beautiful pieces hanging from <a href=\"http://www.markcesark.com/\">Mark Cesark</a> (Carbondale) and <a href=\"https://www.christophermartingallery.com/\">Christopher Martin</a> (Aspen). And, when you are on a Zoom call with me, you are looking at a piece by <a href=\"https://clayjohnson.com/\">Clay Johnson</a> (Laramie, WY).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie installed her piece on Leap Day 2020, just before Covid hit. We were planning to be here for the summer but stayed in Boulder instead. We saw the installation in person for the first time a week ago, and it blew our minds. I&#8217;ve been spending a few minutes with it each morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1.jpeg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17758\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=150%2C113&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_8852-1-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&#38;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all the stress in the world right now, I&#8217;m looking for moments of beauty every day.

Who said professors at MIT didn&#8217;t have a sense of humor. Having known Ed for 35 years, he has a wicked one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has taken 50 years to transform MIT from its unique historic traditions to today&#8217;s recognition that forming new innovation-based companies is indeed the most powerful source of impact upon the world. In his praise for the book, MIT President Rafael Reif exclaims: “An entrepreneurship tornado continues to blow at MIT. The energy of entrepreneurship rises through our classrooms, labs, and centers. It is central to who we are as an institution for 50 years of extraordinary achievement.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first half of the book focuses upon MIT’s history of creating from scratch what they lovingly call the “MIT Entrepreneurial Ecosystem”. Much of what MIT has done has been literally copied by other institutions worldwide. Still more universities, regions, and countries have adopted MIT’s approaches as needed to fit their own surroundings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Structured in two parts, the book first showcases how the unique atmosphere at MIT encourages its innovative entrepreneurs to thrive. Then, with in-depth coverage of the founders and companies that pioneered four industries—biotechnology, the Internet, from CAD-CAM to robotics, and modern finance—plus many other successful firms, Ed analyzes how MIT’s most successful entrepreneurs have capitalized on that environment and culture to build companies that have lasted for decades. Both internal and external to MIT, the founders of these organizations and companies tell their own stories, describing their motivations, challenges, and outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opening cover page says clearly that all author royalties will be donated directly to endowment funds that support the MIT-wide entrepreneurship programs. Buy the book to learn more about the history and evolution of entrepreneurship at MIT while helping foster future entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://feld.com/archives/2020/09/book-celebrating-entrepreneurs.html\">Book: Celebrating Entrepreneurs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://feld.com\">Feld Thoughts</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?a=ywwWY7BP5rA:igsYN0Bftb8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?a=ywwWY7BP5rA:igsYN0Bftb8:ZGknBuXYpFs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?i=ywwWY7BP5rA:igsYN0Bftb8:ZGknBuXYpFs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FeldThoughts/~4/ywwWY7BP5rA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:52:38 +0000","feedId":2648,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"de699a7ea58ec970237ef52c6ea45048","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn68@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-44-12-853_1b1834a760d154ca.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"Brad Feld","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn68@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-44-12-853_1b1834a760d154ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FeldThoughts?i=ywwWY7BP5rA:igsYN0Bftb8:ZGknBuXYpFs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-44-14-022_c700d4b91ff06f06.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FeldThoughts/~4/ywwWY7BP5rA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-44-18-525_d76827c0e7f1e5ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288221460},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:43:41","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:43:41","title":"Endless Meaningless Words in Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital","link":"https://feld.com/?p=17714","description":"\n<p>I read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jwvevW\">On Truth and Untruth: Selected Writings</a> by Nietzsche yesterday. It was chewy, but soaked me in an interesting set of ideas about what words mean, along with a bunch of stuff around the concept of truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get a lot of inbound random email where I get asked a lot of questions, so I see lots of questions repeat or get asked in different ways. For example, I continually get asked some version of &#8220;How do I get a job as a VC&#8221; and point everyone at my partner Seth&#8217;s post <a href=\"https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2019/02/how-to-get-a-job-in-venture-capital.html\">How To Get a Job In Venture Capital</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning, as I was grinding through email, I saw a few questions that could be generally categorized as &#8220;Are we in a bubble?&#8221; There were different flavors, but if I summarized, it would be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Is the public market in a bubble?</li><li>Is VC in a bubble?</li><li>Are SPACs a bubble?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I see the word bubble, the phrase &#8220;Bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble&#8221; comes into my mind, which I know is not how the Macbeth Song of the Witches goes, but that&#8217;s just how my brain works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh &#8211; you want a brief interlude for the Song of the Witches? Ok &#8211; here it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Round about the cauldron go:<br>In the poisoned entrails throw.<br>Toad, that under cold stone<br>Days and nights has thirty-one<br>Sweated venom sleeping got,<br>Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot.</p><p><em>Double, double toil and trouble;<br>Fire burn and cauldron bubble.</em></p><p>Fillet of a fenny snake,<br>In the cauldron boil and bake;<br>Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br>Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br>Adder&#8217;s fork and blind-worm&#8217;s sting,<br>Lizard&#8217;s leg and owlet&#8217;s wing.<br>For a charm of powerful trouble,<br>Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.</p><p><em>Double, double toil and trouble;<br>Fire burn and cauldron bubble.</em></p><p>Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,<br>Witch&#8217;s mummy, maw and gulf<br>Of the ravin&#8217;d salt-sea shark,<br>Root of hemlock digg&#8217;d i’ the dark,<br>Liver of blaspheming Jew;<br>Gall of goat; and slips of yew<br>Sliver&#8217;d in the moon&#8217;s eclipse;<br>Nose of Turk, and Tartar&#8217;s lips;<br>Finger of birth-strangled babe<br>Ditch-deliver&#8217;d by a drab,<br>Make the gruel thick and slab:<br>Add thereto a tiger&#8217;s chaudron,<br>For the ingredients of our cauldron.</p><p><em>Double, double toil and trouble,<br>Fire burn and cauldron bubble.</em></p><p>Cool it with a baboon&#8217;s blood,<br>Then the charm is firm and good.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed that, now you know why I think of this phrase every time I hear the word bubble. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>My answer to the bubble question is, &#8220;I have no idea, and I don&#8217;t care.&#8221; I&#8217;ve never tried to time the markets.

The health crisis (the disease) created the economic crisis (our economy was in strong shape before Covid), which would accelerate a mental health crisis. In the US, we have a fourth crisis amplified &#8211; the racial equity crisis &#8211; which has been going on since the inception of our country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these are complex systems, they are interconnected and don&#8217;t have a deterministic outcome. There are endless unintended consequences from actions in one crisis that have long term and unexpected impacts on other of the crises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans are not built to be isolated in their homes for months at a time. Founders, who are already under immense pressure from many directions, now have to contend with that dynamic for themselves in an uncertain business environment, connected only by video conferencing and email to their teams, investors, and customers. At the same time, there is no relief from the endless intensity of creating and leading a business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be no surprise that the mental health part of the crisis is real and accelerating. Toss in the dissonance in our society. Some tech companies stock prices are at record highs, while established businesses are in a complete retreat or freefall. Many small businesses are on the verge of extinction &#8211; ponder all the local retail businesses and restaurants in your city. Local and state governments are under economic and functional stress. We have record unemployment and a macro communication environment (media, politics, news) that is divisive rather than unifying. We are in an election year in the US. Oh yeah, and the disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the stigma associated with mental health, especially among founders, is lessening. It&#8217;s still real, but more are talking about it. There are many more coaching options like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reboot.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reboot</a> to help founders, CEOs, and leaders through this. There are companies, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.meruhealth.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meru Health</a> (which we recently funded) that are working to make mental health services more broadly accessible and affordable. And, many leaders are speaking out regularly about their struggles with their mental health, making it much easier to start and navigate conversations about mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, I hope we are much more effective as a species around addressing and helping with mental health issues. The sooner we can eliminate the stigma around mental health, especially in entrepreneurship, the better.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"
