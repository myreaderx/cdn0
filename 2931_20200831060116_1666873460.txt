ACT NOW!\" wrote Moore.&#160;</p><p>He went on to claim that recent polling shows the race tightening in swing states.&#160;</p><p>In the post, Moore claimed that \"when CNN polled registered voters in August in just the swing states, Biden and Trump were in a virtual tie.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-august/index.html\">The August 17 CNN poll taken ahead of the party conventions</a> found that of registered voters in battleground states, 49% backed Biden and 48% Trump.</p><p>\"In Minnesota, it's 47-47. In Michigan, where Biden had a big lead, Trump has closed the gap to 4 points,\" continued Moore.&#160;</p><p>In a poll on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattMackowiak/status/1296520490635362307?s=20\">August 20, the GOP-leaning Trafalgar Group found Biden and Trump tied </a>at 47% in Minnesota, while an <a href=\"https://news.wisc.edu/battleground-state-poll-shows-biden-leading-trump-in-michigan-pennsylvania-and-wisconsin/\">August 20 poll by the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> found Biden with a five-point lead over Trump in Michigan.</p><p>The most recent battleground state poll, released by <a href=\"https://changeresearch.com/post/states-of-play-battleground-wave-12/\">CNBC-Change Research on Wednesday,</a> found that Biden currently leads Trump by 3 points in six battleground states, and his lead is narrowing.&#160;</p><p>Back in October 2016, as polls showed Clinton with a commanding lead over Trump and many pundits were writing off his chances, Moore warned that \"Trump's election is going to be the biggest 'f*** you' ever recorded in human history.\"</p><p>\"Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things to people who are hurting, and that's why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump,\" Moore said at the time.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>The kinds of jobs that can be done from home range from managers and supervisors to sales agents, and not all of these jobs require you to be a college graduate.</p><p>Jonathan Dingel and Brent Neiman from The University of Chicago <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/how-many-jobs-can-be-done-at-home/\">researched</a> the kinds of job that can potentially be done from home based on an occupation's characteristics and responsibilities found on <a href=\"https://www.onetonline.org/\">The Department of Labor's Occupational Information Network (O*NET)</a>.&#160;</p><p>Using two work questionnaires on O*NET, if an occupation met conditions like a \"majority of respondents say they work outdoors every day\" or \"performing general physical activities is very important,\" then the researchers classified this occupation as one that cannot be done from home. The full list of these kinds of questions can be found in their <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_White-Paper_Dingel_Neiman_3.2020.pdf\">white paper</a>.&#160;</p><p>To check this method, the researchers manually gave each occupation their own score. The O*NET and manual classifications were mostly the same, agreeing for about 85% of the jobs.</p><p>Athletes, coaches, umpires, and related workers were one of the jobs that did not match between the two assessments. The O*NET classification found these jobs can likely be done from home, while their manual classification believed these jobs are not suited for telework. Private detectives and investigators showed a similar difference.</p><p>Based on their O*NET method, they found about 37% of occupations can likely be done remotely.&#160;</p><p>Given the large number of people working from home during the pandemic, Business Insider decided to look at high-paying remote jobs that don't require a college education. To do this, we used The University of Chicago's classification of jobs that likely can be done from home based on the O*NET classification scheme and found those where the typical minimum requirement is a high school diploma or its equivalent, or does not have a particular educational requirement. Of these occupations, we looked at those that make more than $53,490, the average annual salary of all occupations as of May 2019.&#160;</p><p>The following are the 16 highest-paying jobs that you can do from home that don't require a college degree based on O*NET classifications. Education and occupational data are from the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t16.

sip of summer... with a gin, a splash of tonic, and a wedge of lime, of course.</p><p>Gin is a juniper-infused distilled spirit that hails originally from the British Isles. There are a number of different gin styles and classifications, but what they all have in common is the predominant flavor of juniper berries. After that, gin producers concoct their own combination of \"botanicals,\" which are other natural ingredients and flavorings, to give their own distinct gin spin.</p><p>\"Like most things in the food and beverage world, deciding which is the 'best' or 'good' is simply a matter of taste and flavor preference,\" said Henrik Muehle, the general manager of London's Flemings Mayfair Hotel and a board member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. The five-star hotel is known for the personal \"gin bars\" that they stock in guests' suites with a variety of small batch gins. \"For me, the hallmarks of any 'good' gin come down to the distillation process and the botanicals.\"</p><p>To start, he says, how the gin is distilled becomes the first essential piece that creates the base on top of which the juniper and other botanicals will be added.</p><p>\"The better the distillation process, the more pure the base will be,\" he said. \"A good gin with the right amount of botanicals, simply needs a bit of citrus and tonic to bring out all the natural flavors.\"</p><p>Today there are hundreds of gins, from the big name brands to the small, craft distilleries. We've reached out to several spirits experts to determine which gins are the ones you need to know right now.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t1.

Muehle adds that other botanicals include juniper, citrus, and floral notes, giving it a clean and aromatic taste.</p><p>\"While this gin makes particularly good martini, I personally like this served with elderflower tonic, garnished with a slice of green apple,\" he said.</p>\n\t3.

With so many different botanicals, it is easy to pair it with other ingredients to make several styles of cocktails.</p>\n\t15. Drumshanbo Gunpowder Gin\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ee3925e988ee328c7587a45?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Drumshanbo Gunpowder Gin\" height=\"2048\" width=\"1365\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Drumshanbo Gunpowder Gin.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Drumshanbo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>What draws most people into <a href=\"https://drumshanbogunpowderirishgin.com/\">Drumshanbo Gunpowder Gin</a> is the name itself. \"When I saw 'gunpowder,' all I could think of was the smell of firecrackers, but it intrigued me enough to taste it,\" said Procida. \"The name itself is actually in reference to the gunpowder green tea from China, which is used as one of its botanicals and one of its predominant flavors.\"</p><p>Other ingredients include juniper from Macedonia, orris root from Morocco, cardamom from India, and others. Procida favors this gin, calling it \"art in a bottle.\" \"For a boutique hotel that enjoys exploring the world of craft ingredients, this gin is the closest thing to craft you will get,\" he said.</p><p><br /><br /></p>\n\t16.

Its London Dry Gin is classic and bold, with floral notes on the nose, a strong juniper-forward taste, and a finish that hints of lemon. The Lemon Drizzle Gin is more sweet on the nose, with hints of vanilla and a licorice finish. The Zesty Orange Ginhas more of a tangy finish, with a hint of sweet cinnamon.</p><p>\"When it comes to gin I prefer a classic, juniper forward London Dry style for icy cold martini. Sipsmith Gin is one of my favorites for everything from martinis and Negronis, to gin &#38; tonics,\" said Prairie Rose, a Wine and Spirit Education Trust (WSET)-trained drinks writer and podcast host. \"It has a classic blueprint, but with a sexy, fresh, and modern quality.\"</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Biden issued a statement on the violence that broke out in Portland, Oregon, Saturday night that culminated in a man being shot and killed after supporters of President Donald Trump clashed with Black Lives Matter demonstrators in the city's downtown.</p><p>In the lengthy statement, Biden flatly condemned the violence at the protest as \"unacceptable ... whether on the left or the right.\"</p><p>\"I challenge Donald Trump to do the same,\" the statement reads. \"It does not matter if you find the political views of your opponents abhorrent, any loss of life is a tragedy.\"</p><p>Biden continued on to warn against becoming a \"country at war with ourselves\" that \"accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you.\"</p><p>\"But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are,\" the statement says.</p><p>Biden pointed to Trump's divisive rhetoric, which most recently included a flood of tweets on Sunday taking aim at Portland, particularly Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler, and demanding that the National Guard deploy to the city in response to protesters.</p><p>\"What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters? He is recklessly encouraging violence,\" Biden wrote.</p><p>\"He may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong &#8211; but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is,\" the statement says.</p><p>The statement then said the \"job of a president is to lower the temperature. To bring people who disagree with one another together. To make life better for all Americans, not just those who agree with us, support us, or vote for us.\"</p><p>Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield echoed the statement's pressure on Trump in an appearance on <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/lara-trump-on-strategy-for-final-stretch-of-campaign-kate-bedingfield-on-civil-unrests-impact-on-race-for-white-house\">\"Fox News Sunday,\"</a> where she accused the president of \"inciting violence\" by encouraging aggression among his supporters in the protests of recent months.</p><p>White House chief of staff Mark Meadows defended Trump's response in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" where host Chuck Todd pressed the aide on the president's refusal to condemn violence among his supporters.</p><p>\"The president's on the side of law enforcement and the rule of law,\" <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-law-enforcement-and-the-rule-of-law-2020-8\">Meadows said</a>.</p><p>\"These are people that every single night conduct violent acts,\" Meadows said of demonstrators. \"And it is in Democrat cities. You know, you want to talk about Donald Trump's America. Most of Donald Trump's America is peaceful.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

It was the first house swap we'd ever done. We traded our home, a 667-square-foot sea view apartment with terrace in Villefranche-sur-Mer, on the French Riviera, for a house four times the size with a garden, in a village in the valley between Grenoble and Chamb&#233;ry, in the French Alps.&#160;</p><p>I know it looks like we scored the best deal. But the truth was that we've swapped a sea breeze for a place everyone has told me is the hottest part of France in summer &#8212; and there wasn't even a fan, let alone air conditioning, in the house.</p><p>The first night, we all struggled to sleep because of the heat. As I laid awake, I wondered if maybe our friends and family had been right: were we crazy to have handed over our home to a stranger for 18 days? \"Weren't we worried about them touching our belongings?\" people had asked before we left.</p><p>For us, the incentive was financial: As a family of four, we've saved at least &#8364;2,500 (around $3,000) on the price of a lengthy vacation rental this summer &#8212; and that's a conservative estimate.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47b452cd2fec00296a47e2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The author with her two daughters and husband.

The process to sign up and create a profile was easy. After writing a description about our apartment and our neighborhood, I uploaded some photos and paid the&#160; &#8364;125 ($148) <a href=\"https://homelink.org/fr/join\">annual fee</a>. (For US members, the annual fee is $99).&#160;</p><h2><strong>It wasn't long before we started to receive exchange offers</strong></h2><p>\"We always love to go to Villefranche for a holiday, so let us know if you fancy a week or so in London,\" one member wrote. In total, we had offers from England, Wales, Ireland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Germany, the USA, and France.</p><p>In the end, we decided on the first inquiry we had received, from a retired teacher in the French Alps. It was the pictures of the trampoline, swing set and outdoor playhouse that sold us. \"The girls will love the space,\" my husband said. Plus, Grenoble was just five hours away and the 250-mile drive would cost only about &#8364;80 ($95) each way in fuel and tolls. The listing also welcomed animals, so we could bring our cat.</p><h2><strong>As our first exchange, it felt wise to stay close to home in case anything went wrong</strong></h2><p>We signed the agreement in late January before any major COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. With hindsight, we can now see how fortunate our decision to stay in France this summer was.</p><p>Our home is one of approximately 8,000 listed in 70 countries on the website, Homelink's UK director Caroline Connolly told me via email. \"Quite a few members have hidden their listing at the moment due to COVID-19 travel restrictions,\" Connolly said.</p><p>Connolly explained that swaps are often arranged six to nine months in advance. \"A lot of exchanges were canceled early on,\" she wrote.&#160;</p><p>We had our moments of doubt, too, particularly as the COVID infection rate <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/french-riviera-pandemic-party-problem-saint-tropez-marseille-2020-8\">crept up again in France</a> in the weeks leading up to our departure.&#160;</p><p>But, as the usual crowds of August tourists started to descend on our village, we realized we would actually feel safer there than at home.</p><h2><strong>We arrived at a three-story stone house, which the owner said dates from the Renaissance</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47b3f8cd2fec00296a47dd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Chrissie McClatchie swapped an apartment in the south of France for a big house with a garden in Grenoble\" height=\"2249\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>McClatchie&#39;s family swapped an apartment in the south of France for a big house with a garden in Grenoble.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chrissie McClatchie</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>The property sits at the foot of the Chartreuse mountain range. It's full of character, but it's also big and quite creaky. This was our exchange partner's 40th exchange and it showed: I found a welcome hamper in the kitchen and there are notes and instructions stuck all around the house. In the living room, folders of tourist information were spread out across the sofa. I wondered how I would ever keep the house clean.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47b527db1ed00029714334?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Chrissie McClatchie Around the house notices such as these ones, about what use each pile of towels were for, were stuck to the walls.\" height=\"2274\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Around the house notices such as these, about what use each pile of towels were for, were stuck to the walls.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chrissie McClatchie</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But she didn't tell us everything, especially that her road is being dug up this summer. Most mornings we were woken by the sound of diggers driving past the bedroom windows. During the day, we often found machinery parked in the driveway. The road was covered in loose stones that bounce off the undercarriage of our car every time we left the house.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47b57cdb1ed00029714339?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Every time we opened the gates, we were reminded of the roadworks Chrissie McClatchie\" height=\"2249\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Every time we opened the gates, we were reminded of the roadworks.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chrissie McClatchie</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I found it hard to relax. It didn't help that soon after we arrived her two goldfish died, despite following their care instructions to a tee.</p><p>My husband was right when he said: \"The problem is this place isn't ours, so I can't settle into it.\" I didn't want to be that family &#8212; you know, the one that breaks heirlooms (or kills pets).</p><p>Luckily, my daughters were oblivious to all this. Our exchange partner has three grandchildren and boxes of their toys were left out for our children to play with.

Definitely.</p><p>We were able to vacation in a house and garden in the heart of the French Alps without paying anything more than the Homelink registration fee, and the fuel and tolls to get there and back. It doesn't get much better than that, really.</p><h2><strong>Interested in a home exchange? Here are five things to consider:</strong></h2><ul><li>In practice, most exchangers are homeowners. \"Renters can exchange on the proviso that their landlord (and any associated mortgage and/or insurance companies) are happy with the arrangements,\" Connolly said.</li><li>You can specify dates and/or set preferred destinations, or leave either option open. Some listings offer a 'non-simultaneous' exchange, which means you don't have to swap homes on the exact same dates.&#160;</li><li>Your house doesn't have to be in pristine condition. \"Have a spring clean and declutter &#8211; you don't need a show home, but it should be clean and comfortable,\" Connolly said.</li><li>If you are travelling as a family, consider searching for an exchange partner with children of a similar age. For us, arriving at a house already equipped for play was invaluable.</li><li>If you are flying to your exchange destination, look for a listing that offers a car in the swap as well, as that will save on car rental fees.</li></ul><p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrissieNice\">Chrissie McClatchie</a>&#160;is a freelance journalist who writes about luxury, lifestyle, and travel with a

And we'll also make sure that our guests knows that those top items and that great value is going to be available throughout the season,\" Cornell said, emphasizing that the store's same-day fulfillment options would give shoppers flexibility on the timing of their shopping.&#160;</p><p>Black Friday as a shopping holiday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-is-dead-because-of-discounting-2018-10\">has been declining in importance</a> over the last several years as spending continues to move online and discounts become more prevalent year-round.&#160;</p><p>Still, beginning holiday deals in October represents a big shift to a seasonal schedule that usually sees retailers double down on the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. A number of retailers, including Walmart and Best Buy, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-closing-their-doors-on-thanksgiving-full-list-2020-7\">have joined Target in saying</a> they would keep stores closed on Thanksgiving.</p><p>Nordstrom said in its own earnings call on Tuesday that while it would likely stop short of decorating stores for Christmas before Thanksgiving, it would make gifts available earlier in the fall than usual.&#160;</p><p>\"I think it's pretty clear that there's an opportunity for us to sell gifts prior to Thanksgiving,\" Pete Nordstrom, president and chief brand officer at Nordstrom, said during the call.&#160;</p><p>The changes aren't just about physical stores, though. Shipping volumes&#160;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-retail-shipping/fearing-shipping-crunch-retailers-set-earliest-ever-holiday-sale-plans-idUSKBN25H158\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"d5def91ff01fbce141d67c890dd74f91\">have been unusually high</a> as consumers opt to shop online and largely stay home amid the ongoing pandemic.</p><p>Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works parent L Brands similarly said in earnings that it would spread its holiday promotions over a longer period of time rather than concentrate them in the fourth quarter, when it typically sees the \"majority\" of its annual sales and profits due to gift-buying.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-shopping-could-bring-issues-for-retailers-execs-2020-8\">The company said</a> it would do so because of \"traffic constraints imposed by social distancing protocols in stores and capacity restraints in our direct channel distribution centers,\" adding that it had a \"very cautious outlook about our ability to manage our typical holiday volumes.\"&#160;</p><p>Complicating matters, UPS, FedEx, and the US Postal Service <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fedex-ups-post-office-add-surcharges-before-busy-holiday-season-2020-8\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"6684a451bade7b638831eb0809ad190d\">have all announced</a> surcharges on holiday shipping that will go into effect later this year. Spreading deals out over a larger period of time could help retailers better manage the impact of those surcharges.&#160;</p><p>In Kohl's earnings call, CFO Jill Timm referred to the surcharges as a \"headwind\" and said the company is working through alternatives to avoid them. Kohl's is also looking to get holiday shopping going in October.</p><p>The pandemic has disrupted the usual retail calendar in more ways than one. The back-to-school shopping season, for example, doesn't seem to have provided the sales surge that certain retailers usually see, as distance learning has continued for many students across the country.&#160;</p><p>Abercrombie &#38; Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/abercrombie-fitch-anf-reports-q2-2020-surprise-profit.html\">told CNBC</a> that she expects both back-to-school and holiday shopping to stretch on for longer than usual. She called the trend a \"flattening of the curve.\"&#160;</p><p>\"Maybe the peak [around] Black Friday isn't as big, but there is still a lot of opportunity in December to do a lot of business,\" Horowitz told CNBC.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

But by all indications, American diets have moved more toward convenient and affordable foods in recent months.&#160;</p><p>During lockdown, the sales of many fast food products have skyrocketed, with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hot-dog-sales-soar-as-best-quarantine-food-during-pandemic-2020-5\">hot dog sales increasing by more than 120%</a> in March year-on-year.&#160;</p><p>However, it isn't just comfort cravings that are causing Americans to eat more unhealthy food. People have less time and money to invest in cooking nutritious meals &#8212; during the pandemic, more jobs have been lost than at any time since the Great Depression.&#160;</p><p>Grocery prices, which rose by about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/grocery-food-prices-skyrocketing-coronavirus-recession-unemployment-bonus-benefits-expire-2020-8\">3.6% from April to July,</a> may have also contributed to increased fast food consumption.&#160;&#160;</p><p>It isn't just the price that makes fast food attractive. Parents are juggling working and looking after their kids who are spending more time at home. The American Camp Association says 80% percent of overnight camps and 40% of day camps have remained shut this summer because of lockdown. These time-strapped Americans are turning to the convenience of takeout food, and many delivery services are soaring. Domino's reported that its US same-store sales <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/08/12/coronavirus-food-trends-takeout-delivery-pizza-dominos-covid/\">rose by 16% in the second quarter of 2020</a>, and in the first half of the year generated $240 million in net income - 30% higher than in 2019.</p><p>In the UK, there are similar concerns that obesity rates will rise because of the pandemic. To support the hospitality industry the government introduced the \"Eat Out to Help Out\" scheme in August, where diners at eligible restaurants, cafes and bars can receive 50% off the cost of their meal. This is subsidized by the government. The offer was used more than 64 million times within its first three weeks, and UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that this program is supporting nearly 2 million employees in the hospitality sector.</p><p>However, fast-food restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC are eligible for the scheme. This has brought widespread concerns that it will accelerate UK obesity rates, with the National Obesity Forum arguing that it would be a ''green light to promote junk food.\"</p><p>This increased fast food consumption during lockdown, in turn, is making people more at risk from COVID-19. Obese individuals &#8212; those with a BMI over 30 &#8212; are 113% more likely to be hospitalized from the virus, and have a 48% higher risk of death, according to <a href=\"https://www.unc.edu/posts/2020/08/26/obesity-linked-with-higher-risk-for-covid-19-complications/\">a study</a> by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p><p>Some countries are taking desperate steps to fight this rise in obesity. Recently Oaxaca became the first state in Mexico to ban the sale of junk food and sugary drinks to children. Businesses who break the new law can be fined and risk closure, and their owners can even face time in jail. This isn't the first radical measure introduced in the country to combat its childhood obesity rate, which is among the highest in the world. In 2014 a country-wide tax on sugary drinks and junk food was introduced. Despite this, 73% of Mexicans are currently classified as overweight, <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/about/secretary-general/heavy-burden-of-obesity-mexico-january-2020.htm\">according to the OECD</a>. This figure was just 20% in 1996.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

It's harder to build trust with customers. It's harder to raise money from investors. And it's harder to build authority with employees. When I started my restaurant-technology business, people at&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/trade-shows\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/trade-shows\">trade shows</a>&#160;would look me up and down, roll their eyes, and walk away &#8212; often saying something condescending about my age.&#160;</p><p>But&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/steve-jobs\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/steve-jobs\">Steve Jobs</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/bill-gates\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/bill-gates\">Bill Gates</a>, and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/larry-page\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/larry-page\">Larry Page</a> started their companies at ages 20, 21, and 24 respectively. <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/apple\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/apple\">Apple</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/microsoft\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/microsoft\">Microsoft</a>, and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/google\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/google\">Google</a>&#160;are now collectively worth over $2.7 trillion. Each one of them leveraged their&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/youth\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/youth\">youth</a> to their advantage, and turned that weakness into a strength.&#160;</p><p>So did I.&#160;</p><p>In fact, I now believe that being a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/young-entrepreneur\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/young-entrepreneur\">young entrepreneur</a>&#160;can be a secret weapon. Here's why:</p><h2>1. You aren't trapped by the existing ways of doing things</h2><p>Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said, \"Don't be trapped by dogma &#8212; which is living with the results of other people's thinking.\"&#160;</p><p>When you're young, your perspective on the world is fresh. Whereas others have spent years learning how things are, everything is new to you. You have no choice but to think about things from scratch. You can think more clearly about what's required to solve problems today, without having the dated reasoning of yesterday, because you haven't been conditioned to believe things have to be the way they are.</p><p>For example, when I decided to help restaurants grow using digital marketing, most people would have done it the \"usual\" way: building an agency full of consultants and doing everything manually. This is how it had been done since digital marketing became a thing in 1998.</p><p>But I wasn't limited by that way of thinking. I never even considered doing it manually. I went straight to building technology to automate it and optimize it, and the result was exponentially greater outcomes for our customers and higher profits for our business.</p><h2>2. It's the best time to take risks</h2><p>It's hard to make something from nothing &#8212; to build a sustainable business &#8212; and it's really risky.&#160;</p><p>The best time to do it is when you're young. Larry Page, who was 24 when he founded the internet giant Google, once said, \"I&#160;encourage you to take a little more&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/risk\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/risk\">risk</a>&#160;in life. If you do it often enough, they will really pay off.\"</p><p>When you're a young entrepreneur, you don't have a family depending on you, or a mortgage to pay. You haven't gotten used to living a fancy life.&#160;</p><p>So you have the freedom to take big risks, which may not pay off.&#160;</p><p>It's the time in life when you generally have the least to lose. I'm now 20, and the companies I've built over the past seven years have collectively reached millions of users. My company was recently valued at over $13,000,000.&#160;</p><p>But I still drive a modest car, live on groceries, wear cheap clothing, don't vacation, live as a minimalist, and keep my expenses very low so that I can take bigger risks and compound my capital. The money my competitors are putting into big salaries and fancy lifestyles I invest in building a bigger business.</p><h2>3.&#160;\"People don't take you seriously at first. But when they do, they go overboard.\"</h2><p>That's a direct quote from Bill Gates, who founded tech giant Microsoft when he was 20 years old. He has since created over 144,000 jobs and created $1.06 trillion in market value.</p><p>Gates says that people were skeptical of him at first because of his age, but that when they realized he knew what he was talking about, they became extremely enthusiastic and tried to work with him as much as possible. His age became a part of the story that helped sell customers, because they enjoyed feeling like they were supporting a young prodigy and genius.&#160;</p><p>I've had that same experience. Billion-dollar brands who were skeptical at first became extremely enthusiastic and supportive once they saw that I knew what I was talking about. They liked helping a young person. Top business leaders like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/sean-rad\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/sean-rad\">Sean Rad</a>&#160;(founder of Tinder) and Greg Creed (CEO of Yum Brands) might&#160;have ignored me if I was older, but they ended up sharing fantastic advice and becoming mentors.&#160;</p><p>My age became an advantage because it was a point of differentiation. It reminded them of when they were young and just getting started.</p><h2>4. You have more time to fail</h2><p>Success comes with a lot of failures. And failures suck. They can feel like wasted time. But they're also inevitable when pursuing success. As the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, said, \"<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/failure\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ent-tags\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/failure\">failure</a>&#160;and invention are inseparable twins.\"</p><p>And it's best to fail fast when you're young. I've personally experienced some emotional punches in the face. My first project &#8212; a Facebook-like network for my sixth-grade class &#8212; was shut down by school authorities in a matter of weeks. My second one &#8212; a popular Minecraft server network &#8212; was threatened by Microsoft. Along the way, people that I thought I could count on let me down. I spent months on initiatives that utterly failed. I flew across the country for trade shows that didn't get me any customers. I embarrassed myself publicly again and again. Even though each failure was frustrating at the time, I was able to grab lessons from each experience and move on, with more time left to do better in the future. I'm glad I did.</p><p>So yes, being a young entrepreneur is especially challenging. It's harder to get others to believe in you, and it's harder for most young people to believe that they can be successful, since they often see themselves as just kids.&#160;</p><p>But our youth is also a secret weapon with powerful advantages if you learn to recognize them.&#160;</p><p>So don't stall your start and use your age as an excuse. None of the greats do.</p><p>Go. Get started. Now is the best time.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-being-a-young-entrepreneur-can-be-an-advantage-2020-8'>Business

Make no mistake, Trump is not the law and order President. He is the lawless and disorder President.</p><h2><strong>Lawless</strong></h2><p>Our \"law and order\" president has consistently shown a disregard for the \"law\" portion of that idea throughout his time in office.</p><p>He has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/politics/trump-pardons.html\">abused the pardon power</a> to shrug his shoulders at corruption - perhaps because it's fundamental to his life's work.

He rewarded <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-pardons-commutations.html\">Roger Stone</a>'s silent loyalty with commutation. His Justice Department dropped charges against Michael Flynn <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/08/852582068/mike-flynn-pleaded-guilty-why-is-the-justice-department-dropping-the-charges\"><em>after </em>Flynn pleaded guilty to the charges</a>. And with Steve Bannon's days of freedom <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/nyregion/steve-bannon-arrested-indicted.html\">in peril</a>, it feels as if the question isn't if Trump will pardon him but when.</p><p>Instead of standing up for truth in justice, Trump bristles at perjury charges - such as when Rudy Giuliani cried \"<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/08/08/trump-legal-team-responds-to-mueller-giuliani-bash-wolf-vpx.cnn\">perjury trap</a>\" to explain why the president would not be interviewed by Robert Mueller. Truth is truth, despite Giuliani's <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/402527-giuliani-truth-isnt-truth\">claim to the contrary</a>, and there's no need to claim \"perjury trap\" when the facts are on your side.</p><p>Trump has even built lawlessness into his public policy. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/reps-22-foreign-governments-have-spent-money-trump-properties-n1015806\">Dozens of officials from other countries</a> have spent money at his properties, likely in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.

The Republican-led US Senate Intelligence Committee did what Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to do: prove decisively that Trump's campaign <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/24/senate-intelligence-committees-report-really-is-damning/\">colluded with Russia</a>. Meanwhile, there is strong evidence that Trump also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/14/evidence-that-trump-broke-campaign-finance-laws/\">broke campaign finance laws</a> that same year by participating in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">hush-money payments to women</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, some of his crimes in office would be too <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/26/20885201/trump-ukraine-whistleblower-complaint-hearing\">clear and </a>obvious for Trump to slink away from entirely. He was of course impeached -- but not convicted -- of crimes that can be punishable by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/trump-crimes-law/\">several years in prison</a>.&#160;</p><p>Despite his stain on history, Trump seems ever <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/23/790687293/trump-appears-to-be-emboldened-by-house-impeachment-vote\">more emboldened</a> to cross legal and ethical lines.</p><h2><strong>Disordered</strong></h2><p>President Trump also fails on the second half of his \"law and order\" claim.,&#160;</p><p>His words and actions don't help maintain order but rather sow division, unrest, and chaos.&#160;</p><p>He speaks out against an \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQQDc7gU3YA\">angry mob</a>\" of peaceful protesters but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIs2L2nUL-0\">encourages mob violence</a> at his rallies. He calls himself an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-speech-dc-ally-to-protesters-police-tear-gas-photos-2020-6\">ally to peaceful protesters</a> but sends federal troops to tear gas<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-st-johns-church-bible.html\"> them</a> so he can have a photo op. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216356280933273600\">calls on foreign leaders</a> not to kill their protesters but warns Americans that \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">when the looting starts, the shooting starts.</a>\"&#160;</p><p>It's never been about order. It's a faux strength masking a President's deep insecurities.&#160;</p><p>A president who <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-claims-he-has-legal-right-meddle-doj-former-officials-say-it-would-grossly-improper-1487399\">openly meddles with the Justice Department</a> cannot be a shield for our nation. A president who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/us/nationwide-protests-saturday/index.html\">calls peaceful demonstrators \"thugs\"</a> but sees \"<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/\">very fine people on both sides</a>\" in Charlottesville cannot restore \"order\" to a nation awakened to racial injustice.&#160;</p><p>If Donald Trump were truly a man of order, he would unequivocally condemn this week's <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/26/jacob-blake-shooting-gun-battle-in-kenosha-on-third-night-of-unrest\">murder of protesters</a> allegedly at the hands of a young <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/news/513858-kenosha-shooting-suspect-attended-trump-rally-in-january-report\">supporter</a>.

But by now we know he's not capable.</p><p>Trump claiming the mantle of law and order is like the US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/8/26/21402124/rnc-coronavirus-past-tense-larry-kudlow\">claiming victory over COVID-19</a>. It immediately fails the smell test.&#160;&#160;</p><p>There are many words to describe heads of state who freely bend, flout, and manipulate laws for personal and political ends. Think dictator or strongman, not president.&#160;</p><p>Trump's past and present prove that he is the last person capable of hoisting the law and order banner, and the last person we need in the White House for four more years.

So Pompeo's remarks provided more proof that he genuinely believes that those laws don't apply to him, and that he's a made man as long as Trump's \"America First\" vision of the world prevails.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b92d6e00ce5f592208b4ecb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Pompeo\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Pompeo speaks at State Department headquarters, May 1, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/953385806\" target=\"_blank\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, said this week that his committee would launch an investigation into whether Pompeo's RNC convention speech from the rooftop of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem violated the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7323\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hatch Act</a>, a federal statute that bars civil servants, including Cabinet secretaries, from mixing their official government duties with partisan politics.</p><p>But like New York City's one-time mafia kingmaker, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/john-gotti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Gotti</a>, who repeatedly escaped prosecution, Pompeo has played the role of an untouchable and loyal mafioso, enforcing Trump's new world disorder and repeatedly testing the limits of the rule of law since his appointment as America's top diplomat in 2018.</p><p>Pompeo and his close associates have twice been the subjects of investigations into misconduct at the State Department.</p><p>First, there was the <a href=\"https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/3/7/371f6cc5-e8ff-4107-9eb3-58d58e85f216/D61CA667E291A5DB4139B057A98A3ACD.hfac-dem-letter-to-ig-investigation-on-emergency-arms-to-saudi-arabia.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State Department inspector general's congressionally mandated inquiry</a> into whether the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs overrode a vote by Congress last summer to block the sale of $8.1 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. Then, there was the investigation into allegations that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-wife-susan-ethics-taxpayer-money-2020-7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pompeo and his wife routinely ordered his State Department staff</a> to run personal errands on his behalf, and used State Department resources to enhance his political profile.</p><p>So far, Pompeo has managed to escape accountability for these alleged abuses of power and government resources, in part by appearing to commit more of them.</p><p>First, he convinced Trump to fire the State Department's inspector general, Steve Linick, who was investigating him. Then, Linick's replacement, Acting Inspector General Stephen Akard, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/08/05/acting-state-department-inspector-general-resigns-after-less-than-three-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abruptly resigned in early August</a>, though he was, in any case, <a href=\"https://www.academyofdiplomacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DG-Letter-to-SFRC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apparently held in poor regard by many in the US diplomatic corps</a>.</p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee has since taken up an investigation into Linick's firing. But with the Republicans in firm control of the Senate in what is shaping up to be a precarious election year for endangered incumbents, not much is likely to come of the effort to hold Pompeo's feet to the fire this year.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5bc5f45bdff09410742ab2c8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Pompeo\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Pompeo with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Leah Millis/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>America's top diplomat has at the same time been a key frontline warrior in Trump's unwinnable trade war of attrition with China, while playing small ball on the much more winnable \"tech wars\" by imposing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/pompeo-untrusted-chinese-apps-should-be-removed-from-us-stores.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bans on popular Chinese-owned social media apps TikTok and WeChat</a>.</p><p>In his convention speech, Pompeo also cheerily reminded the world that Trump's series of friendly summits with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un helped \"lower the temperature\" with the regime in Pyongyang, while carefully eliding the fact that <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">North Korea has carried out 52 missile tests since Trump took office</a> in January 2017, according to the nonpartisan <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nuclear Threat Initiative</a>.</p><p>There are 46 other countries on the Asian continent other than North Korea and China, including Turkey, Japan, India and Pakistan, which constitute by far America's most consequential, if at times inconsistent, partners in a wide region where geopolitical competition between the US and China is likely to be the most intense for generations to come.</p><p>As it is, tensions between China and India over the disputed Himalayan border territory of Ladakh only seem to be worsening, with India's defense chief, Gen. Bipin Rawat, <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/08/ladakh-standoff-indias-defense-chief-notes-military-option-on-the-table/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying that military options remain on the table</a>. Given Pakistan's close diplomatic relations with Beijing, and its dependence on China for military goods and trade, the high-stakes standoff between Chinese and Indian soldiers on the world's rooftop sets up the possibility for a three-way shooting war involving three nuclear-armed countries.</p><p>This is one time when it might make sense for America's secretary of state to signal that a focus on allies is as important as adversaries in US foreign policy. It was only six months ago, after all, that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-51638345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump proudly touted his bromance with India's prime minister, Narendra Modi</a>, on his last major diplomatic trip before the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has similarly tried to muscle Japan's prime minister, Abe Shinzo, into being a key ally in an America First coalition of the coerced, arrayed against a rising China.</p><p>Yet there was not a single mention of Japan or India in Pompeo's convention speech.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a203bde3dbef4cc1d8b903d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Pompeo\" height=\"694\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alex Wong/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Pompeo also enthusiastically touted the US assassination of Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in January, ignoring the determination by UN human rights investigators that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-un-rights/un-expert-deems-us-drone-strike-on-irans-soleimani-an-unlawful-killing-idUSKBN2472TW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American drone strike in Baghdad that killed him was unlawful</a>.</p><p>He praised the Trump administration's shredding of the Iran nuclear deal, even as it became clear that the UN Security Council would <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/unsc-dismisses-demand-impose-snapback-sanctions-iran-200825163456943.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reject the Trump administration's demand to trigger \"snapback\" sanctions</a> against Iran that were part of the deal the White House trashed and withdrew from unilaterally.</p><p>Then there was the most embarrassing part of the speech, Pompeo's blithe commentary on the state of US-Russia relations, Ukraine and NATO.</p><p>\"Today, because of President Trump, NATO is stronger, Ukraine has defensive weapon systems, and America left a harmful treaty so our nation can now build missiles to deter Russian aggression,\" he declared.</p><p>While there are ultimately <a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28957/don-t-fear-a-u-s-troop-withdrawal-from-germany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sound reasons for the recent US decision</a> to redeploy thousands of American troops stationed in Germany to Poland, it is undeniable that the White House's move, and how it made it, has created more fissures within the already unsteady trans-Atlantic alliance.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a2038bc3dbef425008b92ef?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Pompeo\" height=\"1267\" width=\"1900\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Yuri Gripas/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It's all well and good that after more than a year of dithering, <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/34638/ukraine-cleared-to-move-javelin-missiles-to-front-lines-to-blow-up-russian-tanks-defensively\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ukraine now appears to be prepared to deploy its US-made Javelin anti-tank batteries</a> closer to the contested region of Donbass in eastern Ukraine. But there is zero indication that there is a Ukrainian-American game plan in the event that Russia escalates its operations in Ukraine, either in response to ongoing negotiations over the status of Donbass and Crimea, or to the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/25/905808711/facing-the-biggest-challenge-ever-to-his-power-lukashenko-looks-to-russia-for-he\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still bubbling situation in neighboring Belarus</a>.</p><p>On top of all that, why anyone would view the idea of ramping up another nuclear arms race with Russia after the US pullout from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty as a good thing is beyond me, and probably several million other Americans. There is so much that is illogical about the Trump administration's Russia policy, including the lack of response to repeated provocations between Russian and American forces in the field, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/world/middleeast/pentagon-russia-syria.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most recently in Syria this week</a>.</p><p>Pompeo's RNC speech was, in a nutshell, just plain defiant and deceptive. But it was also pretty scary. If you were at all curious about what America might look like under Trump's most avaricious and aspiring political heir apparent, Pompeo's taxpayer-funded campaign speech and preening to the RNC is probably the closest thing to a crystal ball.</p><p>Trump or no Trump, the trajectory of the GOP's foreign policy is unlikely to veer far from this brand of ultranationalist diplomacy as long as Pompeo remains a leading light of the party.</p><p><em>Candace Rondeaux is a senior fellow and professor of practice at the Center on the Future of War, a joint initiative of New America and Arizona State University.

It also occupied Egypt's Sinai peninsula, the Golan Heights that had been part of Syria, and the West Bank, controlled by Jordan.</p><p>Today, Gaza is controlled by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/\">by the US government</a>. The area is the constant conflict flashpoint between Israel and the Palestinians.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/idf-airstrikes-target-terrorist-sites-in-gaza-strip-report-640263\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In recent days, hostilities have reignited&#160;</a>as Palestinians launched multiple incendiary balloons and rockets across the border. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes.</p><p>For Mor-Cicurel, in 1969, the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Golda Meir, had an inkling of the conflicts that would follow. However, at the time, relations between Israel and Gazans could not have been more different than the enmity that exists today.&#160;</p><p>\"The Palestinian population (in Gaza) was very peaceful at the time. Israel was a welcome occupier. Israelis were going to Gaza and shopping, sitting on the beach, and talking about how people were friendly. Relations were basically very good at the beginning,\" he said.</p><p>But the Paraguay transfer plan emerged because, \"the Israel government identified the problem in advance,\" he said.</p><p>\"After the '67 war, the Gazan economy was disconnected from the Egyptian economy. There was very high unemployment. In Golda Meir's view, it was a humanistic attempt to solve a difficult problem &#8212; it seemed reasonable.\"</p><h2><strong>Palestinians to Paraguay</strong></h2><p>What to do with the millions of Palestinian Arabs that came under the Jewish state's control after 1967 has been an intense debate in Israeli politics ever since. As recently as 2019, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-right-wing-resurrects-voluntary-transfer-of-palestinians-despite-50-years-of-fail-1.7735140\">a senior government official said that Israel was willing to help Palestinians emigrate from Gaza</a>.</p><p>One idea that never got off the ground, Mor-Cicurel said, was to establish agricultural settlements in northern Sinai for 50,000 Palestinians. But in reality, there was no local solution, so Israel's leaders, advised by its spy agency, Mossad, began to look further afield.</p><p>&#160;\"Paraguay was basically a dictatorship. You had a strongman there who you could reach an agreement with,\" said Mor-Cicurel.&#160;</p><p>Paraguay was ruled by Alfredo Stroessner, who took power in a military coup in 1954 and ruled until his overthrow in 1989. The period was marked by sustained human rights abuses of opponents.</p><p>The Mossad brokered a secret agreement with the Paraguayan regime.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kan.org.il/Item/?itemId=75705&fbclid=IwAR1JSxlK6l2aUIeNByxQ4VIKpVVly4oYhdLL-M0uAm-HTsFyDzaEw4-WIi4WIi4\">According to the archived cabinet minutes</a>, the head of the Mossad<strong>, </strong>Major General Zvi Zamir, said: \"The proposal in question is the consent of the Paraguayan government, through the Paraguayan Institute of Agriculture and Immigration, to absorb for a minimum period of four years &#8212; although it can continue longer if things develop &#8212; 60,000 Arab Muslim people, Who by definition are not communists. She is willing to absorb them into the country, When the Government of Israel fulfills certain conditions.\"</p><p>The plan guaranteed Israel would cover the emigrants' travel expenses. It said they would be paid $100 each, plus $33 per person would go to the Paraguay government. On arrival, the Palestinians would receive residency rights, and citizenship after five years.</p><p>\"According to the Israeli state papers, a down payment of $350,000 was made for the first 10,000 emigrants. The total bill for the 60,000 resettled Palestinians was estimated at $33 million.</p><p>\"The idea was to seduce people to leave Gaza,\" said Mor-Circurel.</p><p>To facilitate the movement of the Palestinians, Israel set up a travel agency in Gaza to entice people and provide them with the relevant documentation.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4a64207ffa48002894d045?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Golda Meir.

All of them were basically immigrants. Most of the policymakers came from other countries to the State of Israel,\" he said.</p><p>\"In the eyes of today, the idea of transferring the population is quite strange. But 1968 was not so far away from the division of Pakistan and India and the transfer of populations. It wasn't considered human rights abuse.\"</p><p>The secret Paraguay plan also mingles with the history of the Holocaust. Mor-Circurel points it formed as Israel wound down its hunt for fugitive Nazi war criminals.</p><p>Paraguay was a safe haven for many notorious fugitives from Hitler's Third Reich. Josef Mengele, the so-called \"the angel of death,\" who carried out horrific medical experiments on Jewish <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/auschwitz-photos-nazi-camp-history-liberation-anniversary-2020-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prisoners at Auschwitz,</a> was gifted<a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/features/an-awkward-friendship-blossoms-between-jerusalem-and-asunci%C3%B3n-israel-paraguay-1.465281?highlight=Paraguay\">&#160;Paraguayan citizenship</a> under his real name in 1959.</p><p>Mor-Circurel believes that Israel made a realpolitik decision that it was better to develop relations with South American countries than continue efforts to hunt down Nazis.</p><p>\"The head of Mossad said it was too expensive to continue the Nazi-hunting operation and it should concentrate on security threats not 'ghosts from the past',\" said Mor-Circurel.</p><p>Only 30 Palestinians ever made the 7,000 thousand-mile journey before the project came to a shuddering halt.</p><p>Two immigrants shot a young clerk at the Israeli Embassy in Asunci&#243;n. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/porazdan/status/1257186895789993985\">This has since been framed as the first act of Palestinian terrorism against Israel abroad.</a></p><p>Mor-Circurel says his research suggests that the motive was more likely they were disgruntled with life in their new South American home. \"It was convenient to claim they were terrorists,\" he said.</p><p>It created a scandal around the Paraguayan resettlement plan, and Stroessner, fearing the Arab world's wrath, aborted the project.</p><p>\"This is an unusual story,\" Professor Colin Shindler of the University of London (SOAS), told Business Insider, by email</p><p>\"It was soon after the Six-Day War and there were no negotiations with the Arab states &#8212; a stalemate. It also coincided with the rise of Palestinian nationalism, Arafat and the PLO,\" he said.</p><p>\"Perhaps they believed that exporting 60,000 Palestinians would help to mitigate the problem. However, 60,000 is such a small number in the context of the population of the West Bank and Gaza that it would have made no difference.</p><p>\"It sounds more like a temporary flight of fancy than a thought through idea. More wishful thinking than confronting the political reality,\" he said.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

I had found it quite challenging to find regular time for self-care routines. Pre-pandemic, most weeks I found time to fit in a training session with the amazing personal trainer Ador Orca, happy hour with \"the girls\" on Wednesday evenings, and at least three work-free weekends per month. Such luxuries are hardly tenable in the current climate.&#160;&#160;</p><p>At the outset of the pandemic, I contemplated ways I could remain active and positive while continuing to have a challenging schedule &#8212; now also occupied with homeschooling &#8212; while putting aside some time for new culinary ventures at home.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Since about April 15, I have managed to get a simple routine down that's worked wonders for me. I attribute this success to drawing from my innermost desires, rather than basing my choices on what others typically say self-care \"should be\" all about.</p><p>Self-care is very personal. It requires an intimate understanding of one's true wants and needs, and then going for it! It can change on a weekly or even daily basis and thus requires some real introspection and lots of planning.</p><p>Here's how my routine works:</p><h2>6-8 a.m.: I set an alarm for 6 a.m. so that I can actually get myself up by 6:45 most mornings.</h2><p>After a quick shower and a relaxed dressing (except for Fridays, when I actually wear PJ's until around 11 a.m.), I prepare a cup of earl gray in preparation for a 7 a.m. virtual French language lesson. This has become one of my most important self-care rituals during this COVID era.&#160;</p><p>On December 31, 2019, I held a New Year's Eve party at home. When friends asked about New Year's resolutions, I replied that I was set on becoming fluent in French and growing my secondary business. Fast forward to August 23, 2020: When I listen to podcasts in French, I can actually understand what's being said!&#160;</p><p>Believe me, it's a rare pleasure to be able to follow through on a goal like this. What began in my mind as a lofty ambition &#8212; a \"would be nice\" scenario &#8212; has progressed into real achievement in the midst of this unfortunate crisis.&#160;</p><p>Actually following through on a seemingly fanciful but long-held aim has filled me with a unique joy, and allowed me to note real changes in the way I see myself; it has engendered a strong sense of self-confidence I never knew I could draw from.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h2>8 a.m.-6 p.m.: My days are full of calls, emails, organizing meals, overseeing an active seven-year-old, delegating tasks to my associates and staff, composing reports, and putting out fires of a seemingly limitless variety &#8212; all of which results in me feeling a good deal overwhelmed, especially as this multi-tasking is ever-changing.&#160;&#160;</h2><p>I have found that, more than ever, having set to-do lists has been a lifesaver. I have a list of daily musts, which I prepare the night before, as well as ongoing lists of important &#8212; sometimes urgent &#8212; tasks to be performed at some specified time.&#160;</p><p>This helps me stay sane, focused, and feel a sense of accomplishment on a daily basis, as a once-dreaded pastiche of tasks is reduced to checklist items. Each line drawn through a completed task yields a sense of satisfaction.</p><h2>7-9 p.m.: The dinner hours have become quite the sacred time.</h2><p>I have found a new love in preparing dinner with my family. I myself am a master veggie-chopper, our 7-year-old is an ace at salad dressing, and my husband has perfected the art of producing what my daughter has labeled \"heavenly chicken.\" We use this time to laugh, tell jokes, play loud music or give each other dance lessons, plan where our next vacation might be (one day), as well as share about our days.&#160;</p><h2>~10 p.m.: After much joking around and a heavy dose of either Food Network watching or Harry Potter reading, our daughter finally falls asleep.</h2><p>Success!&#160;</p><h2>11 p.m.: I do a bit more work and prepare for bed.</h2><p>Composing a list of the wonderful things I experienced during the day, I realize I am smiling as I do so. I find that gratitude keeps me in a positive frame of mind, aware of how fortunate we are and have been, and how much we can offer to others in need.&#160;</p><p>We are healthy, and we have basic needs covered, friends and family we can count on, and the freedom to dream about the future with the serene optimism of security. Indeed, we are just about as fortunate as it gets. Time to turn on a French podcast and fall asleep smiling because I actually understand what is being said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

lane to summer.</p><p>And what does summer signal? Ros&#233; on rooftops, of course.</p><p>While this summer you may be sipping your ros&#233; on your own rooftop with a mask firmly at your side, choosing the right ros&#233; can certainly elevate any self-isolation experience, transforming your personal space into a Provencal paradise.&#160;</p><p>\"For folks that may be new to ros&#233;, I would encourage them to try a few different hues,\" said Andy Myers, wine director at Jose Andres Think Food Group. \"Try a pale Provencal one, a blushing Spanish, and a rich, dark US version. See what you like.\"</p><p>He adds that ros&#233;s should ideally be dry &#8212; anywhere from 12.5% ABV or higher is a dry ros&#233; &#8212; and loaded with fresh, vibrant fruits like strawberries and raspberries.</p><p>A note from our experts: While we tend to think of warm weather as \"ros&#233; season,\" our experts unanimously agree that there is no such thing, and a great ros&#233; can be enjoyed any time of year. The taste of a good ros&#233; can give us something to look forward to and transport us to a beautiful afternoon at any time of year &#8212; which may be just the dose of optimism we need right about now.</p><p>\"The biggest misconception about ros&#233; is that it's only for warm-weather enjoyment.

He consults on restaurants, is a drinks educator, event host, speaker, and regular wine contributor for Food &#38; Wine Magazine.</p><p>\"In fact, I love opening a bottle on a snowy evening in the dead of winter. It's my own little protest against the cold and the dark, and a wonderful reminder that better days are sure to come,\" Freedman added. Well said!</p><p>Anyway, shall we get on with it?

Its flavors of citrus, red berry, melon, tangerine, spice, herb, and wet stone. Ros&#233;s from Provence are dry and have minerals as well.

Their vintage ros&#233; is aged in American barrels for four years, and then another four years in the bottle. If you know anything about ros&#233;, that may seem wild to you, but according to Hoel, it's a must-try.</p><p>\"The current vintage is impossible to get,\" he said. Not because it's expensive, but because it's rare. In fact, he said it's not even that expensive, just a tough one to discover.</p><p>\"It is one of the most amazing ros&#233; experiences you'll ever have. If you see it somewhere, buy it and call me,\" he added.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\t13.

For 2020 we should be looking for 2019. Only in rare cases does a rose improve with age.</p>\n\t14. 2017 Jean-Yves Péron 'Vers la Maison Rouge'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f49515360bf1f0028079456?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2017 Jean-Yves Péron &#39;Vers la Maison Rouge&#39;\" height=\"1239\" width=\"1652\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2017 Jean-Yves Péron &#39;Vers la Maison Rouge&#39;.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Winery Jean-Yves Péron</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This particular ros&#233; is a party in a bottle. Why? Because they only bottle it in Magnum. And once you taste it, you may have a tough time putting it away.&#160;</p><p>\"This is a super fresh, bright, and fruity ros&#233; made of the Savoie varietal, Mondeuse, with a dash of Gamay,\" said Billy Smith, sommelier and assistant wine director at Michelin-starred The Four Horsemen restaurant in Brooklyn.&#160;</p><p>Smith attributes the fruity, yet acidic, flavors to the high altitude vineyards, which makes this dark ros&#233; completely dry.&#160;</p><p>\"One regular-sized bottle would just be a disappointment,\" he added.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

But past recessions have shown that failure to adequately fund state and local governments hinders recovery and puts the future at risk for all of us.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/state-and-local-budgets-and-the-great-recession/\">Dropping public sector employment</a>, curtailed services, and other consequences of underfunding state and local governments <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/without-federal-aid-many-state-and-local-governments-could-make-the-same-budget-cuts-that-hampered-the-last-economic-recovery/\">deepened the Great Recession</a> and continue to be <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/great-recessions-lessons-state-and-local-aids-importance-combating-economic-downturn-and-supporting-children\">a problem to this day</a>.</p><h2>Debt hypocrisy</h2><p>McConnell's concerns about future generations also ring hollow given the massive tax giveaways he's supported.&#160;</p><p>He didn't lament adding to the national debt when he passed the 2017 tax cut law law that gave away $1.9 trillion in tax breaks mainly to the rich and corporations. Nor was he worried about the future when<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/coronavirus-real-estate-investors-stimulus.html\"> he gave real estate tycoons and hedge fund managers $135 billion</a> in the CARES package.&#160;</p><p>In the first three months of the pandemic, wealth for billionaires actually grew by<a href=\"https://americansfortaxfairness.org/wp-content/uploads/2020-7-16-Billionaires-Wealth-Gains-Top-700-Billion.pdf\"> $700 billion</a> even as record job loss and economic hardship swept the nation.&#160;</p><p>While<a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/More-than-50-million-have-filed-for-unemployment-15412510.php\"> more than 50 million people have filed unemployment claims</a> since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak and<a href=\"https://www.familiesusa.org/resources/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-resulting-economic-crash-have-caused-the-greatest-health-insurance-losses-in-american-history/\"> over 5 million have lost health coverage</a>, the top 1% are getting another tax break averaging $1.6 million just this year. McConnell and his Republican allies slipped the giveaway into the last relief bill by re-opening a loophole that benefits<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-doggett-release-new-analysis-showing-gop-tax-provisions-in-cares-act-overwhelmingly-benefit-million-dollar-plus-earners\"> 43,000 business owners making more than $1 million annually</a>.</p><p>It's the height of hypocrisy when Republicans in Congress wail about the deficit while handing out favors to the richest households and corporations while millions of their constituents are facing<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/507754-enhanced-unemployment-insurance-likely-to-expire-during-coronavirus-aid-talks\"> joblessness, hunger, and sickness.</a>&#160;</p><p>That hypocrisy points to the bigger deficit in their priorities: instead of passing relief and recovery that is commensurate with what real people need to get through this crisis and for the country to beat COVID, these politicians are putting their rich donors and corporate shareholders ahead of the rest of us.&#160;</p><h2>States need help, now</h2><p>Now,<a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/states-need-significantly-more-fiscal-relief-to-slow-the-emerging-deep\"> state revenue is plummeting</a> due to job losses resulting in less money from income taxes and diminished sales tax revenue at the same time the burden of COVID-19 is increasing.&#160; State budget shortfalls will force more cuts to jobs and to services at the same time that states are still struggling to contain the pandemic, deepening the crisis and putting recovery further out of reach.&#160;</p><p>We've seen this cycle before: during the last recession, failure to address the budget needs of state and local governments resulted in<a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2020/04/17/483461/coronavirus-recovery-demands-substantial-durable-aid-state-local-governments/\"> weak recovery</a> and a longer recession, prolonged struggles for more people and diminished opportunities for future generations. A<a href=\"https://www.nga.org/policy-communications/letters-nga/governors-letter-regarding-covid-19-aid-request/\"> bipartisan letter</a> from the National Governors' Association noted that state and local governments require at least an additional $500 billion in federal funds for COVID relief.&#160; Yet McConnell has delayed taking action since May even as deadlines for unemployment insurance relief approach.</p><p>Hedge fund managers, real estate moguls, pass-through owners and corporate shareholders on the other hand aren't worried about eviction, feeding their families, losing insurance or paying the bill because thanks to McConnell, the<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/american-billionaires-got-434-billion-richer-during-the-pandemic.html\"> rich are getting richer</a> off the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>If the federal government can afford billions in tax breaks for rich and corporations--even in a worldwide pandemic that has already killed more than 170,000 Americans--then we can also afford to give ailing families and the local governments they depend on the resources they need to combat COVID and recover quickly.</p><p>Americans are tired of lip service, delays, half-measures and excuses. It's time for Sen. McConnell and President Trump to make the future of struggling families, seniors, people with disabilities, frontline essential workers and others a higher priority than their rich donors and corporate cronies.</p><p><em>Margarida Jorge is the Executive Director of Health Care for American Now (HCAN)</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

five-minute recording, captured secretly by the mother of his children Desiree Middlebrooks and shared widely on social media, a man later identified as Wright is heard using a racial slur nine times.&#160;</p><p>Wright was apparently <a href=\"https://www.pbcommercial.com/news/20200827/arkansas-county-judge-responds-to-leaked-audio\">upset that Middlebrooks talked to the employee</a>. He called her a \"n----- lover,\" later saying, \"Why you got to holler at f------ n----- when I'm around?\"&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pbcommercial.com/news/20200827/arkansas-county-judge-responds-to-leaked-audio\">In a May 28 Facebook post reported by the Pine Bluff Commerical</a>, Wright acknowledged it was his voice, saying, \"To all I have offended or hurt I send my sincere apologies and will pray for my enemies.\"&#160;</p><p>But that wasn't enough. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/30/arkansas-county-sheriff-todd-wright-resigns-after-leaked-racist-rant/5673985002/\">On Friday, a special meeting was held at the Arkansas County Courthouse</a> in which the Arkansas County Quorum Court unanimously requested that Wright resign.&#160;</p><p>The court didn't have the authority to fire him, Arkansas County Judge Eddie Best said, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/30/arkansas-county-sheriff-todd-wright-resigns-after-leaked-racist-rant/5673985002/\">according to USA Today</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Throughout the several-hour hearing, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=328349198366909&ref=watch_permalinklink\">broadcast on Facebook</a>, public officials, community members, activists, and at least one colleague urge Wright to resign.&#160;</p><p>\"After viewing and hearing the video I was terribly upset to know that we have someone out here that's supposed to be taking care of us, protecting and serving to have that kind of opinion of me &#8211; I'm using me as a race because of my color,\" Justice of the Peace Inez McLemore said.&#160;</p><p>Wright blamed his behavior on the devil, insisted he's not racist, and pointed to some of the Black community members he said he has good relationships with.&#160;</p><p>\"I'm a Christian man. I read my Bible every day,\" Wright said. \"I am by no means a racist. That video does not show the true picture of me.\"</p><p>But the crowd, including a woman who said she's the aunt of the Black employee, didn't buy it.</p><p>\"I don't believe anything you just said,\" she said. \"You have to say this stuff because you want to keep your job.\"&#160;</p><p>Wright at first refused to resign, then said he would do so in a month, and finally did what the crowd requested &#8212; said he'd resign immediately &#8212; after his former colleague spoke.&#160;</p><p>\"Todd, I've known you all my life. You need to take that badge and (set) it on that table and walk out of here Todd,\" former officer Bobby Webb said. \"You know I love you, but you screwed up. Lay that badge down, lay that gun down and walk out of here.\"</p><p>The court passed a motion allowing Wright to receive payment as a contract labor, but not active law enforcement, for the next month, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/arkansas-sheriff-resigns-over-racist-rant-leaked-recording-n1238791\">NBC News reported</a>. Until a replacement is found, the county's chief deputy will fill in for Wright's spot.&#160;</p><ul class=\"read-more-links\"><li>Read more:</li><li><a

Berkshire's dumping of its airline holdings in April <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-trump-calls-out-airline-stock-sales-made-mistake-2020-6-1029285301#\">drew criticism</a> from President Donald Trump, while slashing its bank holdings and making its first investment in a gold miner last quarter <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-barrick-gold-miner-investment-big-change-2020-8-1029508701#\">raised a lot of eyebrows</a> in the investment community.</li></ul><p>In recognition of Buffett turning 90, here are five of his best comments and stories about birthdays:</p><h2>1. Aiming for 100</h2><p>Geico, one of Buffett's oldest and most lucrative investments, has surpassed rivals such as Progressive and Allstate in terms of premium volumes over the years. Buffett wants the auto insurer to be number one in 10 years' time.</p><p>\"On August 30, 2030 &#8212; my 100th birthday &#8212; I plan to announce that Geico has taken over the top spot, \" Buffett said in his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2015ltr.pdf\">2015 shareholder letter</a>. \"Mark your calendar.\"</p><p>Buffett reiterated his goal at Berkshire's 2016 annual meeting, according to a transcript on Sentieo, a financial-research site.</p><p>\"I hope on my 100th birthday that the Geico people announce to me that they passed State Farm,\" he said. \"But I have to do my share on that, too, by getting to 100.\"</p><h2>2. Huggins' Law</h2><p>Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-dream-business-is-sees-candies-2019-7-1028348838\">acquired See's Candies for $25 million in 1972</a> and immediately put Chuck Huggins in charge.</p><p>In his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/final1999pdf.pdf\">1999 shareholder letter</a>, Buffett credited Huggins' \"fanatical insistence on both product quality and friendly service\" for See's generating $857 million in pre-tax income since Berkshire took over.</p><p>See's pre-tax profit in millions was about 10% of Huggins' age when he took over aged 46, Buffett said in the letter. That ratio soared to 100% by the time he turned 74, the investor continued.</p><p>\"Having discovered this mathematical relationship &#8212; let's call it Huggins' Law &#8212; Charlie and I now become giddy at the mere thought of Chuck's birthday,\" he joked.</p><h2>3. Buying a furniture store</h2><p>Buffett received a particularly nice birthday gift in 1983 when Mrs B, the 89-year-old owner of Nebraska Furniture Mart, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-89-mrs-b-fortune-500-ceo-2019-12-1028763487#\">agreed to sell the company to him</a>.</p><p>\"I think back to August 30, 1983 &#8212; my birthday &#8212; when I went to see Mrs B (Rose Blumkin), carrying a one and a quarter-page purchase proposal for NFM that I had drafted,\" he recalled in his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf\">2013 shareholder letter</a>.</p><p>\"Mrs B accepted my offer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers or lawyers,\" Buffett continued.</p><p>\"Though the company's financial statements were unaudited, I had no worries,\" he added. \"Mrs B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.\"</p><h2>4. Business at a party</h2><p>Buffett shared an example of Berkshire's \"carefully crafted and sophisticated acquisition strategy\" in his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1996.html\">1996 shareholder letter</a>.</p><p>The investor tried to get out of attending the 40th birthday party of his nephew's wife, Jane Rogers, but agreed to go after learning he would be sitting next to Jane's dad, Roy Dinsdale.</p><p>During the party, Dinsdale revealed he had attended a directors' meeting at Kansas Bankers Surety, an insurance firm that Buffett had long admired. Buffett told Dinsdale to let him know if the company ever came up for purchase.</p><p>Buffett received a letter from Dinsdale a couple of weeks later that contained KBS's financial information. He called Dinsdale the next day to offer $75 million for the company, and the pair soon struck a deal.</p><p>\"I'm now scheming to get invited to Jane's next party,\" Buffett joked.</p><p>If anyone owns a company that meets Berkshire's requirements \"and if I fail to make the next birthday party you attend ... give me a call,\" he added.</p><h2>5. 'I'm really good at this'</h2><p>Buffett famously hires and trusts top-notch managers to run Berkshire's various businesses, freeing him to focus on allocating capital across the company.</p><p>He illustrated the point in his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1990.html\">1990 shareholder letter</a>, using a story about his granddaughter Emily's fourth birthday party a few months earlier.</p><p>Beemer the Clown asked Emily to wave a magic wand over a box of wonders.</p><p>\"Loose handkerchiefs went in and, upon a magisterial wave by Emily, emerged knotted,\" Buffett said. \"After four such transformations, each more amazing than its predecessor, Emily was unable to contain herself.\"</p><p>\"Her face aglow, she exulted: 'Gee, I'm really good at this.\"</p><p>\"That sums up my contribution to the performance of Berkshire's business magicians,\" Buffett added, listing several superstars including Mrs B's family and Huggins.</p><p>\"They deserve your applause.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

I also make sure we spend 20 minutes doing some silent meditation and deep breathing before the hair and makeup process begins or the other bridesmaids arrive.&#160;</p><h2><strong>I meet dozens of new people on the morning of the big day</strong></h2><p>Once the other bridesmaids show up, I often meet them for the first time. Of course they question who I am and why I haven't been at any other pre-wedding events. I always have answers ready for each situation and the bride backs me up. I help them steam their dresses and tell them it's my specialty. I also know in advance who will be problematic that day and try to buddy up with them so I can intervene before the drama gets to the bride.</p><p>If there aren't any other bridesmaids, I meet the other people in the bride's life, like parents or family members who are getting ready with her that morning. Usually they pull me aside, talk my ear off with different drama and problems, all without knowing I'm hired to work the wedding.</p><p>Why do they do it? At weddings, everyone involved wants a pair of ears to vent to. I always make mine available so that I have inside access to all the problems taking place, so I can help ease tension among the people there.</p><h2><strong>Tears are inevitable at every wedding</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47e32ecd2fec00296a4960?format=jpeg\" alt=\"I bring at least 7 packs of tissues and they all get used throughout the wedding day.

Sometimes it's from an overwhelmed or cold-footed bride, other times it's from a bridesmaid who is sabotaging the wedding experience with her emotions and problems. Occasionally it's from a stubborn or opinionated family member. Either way, this is when I pull out my first tissue pack of the day (I carry seven mini tissue packs with me for each wedding &#8212; they always get used).&#160;</p><p>I often spend 15 to 20 minutes inviting the crying person into the hallway with me to talk things out. I'm good at getting them to stop crying and usually that's because I listen, question them, and try to bribe them to calm down (with a mid-morning coffee or pastry).&#160;</p><h2><strong>Problems often pop up last-minute before the ceremony</strong></h2><p>Right before the ceremony, there's always a problem I have to attend to. I make sure I get ready for the wedding as early as possible so I don't have a curling iron in my hand when the morning problem happens. Sometimes it's a stained wedding dress, a missing groom, a hungover bridesmaid, a broken bracelet, a late officiant, or bad weather.</p><p>While I do my best to fix the problem, sometimes I can't, like when there's torrential rain and the wedding is outside without a tent. I do my best to come up with crafty solutions and if that doesn't work, I'm honest with the bride. I'd rather set realistic expectations &#8212; because if not, they count on me to do the impossible, like make the sun come out.&#160;</p><h2><strong>After the ceremony, things slow down and I sneak away for a quick break&#160;</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f11a5403ad861163c73c459?format=jpeg\" alt=\"At some weddings, Jen is happy to have it be over so she never has to see the person who hired her again.

I bustle the bride's dress, bring her and her partner food from cocktail hour, and let them be for a little bit. I go off and hide in a bathroom stall for 30 minutes, take deep breaths, and try to unpack all that happened so far. I often try to sneak in my first meal of the day, since finding time to eat amid nonstop chaos can be tricky, before going back to work.&#160;</p><h2><strong>As cocktail hour gets underway, another problem usually pops up</strong></h2><p>When I exit the bathroom, someone usually grabs me and pulls me toward a problem, such as the couple fighting, a groom who is too drunk already, or a bridesmaid threatening to leave because she feels left out. Most of the time it's that the bride needs help peeing in her wedding dress. I return to the bathroom and spend 20 minutes helping her.</p><h2><strong>I'm</strong><strong> in charge of getting the party started and keeping it going</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f11a5fd3f7370464b27efa7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"On rare occasions, Jen says she remains good friends with clients.

Have you ever danced alone at a wedding while all the guests watched from their tables? That's part of my job. I try to pull people onto the dance floor and make the environment fun. It can be tricky, especially if the crowd isn't interested or the music is bad. But I do what I can to make the night exciting and fun.&#160;</p><h2><strong>As the night wears on, I make a secret exit&#160;</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47e410cd2fec00296a4965?format=jpeg\" alt=\"I leave the weddings without saying goodbye. Jen Glantz\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>I leave the weddings without saying goodbye.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Glantz</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>When my time is up (based on how many hours the bride hired me for) I grab my bag and find the exit door. I don't say goodbye because I don't want to draw attention to myself leaving. I try to be as discreet as possible, so I tell people I'm heading to the bathroom, then I call a cab and get back to my hotel or the airport, where I either catch a flight home or continue on to the next wedding of the weekend.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Different understandings of the concept of liberty have very different impacts on individuals and society as a whole, and the arrival of COVID is helping to highlight the tradeoffs of the freedoms we preserve for ourselves and each other.&#160;</p><p>In the midst of a global pandemic, the liberties we take with others' safety and the liberties we hold for ourselves reveal fundamental, competing differences in how Americans conceive of our freedoms.</p><p>But the coronavirus offers a chance for us to reassess our assumptions about the costs to others that taking liberties impose, and illustrate the need for a more egalitarian approach to making our way in the world.</p><h2>Four views of liberty</h2><p>In his massive book on the migratory origins of America's voluntary society, <em>Albion's Seed</em>, David Hackett Fischer identifies four different conceptions of \"liberty\" that all found their way into our national political culture: ordered, hierarchical, natural, and reciprocal.</p><p>These liberties are different ways of viewing the concept of freedom, and they have all played roles in American culture. The conflicts in our society highlighted by COVID generally and the push to wear a mask specifically neatly highlight these various conceptions of freedom.</p><p>Efforts to require masks are a straightforward expression of <em>ordered</em> liberty. The concept of ordered liberty argues that without structure and a set of rules which are enforced for the common good, society would devolve into chaos. Mask orders are quite literally saving society from itself, so that we can be more free than we would if COVID spread even further and faster.</p><p><em>Hierarchical</em> liberty takes a different view: that hierarchy is the source of liberty. In this understanding, people of a lower rank do not have the same liberties or rights as those with higher rank, and that system of inequality actually improves society. To a believer in hierarchical liberty, hierarchy brings harmony and therefore freedom.</p><p>You won't find much respect for hierarchical liberty among those who follow a more <em>natural</em> liberty, which boils down to refusing any authority at all. Mask orders from local government and local business are seen as equally unacceptable to a natural libertarian, but they're also not going to be bothered by someone else deciding to mask...after all, that's their business.</p><p>Finally, we come to <em>reciprocal</em> liberty, which is best thought of as a generic application of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\">The Golden Rule</a>. Under principles of reciprocal liberty, any threat to one person's freedom or safety is a threat to the freedom or safety of all people, because that same threat may eventually be turned on whoever is avoiding it today. This approach would dictate mask-wearing not out of paternalistic concern for the wearer, but out of the wearer's concern that they may endanger the people they interact with.</p><p>These principles of liberty may be understood through a meal at a restaurant.</p><p>A diner focused on ordered liberty would assiduously follow the rules for patrons laid out by the restaurant itself, and by applicable government regulation. If not required to by the rules established, the diner wouldn't wear a mask. The fact that staff did wear masks wouldn't be strange to them...after all, the rules don't say they can serve without a mask, unlike the diner.</p><p>If that same diner had a hierarchical view of liberty, they might decide it was right and proper for the diner to be protected by mask-wearing staff's face coverings, but pay no mind to the risks their unmasked exhales create for staff. After all, there is an order established, and their liberty is greater being from a higher class or socioeconomic standing.</p><p>The natural libertarian may reject wearing a mask in the restaurant, complain about how spaced out seats were, or go the other way entirely and assiduously dine in an N95 out of fear of the virus. Either way, others wouldn't factor much in their thinking, regardless of position.</p><p>Finally, a reciprocal conception of liberty would dictate that any time a server approached the table, diners would pause, don masks, and keep them on until distance was re-established. After all, the server is at risk if the diners are not wearing masks themselves.</p><p>My wife and I decided that our first dinner out in a post-COVID world would be dictated by those reciprocal principles. It made the meal quite nerve-wracking by the standards of fine dining, both in terms of explaining our thinking to staff who had not encountered that sort of behavior before, and because we had to constantly look out for servers approaching the table. But we also felt more comfortable knowing that we were doing our best to treat servers as we expected to be treated ourselves.</p><h2>American liberties before the virus</h2><p>Our stratified and increasingly unequal society has been cast in even sharper relief by COVID. By-and-large, American society has steered further towards its hierarchical influences over the last several decades, with some influences of ordered and natural liberty sprinkled in.</p><p>Our economic model is reliant on services consumption, and the conventional wisdom for successful service is \"the customer is always right\". This dynamic appeals to both hierarchical and natural concepts of liberty: customers are on a pedestal above the services workers who cater to them, and face little restriction in their desires from any authority.</p><p>In a system of ordered libertarian thinking, disrupting a business because an order is incorrect makes no sense; a loud argument that bothers others is just as problematic as an incorrect order. Similarly, venting frustration and petty tyranny upon service workers makes no sense to a reciprocal libertarian, because receiving that sort of treatment is such a difficult experience.</p><p>Another example of hierarchical liberty current reckoning with police violence. But unlike consumer culture, police brutality appeals to ordered liberty; a conception of freedom requiring order sits at the core of any argument that atrocious force in response to disruption is justified.&#160;</p><h2>A path forward</h2><p>Just as the virus may offer us the opportunity to make choices that are more reciprocal, society as a whole would be well-served by a reciprocal approach to problem solving.&#160;</p><p>At the individual level, it requires a simple application of human empathy. In any situation of conflict or dispute, simply asking oneself \"how would I feel being treated the way I am treating someone else?\" can go a long way.</p><p>In public policy, renewed focus on solutions grounded in consent, agency, and discussion are more reciprocal than institutions which enforce order, create hierarchy, or retreat from intervention of any kind. Reciprocal libertarians always take up the pen and the chat over the gun or the court, and encouraging that sort of approach would do much to improve conditions for all Americans.</p><div

stories</a>.</li></ul><p>Steven Spielberg's father served in World War II and the director's dad has been a major influence on the director's career. Arnold Spielberg died this week at 103, so let's take a look at how he inspired his son to make some of the greatest films and TV shows about the greatest generation.</p><p>Like many young men of his generation, Arnold Spielberg enlisted in the <a href=\"http://www.military.com/army\">Army</a> within a month of the December 7, 1941, Japanese attack on <a href=\"http://www.military.com/base-guide/naval-station-pearl-harbor\">Pearl Harbor</a>.</p><p>He served as a radio operator and chief communications man for the 490th Bomb Squadron, nicknamed the \"Burma Bridge Busters\" after their assigned mission to bomb Japanese bridges and railroad lines. Spielberg volunteered for two combat tours in the China Burma India theater of war.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f494b7d60bf1f002807942d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Steven Spielberg and Arnold Spielberg\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Steven Spielberg and Arnold Spielberg in Beverly Hills, California, April 26, 2012.\n<p class=\"copyright\">FilmMagic via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Arnold married Leah Posner after his return home and son Steven was born in 1946 at the beginning of the post-war baby boom. He developed a fascination with gadgets during his military service and got an engineering degree from the University of Cincinnati on the G.I. Bill.</p><p>That led to a career in the new field of computer science that included stints working for RCA, GE, Electronic Arrays, SDS, Burroughs and IBM.</p><p>Steven credits his dad for his own devotion to new technology. \"When I see a PlayStation, when I look at a cell phone &#8212; from the smallest calculator to an iPad &#8212; I look at my dad and I say, 'My dad and a team of geniuses started that.'\"</p><p>Arnold Spielberg also supported his only son's devotion to movies, giving him access to gear and helping his teenage son make his first films with a home movie camera. The 1961 short \"Fighter Squad\" was shot at the Sky Harbor Airport hangar in Phoenix and featured grounded former WWII fighter planes.</p><p>Here are five World War II movies from a storied career, movies that would never have been made without the influence and early support of Arnold Spielberg.</p><h2>1. 'Saving Private Ryan'</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CiW_DgxCnQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>\"Saving Private Ryan,\" released in 1998, refocused American minds on the heroes of World War II and kicked off two decades of tribute to the men and women who won the war.</p><p>Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his men behind German lines to rescue a missing soldier and teaches everyone the importance of shared sacrifice. The 20-minute opening sequence recreates the Allied Forces' D-Day landing on Omaha Beach and stands as the greatest battle sequence in movie history.</p><p>\"Saving Private Ryan\" is currently available to stream on HBO Max and on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.</p><h2>2. '1941'</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_KOLqpo7z8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>\"1941,\" released in 1979, lampoons the panic in Los Angeles about a rumored Japanese invasion in the days immediately after Pearl Harbor. American wasn't exactly ready for a World War II farce back then and the movie has a reputation as one of Spielberg's rare failures.</p><p>Seen 40 years later, the movie plays as a cross between \"Animal House\" and \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,\" bringing together young comedy talent like John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and John Candy alongside Hollywood legends like Robert Stack, Christopher Lee, Warren Oates and Slim Pickens. It's flawed but still very funny.</p><p>\"1941\" is currently available on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.</p><h2>3. 'Schindler's List'</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG22XNhtnoY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>\"Schindler's List,\" released in 1993, won seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Spielberg's first Best Director Oscar. More importantly, it told the story of the Holocaust for a mainstream audience by focusing on one of the few heroes from that terrifying chapter of World War II history.</p><p>Oskar Schindler was a German industrialist who protected his Jewish employees from Nazi extermination by employing him in his factories. The real-life Schindler is credited with saving 1,200 lives during the war.</p><p>Spielberg's family is Jewish and the movie is just as much about the lives lost as the lives saved. It's shot in black-and-white and effectively conveys the horror and the sadness while chronicling the heroism of a man who chose to resist the Nazi regime.</p><p>\"Schindler's List\" is currently available to stream on Netflix and on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.</p><h2>4. 'Empire of the Sun'</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_WiDVA1kLY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>\"Empire of the Sun,\" released in 1987, features a 12-year-old Christain Bale in a movie based on J.G. Ballard's novel about a young English boy living in Shanghai, China after the Japanese invasion. Separated from his family, he's forced to grow up to survive over the course of the war.</p><p>The movie was originally set to be directed by the great David Lean and produced by Spielberg. Lean won Oscars for directing \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Both movies also won Best Picture and stand among the greatest war pictures ever made. Spielberg considers Lean a major influence on his filmmaking and aimed to make the same kind of epic once Lean dropped out of the movie.</p><p>\"Empire of the Sun\" is currently available to stream on HBO Max and on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.</p><h2>5. 'Escape to Nowhere'</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pI3431fetiM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Let's hope the 1961 \"Escape to Nowhere\" is safely stored in the Spielberg family archives and will be available for aspiring filmmakers to study someday. For now, we've only got the blurry (but still impressive) excerpt that's available on YouTube.</p><p>The clip that exists shows that young Steven was already learning how to shoot and edit a scene. Are <a href=\"http://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-uniforms/uniform-and-insignia-guide.html\">uniforms</a> wrong? Are the production values non-existent? Sure, but what were you doing when you were 15?</p><p>This list doesn't include the Spielberg productions of \"Band of Brothers\" (2001) and \"The Pacific\" (2010). Each epic HBO series took its inspiration from the camaraderie on display in \"Saving Private Ryan\" and told more stories collected by historian Stephen Ambrose. Both shows are streaming on HBO Max and available on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.</p><p>Spielberg and Apple TV+ are making yet another World War II series called \"Masters of the Air\" and have yet to announce a release date.</p><p>Spielberg also produced the outstanding Netflix documentary \"Five Came Back,\" based on Mark Harris' book about five of Hollywood's most legendary directors and their service in World War II.</p><p>Arnold Spielberg may have had the most influence on \"The Mission,\" a 1985 episode of the original \"Amazing Stories\" television series personally directed by Steven. Kevin Costner and Kiefer Sutherland star in this show about a WWII tail gunner trapped in the belly of a B-17. You can stream this episode in the NBC app or on <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/amazing-stories/video/the-mission/2909096\">NBC.com</a>. The \"Amazing Stories\" series is available on DVD and digital.</p><p>Finally, don't forget the Nazi bad guys in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) and \"Indiana Jones and Last Crusade\" (1989). Some people want to count them as World World II movies, but even we're willing to admit that's a stretch. Both are streaming on Netflix and both are available on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.</p><p>The legacy of Arnold Spielberg offers a great lesson for parents. Support your kids. Encourage their creativity and provide them with whatever gear you can. Raise them right. They might not become one of Hollywood's greatest directors but they'll make you proud some other way.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Just 20 years ago, however, the production of argan oil was isolated to local villages in Morocco, with international sales virtually nonexistent. But since then, the formation of women-run cooperatives has transformed the production into a billion-dollar industry.</p><p>So, why has argan oil suddenly gained such popularity? And what makes it so expensive?</p><p>Argan oil is predominantly used in high-end cosmetic products and Moroccan cuisine. The oil comes from the seed of the argan tree, native only to the narrow strip of semi-desert between Morocco's Atlantic coast and the Atlas Mountains. The Amazigh people of North Africa have been using the argan seeds for centuries, and the methods for creating this costly oil haven't changed in years.</p><p><strong>Khadija Heeda:</strong> The first stage of production is the collection. We collect the fruits of the argan. We collect them when they are mature. The young fruit is this color, green. We can't collect it by striking the tree with sticks or picking it from the tree. We wait for it to mature and drop to the ground, and its color turns to brown.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Once collected, the argan fruits are sun-dried before being peeled and de-pulped by hand to remove the fleshy outer layers. The leftover argan nut then needs to be cracked to retrieve the oil-rich kernel inside.</p><p><strong>Khadija Heeda:</strong> This is a difficult stage. Not just anybody can crack this nut, because you need to know the technique to crack it correctly to maintain the structure of the nut and not grind it. To obtain a liter of argan oil, we need 40 kilograms of the fruit, or about 20 kilograms of the nuts, to obtain one liter.</p><p><strong> Narrator:</strong> The next stage is grinding, which is often also done by hand.</p><p><strong>Khadija Heeda:</strong> We grind the argan kernels in this traditional method that we learned from our ancestors and that is known in our Moroccan heritage. This is a time-consuming method. To obtain one liter, this method takes two hours. That is why we developed, and now we are able, when we have a large order, to use the machine. The machine &#8212; it takes little time. In five minutes, it can produce one or two liters.</p><p>Argan oil is not like other oils. The best quality is known as \"red gold\" because it is very expensive. Argan oil requires a lot of effort to produce. For one woman to produce one liter of argan oil, it would take her approximately 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The leftover pulp removed from the fruit is sold as animal feed, particularly for goats, who are intrinsically linked to the argan tree. In some areas, it's tradition to allow goats to climb the trees to freely feed on the fruits. Argan kernels are then collected from their excrement, saving the laborious work of cracking open the nuts manually. But nowadays, in most argan forestries, this peculiar sight is mainly used as a tourist attraction.</p><p><strong>Khadija Heeda:</strong> When oil produced that way was studied, it was found to be unfit for consumption. If the goat has any problem, it becomes harmful. Goats are a part of this region &#8212; tourists enjoy seeing the goats in the argan trees, and they like to take pictures with them.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Traditionally, Amazigh women, who until 1956 required the man's permission to leave their homes, made argan oil primarily for culinary purposes using methods passed down through generations. This artisanal oil was occasionally sold on the roadside in recycled bottles for as little as $3 per liter.</p><p><strong>Zoubida Charrouf:</strong> We found out that the women who prepared this oil in a traditional way had very soft skin and no wrinkles at all. But we had no scientific proof.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Zoubida Charrouf first studied the argan tree for her PhD in the late 1980s, when the species was in dangerous decline. After conducting scientific research to support the moisturizing benefits of argan oil on hair and skin, Charrouf planned to transform the environmental problem into an economic solution.</p><p><strong>Zoubida Charrouf:</strong> The objective was not to keep these results in the drawers at the university, but to go out into the field and organize the sector. These women were not organized at all, who produced argan oil in the traditional way at home. It was very difficult. It was something new. They didn't know what a cooperative was. Then, they never left their homes. But we started with 16 women, and as soon as the others saw how this first cooperative turned out, a lot of women came to see us who also wanted to organize themselves into cooperatives and benefit from the marketing of Argan oil.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Sure enough, the rapid rise in popularity of argan oil not only brought profit to the region, but also revitalized an entire ecosystem. The newfound respect for the value of argan trees ensured stability for the species, and in turn, the surrounding wildlife and community reaped the benefits. The argan tree, known locally as \"the tree of life,\" provides food, shelter, and protection from desertification, and its deep roots prevent soil erosion, allowing vegetated grass to grow for grazing livestock. It's estimated that up to 90% of the economy in this region is owed to the argan tree.</p><p><strong>Zoubida Charrouf:</strong> There are almost 3 million people who subsist on the argan tree because it provides a lot of working days for the local population. The extraction of the<br >oil alone provides almost 1 million working days. But the most important role is the environmental role. The argan tree is really the last green curtain on the desert.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> In just one generation, the international market for argan oil has risen from just 200 liters to 4,000 metric tons in 2019. By 2025, the state's ambition is to sell over 10,000 metric tons. To facilitate this increase, the area for producing the oil has expanded more than 100 miles south of Essaouira and is due to expand north.</p><p>As with any costly ingredient, argan oil products are often adulterated. Both cosmetic and culinary argan oil is often labeled as \"pure\" despite the undisclosed percentage of Argania kernel oil being mixed with a host of chemical compounds.</p><p>And cheaper, mechanically extracted oil has begun to appear on the market for as little as $22 a liter, threatening the stability of the local cooperatives. However, some cosmetic giants, such as L'Or&#233;al, have committed to fair-trade programs to help ensure the stability of their argan oil and the preservation of the forest's biodiversity.</p><p>With the help of the cooperatives, the traditional skills held by the Amazigh women have created a booming industry. But even though this income has granted some financial independence in a male-dominated society, the women normally make less than $220 a month - below Morocco's recommended national minimum wage.</p><p>With the argan oil industry predicted to continue its growth, the prosperity of the Amazigh women remains to be seen.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The coronavirus pandemic prompted the largest quarterly and year-over-year gross domestic product declines in US history. Unemployment skyrocketed, consumer spending slowed immensely, and overall activity ground to a halt.</p><p>Plunges in US GDP have historically driven earnings-per-share declines four to five times larger than what was seen, the strategist found. This year's downturn reversed the trend. Though GDP has contracted nearly 11% from its recent high, EPS only dropped by 15%.</p><p>Companies were able to limit EPS damage to \"one of the mildest recessionary contractions of the post-war era\" despite the coronavirus fueling the biggest economic downturn in nearly a century, Paulsen said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-hedge-mutual-funds-market-favorites-goldman-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 9 stocks that are poised to continue crushing the market as the 'shared favorites' of Wall Street's biggest investors</a></em></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4b9d1d60bf1f002807962d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 08 30 at 8.35.21 AM\" height=\"841\" width=\"716\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.leutholdgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Leuthold Group</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"If firms are successful at minimizing the earnings impact of a record collapse in the economy, why shouldn't the stock market recover faster and more robustly?\" he wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Detailed below are the four factors Paulsen says reinforced corporate earnings before and during the coronavirus recession.</p><h2>(1) Fed to the rescue</h2><p>To start, the government and Federal Reserve's response to coronavirus economic fallout was faster and larger than in any other recession. The Fed stepped in with unprecedented lending programs and asset purchase strategies, while Congress passed the historic $2.2 trillion CARES Act to inject fiscal relief into the economy.</p><p>The response was more than double the size of aid efforts used during the financial crisis, and seven times larger than those used after the dot-com bust, Paulsen said. The cocktail of fiscal and monetary relief \"buffered company sales trends\" from the damage typically incurred in a recession, he added.</p><p>Sales data for <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500_500\">S&#38;P 500</a> companies shows just how directly the policy response buoyed earnings. For the first time in data going back to 1990, annual sales per share growth fell less than nominal GDP growth during a recession. The former even avoided contraction despite the dire backdrop.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-david-rosenberg-dot-com-tech-bubble-distortions-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">35-year market vet David Rosenberg warns the stock market's rally features distortions that were glaring during the tech bubble &#8212; and lays out his plausible scenario for a crash</a></em></p><h2>(2) Companies battened down the hatches</h2><p>Just as the government responded to the virus's sudden shock, so did the nation's biggest corporations. Firms slashed costs by unprecedented amounts through layoffs and liquidations to maintain their cash piles. By the second quarter, the US output gap &#8212; a measure of how much firms under-utilize the economy's resources &#8212; sank to a post-war low.</p><p>Though the pandemic itself wasn't anticipated, companies were prepared themselves for the resulting economic hit, Paulsen said.</p><p>\"Because this recession was predictable, businesses moved more quickly and more assertively than ever in lowering breakeven points to preserve profits more effectively than in past cycles,\" the strategist added.</p><h2>(3) Shrunken household debt piles</h2><p>In past recessions, US households entered downturns with increasingly high levels of debt. Such indebtedness tends to worsen slumps, as Americans lack the extra cash to restart the country's economic engine.</p><p>This year has been different. The household debt burden sat near record lows when the recession started, leaving Americans with plenty more power to maintain spending and keep companies afloat. The personal savings rate heading into the recession was also double that seen before the 2000 and 2008 downturns. In all, these positive trends helped drive corporate sales and pad against a worse plunge than past recessions, the strategist said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-cheap-companies-strong-earnings-morgan-stanley-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MORGAN STANLEY: Buy these 12 underappreciated stocks that offer strong profit growth and are due for a surge</a></em></p><p>\"The US consumer came into this crisis in uncommonly strong financial shape, surrounded by a robust job market and with fewer headwinds than one normally faces when entering the recession,\" Paulsen said, adding the lack of hurdles could be \"why many consumer spending categories have bounced back quicker and stronger than most expected.\"</p><h2>(4) Bolstered rainy-day funds</h2><p>Companies also entered the coronavirus recession in better positions than usual. S&#38;P 500 firms' debt to earnings ratios stood at historic lows, and cash flow per dollar of sales was higher than in past downturns. Combined, the gauges reveal companies had less debt to worry about and healthier cash buffers once the pandemic stifled sales.</p><p>\"Having financial strength and flexibility, as opposed to the worsening vulnerabilities that often characterize the health of businesses in advance of a recession, provides far greater options when challenges emerge once in a recession,\" Paulsen wrote.</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-strategy-wall-street-career-advice-savita-subramanian-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Savita Subramanian uses her philosophy major more than her math degree as Bank of America's US equity chief.

virtual program involves physical activities like breathing exercises and cardio, as well as lectures, meditations, and motivational talks.</li><li>Marissa Oliver, a 36-year-old who's had symptoms for more than five months, said the program has improved her psyche and reduced tightness in her diaphragm.</li><li>Eventually, it could feed into a long-term treatment plan.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>Each day, Marissa Oliver logs onto her computer after work and sees the familiar face of Dr. Noah Greenspan, a physical therapist with colorful tattoos on both arms. He offers Oliver &#8212; and many other coronavirus patients with long-lasting symptoms &#8212; a daily motivation: They are not their illness. Things will get better.&#160;</p><p>Before the pandemic, Dr. Greenspan worked with elderly patients diagnosed with cardiovascular and pulmonary disease in New York City. But as the coronavirus spread, he began to hear more and more from COVID-19 patients who said they hadn't recovered. That's the case for Oliver: The 36-year-old has had difficulty breathing since March 11.&#160;</p><p>So Greenspan decided to see how these COVID-19 \"long-haulers\" would respond to some of the same exercises he often gave his elderly patients, even though many, like Oliver, are much younger than the people Greenspan previously treated. His initial program turned out to be too rigorous, so Greenspan launched a specialized, virtual \"<a href=\"https://pulmonarywellness.org/covid-bootcamp/\">COVID-19 bootcamp</a>,\" on August 2.</p><p>More than 300 patients have signed up, he said, and their progress is offering clues about how to treat the disease's long-term effects.</p><p>\"Each week, we are seeing patients, throwing a little pebble, letting the pool ripple, seeing how things go,\" he said. \"We're starting to be able to map out a consistent treatment plan and a consistent rehabilitation plan that will likely work for the majority of people, as long as we do it the right way.\"</p><p>The daily program starts with a meditation or inspirational lecture, then moves on to breathing exercises, strength training, and cardio. It's donation-based, so patients have the option to sign up for free.</p><p>\"Since I started, I've actually noticed a lessening of the diaphragm tightness, which was a symptom I've had nonstop for four and a half months,\" Oliver, who manages an arts organization, said. \"It's these exercises that I tie directly to helping relieve my pain naturally.\"</p><h2>Rehab programs address long-term COVID-19 symptoms</h2><p>Greenspan said limited hospital capacity earlier in the pandemic meant that many COVID-19 long-haulers had to deal with severe cases on their own at home &#8212; some had pneumonia, blood clots, or high fevers.</p><p>\"If this were any other time in the history of the world, a huge number of the patients would have been admitted to the hospital,\" Greenspan said. \"For all we know, had they been admitted right off the bat, maybe they wouldn't be long-haulers or maybe the severity of their symptoms would have been a lot less.\"</p><p>Other long-haulers never developed life-threatening symptoms, and their brain scans, chest X-rays, and blood work have since come back normal &#8212; yet they've continued to experience heart palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, and difficulty breathing for months. Some doctors suggested to these patients that their symptoms might be psychological.</p><p>\"We know for sure now that that's not true,\" Greenspan said.</p><p>He believes there's a way for many of these patients to fully recover.</p><p>The six-week bootcamp involves recorded, virtual daily sessions &#8212; patients can tune in from anywhere at any time. The short-term goal of the lessons and exercises in the sessions is to improve patients' flexibility and balance, and to teach them how to regain control of their breath when they start to feel winded.&#160;</p><p>Sessions last around 30 minutes to start, but patients have the option to break up the exercises throughout the day or tack on more time as they grow stronger. The exercises vary each day.&#160;</p><p>At the start of the bootcamp, each patient fills out a quality-of-life survey. Greenspan said it's too early to administer a second survey to anyone, but he plans to track patients' progress once they've finished.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f493cd17ffa48002894ce24?format=jpeg\" alt=\"online lecture\" height=\"3333\" width=\"5000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Fitness coach Gabrielle Friscira gives a lesson by video conference in Saint-Remy-l&#39;Honore, France, on April 15, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The bootcamp is the US's first online rehab program for COVID-19 patients.&#160;</p><p>But it's not the first to treat long-haulers using physical therapy: The Detroit Medical Center began offering an <a href=\"https://www.dmc.org/news/newsroom/rehabilitation-institute-of-michigan-launches-covid-19-rehab-recovery-program\">in-person rehab program</a> for COVID-19 patients in June. A rehabilitation clinic in Genoa, Italy, is also walking long-haulers through light, in-person exercises. And a clinic at St. Luke's Hospital in Bradford, England, has enlisted a dietitian, psychologist, and chronic-fatigue specialist to care for long-haul patients.</p><p>Greenspan's bootcamp has adopted a similarly holistic approach.</p><p>Patients do tai chi, yoga, and meditation as part of the program. They listen to relaxing music while walking in place, while gazing at serene footage from around the world on the screen. They also watch lectures from top physicians, pulmonologists, cardiologists, and neurologists, and can submit questions about their health.&#160;</p><p>\"At first I thought, 'Oh, it's kind of cheesy,' but honestly, I can tell that it's improving my psyche,\" Oliver said, adding, \"the emotional and mental impacts of the virus have been just as severe as the physical ones.\"&#160;</p><p>The breathing exercises are what she finds most useful, Oliver added. They often involve deep inhales through the nose and long, extended exhales through pursed lips.&#160;</p><p>In May, Oliver was diagnosed with pleurisy, or inflammation in her lung tissue. Right around the time that she started the bootcamp, her pulmonologist prescribed a steroid, which she said made her feel \"really weird.\" Greenspan's program has made her feel like she can manage her symptoms without the steroid, she said.</p><h2>Too much activity can push patients 'over the edge'</h2><p>Oliver has nicknamed her lasting, fluctuating symptoms \"the COVID coaster.\" Her health is hard to predict, she said, and it's often hard to know which types of activity will exacerbate her illness.&#160;</p><p>\"One of the things about COVID is it's definitely not orderly,\" Greenspan said. \"It's completely chaotic. There's no rhyme or reason to it.\"</p><p>That might be because an aggressive inflammatory response to the virus can impair the autonomic nervous system, he said, which regulates blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. This would explain why some patients feel dizzy or experience a racing heart after merely sitting up or walking across a room. Breathing, he said, is the portal to helping the nervous system heal and improve.</p><p>\"You're only going to heal as quickly as your slowest system, and unfortunately the neurological system is one of the slower systems to heal,\" Greenspan said. \"Until that inflammation goes away, you may not see the change.\"</p><p>Like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-long-haul-lasting-symptoms-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-2020-8\">patients with chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, many COVID-19 long-haulers say their symptoms get worse after exercise.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f493c9a7ffa48002894ce1f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"virtual workout exercise\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Emmie Galan conducts a virtual workout  via Instagram live for her 8th grade physical education students on April 27, 2020, in Schaumburg, Illinois.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"You have to go extremely slow with COVID patients because sometimes they can feel perfectly fine during a treatment, or they can feel perfectly fine during an activity, but if you go that one step over the edge, then they could be knocked out for a week after that or they can have a flare in their symptoms,\" Greenspan said.</p><p>He encourages patients to go slower than they might think is necessary.&#160;The ultimate goal, he added, is to help them manage their recovery on their own and eventually resume normal activities.</p><p>\"It's like if you were all of a sudden in a pitch-black room,\" Greenspan said. \"Until you adjust to that darkness, you're going to tip toe around, taking slow steps, feeling things out. Eventually, as you gain confidence with that, we can start to move at a quicker pace.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
