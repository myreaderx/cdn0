In this blog I will be discussing my progress with the wrecking ball simulation and my scrollbar separation work. Apart from this I have also finalized the physics simulation tutorials and have created a Pull Request to finally get it merged with the official repository. The official repository of my sub-org can be found </span> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/fury-gl/fury\">here</a></span>.</p>\n\n<h2>What did you do this week?</h2>\n\n<p><span>This week I was mainly focusing on the wrecking ball simulation. This simulation is basically the combination of chain simulation and brick wall simulation. A sphere attached to a chain smashes a \"NxNxN\" brick wall. The simulation is as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90336291-84232280-dff8-11ea-869b-21a99b203c31.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p><span>There's a rendering bug with the cylinders because of which the chain segments look weird. My mentors confirmed that this bug originated from VTK's `cylinder source` method and they are currently working on it to fix it. The simulation will render correctly once that bug is fixed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Regarding the scrollbar separation task, I was able to fix those callback issues that I was facing. The mouse callbacks on the scrollbar now work correctly:</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90337280-1af2dd80-dfff-11ea-94c4-508121307583.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p><span>I have also created a pull request to add the following physics simulations with proper documentation to the main repository:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span>Brick Wall Simulation</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Ball Collision Simulation</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Chain Simulation</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Wrecking Ball Simulation</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What is coming up next?</h2>\n\n<p><span>Currently I am a bit confused with the implementation of scrollbars with UI components. I had a meeting with my mentor and he decided to help me out with this. So most probably I will be working with the scrollbar component and its implementation. Next week will also be the final week for GSoC 2020 before the evaluations start so I would work on getting the final documentation and formalities ready.</span></p>\n\n<h2>Did you get stuck anywhere?</h2>\n\n<p><span>Apart from the scrollbar implementation idea, I did not face any major issues.</span></p>\n\n<div><span>Thank you for reading, see you next week!!</span></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 15:20:18 +0000","feedId":554,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90336291-84232280-dff8-11ea-869b-21a99b203c31.gif","linkMd5":"82561f06cbc5c24c4c0a701eabb425e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/16/16-55-07-481_ea690713d69dc5ed.webp","destWidth":900,"destHeight":737,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90336291-84232280-dff8-11ea-869b-21a99b203c31.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/16/16-55-03-331_ea690713d69dc5ed.webp","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90337280-1af2dd80-dfff-11ea-94c4-508121307583.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/16/16-54-49-536_4420cbac92584cf7.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-17 00:54:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-17 00:54:48","feedId":554,"fetchDate":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 16:54:48 +0000","fetchMs":1408,"handleMs":8764,"totalMs":31562,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"18.200.90.105","hostName":"europe-020.herokuapp.com","requestId":"d85695344ecd47e284315eeebd82b1ac_554","bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2},"extra4":{"start":1597596878054,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":1567,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":8764,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":18093,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":21217,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90337280-1af2dd80-dfff-11ea-94c4-508121307583.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":500,"destHeight":500,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/16/16-54-49-536_4420cbac92584cf7.webp","sourceBytes":46895,"destBytes":61414,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":554,"totalSpendMs":2489,"convertSpendMs":603,"createdTime":"2020-08-17 00:54:48","host":"europe-013.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/nibba2018s-blog/weekly-check-in-12/","linkMd5ListStr":"82561f06cbc5c24c4c0a701eabb425e2","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"45.8 KB","destSize":"60 KB","compressRate":"131%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90336291-84232280-dff8-11ea-869b-21a99b203c31.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":900,"destHeight":737,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/16/16-55-03-331_ea690713d69dc5ed.webp","sourceBytes":7614233,"destBytes":5176426,"targetWebpQuality":52,"feedId":554,"totalSpendMs":18067,"convertSpendMs":13639,"createdTime":"2020-08-17 00:54:48","host":"europe-012.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/nibba2018s-blog/weekly-check-in-12/","linkMd5ListStr":"82561f06cbc5c24c4c0a701eabb425e2,82561f06cbc5c24c4c0a701eabb425e2","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"7.3 MB","destSize":"4.9 MB","compressRate":"68%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29832615/90336291-84232280-dff8-11ea-869b-21a99b203c31.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":900,"destHeight":737,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/16/16-55-07-481_ea690713d69dc5ed.webp","sourceBytes":7614233,"destBytes":5176426,"targetWebpQuality":52,"feedId":554,"totalSpendMs":21032,"convertSpendMs":18486,"createdTime":"2020-08-17 00:54:48","host":"gentle-escarpment-75234.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/nibba2018s-blog/weekly-check-in-12/","linkMd5ListStr":"82561f06cbc5c24c4c0a701eabb425e2,82561f06cbc5c24c4c0a701eabb425e2","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"7.3 MB","destSize":"4.9 MB","compressRate":"68%"}]}
