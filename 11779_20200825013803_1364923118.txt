As <a href=\"https://www.aier.org/staff/jeffrey-tucker/\">Jeffrey Tucker</a> reminds us, <a href=\"https://www.aier.org/article/woodstock-occurred-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/\">Woodstock took place</a> in the midst of a global pandemic that claimed more American lives than has Covid-19 (at least so far) &#8212; at a time when the population was much smaller .   After correcting for population size and demographics, Tucker estimates the Hong Kong flu epidemic of 1969 killed the equivalent of 250,000 contemporary Americans, compared to under 100,000 so far for the current affliction.  </p>\n<p>Yet in 1969, American life went on pretty much as normal.  As Tucker points out:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nStock markets didn’t crash because of the flu. Congress passed no legislation. The Federal Reserve did nothing. Not a single governor acted to enforce social distancing, curve flattening (even though hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized), or banning of crowds. No mothers were arrested for taking their kids to other homes. No surfers were arrested. No daycares were shut even though there were more infant deaths with this virus than the one we are experiencing now. There were no suicides, no unemployment, no drug overdoses attributable to flu. </p>\n<p>Media covered the pandemic but it never became a big issue.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Woodstock producers flew in a dozen doctors to have on hand in case of a fast-spreading virus, but they seem to have given no serious thought to the prospect of cancelling.</p>\n<p>Why such a difference between then and now?  Tucker suggests a few possible culprits (the 24 hour news cycle, political and cultural shifts, etc.), but the first thing that came to my mind was that folks today are a whole lot richer than folks in 1969, and can therefore much better afford to take a few months off.  If the average worker in 1969 had taken a four-month unscheduled vacation without any assistance, he&#8217;d have gone hungry &#8212; and the amount of available assistance was limited by the fact that everyone else was a lot poorer then too.</p>\n<p>Here are the key facts we need to test that theory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The income of the average American today is about two-and-a-half times what it was in 1969. </li>\n<li>The income elasticity of the value of life is estimated to be somewhere between .5 and 1.0, and probably toward the lower end of that range for a developed country like the United States.  I&#8217;ll take it to be .6.   Here the &#8220;value of life&#8221; refers to the amount people are willing to pay to avoid a given small chance of death, and the elasticity estimate means that the value of your life is (approximately) proportional to I<sup>.6</sup>, where I is your income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taken together, these facts imply that the value of a life in 1969 was about 58% of what it is today, which in turn implies that people would have been willing to put up with only 58% as much lost income in exchange for the same amount of safety.  If you&#8217;re willing to tolerate six months without a paycheck to avoid, say,  a 1% chance of death, then your 1969 self would have been willing to tolerate only about three-and-a-half months.   If avoiding that 1% chance of death requires, say, a five-month lockdown (or any other length longer than three-and-a-half months but shorter than six), then you&#8217;re going to favor that lockdown, though you&#8217;d have scoffed at the thought of it in 1969.</p>\n<p>Even this fails to account for another factor:  A national shutdown of a given length would have been a lot costlier in 1969 than it is in 2020, when a good 30% of us can work from home.  Perhaps a six-month lockdown only costs us (on average), say, three month&#8217;s income.  (I pulled that &#8220;three months&#8221; out of my hat.  I&#8217;m sure with a little research I could have done better.) If that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re willing to tolerate for a given amount of safety, then our 1969 selves would have tolerated only a one-and-three-quarter months&#8217;s income loss, which might have meant something like a two month lockdown.   Where we&#8217;d tolerate six months, they&#8217;d tolerate only two.</p>\n<p>In other words:  Nobody considered locking down the economy in 1969 because they couldn&#8217;t afford to (or more precisely, given their relative poverty, they preferred to spend their wealth on other things).  Today&#8217;s lockdown is widely supported because it&#8217;s a luxury we&#8217;ve grown rich enough to afford.  In other words, the lockdown is yet another triumph of capitalism.</p>\n<p>That, at least, is what the back  of my envelope says.  I expect there are people who have thought about this a whole lot harder than I have.  I hope we hear from some of them. </p>\n</div><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebigquestions.com%2F2020%2F05%2F19%2Fthis-is-what-a-pandemic-looks-like%2F&#38;title=This%20is%20What%20a%20Pandemic%20Looks%20Like\" id=\"wpa2a_16\">Share/Save</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 May 2020 21:57:33 +0000","feedId":11779,"bgimg":"http://www.thebigquestions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woodstocksmall.jpg","linkMd5":"e443159d933c906ce9b5543f00ea86c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn69@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-38-01-078_93a207aa333536b8.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":190,"sourceBytes":120117,"destBytes":39526,"author":"Steve Landsburg","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.thebigquestions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woodstocksmall.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn69@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-38-01-078_93a207aa333536b8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598319480010},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:38:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:38:00","title":"Take the Tablet","link":"http://www.thebigquestions.com/?p=11341","description":"<div class=\"pf-content\"><p>My thoughts on risk assessment and Covid-19 policy are <a href=\n\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/science-risk\">here</a>.</p>\n<p> <center><font color=orange>Click <a href=\"http://www.thebigquestions.com/2020/06/29/take-the-tablet/\">here</a> to comment or read others&#8217; comments.</font></center></p>\n</div><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebigquestions.com%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Ftake-the-tablet%2F&#38;title=Take%20the%20Tablet\" id=\"wpa2a_14\">Share/Save</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 05:34:11 +0000","feedId":11779,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3dcc31e937241251f03c27b15a2f7a31","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Steve Landsburg","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598319480010},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:37:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:37:59","title":"How to Kill Off Amazon’s Damned “Popular Highlights”","link":"http://www.thebigquestions.com/?p=11372","description":"<div class=\"pf-content\"><p>As my good deed for today, I&#8217;m posting a solution to a problem that I&#8217;m sure is plaguing others.  I hope Google points them here.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll say this much for brick-and-mortar booksellers:  Not one of them ever sold me a book, then showed up at my house two years later, pulled the book off the shelf and started highlighting passages for me.  I can&#8217;t say as much for Amazon, which has been selling me books for many years and has suddenly decided to highlight passages in <b>all</b> of them.  Effectively, they&#8217;ve vandalized every book they&#8217;ve ever sold me.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know about the checkbox in the settings for &#8220;Show Popular Highlights&#8221;.  (This is in the Android Kindle App.)   Yes, I have that box unchecked.  I am not an idiot.  Unchecking the box has no effect.  Checking it and then unchecking it again has no effect.  The highlights remain highlighted.</p>\n<p>Here are some other things that don&#8217;t work:  Clear the app cache.   Reboot the phone.  Express rage.</p>\n<p>So I called Amazon customer service and had the good luck to hook up with Brandi G., who was <b>fantastic</b>.  She instantly understood the problem, instantly understood everything I had tried to do to fix it, and, unlike what I&#8217;ve come to expect from customer service reps pretty much everywhere, she did not insist that I try all the same things again.  Instead, she suggested that I uninstall the app completely and reinstall it, and she stayed with me on the phone to see how things would turn out.  Presto!  Problem solved.  Yay Brandi.</p>\n<p>Then an hour later, the popular highights came back.</p>\n<p>So I uninstalled and re-installed about six more times (because that&#8217;s the kind of guy I am) and finally called Amazon again.  This time I had the bad luck to hook up with Devan J., who kept me on the phone for 35 minutes, mostly in silence while he researched the problem.  (When I suggested that we hang up and he could call me back when he had an answer, he insisted that I stay on the line, to no apparent purpose.)  One of the first things I asked him was:  What if I install an <b>older version</b> of the app?  No, said Devan, unfortunately that&#8217;s impossible.</p>\n<p>Like an idiot, I spent about 24 hours believing him.  Then I decided to go ahead and do it.  Here is the solution:</p>\n<p>1)  Fully uninstall the app.  This means going to the phone settings, then Apps, then Amazon Kindle.  First choose &#8220;Force Stop&#8221; and then &#8220;Uninstall&#8221;.</p>\n<p>2)  Go to apkpure.com, search for the Kindle app, and you&#8217;ll be presented with a great variety of choices, all representing different vintages of the same app.  I chose one from June 2020, two months ago, well before my problems started.  Click to download, click to install, and voila.  Problem solved.</p>\n<p>I hope this works for you too.</p>\n<p>Coming soon, I hope:  Tricks I&#8217;ve discovered for setting up a new Windows 10 machine, which has been something like a fulltime job for me for the past two weeks.  Why can&#8217;t things just work out of the box?</p>\n</div><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebigquestions.com%2F2020%2F08%2F13%2Fhow-to-kill-off-amazons-damned-popular-highlights%2F&#38;title=How%20to%20Kill%20Off%20Amazon%E2%80%99s%20Damned%20%E2%80%9CPopular%20Highlights%E2%80%9D\" id=\"wpa2a_2\">Share/Save</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:03:29 +0000","feedId":11779,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9f61101cc4fffd6e196cf6765ecc5155","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Steve Landsburg","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598319479998},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:37:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:37:59","title":"The Times They Have A’Changed","link":"http://www.thebigquestions.com/?p=11350","description":"<div class=\"pf-content\">\n <p>\n  <center>\n   <br /> \n   <table cellspacing=\"10\" cellpadding=\"10\"> \n    <tr> \n     <td><img src=\"http://www.landsburg.org/kraft.jpg\" /></td> \n     <td><img src=\"http://www.landsburg.org/florence.jpg\" /></td> \n    </tr> \n   </table> \n   <p></p>\n  </center></p> \n <p>Thoughts on what it takes to be a successful presidential candidate, circa 1980.</p> \n <p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kraft\">Joseph Kraft</a>: </p> \n <blockquote>\n  <p>The emergence of President Carter and Ronald Reagan as the nearly certain nominees of their parties expresses not a failure of the system, but a true translation of how much the majority prefers nice men to effective measures. </p>\n </blockquote> \n <p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_King\">Florence King</a>: </p> \n <blockquote>\n  <p>We want a president who is as much like an American tourist as possible.

Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t matter, because these people are as unoriginal as they are silly, and the issues are pretty much the same as they were when a bunch of equally silly people ganged up on Walter six years ago.  So you&#8217;ll be pretty much caught up if you just re-read the accounts from back then.</p>\n<p>You could, for example, re-read my 2014 blog posts titled <a href=\"https://www.thebigquestions.com/2014/02/13/block-heads/\">Block Heads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thebigquestions.com/2014/02/17/chips-off-the-block/\">Chips Off the Block.</a>   I&#8217;ll even make this easier for you by reposting the first one right here:</p>\n<p><center><font size=+2>Block Heads</font></center><br />\n<center>February 13, 2014</center></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thebigquestions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/walterblock.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thebigquestions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/walterblock.jpg\" alt=\"walterblock\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9255\" /></a>The righteously irrepressible <a href=\"http://www.walterblock.com/\">Walter Block</a> has made it his mission to <a  href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Defending-Undefendable-Walter-Block/dp/1933550171/ref=nosim/?tag=moseissase-20\">defend the undefendable</a>, but there are limits.  Chattel slavery, for example, will get no defense from Walter, and he recently explained why:  The central problem with slavery is that you can&#8217;t walk away from it.  If it were voluntary, it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad.  In Walter&#8217;s words:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe slaves could not quit. They were forced to ‘associate’ with their masters when they would have vastly preferred not to do so. Otherwise, slavery wasn’t so bad. You could pick cotton, sing songs, be fed nice gruel, etc. The only real problem was that this relationship was compulsory.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>A group of Walter&#8217;s colleagues at Loyola university (who, for brevity, I will henceforth refer to as &#8220;the gang of angry yahoos&#8221;) <a href=http://www.loyolamaroon.com/2.6713/letter-faculty-says-walter-block-s-claims-were-once-again-untrue-and-offensive-1.2854769#.UvxAHWJdWO6\">appears to concur</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nTraders in human flesh kidnapped men, women and children from the interior of the African continent and marched them in stocks to the coast. Snatched from their families, these individuals awaited an unknown but decidedly terrible future. Often for as long as three months enslaved people sailed west, shackled and mired in the feces, urine, blood and vomit of the other wretched souls on the boat&#8230;.The violation of human dignity, the radical exploitation of people’s labor, the brutal violence that slaveholders utilized to maintain power, the disenfranchisement of American citizens, the destruction of familial bonds, the pervasive sexual assault and the systematic attempts to dehumanize an entire race all mark slavery as an intellectually, economically, politically and socially condemnable institution no matter how, where, or when it is practiced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So everybody&#8217;s on the same side, here, right?   Surely nobody believes the slaves were <b>voluntarily</b> snatched from their families, shackled and mired in waste, sexually assaulted and all the rest.  All the bad stuff was involuntary and &#8212; this being the whole point &#8212; was <b>possible only because</b> it was involuntary.  That&#8217;s a concept with broad applicability.  One could, for example, say the same about Auschwitz. Nobody would have much minded the torture and the gas chambers if there had been an opt-out provision. And this is a useful observation, if one is attempting to argue that involuntary associations are the root of much evil.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-11356\"></span></p>\n<p>Nevertheless &#8212; that is, <b>even though they agree with him</b> &#8212; the yahoos go on to denounce Walter&#8217;s words as &#8220;untrue and offensive&#8221; &#8212; and to call for his condemnation and censure &#8212; because &#8212; well, as far as I can tell, because a certain kind of person just loves getting high on the euphoria of outrage, though God knows there are enough <b>real</b> outrages in the world that it&#8217;s hard to see why people feel like they&#8217;ve got to manufacture them.</p>\n<p>Enter Father Kevin Wildes, the president of Loyola University &#8212;- you know, the guy who&#8217;s supposed to have his faculty&#8217;s back &#8212; to publish this astonishing response:\t \t</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nDr. Block made two claims, one empirical and one conceptual, that are simply wrong.  First, he made the claim that chattel slavery “was not so bad.”  “Bad” is a comparative measure that, like every comparison, is understood in a contrast set. My initial question was where is the evidence?  Dr. Block makes an assertion but gives no evidence for his assertion.  </p>\n<p>His second claim is an example of a fundamental logical mistake.  In peaking of discriminatory lunch counters, Dr. Block makes the mistake of assuming that because of the Civil Rights legislation people would be compelled to associate with others against their will. The Civil Rights legislation did no such thing. </p>\n<p>What the Civil Rights legislation did was prevent places like Woolworth’s from excluding people because of their race. No one was forced to sit at the lunch counter.  The law simply made clear that people could not be excluded from the lunch counter because of their race.</p>\n<p>If these remarks were made in a paper for my class, I would return the paper with a failing grade. This is hardly critical thinking. Rather it is a position filled with assertions, without argument or evidence, to gain attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My lord. Where to begin? Let&#8217;s skip right by the irony of a Catholic priest admonishing us to reject claims made with inadequate evidence, and get right to the meat of this:</p>\n<p>1) Father Wildes opposes &#8220;slavery enforced against someone&#8217;s free will&#8221;. Professor Block says: &#8220;The real problem with slavery was that it was compulsory&#8221;.  If Father Wildes really wanted to reinforce his own point, I wonder why he failed to quote Professor Block with approval.</p>\n<p>2) Professor Block says that, except for its compulsory nature, chattel slavery was &#8220;not so bad&#8221;. Father Wildes calls this &#8220;an empirical claim&#8221;. Well, that&#8217;s one reading. Another reading is that it&#8217;s a <b>principled</b> claim, namely an instance of the principle that <b>nothing</b> is so bad as long as you can walk away from it.  In fact, given the context, this would seem to be the obvious reading.  Why did Father Wildes choose the reading that is both less likely and less charitable?  </p>\n<p>3) For the sake of argument, though, let&#8217;s suppose that Professor Block&#8217;s claim <b>was</b> meant to be empirical &#8212; i.e. a claim that the material conditions of chattel slavery were, by the standards of the time, not so bad. That is indeed an empirical claim. Father Wildes says this claim is &#8220;simply wrong&#8221;. That&#8217;s also an empirical claim. Father Wildes considers it reprehensible that Professor Block would make an empirical claim without citing evidence. In the course of doing so, Father Wildes makes an equally strong empirical claim, without citing evidence. You don&#8217;t need years of Jesuit training to see the problem here.</p>\n<p>(Side note:  Surely there were in fact slaves who were treated well &#8212; except of course for the involuntary part &#8212; and slaves who were treated abominably.  If you&#8217;re interested in what sorts of treatment were most common in various times and locations, the place to start is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Time-Cross-Economics-American-Slavery/dp/0393312186/ref=nosim/?tag=moseissase-20\">Time on the Cross</a> and the critical literature that it spawned.  It has occurred to me to wonder whether Father Wildes, for all his professed certainty about this empirical question, has bothered to peruse that literature.)</p>\n<p>4) I am dismayed by Father Wildes&#8217;s blindness to the clear analogy between being forced to work someone else&#8217;s land and being forced to serve someone else&#8217;s lunch. (Are these exactly the same thing? Of course not. That&#8217;s why the word &#8220;analogy&#8221; was invented.) But of course we all have our blind spots.  On the other hand, a lot of us went into academia precisely because we like having our eyes opened.  We are in fact particularly delighted when our eyes are opened by our students.  Blindness is easy to forgive.  Proud and defiant blindness &#8212; blindness coupled with an announcement that one has no interest in seeing things in any other way &#8212; is quite another thing. And malicious blindness &#8212; the sort of blindness that would punish a student with a failing grade for daring to point to an obvious truth that Father Wildes happens to have overlooked &#8212; is a most distressing thing indeed.   One wonders why a man with such deep-seated hostility to careful thought, and particularly to careful thought on the part of his students, chose an academic career in the first place.</p>\n</div><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebigquestions.com%2F2020%2F07%2F17%2Fblock-heads-redux%2F&#38;title=Block%20Heads%2C%20Redux\" id=\"wpa2a_8\">Share/Save</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 05:15:05 +0000","feedId":11779,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2b9cdb9262b76813ccc15e0994b1170c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Steve Landsburg","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.thebigquestions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/walterblock.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn78@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-38-02-668_ab8a99c277b70647.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598319479998},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:37:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:37:59","title":"A Tale of Two Universes","link":"http://www.thebigquestions.com/?p=11365","description":"<div class=\"pf-content\"><p>A short time ago, in a Universe remarkably similar to our own, a team of researchers investigated racial differences in cognitive skills and concluded, with high degrees of certainty and precision, that the correlation between race and intelligence is zero.  They submitted their results to a journal called <b>Science</b>, which is remarkably similar to the journal called <i>Science</i> in our own Universe.  The paper was accepted for publication, but the editors saw fit to issue this public statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were concerned that the forces that want to downplay the differences between the races as well as the need for racial segregation would seize on these results to advance their agenda.  We decided that the benefit of providing the results to the scientific community was worthwhile.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which of the following best captures the way you feel about that statement?</p>\n<p><b>A.</b> Bravo to the editors for advancing the cause of truth, even if it might be misused.</p>\n<p><b>B.</b> Boo to the editors for even <b>thinking</b> about suppressing the truth, even if the truth might be misused.</p>\n<p><b>C.</b> WHAT?!?!? Since when is a failure to share the editors&#8217; political priorities a &#8220;misuse&#8221; in the first place?</p>\n<p><b>D.</b> Both B and C.</p>\n<p><b>E.</b> Other (please elaborate).</p>\n<p>My vote is for D. It is outrageously wrong for the editors to even consider using the resources of their journal to promote their private political agenda.  It is doubly wrong for them to even consider doing so by suppressing a paper they would otherwise accept.  And it is triply wrong for them to even consider imposing on the owners and readers of the journal to support a political agenda that some of those owners and readers will no doubt find deplorable.</p>\n<p>I happen to be one of those who deplore the expressed agenda, but that has nothing to do with my point here.  The outrage would be exactly as great if the editors were focused on protecting capitalism instead of segregation.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s come back to our own Universe, where the editors of <i>Science</i>  (the <b>real</b> <i>Science</i>) accepted a paper suggesting that a large fraction of the population might already have a sort of pre-immunity to Covid 19, and somehow saw fit to issue the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWe were concerned that forces that want to downplay the severity of the pandemic as well as the need for social distancing woud seize on the results to suggest that the situation was less urgent.  We decided that the benefit of providing the model to the scientific community was worthwhile.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I said, the two Universes are eerily similar.   The statements made by the editorial boards in both Universes seem about equally outrageous to me.</p>\n<p>The real-world editors, if they cared what I thought, might want to respond that my analogy fails because &#8220;the need for racial segregation&#8221; is a political stance, whereas &#8220;the need for social distancing&#8221; is a scientific one.  If so, they&#8217;d simply be wrong.  Biologists have no particular insight into whether people would be happier in a world with both a little more Covid and a few more hugs.  If any group is uniquely qualified to estimate the terms of that tradeoff, it&#8217;s the economists &#8212; but I wouldn&#8217;t want the editors of an economics journal making this kind of call either.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad that the editors did the right thing.  I&#8217;m appalled they even considered doing the wrong thing, and concerned that this means they might do the wrong thing in the future, and might have done so in the past.  It is not okay to suppress truth in the furtherance of a political agenda.  It is not okay to presume that all good people share in your agenda, or to co-opt other people&#8217;s resources in order to advance it.  </p>\n<p>(Hat tip to David Friedman, whose <a href=\"http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2020/08/covid-invisible-elephant-in-room.html\">blog</a> made me aware of this.)</p>\n<p> <center><font color=orange>Click <a href=\"http://www.thebigquestions.com/2020/08/09/a-tale-of-two-universes\">here</a> to comment or read others&#8217;
