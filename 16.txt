But what does an education mean, and what does claiming it look like, for lives and minds animating bodies born into dramatically different points along the vast spectrum of privilege and possibility which human society spans? </p>\n<p>This question comes alive in a wonderfully unexpected and necessary way in one of the highlights of the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/04/14/universe-in-verse-2019/\"> the third annual <em>Universe in Verse</em></a> by another great poet, essayist, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/01/the-light-of-the-world-elizabeth-alexander-memoir/\">almost unbearably moving memoirist</a>: <strong>Elizabeth Alexander</strong> &#8212; the fourth poet in history read at an American presidential inauguration (she welcomed Barack Obama to the presidency with her shimmering poem <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/17/elizabeth-alexander-verses-for-hope/\">&#8220;Praise Song for the Day&#8221;</a>) and the first woman of color to preside over <a href=\"https://mellon.org/about/staff/elizabeth-alexander/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the world&#8217;s largest philanthropic foundations</a>.</p>\n<p>Two years after Alexander illuminated a disquieting shadow-patch excised from the hegemonic history of science with the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/17/the-venus-hottentot-elizabeth-alexander/\">stunning poem</a> she read at the inaugural <em>Universe in Verse</em>, she returned to the stage to shine a beam of radiance on the beauty hidden in an umbral corner of the selective collective memory we call history. Following astrophysicist Janna Levin&#8217;s opening reading of a pair of short poems by two titanic contemporaries who never knew of each other&#8217;s existence &#8212; a short untitled exultation at the surreality of a solar eclipse by Emily Dickinson and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/05/31/astrophysicist-janna-levin-reads-when-i-heard-the-learnd-astronomer-walt-whitman/\">“When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer”</a> by Walt Whitman &#8212;

was twelve when she observed her first solar eclipse through a brass telescope set up in the front parlor of her modest Quaker home on the island of Nantucket. The cosmos, with its mystery governed by immutable laws of poetic precision, staggered her imagination. By fifteen, she had mastered higher mathematics, which she supplemented with an ardent love of poetry. No institution &#8212; not on the island, not on the globe &#8212; had anything further to offer her in the way of higher education for a woman. And so, at seventeen, she founded a small school of her own. </p>\n<p>The first children who approached the teenage teacher for enrollment were three “Portuguese” girls &#8212; the era&#8217;s slang for immigrants of color, whatever their actual nationality or race. Having just witnessed a vehement outcry when the Nantucket’s public school had attempted integration the previous year, Mitchell knew that admitting students of color would cost her the support of many parents, particularly the wealthy. But when the little girl representing the trio implored for a chance to learn, Mitchell made a decision with a clarity of conviction that would come to mark her life. The three “Portuguese” children became her first scholars, soon joined by others ranging in age from six to fourteen.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_61914\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mitchell-Letters-Journals-Classic-Reprint/dp/1451018460/?tag=braipick=20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=680%2C778&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"778\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61914\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchell_telescope.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=240%2C275&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=320%2C366&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=768%2C879&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=600%2C687&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The young Maria Mitchell&#8217;s telescope.

But before she could savor the success of her school, she was offered the head librarianship of the Nantucket Atheneum &#8212; a new kind of cultural institution, named after the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom, learning, and the arts, designed as a secular gathering place to discover and discuss ideas. She was eighteen. She would not relinquish her librarianship for two decades, despite the international celebrity into which her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/01/october-1-1847-miss-mitchells-comet/\">historic comet discovery</a> catapulted her at the end of her twenties; despite her landmark admission into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as the venerable institution&#8217;s first female member; despite becoming the first woman employed by the federal government for a “specialized non-domestic skill” as a “computer of Venus” &#8212; a one-person GPS performing complex celestial calculations to help sailors navigate the globe.</p>\n<p>During her tenure at the Atheneum, Mitchell hosted the institution’s regular public lectures by itinerant speakers. Among them was a young man who had escaped slavery three years earlier. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_62352\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Frederick-Douglass-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143106813/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=680%2C736&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"736\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62352\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=240%2C260&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=320%2C346&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frederickdouglass.jpg?resize=600%2C650&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frederick Douglass</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One August day in 1841, a nervous twenty-three-year-old <a href=\"brainpickings.org/2017/09/07/frederick-douglass-pictures-and-progress/\">Frederick Douglass</a> &#8212; the same age as Mitchell &#8212; took the podium at the Atheneum to deliver his very first public address before the mixed-race audience of five hundred gathered at the island&#8217;s temple of learning for the first Nantucket Anti-Slavery Convention. &#8220;It was with the utmost difficulty,&#8221; Douglass would later recount, &#8220;that I could stand erect, or that I could command and articulate two words without hesitation and stammering. I trembled in every limb.&#8221; He proceeded to deliver a speech so electrifying that at its conclusion, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who was waiting to take the platform next, leapt to his feet, turned to the audience, and exclaimed: “Have we been listening to a thing, a piece of property, or a man?” The chamber of the Great Hall bellowed with a resounding “A man! A man!” The man was hired on the spot as full-time lecturer for Garrison&#8217;s American Anti-Slavery Society. </p>\n<p>Four years later, by then one of the country&#8217;s most prominent public speakers, Douglass would write in his autobiography:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and incur my own abhorrence. From my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Maria Mitchell echoed this sentiment in her own diary as she was doing for women what Douglass was doing for African Americans:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best that can be said of my life so far is that it has been industrious, and the best that can be said of me is that I have not pretended to what I was not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mitchell and Douglass cherished their friendship for the remainder of their parallel pioneering lives &#8212; both world-famous before they were thirty, both liberators of possibility in their present, both role models of courage and tenacity for generations to come. The year Mitchell made her historic discovery of the world&#8217;s first telescopic comet, Douglass &#8212; who in that trembling dawn of his career had calmed his nerves by taking in the cosmic perspective through her telescope &#8212; began publishing his abolitionist newspaper; he titled it <em>The North Star</em> in homage to the key role astronomy played in the Underground Railroad &#8212; traveling at night, slaves were told to keep the river on one side and follow the Drinking Gourd, an African name for the Big Dipper, for if they kept after the pole star, they would keep themselves moving north. In the final year of hers, the ailing Mitchell &#8212; whose childhood home had been a stop on the Underground Railroad &#8212; exerted herself to travel many miles via ferry, coach, and train for a reception given in her cherished friend&#8217;s honor. </p>\n<p>Full recordings of the first three seasons of <em>The Universe in Verse</em> &#8212; a celebration of the meeting ground between science and the human spirit through the lens of poetry &#8212; are freely available to be enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/the-universe-in-verse/\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.

I grew attuned to the echoes of his sensibility bellowing down the corridor of time, reverberating strongly in the work of <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/brainpickings/universe-in-verse-governors-island\" target=\"_blank\">established artists</a> in my own community. </p>\n<p>Long before he moved to Brooklyn in pursuit of his own calling, poet Matthew Burgess had a parallel experience of Haring&#8217;s world-expanding art, which he first encountered on the cover of a Christmas record at fourteen, living behind the Golden Curtain of suburban Southern California as a budding artist and young gay man trying to find himself. &#8220;For those of us who grew up before the internet became ubiquitous, a bright fragment from the outer world can feel like an important discovery &#8212; and a call,&#8221; Burgess writes in the author&#8217;s note to what became his serenade to the artist who opened minds and world of possibility for so many.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg?resize=680%2C447&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71042\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg?resize=240%2C158&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg?resize=320%2C210&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg?resize=768%2C505&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg?resize=600%2C395&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring22.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71071\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring22.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring22.jpg?resize=240%2C160&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring22.jpg?resize=320%2C213&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring22.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring22.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>A decade into teaching poetry in public schools, Burgess encountered Haring&#8217;s work afresh in a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum. After mesmeric hours in the galleries, he wandered into the museum bookshop and went home with a copy of Haring&#8217;s published journals, which he devoured immediately. On its pages, he realized that the special native sympathy between children and Haring&#8217;s art is not an accident of his line and color but at the very center of his spirit. In an entry from July 7, 1986, Haring writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Children know something that most people have forgotten. Children possess a fascination with their everyday existence that is very special and would be very helpful to adults if they could learn to understand and respect it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Having previously composed <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/30/enormous-smallness-e-e-cummings-matthew-burgess/\"><em>Enormous Smallness</em></a> &#8212; the wondrous picture-book biography of E.E. Cummings, another artist who so passionately believed that &#8220;it takes courage to grow up and become who you really are&#8221; &#8212; Burgess was impelled to invite young people into Keith Haring&#8217;s singular art and the large heart from which it sprang.

It tipped a Rube Goldberg machine of opportunities and invitations, making the world his canvas &#8212; from the wall of an Italian monastery to the Berlin Wall to the wall. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring18.jpg?resize=680%2C899&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"899\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71055\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring18.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring18.jpg?resize=240%2C317&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring18.jpg?resize=320%2C423&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring18.jpg?resize=768%2C1016&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring18.jpg?resize=600%2C794&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Burgess writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But no matter how busy he became or where in the world he went, he always made time for children.</p>\n<p>Keith understood kids and they understood him.<br />\nThere was an unspoken bond between them.</p>\n<p>And since children often asked him to draw on their t-shirts, skateboards, and jeans, he always kept a black marker handy.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring15.jpg?resize=680%2C662&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"662\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71053\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring15.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring15.jpg?resize=240%2C234&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring15.jpg?resize=320%2C311&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring15.jpg?resize=768%2C748&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring15.jpg?resize=600%2C584&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring34.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71056\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring34.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring34.jpg?resize=240%2C160&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring34.jpg?resize=320%2C213&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring34.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring34.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the remaining seven years of his life, as the art world grew to lavish Haring with recognition and plaudit, his drawings would come to cover the walls of orphanages and hospitals and daycare centers. When he spent five days painting the wall of a Chicago high school together with its 500 students, one walked up to him and said, with that special way children alone have of seeing into the heart of things and naming what is there without self-consciousness or pretense:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I can tell, by the way you paint, that you really love life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not long after that, Haring&#8217;s vivacity was stamped with the four letters that would spell certain death for so many young people of his generation. But even his AIDS diagnosis didn&#8217;t stifle his exuberant love of life &#8212; it only amplified it. Burgess quotes Haring&#8217;s diary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I appreciate everything that has happened, especially the <em>gift of life</em> I was given that has created a silent bond between me and children. Children can sense this &#8220;thing&#8221; in me.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring17.jpg?resize=680%2C895&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"895\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71076\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring17.jpg?resize=240%2C316&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring17.jpg?resize=320%2C421&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring17.jpg?resize=768%2C1011&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring17.jpg?resize=600%2C790&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71040\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Walls-Life-Keith-Haring/dp/1592702678/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KeithHaring_painting.jpg?resize=680%2C522&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"522\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71040\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KeithHaring_painting.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KeithHaring_painting.jpg?resize=240%2C184&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KeithHaring_painting.jpg?resize=320%2C246&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KeithHaring_painting.jpg?resize=768%2C589&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KeithHaring_painting.jpg?resize=600%2C461&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keith Haring painting a wall at the Palaexpo Museum in Rome, 1984.
