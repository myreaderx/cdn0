It would also include a built-in camera for using video conferencing apps on the TV itself, the report says.</p>\n<p>That second device would be much more like existing smart assistant display devices on the market today, with an iPad-like screen providing integrated visuals.

Dennis Maloney, Domino’s senior vice president and chief innovation officer said in a statement. &#8220;This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>On certain days and times, customers ordering from the Woodland Heights store on the Domino&#8217;s website can request R2, which uses radar, 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging to direct its movement. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">They&#8217;ll get texts to let them know where the robot is and what PIN they&#8217;ll need to access their pizza via the bot&#8217;s touchscreen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Over the course of the pandemic, the contactless, autonomous food delivery industry has accelerated quickly, and Nuro is currently poised to become a leader in this space.</span></p>\n<p>“Nuro’s mission is to better everyday life through robotics,&#8221; Dave Ferguson, Nuro co-founder and president, said in a statement. “We’re excited to introduce our autonomous delivery bots to a select set of Domino’s customers in Houston. We can’t wait to see what they think.”</p>\n<p>This is the first time meals will be delivered by an electric, self-driving, occupant-less vehicle on the roads in Houston. Woodland Heights, which is mainly residential, is one of the oldest historic neighborhoods in Houston, flanked by the I-45 and I-10 highways. The Domino&#8217;s there is right on Houston Avenue, a main thoroughfare, making this a substantially challenging space in which to pilot this technology.</p>\n<p>Nuro originally <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/17/dominos-will-start-delivering-pizzas-via-an-autonomous-robot-this-fall/\">announced the Domino&#8217;s partnership and began testing in Houston in 2019</a>. That same year, the company began deploying its vehicles to transport Kroger groceries in Houston and Phoenix. At the end of 2020, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/\">approved to begin testing on public roads in California</a>, delivering goods from partners like Walmart and CVS. Nuro is the first company to be granted regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation for a self-driving vehicle exemption.</p>\n<p>Domino&#8217;s appears to be Nuro&#8217;s first large foray into restaurant delivery, but it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. The company just announced its $500 million Series C round, funded in part by Chipotle.

Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance,&#8221; Nadella said <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/\">in a post announcing the deal</a>.</p>\n<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says says that may be so, but he believes that Microsoft missed the boat with Cortana and this is about helping the company catch up on a crucial technology. &#8220;Nuance will be not only give Microsoft technology help in regards to neural network based speech recognition, but also a massive improvement from vertical capabilities, call center functionality and the MSFT IP position in speech,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Microsoft sees this deal doubling what was already a considerable total addressable market to nearly $500 billion. While TAMs always tend to run high, that is still a substantial number.</p>\n<p>It also fits with Gartner data, which found that by 2022, 75% of healthcare organizations will have a formal cloud strategy in place. The AI component only adds to that number and Nuance brings 10,000 existing customers to Microsoft including some of the biggest healthcare organizations in the world.</p>\n<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says the deal could provide Microsoft with a ton of health data to help feed the underlying machine learning models and make them more accurate over time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is going be a ton of health data being captured by the interactions coming through telemedicine interactions, and this could create a whole new level of health intelligence,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>\n<p>That of course could drive a lot of privacy concerns where health data is involved, and it will be up to Microsoft, which just experienced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/\">a major breach on its Exchange</a> email server products last month, to assure the public that their sensitive health data is being protected.</p>\n<p>Leary says that ensuring data privacy is going to be absolutely key to the success of the deal. &#8220;The potential this move has is pretty powerful, but it will only be realized if the data and insights that could come from it are protected and secure &#8212; not only protected from hackers but also from unethical use. Either could derail what could be a game changing move,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also seemed to recognize that when it wrote, &#8220;Nuance and Microsoft will deepen their existing commitments to the extended partner ecosystem, as well as the highest standards of data privacy, security and compliance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We are clearly on the edge of a sea change when it comes to how we interact with our medical providers in the future.

This means Qiskit users can now bring their programs to IonQ&#8217;s platform without any major modifications to their code.</p>\n<p>At first glance, that seems relatively unremarkable, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Qiskit was founded by IBM Research and is IBM&#8217;s default tool for working with its quantum computers. There is a healthy bit of competition between IBM and IonQ (and, to be fair, many others in this space), in part because both are betting on very different technologies at the core of their platforms. While IonQ is betting on trapped ions, which allows its machines able to run at room temperature, IBM&#8217;s technique requires its machine to be supercooled.</p>\n<p>IonQ has now released a new provider library for Qiskit that is available as part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners\">Qiskit Partner</a> repository on GitHub and via the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-ionq/\">Python Package Index</a>.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;IonQ is excited to make our quantum computers and APIs easily accessible to the Qiskit community,&#8221; said IonQ CEO &#38; President Peter Chapman. &#8220;Open source has already revolutionized traditional software development. With this integration, we’re bringing the world one step closer to the first generation of widely-applicable quantum applications.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the one hand, it&#8217;s hard not to look at this as IonQ needling IBM a bit, but it&#8217;s also an acknowledgment that Qiskit has become somewhat of a standard for developers who want to work with quantum computers. But putting these rivalries aside, we&#8217;re also in the early days of quantum computing and with no clear leader yet, anything that makes these various platforms more interoperable is a win for developers who want to dip their feet into writing for them.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Ph02kSVd1K\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ionq-plans-to-launch-a-rack-mounted-quantum-computer-for-data-centers-in-2023/\">IonQ plans to launch a rack-mounted quantum computer for data centers in 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;IonQ plans to launch a rack-mounted quantum computer for data centers in 2023&#8221;

Today, more than 54 million vehicles have Mobileye technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a great combination of the two partners together and we expect some great scale,&#8221; Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the Vice President of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye, said in a recent interview. &#8220;And this does kind of mark, officially, the first proof point of Mobileye&#8217;s technology getting into goods delivery in addition to all the other spaces that we&#8217;ve already announced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017, has widened its scope in recent years, moving beyond its advanced driver assistance technology and toward the development of a self-driving vehicle system. More than two years ago, Mobileye announced plans to launch a kit that includes visual perception, sensor fusion, its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/intels-mobileye-will-have-2-million-cars-on-roads-building-hd-maps-in-2018/\">REM mapping system</a> and software algorithms. And in 2018, the company made an unlikely turn and announced plans to become a robotaxi operator, not just a supplier. Mobileye also plans to deploy autonomous shuttles with Transdev ATS and Lohr Group beginning in Europe. Mobileye also plans to begin operating an autonomous ride-hailing service in Israel in early 2022.</p>\n<p>This latest deal shows Mobileye&#8217;s ambition to see its self-driving systems used in other applications beyond robotaxis.</p>\n<p>The self-driving system, now branded as Mobilieye Drive, is made up of a system-on-chip based compute, redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology, its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into more than 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.</p>\n<p>Udelv will work with Mobileye to integrate the self-driving technology with its own delivery management system. Mobileye will also provide over-the-air software support throughout the lifetime of the vehicles.</p>\n<p>These purpose-built vehicles won&#8217;t have the typical mechanical features one might find in a human driven truck or delivery van. It will be designed to be capable of so-called Level 4 self-driving, a designation by SAE that means the vehicle can handle all operations without a human under certain conditions. It will also come with four-directional four-way steering, LED screens to great the people picking up the delivery and special compartments for goods.</p>\n<p>There will be a teleoperations system that will allow for the maneuvering of the vehicles in parking lots, loading zones, apartment complexes and private roads, according to Udelv.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nDbnxM7WUQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/\">Mobileye taps Luminar to supply lidar for its robotaxi fleet</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Mobileye taps Luminar to supply lidar for its robotaxi fleet&#8221;

Real profits are still somewhere out in the uncharted future.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s parse Uber&#8217;s latest, vet its profit promise, consider its rivals and their performance, and then ask ourselves if the great ride-hailing and food-delivery booms will ever make back the money they cost to scale.</p>\n<h2>Uber&#8217;s planned profits</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Lyft told investors to expect positive adjusted EBITDA by the final quarter of 2021; at the time, Uber said it would generate full-year positive adjusted EBITDA. Those are slightly different (if related) promises.

The story that landed <a href=\"https://astrohaus.com/\">Astrohaus</a> in Detroit on two separate occasions is a bit tangled, certainly. The hardware startup’s cofounder and CEO isn’t the sort of hometown cheerleader you often encounter when speaking with executives who’ve opted to keep their organizations outside cities like San Francisco or New York.</p>\n<p>Hailing from Detroit’s outer suburbs, Leeb cofounded the company in the Motor City in Fall 2014 with Patrick Paul. Astrohaus’s first – and best known – product was born as an attempt to offer users a “distraction-free writing experience.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not even a writer,” Leeb says of the product’s inception. “What interests me about the product – what got me going – is yes, it’s about writing, but common among all of the things I’m interested in, is it’s more about process and productivity. That’s something I’m super passionate about. And making things easier that get out of your way and are really fun to use.”</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Leeb, an MIT mechanical engineering graduate and Paul a Michigan State graduate and software developer met through the Detroit startup community and got to work prototyping a word processing device that delivered the benefits of modern tech, without the sort of inherent distractions of computers and tablets that today’s writers know all too well.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"z85CqJAEkd\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dive-into-detroits-growing-startup-scene-with-techcrunchs-detroit-city-spotlight/\">Dive into Detroit&#8217;s growing startup scene with TechCrunch&#8217;s Detroit City Spotlight and meetup</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Dive into Detroit&#8217;s growing startup scene with TechCrunch&#8217;s Detroit City Spotlight and meetup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dive-into-detroits-growing-startup-scene-with-techcrunchs-detroit-city-spotlight/embed/#?secret=z85CqJAEkd\" data-secret=\"z85CqJAEkd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The young company introduced itself to the world by way of Kickstarter, launching a campaign in 2014.</p>\n<p>“The Hemingwrite combines the best features of all previous writing tools with the addition of modern technology,” the company wrote. “It is dedicated like a typewriter, has a better keyboard and battery life than your computer and is distraction free like a word processor. Finally, we sync your documents to the cloud in real-time so you never have to worry about saving, syncing or backing up your work.”</p>\n<p>The product was greeted with excitement and some gentle-ribbing (and some not-so-gentle, including one review that called it <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2016/02/24/freewrite-word-processor/\">&#8220;pretentious hipster nonsense&#8221;</a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">) over a $500 reinvention of the typewriter. The crowdfunding community went wild, with nearly $350,000 raised. In June of 2015, the product was renamed.</span></p>\n<p>“We are updating our brand with a more demonstrative name that also no longer ties us to the persona of a certain famous writer,” the company wrote in a June 2015 Kickstarter updated. Two months later, Astrohaus relocated to New York City.</p>\n<p>“I was really itching to leave. I didn’t know how we were going to make it in Detroit,” Leeb says. “There’s not really a hardware scene and my connections were mostly in New York. I pushed Patrick – we had raised some money and gotten going, so I was like, ‘let’s move to New York.’ There’s definitely more of a hardware scene and we were definitely a part of it.”</p>\n<p>Once again, life intervened. Paul left the company and Leeb married Kacee Must, a Detroit resident – and owner of local yoga chain, Citizen Yoga. In 2018, he found himself building Astrohaus up again in the city where it started life. Three years later, the team is still a fairly lean one, with five full time employees in Detroit and a more distributed team of contractors.</p>\n<p>Leeb’s feelings about launching a hardware startup in Detroit are clearly mixed. He bemoans the difficultly in recruiting and finding funding locally, while acknowledging a sense of local cheerleading one really finds in larger cities. “With these smaller ecosystems, you really get to know people everywhere,” he says. “Everyone is so accessible. As far as anywhere I’ve ever been, Detroit companies really cheer for each other. There’s so much Detroit pride.”</p>\n<p>For all of the talk of returning manufacturing to Detroit, Leeb says he’s had little luck in his pursuit to get the Freewrite and subsequent products created in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole other world of advanced manufacturing startups that definitely get a lot of benefits from being in a manufacturing hub,” he says. “I think for software companies and for us it’s not so beneficial. We make our goods in China, and I don’t see that changing any time soon. I have good relationships with our factories and I spend a lot of time in China. That’s what they’re geared toward. They make consumer electronics.”</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2066028\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2066028\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2066028\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg\" alt=\"Astrohaus' Freewrite Traveler on a table\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2066028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>\n<p>Leeb says he’s found the Andrew Yang-founded Venture for America nonprofit a useful source of hiring locally. In the years following Astrohaus’ launch, impressions of the city have changed radically from a depressed byproduct of rust belt boom and bust to a viable place to launch a business.</p>\n<p>“The last 10 years, there’s a massive difference in the city,” Leeb says. “[Quicken Loans cofounder] Dan Gilbert almost single-handedly brought the city back. There are a lot of people who hate him, but the reality is that, while he wasn’t the only billionaire in town, he’s the only one who heavily invested in Detroit. He consolidated all of his suburban offices and put them in downtown and he convinced all of these companies to do the same.”</p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic will no doubt continue to have repercussions, as remote work becomes the norm for many or most tech outlets. Though hardware startups will always have a compelling reason to keep things in close quarters, as companies develop and test products. For his part, Leeb says Astrohaus’ next device aims to address concerns about remote collaboration.</p>\n<p>“I’m very aggressively starting to work on a new hardware product that is a collaboration and communication tool,” he says. “It was a problem before, and now it’s such a widespread problem that I feel we’re lacking in certain communication. There’s a lot to be done there. I don’t feel as connected as we could be, even with the technology we have.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/detroit\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2135814\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=150,21 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=300,41 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=768,106 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=680,94 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=1536,211 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=2048,282 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/R_4ilIl1bo0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 13:31:36 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg","linkMd5":"22b7cf371c7265b3776719ab8f465d50","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-43-27-350_8264ade3c948a59b.webp","destWidth":2400,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":482784,"destBytes":84640,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-43-27-350_8264ade3c948a59b.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/detroit-footer-banner.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn4@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-00-421_909cfb0cde10b1c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-27-169_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-00-971_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-01-881_dac1c8ad405e7732.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=R_4ilIl1bo0:qpZ-I_Wacl4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn83@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-06-324_704934076e2a7096.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-01-772_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/R_4ilIl1bo0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-01-667_38466051e2a101b3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245806418},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:26","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:26","title":"UiPath’s first IPO pricing could be a warning to late-stage investors","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2137052","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A few months back, robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn UiPath <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/\">raised a huge $750 million round</a> at a valuation of around $35 billion.

Using a simple share count of 516,545,035, the company would be worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion at the lower and upper extremes of its expected price interval. Neither of those numbers is close to what it was worth, in theory, just a few months ago.</p>\n<p>According to IPO watching group Renaissance Capital, UiPath <a href=\"https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/80660/Software-maker-UiPath-sets-terms-for-$990-million-IPO\">is worth</a> up to $26.0 billion on a fully diluted basis.

Confusion. Fear. A run for the car. Roads open and then suddenly closed by authorities. Traffic jams. A fire break that stalls the flames and then suddenly the flames jump, changing direction. Everyone has a plan for what to do — a plan that gets ripped up the second someone leaves their home to evacuate.</p>\n<p>In the heat of the moment, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and where to go. Unfortunately, that information is rarely available in the format they need.</p>\n<p>Bailey Farren’s family has experienced this four times living in California north of San Francisco. The wildfires are more common than ever with the aridness of climate change, yet the evacuations remain a pandemonium. While a student at Berkeley, she started investigating what was happening, and why her family constantly lacked the information they needed to get out safely and swiftly. “I thought that first responders had everything they need,” she said.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>They don’t. Firefighters on the frontlines often lack the technology needed to relay accurate information to operations centers, which can then guide citizens on how to evacuate. With the pressing need to keep citizens up-to-date, most authorities rely on simple text messages to just tell everyone in, say, an entire county to evacuate, with nary more detail.</p>\n<p>The Camp Fire in California in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/25/camp-fire-deadliest-wildfire-californias-history-has-been-contained/\">the worst fire in California’s history</a>, triggered her to go beyond interviewing public safety officers to building a solution. She graduated in spring 2019, and at the same time, founded Perimeter with fellow Berkeley grad Noah Wu.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://perimeterplatform.com\">Perimeter</a> is an emergency response platform designed to “bridge the gap between agencies and citizens” in Farren’s words by offering better two-way communication centered on geospatial data.</p>\n<p>The company announced today that it has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by Parade Ventures with Dustin Dolginow, social-impact organization One World, and Alchemist Accelerator participating. Alchemist was the first money into the startup.</p>\n<p>Using Perimeter, citizens can upload geospatial-tagged information such as a new fire outbreak or a tree that has fallen and is now blocking a road. “Sometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up — we want citizens to share that with … government officials,” Farren said. That information is not immediately disseminated to the public though. Instead, first responders can vet the information, ensuring that citizens are always using accurate information in planning their actions. “We do not want it to be a social-media platform,” she explained.</p>\n<p>In the other direction, operations centers can use Perimeter to send citizens accurate and detailed evacuation maps with routes on where to go. Unlike with just a text message, Perimeter will send both the message and a URL, which can then display maps and real-time information on how a disaster is progressing.</p>\n<p>Right now, the platform is distributed as a web app, so that citizens don’t need to have it pre-installed when a disaster strikes.

We realized it was incredibly difficult to maintain this sustainability ethos,&#8221; Baker said. </span></p>\n<p>While the browser extension sets EcoCart apart from other offsetting services like Cloverly, the company does share some functionality in its business-facing offering where<a href=\"https://ecocart.io/business/\"> an option to offset the carbon associated with a purchase</a> is integrated directly into the checkout flow.</p>\n<p>EcoCart launched its business-to-business integration in June of last year and now counts 500 vendors as customers. So far, about a quarter of customers have chosen to offset their purchases at checkout amounting to the capture of an estimated 25 million pounds of CO2, the company said.</p>\n<p>Investors backing the company include Base 10 Partners; PopSugar co-founder, Brian Sugar&#8217;s early stage venture fund and angel investors like Ben Jabbaway, the founder of Privy; Rich Gardner, the VP of global partnerships at Klaviyo; Kyle Hency, the co-founder of Chubbie; Bryan Meehan, the chair of Blue Bottle Coffee; and Carly Strife, the co-founder of BarkBox.</p>\n<p>While online shopping gets a bad reputation, it&#8217;s actually sometimes a greener option than shopping in physical stores, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00562-y\">according to one study published in Nature last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Consumer offsets, while well-meaning, don&#8217;t have nearly the same impact as having the companies themselves actually rein in their greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonize their operations. In fact, the whole notion of the consumer carbon footprint and the personal responsibility of consumers for planetary pollution was <a href=\"https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/\">dreamed up by advertising executives at the behest of oil and gas and consumer goods companies pushing products</a>.</p>\n<p>But something is better than nothing, and offsets do help necessary projects get funding.</p>\n<p>EcoCart said it spent months developing a proprietary algorithm to calculate the carbon footprint of online orders. For both the e-commerce plugin and browser extension, EcoCart uses the characteristics of each order including material inputs to the item, shipping distance, and package weight to estimate the emissions created from that order, the company said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe EcoCart is reinventing how brands interact with their customers while also managing and addressing their environmental impact at scale,” said Chris Zeoli, Principal at Base10 Partners, in a statement. “EcoCart represents a solution that is helping reverse decades of harmful climate change. Base10 is proud to be partnering with the EcoCart founders as they continue to make carbon neutral shopping the new checkout standard for industries including retail, micromobility, food delivery, and more.”</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=88GScE4XLh8:xgqjNKaVM9A:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img
