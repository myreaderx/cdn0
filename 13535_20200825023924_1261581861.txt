One of the cornerstones of humor.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody knows this better than Professor Sophie Scott, Director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott and I were recently talking about her work on laughter and humor, when she muted her microphone to not cough in my ear. Seems like everyone needs to justify sneezing or coughing these days. “It’s hay fever, it’s not… well read the room hay fever, we’ve got enough going on.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not a week later, I read an <a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/blog/read-the-room/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article</a> by SparkToro co-founder and CEO Rand Fishkin that starts “When folks ask me about how best to do marketing right now [during the COVID-19 pandemic], my answer is consistently turning into the same three words: Read the room.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day I watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bOriPEk7S8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Karyn Buxman’s TEDx Talk</a> where she suggests it’s “more important to ‘see’ funny than it is to ‘be’ funny.” And to do that you have to intentionally raise your awareness and start looking for humor, you’ll see funny things everywhere. And by being able to spot the funny (instead of constantly trying to be the funny) you’re opening your mind to opportunities and other viewpoints.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So ya, timing. (And serendipity.)&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it happens, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about all the memes (and humor) I’ve seen relating to COVID-19.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pets at home not sure what to make of quarantine:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QpuE8YBWO64-W8QHBT441yIsRMfeYhVd-woNiwLjQV0g_WbU44YLCX-EPTSkathmRimyUFW6pSx5F1pU6mbLsEkC5TdoRANAsPt3yM3C88lMFpTnLOF_SAVQpOzqm1-aXLlfX3YL\" alt=\"covid memes - dog in quarantine time\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So many movies about apocalypse (including zombie apocalypse) that we had very different expectations… no one thought robes and slippers would be involved:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/npyzNAiCY7mROcz0ab9mzpGAwn9gM1umMM-r-rXCprovDDUk9FBI4eOGdWJynWPcqWlf9K7MqQOdAsu6kmRny-SWySBV7QdGe5k7xzdRl8k6_9IFmGhi5oMYIOel8sQg_7WoDrBO\" alt=\"apocaalypse and covid memes\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents who don’t normally home school are frustrated (and they probably don’t remember how hard it is to math):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/s4AVBilL3d0FYqpkzoi-7uSGy0oQ3UGXVdMRzXomb1XmsDTIYtbRdHRYp9aOfNNyvvmB9aqOx7UVOHUidqDtRSAyqpKkgZIYJX4hnn6W8pmwadJhSVnWyswpmRKubRPiHECzGht5\" alt=\"teaching during covid\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Toilet paper hoarding was the first thing that went out of control… it became a form a currency since not everyone could get any:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-c-UJuF-uQH_z7_jaYdL1PMWG9muFYz3mZNm1xBPGI__Znx3S-xDm6Ddaha4aEVpk2vjaeoPeCJN6O5ZPwZKr0pQwoLInFcTFas9lrbyXi8nZm3ejEWiEQfxez2aX3P6sdUnZL6J\" alt=\"toilet paper meme (coronavirus)\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone not used to working from home (and the luxuries it entails) are realizing you gotta be prepared for that impromptu Zoom call with the boss:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4om3NpJdUwzXmObHakLpbzcIuKBCxUbtp7Buk4lgIEY3gsfili_uLG3PrNtiAOEcHBHdnth-ZuCu5xioMH5eBS2SB4rdvInpcRHQ2cqtFrMUQyvx89ZKGT08ycl2PfcysMAJQv31\" alt=\"mccauley culkin covid meme\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer this pandemic lasts, the more memes people seem to create.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked myself why.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are we resorting to memes during a time of crisis (and as people are dying)? And why are they so damn funny?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand COVID memes at a rudimentary level, we have to explore four factors:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Memes (and their place in our society).</li><li>Humor and laughter (and their anthropological, physiological and societal roles).</li><li>Sharing memes (and how that affects happiness).</li><li>Gallows humor (and its role managing stress, fear and even death).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s in a meme? And a covid meme, particularly?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the most basic level, a meme is a representation of a phenomenon or concept that is repeatedly imitated and mutated <em>ad infinitum</em>. Memes are most often spread via social media and there are several different types of memes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With everyone under quarantine, it got boring quickly. We started paying way more attention to our neighbors:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DbJV6x0HEjc1xNeX-VbpcXYP9wlIPHMweM_Zko-rgmT8C1hCTU6AGjroCHvK9H-fVwKOAUIubscg5U23uuZ1ekU1PNsmEC2yTOoFAyZszO0qSPbXqCc99KK4NbC_DA1QZ-ADJrvi\" alt=\"&#34;covid-19 got us all like&#34; meme of cat\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Observations in the wild: pay attention to how people are acting and reacting.

But even Pooh bear doesn’t want to catch COVID.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KdY3t80xq2qCZbA4nIr4Hg4ZpDnHD3Rh3sE_ade2k57uwlF_TovkwmPWWwVLi1sd4ad9vX0C0eeFPDMCrGGk2yV9CgivCLj_eNDNndSrPo6xmNrLF7poAno3K3c8KB6yCT1BVx2L\" alt=\"winnie the pooh and piglet coronavirus meme social distancing\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another, perhaps more precise definition of a meme was coined by Limor Shifman, senior lecturer in the Department of Communication and Journalism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in her book <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/memes-digital-culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Memes in Digital Culture</a>. Shifman suggests a meme is a: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“group of digital items sharing common characteristics of content, form, and/or stance that were created with awareness of each other; and were circulated, imitated, and/or transformed via the Internet by many users.” </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the book dates back to 2013, this definition still holds.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet of the 21st century is driven by a “participatory culture,” one in which audiences are no longer being fed pop culture, but arguably creating it themselves. And memes are one way we’re doing that. In other words, memes are a form of communication; they’re how we convey our ideas or observations and how we voice our opinions and viewpoints to others in a fun way.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas in past years, copying (or plagiarism of sorts) was frowned upon, Shifman posits that Web 2.0 culture is propelled by copying and imitating, which is (in the case of memes) the best form of flattery. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“In this environment, user-driven imitation and remixing are not just prevalent practices: they have become highly valued pillars.”&#160;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence memes like these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one appeals to the Gen Xers in the house. Mary Poppins is the epitome of what we all aspire to be at home, while Miss Hannigan is the more frightening (yet realistic) rendition:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OAGFQwR_hSyyxn9inSNsuMS8NbZD6PjScPP8UhKTh8z8rlio79EP1BNSoYE7w9gDHd9lj6Rqu1khSozXHTy1kGUz3yk4nOwuoTuSaLElBfalQQW7v71HfvaVkhRldxmSZR47jiSr\" alt=\"reality of home schooling during coronavirus meme - mary poppins vs carol burnett\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone’s always so excited when you start something new:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/syW-v8OfKyvEyW9EmmjbUsg_emBl2dBHr-M-8YrPX_vYCyv_FTLnsl5Z-tlegZMLSmvAtnd_0FvSPdYQgxVqSqFwa0VlcVPbzWlLZhzWT9uDi9edznSv7SqD2mSm3LSy4ypnSdt4\" alt=\"day 1 vs day 4 of covid meme\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthew McConaughey can really play any part, can’t he?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ft-X_9f92SaYV1Q98Vd85SENjQR-ZCf-5aGZs5-joutioB7Rv0qqUG5wT8fKMvEBrzCfgR6PlC0R2GM-XCcUi-C9FzJCoSG2o7bNyIej-OR6D8bO4lKJe8hfuShjlxDltBVh8BB3\" alt=\"matthew mcconnaughey meme\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As memes have become more prevalent across our culture, this is how we choose to communicate not only amongst our peers but with the world through social media (and beyond).&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So although it might seem on the surface as though the use of memes minimizes the importance of certain events, “A deeper look reveals that they play an integral part in some of the defining events of the 21st century,” explains Shifman.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What part, exactly? Simply put, memes can serve several purposes – shaming actions (our own and others’), relating, camaraderie, empathy, pointing out the obvious, etc. – and no matter their purpose, they all serve to bring about laughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thrillist staff writer <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/first-meme-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wil Fulton</a> created an acronym (MEME) to define the characteristics of memes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Message: </strong>There needs to be a clearly definable, central message or reference that&#8217;s understood, and relatable by commonly shared knowledge or experience.&#160;</li><li><strong>Evolution:</strong> The meme cannot remain static. It must be adopted and remixed by a community of people that embrace it.</li><li><strong>Malleability:</strong> It must aid in its own evolution by having defined characteristics that can be changed while maintaining and preserving some semblance of the original message.</li><li><strong>Effect: </strong>It has to reach a certain level of popularity and understanding, or the message won&#8217;t matter. Perhaps the most important part of the meme is its virality.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One part that I think is missing from both Shifman and Fulton’s definitions or criteria is the fact that a meme isn’t a meme if it isn’t shared. Though they both allude to it – Shifman’s “circulated” and Fulton’s “popularity” – <strong>shareability is one of the cornerstones of memehood</strong>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole tree-falling-in-the-forest adage rings true right about here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a meme isn’t shared, is it even a meme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important characteristic because it will serve us later in answering the question of why memes seem to have become an acceptable way to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic crisis of 2020. (More on that later.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cornerstone is the “it’s funny because it’s true” nature of memes. The reason memes are funny is because they’re based on actual facts. In comedy, the best jokes come from observational humor. In the online world, memes serve the same purpose.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Covid memes and the science of humor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>“You cannot hope to understand the most serious things in life unless you understand the most humorous.” &#8211; Winston Churchill, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;And there are few things in life more serious than facing a global pandemic.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/1918314/Humor_in_the_OR_A_Stitch_in_Time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buxman</a>, a registered nurse and neuro-humorist, and the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mayo Clinic</a> agree that humor offers certain emotional and mental benefits, such as establishing relationships, relieving anxiety, releasing anger in a socially acceptable way, decreasing depression and loneliness and increasing self-esteem, as well as physical benefits like increasing pain tolerance, improving respiration and breathing and exercising facial, abdominal and chest muscles, leading to reduced muscle tension.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, the anxiety, fear and inherent loneliness from being isolated for weeks at a time can be jarring, to say the least. Humor, in that sense, is helping to unite us in a socially acceptable way.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been shown that as a positive emotion, humor can undo the physical effects of negative emotions like anger or sadness, which corroborates the idea that one of the evolutionary purposes of positive emotions (notably humor) is to ease or reduce tension.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since the start of COVID-19, we’ve seen a lot of this through shared memes like this&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the posts in the earlier half of quarantine, you were either preparing to join Top Chef or Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4q6yh3qb694eUT0BJ_8qPu5Ttx-yomg6YoIbeUXxdZpwhDF_iwUDp7bF7IKMXTRGLXcONOBT4OIZFCbKRqemOeJbrj_iHixP_HdIWiI2vD0XocPDF3X_6PN8uSJ8t70IrZwLEL8H\" alt=\"tweet gets so popular, it becomes meme in covid times\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matchu_chutrain/status/1240473805698392064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Source</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://bpl.berkeley.edu/docs/206-Physio%20Down-Regulation%20and%20PosEmo%20in%20Couples.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">longitudinal study</a> conducted by Robert W. Levenson <em>et al</em> and published by the American Psychological Association, 157 middle-aged and older couples were studied beginning in 1989. The study reports,&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“One of the powerful themes that emerged from this work was the association between successful emotion regulation during conflictive interaction and marital satisfaction and stability.”</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That is, those who were readily able to regulate their emotions (through humor) were found not only to have a more satisfactory and stable marriage, but also stayed married longer (over 50 years) than those who didn’t or couldn’t regulate their own emotions. “These couples introduced positive emotions, such as affection and humor, to ‘soothe’ and ‘calm’ the interaction, thus reducing the level of negativity to a point where they could continue to work on the issues at hand.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can equate this to those of us who seem to laugh during particularly gruesome scenes in horror movies, or share funny stories during a funeral or wake, or when we laugh at someone who just fell (but didn’t seriously hurt themselves). The Levenson study suggests that these behaviors are meant to reduce our negative emotional states, specifically fear, anger and sadness.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As luck (or serendipity, ahem) would have it, March brought with it one of the few Friday the 13th and it was an opportunity for pop culture and memes to make magic:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kgUOqXVAxN7zTmfCMGPpdVxOo6GVUK_g9kIZ1XfeEgT1Nkyn1zPg3pCJpd_kxcEfBvoAcyAOirzyxgWGsTXSNYBrDKavZVPLqTth73_vJLYGuQKKqZPkDRJU_aIRggXRri_db8xu\" alt=\"fear based covid meme\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Who wouldn’t be afraid of someone in a Michael Myers costume at the grocery store?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90645211_10163300435015083_7005873575752105984_n.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"covid meme - michael myers in grocery store\" class=\"wp-image-26557\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90645211_10163300435015083_7005873575752105984_n.jpg?w=442&#38;ssl=1 442w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90645211_10163300435015083_7005873575752105984_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90645211_10163300435015083_7005873575752105984_n.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A joke Stephen King fans would understand:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91033121_10163340953425083_3284857757542383616_n.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"pennywise balloon TP covid meme\" class=\"wp-image-26558\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91033121_10163340953425083_3284857757542383616_n.jpg?w=442&#38;ssl=1 442w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91033121_10163340953425083_3284857757542383616_n.jpg?resize=226%2C300&#38;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91033121_10163340953425083_3284857757542383616_n.jpg?resize=113%2C150&#38;ssl=1 113w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Samuel L.

He explains, </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Social laughter is 30x more frequent than solitary laughter. And the discovery here was it was the relationship between individuals that was causing the laughter not jokes.”&#160;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And Scott confirms that, indeed, <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/sophie_scott_why_we_laugh?language=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">laughter is an extremely behaviorally-contagious effect</a> that you’re more likely to ‘catch’ from someone you know than from someone you don’t. Which explains why we always seem to laugh more (out loud) when we’re surrounded by others than when we’re alone. It’s like when you are at a live comedy show in a room full of people vs when you’re watching a comedy special on your couch. I know I’m way more boisterous in groups than alone.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Good news: </strong>there’s an actual physiological reason for this phenomenon. It involves mirror neurons.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of social neuroscience in the Psychotherapy Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, <a href=\"https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/HMS_OTB_Spring10_Vol16_No2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Carl Marci</a>, MD, suggests that based on studies done to measure the effects of laughter during psychotherapy, “Mirror neurons, which are linked to empathic behavior, are often involved in laughter. Mirror neurons are a subset of neurons that fire both when we perform an action and when we observe that same action performed by others.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8vFqg0LPsHS9hm2hDLkryh5BqF444I8kxsJ4PYiG0aRdQh_svkBbjtDeV6BNdyD7_G4xSbRqMrpx5ulmdg4Q0JXUAGnDuCn06jdp0DKUX1mJdxaaZJVD5HX3UOhS1jVTBGGUl29W\" alt=\"breaking bad meme relives in covid\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And during his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2qM1I-JCEQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TEDxMünchen talk</a>, award-winning filmmaker, novelist, and playwright, Anthony McCarten explains, </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The forces of seriousness would limit us to narrow thinking, rigid ideology, cruelty and tunnel vision. Whereas humor obliges us to have an open mind, it obliges empathy and forgiveness.”&#160;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarten’s quote hits me particularly close to home. Growing up, everything was turned into a joke in my family. And for better or for worse, it’s meant that as an adult, I also try to turn everything into a joke, or at least see the humor in everything. It gives me a different perspective than I find others might have because I don’t take myself (or others) too seriously.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever enjoyed a deep belly laugh, then you don’t need “experts” to explain that laughter is contagious, especially when you’re with people you know and trust.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why? Why do we suddenly burst out into laughter just because we’re in the company of others? Why are we exponentially more likely to laugh when we’re with friends or family?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott provides the answer: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Wherever you find [laughter], it’s associated with interactions… you’re laughing to show people you understand them, that you agree with them, that you’re part of the same group as them.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarten goes a step further to suggest that we’ll laugh at almost anything to maintain our standing within a “community” because jokes (humor and laughing) connect us. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/05/leading-with-humor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alison Beard</a>, senior editor at Harvard Business Review, says,&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>“Good comedy is a conspiracy. Create an in-group.”</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, philosopher Ted Cohen surmises that laughing at someone’s joke means you have the same worldview (of a given topic): </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“humor serves the vital psychological and social function of confirming or cultivating intimacy, and establishing or reinforcing community.”&#160;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But way before in-jokes, before studies and research, before… even maybe speech, laughter signified to fellow humans that everything was okay, or that danger had passed.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evolution of quarantine realization through the Kanye West lens:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90167758_10163286879800083_3052680505649528832_n.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"kanye west corona meme - changing expression\" class=\"wp-image-26560\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90167758_10163286879800083_3052680505649528832_n.jpg?w=444&#38;ssl=1 444w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90167758_10163286879800083_3052680505649528832_n.jpg?resize=286%2C300&#38;ssl=1 286w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90167758_10163286879800083_3052680505649528832_n.jpg?resize=143%2C150&#38;ssl=1 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So many stories about cruise ships being stranded for fear of sick passengers:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90164424_10163286879980083_4508941072038100992_n.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"cruise ship coronavirus meme hiding\n\" class=\"wp-image-26561\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90164424_10163286879980083_4508941072038100992_n.jpg?w=443&#38;ssl=1 443w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90164424_10163286879980083_4508941072038100992_n.jpg?resize=300%2C259&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/90164424_10163286879980083_4508941072038100992_n.jpg?resize=150%2C129&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can laughter during the COVID-19 pandemic signify that the danger has passed? Especially since it has not (not yet, at least) passed?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing (covid memes) is caring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Scott, there’s an unspoken communication hierarchy that dictates how happy or satisfied we are with our social interactions.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that the highest level of satisfaction comes from face-to-face communication. This is due in most part to the fact that seeing each other allows us to read non-verbal cues that allow us to paint a more complete picture of the message(s) we’re receiving (or sharing). This not only occurs in-person but nowadays can include video calls when you can’t physically be together (hello Zoom and FaceTime!).&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When that’s not an option, auditory communication is next in the preferred communication hierarchy, followed by written communication like letters, emails, even social media posts. It stands to reason that with less interaction (visual or auditory), we lose parts of the message, and therefore, our satisfaction with those interactions is lower.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5njEIpQSlrSgdMYcA5F-BH8tXjo50nu4tphpU0AjJugJsbCl0uDHDm3Rzjrh3n2VFjqjr7vVIJ5-1aARfkzfoKnv2wBZEAUf4QploblVxF1nw70_LbmRVHY8ymyWw7S7_oNeHvLW\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Can the interaction represented by sharing memes, despite their lack of face-to-face communication, generate the same joy and satisfaction as cracking someone up in person?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hypothesize that the act of sharing something on social media is the modern-day “stamp of approval.” It’s the equivalent of communicating to another that (1) you approve of this content, (2) you think it’s funny and (3) you believe they will agree that it’s funny.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually these three things are instantaneously communicated and understood when you’re physically in the same room as someone else sharing a story. However, when you can’t be in the same room together, sharing something on social media helps to solidify that intent.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The act of sharing memes is the sticky point here. And if someone else shares something that you’ve<em> </em>shared, then, as Scott explains: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“You feel like you’ve had a social interaction, even if you weren’t laughing out loud in person.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The other, and arguably more important, power of memes lies in the fact that not everyone understands or gets the joke. And much like how McCarten suggests you have to belong to the “community” to be “in on it,” understanding a meme gives you that same sense of approval and acceptance. It makes you feel like you’re part of a certain community.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no better feeling than knowing that you understood a joke that not everyone will be privy to; not everyone will understand or appreciate. You’ve probably also been on the other side of the interaction, when you see people laughing or enjoying a meme or joke and you’re sitting there wondering, “What am I missing? I don’t get it.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you <em>get it</em>, it’s empowering.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, a Gen-X joke at its finest: Chuck Norris drinks Coronavirus for breakfast:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HhPBNjLAc6bGtw9hGoQSQ9qR0Uf9pTEOJu6yRs9tG62eQ9rgi-3sPt194-XlB7IHhF17MYwsVqwo4JBtJp9GjR_FBRDDM3TnB7xiglL_ODESocT91GhfEjZ9uh3Z-cHlI3UG3iLD\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the SARS outbreak?

Which leads us to…&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Get your mind outta the gallows&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott introduced me to the weird and wonderful world that is humor in high-stress jobs. She explains they serve three purposes: “1. Increasing social bonding. 2. Dealing with the stress of the job and coping. 3. Keeping outsiders out.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I found in my research is that most of these high-stress on-the-job jokes are quite dark and morbid. And although some translate to outsiders, as an “outsider,” I admit that you probably <em>had to be there</em>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gallows humor, as it is referred to, takes serious, painful, or even scary topics and trivializes them in an irreverent or satirical way. <a href=\"http://www.douglasficek.com/teaching/phil-4450-humor/watson.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Professor Katie Watson</a>, lawyer and bioethicist at Northwestern University and adjunct faculty member at The Second City in Chicago, says:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Joking about death fits the term most literally, but making fun of life-threatening, disastrous or terrifying situations fits the category as well.”&#160;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781587297922/doctors-in-the-making\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Doctors in the Making</em></a>, Dr. Suzanne Poirier, professor emerita of literature and medical education at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, explains, </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Anger and gallows humor are generally accepted forms of expression among undergraduate and graduate medical students&#8230; but expressions of serious self-doubt or grief are usually kept private or shared with only a trusted few.&#8221;&#160;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In these types of professions, serious self-doubt and grief can be construed as incompetence or being unable to hack it. Instead, gallows humor helps accomplish two things: first, release tension and stress, and second, save face with colleagues and superiors.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Sigmund Freud proposed that those who are “unafflicted” prefer when “victims” joke about their predicament because “it relieves us of the burden of sympathy.” As the joker, however, <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books/about/Jokes_and_Their_Relation_to_the_Unconsci.html?id=G3x-CgAAQBAJ&#38;printsec=frontcover&#38;source=kp_read_button&#38;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&#38;q&#38;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Freud</a> further suggested it’s how we choose to avoid dealing with both internal (like our inhibitions) and external (things that are out of our control) conflicts, the latter of which is best dealt with laughter rather than anger.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s also been documented that concentration camp prisoners would joke about their circumstances as a way to deal with the horrible injustices they faced.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The curious chihuahua gets me every time:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dMIyDElgL4C6_OqvEKticWzW7jKI7iltMy2WXQ8QKQM5PRb6vo5H4Ng32fG7Arn0zL1Jx00jLFLOjiMqoe28vbu1oZHjaixCM7FFMzzPJqmhcWlcPPaGpvzl0Mb9QKeVbNYv8G8W\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty morbid but also true:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91792910_10163346768230083_325696715904516096_o.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26562\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91792910_10163346768230083_325696715904516096_o.jpg?w=439&#38;ssl=1 439w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91792910_10163346768230083_325696715904516096_o.jpg?resize=300%2C292&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91792910_10163346768230083_325696715904516096_o.jpg?resize=150%2C146&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“A joke is a rebellion against oppressive authority, and few authorities are more oppressive than death, illness, and injury,” says Watson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://as1020.pbworks.com/f/saunders-braindead.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">George Saunders</a> wrote, </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Humor is what happens when we’re told the truth quicker and more directly than we’re used to.

In the case of gallows humor, oftentimes, rapid-truthing is seen in the form of breaking down a situation (likely a grim or dire one) and calling out its absurdity. To the layperson, this may seem insensitive, but sometimes it’s necessary to get your point across faster and with impunity. And sometimes that rapid-truthing may end up looking like a joke.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Philogelos,</em> or <em>The Laughter Lover,</em> is the oldest known collection of jokes that dates back to the fourth or fifth century. Some of the jokes were about oversexed women (ahem!), the absent-minded professor (the era’s equivalent to blonde jokes), and other themes that translate today with a few lingo swaps.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But others, jokes about crucifixion, don’t translate so well to the 21st century and, more so, make you wonder… WTF was wrong with these people?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"http://publishing.yudu.com/Library/Au7bv/PhilogelosTheLaughAd/resources/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">From Philogelos, Joke #121</a> (as translated by Professor William Berg)<br>An Abderite observes a runner who’s been crucified. “By the gods,” he exclaims, “He’s no longer running – he’s flying!”</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To us, this seems both insensitive and incomprehensible, even “inconceivable,” but the fact of the matter is that in those days, crucifixion was everywhere, in public places and in plain sight for everyone to see and fear.

Because memes are so commonplace nowadays, we know to expect the formula that comes with the different types, be it [ <em>image</em> + <em>caption</em> = <em>funny</em> ]. It’s the interruption of this pattern that brings about the humor in memes, and it’s why it always feels like <em>new</em> when you see a different version of an old meme.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, it’s clear: using laughter to cope with an ongoing pandemic during a worldwide quarantine is the way that many of us are choosing to deal with an absurd and incredible situation no one ever believed would happen in our lifetime.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes me laugh probably more than it should… because who in our lifetime thought you’d ever be able to say these words and mean them?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pJZuJD4ptIbFBOr0B8AkYgc8bOIwXcfWFbhkj8hCPvGcEDiTnz2Hb1VKBTSd_DJwPrQLuaiMhQrxbLf2xaSQQAq9ij905YuCQsi69cVTz221Rwt0_bueqGstKYPa1NzhLrELaoFR\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of memes as a conduit for humor is likely due to the medium’s ability to rapidly expose and acknowledge the truth, which allows us to confront the numerous ways in which our lives have been altered: working from home, kids at home, video calls, how to wash your hands, social distancing and quarantine, not the apocalypse you expected, new schedules, drinking, baking (sourdough), COVID-19 and coronavirus, toilet paper. There’s even a subgroup of memes wherein the words to common songs are being adapted to these events.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such as:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do Re Mi &#8212; COVID 19 version of The Sound of Music classic</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Do Re Mi - Covid-19 version\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MMBh-eo3tvE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do I Have the COVID Virus?

Although we are all experiencing the pandemic slightly differently, we all share this commonality, and thus we are all <em>in on the joke</em>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, the deaths and the incredible suffering are not a laughing matter, but that’s not exactly what the memes are suggesting. We’re joking about the scary fact that the world has changed, likely, for the foreseeable future.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cohen recognizes this: &#8220;When we laugh at a true absurdity, we simultaneously confess that we cannot make sense of it and that we accept it. Thus laughter is an expression of our humanity, our finite capacity, our ability to live with what we cannot understand or subdue. We can dwell within the incomprehensible without dying from fear or going mad.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is there anything more absurd than living through a pandemic in 2020? Memes have truly helped us all grow as a community, communicate our difficulties and show that we really are all in this together.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take your daily dose of memes and call me in the morning.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and here you go&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

I earned my undergraduate degree in English and went on to graduate school for a Masters in Divinity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, my life imploded.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It started with a wrecking-ball event out of my control and culminated in a bomb I assembled with my own two hands &#8211; made of resentment, anger and entitlement.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won’t belabor the details. Suffice to say, there I was: 31 years young, standing amidst the burnt rubble of a life torn down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I had going for me was that my previous life had taught me <em>all communication is sales</em>: getting what’s inside my heart and mind into someone else’s in a way that makes them say, “Yes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other thing I had going? Desperation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Aaron,” I thought, “you’ve got to do something to eat. You can communicate pretty well. Maybe there are people out there selling things to other people who can’t communicate well. Maybe they would pay you to help.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thus, a marketer was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hit the ground running with the speed and tenacity only one part desperation and two parts ignorance can provide. (Thank God for the latter!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I began devouring the likes of Copyblogger, Neil Patel, MarketingProfs and &#8211; yes, not to suck up &#8211; Copyhackers, I noticed a unifying ingredient on their sites: logos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Logos depicting where they’d published and clients they’d worked for. Logos that screamed social proof: “These companies and people trust me. They gave me money. You should too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>Logo envy, the desire to look like somebody even though I was nobody, took over my heart.</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>After grinding out the first few months as a newbie online writer, I began researching a select handful of sites. It started with niche marketing publications &#8211; like MarketingProfs, Copyblogger, Content Marketing Institute and Unbounce.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the approach I’ll detail below worked, I then sent off a completed article to multiple mainstream sites. Low and behold, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238012\" target=\"_blank\">Entrepreneur picked it up</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=800%2C511&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24719\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=800%2C511&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=150%2C96&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=300%2C192&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=768%2C491&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=990%2C633&#38;ssl=1 990w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?resize=1320%2C844&#38;ssl=1 1320w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png?w=1488&#38;ssl=1 1488w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneur even told me I could continue to submit to them.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>The lights came on.

It’s probably the leading characteristic of my success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how <em>journalistic</em> a site or publication may appear, editors care about one thing: <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/mass-traffic-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"popular content (opens in a new tab)\">popular content</a>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular content equals traffic. And traffic equals ad revenue, subscribers or (in some cases) customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Editors want articles that align with what’s currently working for their site, without overlapping or cannibalizing existing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While popular content looks different publication to publication, within a publication &#8211; and even <em>within a publication niche</em> &#8211; it changes very little.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret is…</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>Popular content isn’t invented. It’s discovered.</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, most writers don’t put in the work upfront to figure out exactly what already works.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Good news: if you do put in that work, you’ll be lightyears ahead of the competition.</strong> Not to mention, more than halfway toward the goal of seeing your words come to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do tons of research before I ever write a word. (What’s more, when I was editor in chief at Shopify Plus, I salivated over submissions that showed that same level of preparation.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in addition to that first post on Entrepreneur when Mindy Kaling was trending, my research process landed me on Success Magazine when Jimmy Fallon was hot and again when Stephen Colbert took over the Late Show.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Aaron Orendorff's guest posts in Success Magazine\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It served me at Unbounce when Straight Outta Compton dropped and made me an official top-performing blogger at Content Marketing Institute multiple times over.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Aaron Orendorff's guest posts for Unbounce and the Content Marketing Institute\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It even got me into places like Mashable and The Next Web, which &#8211; because I don’t have any technical expertise &#8211; I have no real business writing for.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mashable-The-Next-Web.png?resize=800%2C1253&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Aaron Orendorff's guest posts for Mashable and The Next Web\" width=\"800\" height=\"1253\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you’ve already noticed a pattern.

Popular</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collect 10 to 20 of your target publisher’s most popular existing articles using (1) onsite lists &#8211; normally on their homepages or within specific sections &#8211; (2) “best of” round-up articles or (3) social media counters (e.g. Buzzsumo).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drop those URLs into column B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Headlines</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copy and paste <em>all </em>the headlines from those articles (one by one or by exporting them from Buzzsumo) into column C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Headline characters</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the formula =len(C2) into the next column &#8211; where C is the column and 2 is the row. That will automatically calculate the number of characters in the selected cell. Drag that cell down to the end of your list and run the AVERAGE formula at the bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behold, the power of math &#8211; the perfect length for your headline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Headline patterns</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examine each headline <em>like a popularity bloodhound</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they use numbers, names, scientific words, questions, trends, “how-to” phrases, contrarian perspectives, the promise of intrigue and surprise or any other dominant patterns?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Additional-Headline-Questions.png?resize=512%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A sampling of additional headline questions from inside Master of Guest Blogging - plus, there’s WAY more!\" width=\"512\" height=\"329\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>A sampling of additional headline questions from inside <a href=\"https://school.copyhackers.com/courses/master-of-guest-blogging\">Master of Guest Blogging</a> &#8211; plus, there’s WAY more!</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.

Formality Score</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skim each article &#8211; paying special attention to the introduction (lede) and conclusion. Then, give each one a formality score of 1 to 3:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Weekend Cookout (Hella informal)</li><li>Casual Friday (Formal)</li><li>Gala (Most formal)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.

Links</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hover over each of the links in the articles and note whether they’re onsite or offsite. Also, count the total number of links. (Links are SEO currency. Editors know this and treat them accordingly.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Data Points</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tabulate the total number of data points contained within each article.

Why? Because pitch implies sending an idea or a <em>listicle</em> of ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with that is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online publications feed the beast; they’re hungry for content. Ravenous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, editors are busy AF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Editors don’t have time to look at a portfolio of previous articles or to cook up a topic and angle. Nor do they want to wade through a 10- or 20-point list of “article ideas and headlines.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>That’s homework. Never give an editor homework. Instead, make it as easy as possible for an editor to say, “Yes.”</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>A pitch doesn’t do that (except for top-tier print magazines). Most only add effort to an editor’s already crowded plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having lived on both sides of the divide &#8211; as a guest blogger and as Shopify Plus’ editor in chief &#8211; I know this all too well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I longed for at Shopify was a guest post I could hit “Publish” on as quickly as possible with as little back-and-forth as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a guest blogger, instead of sending pitches, I sent completed articles customized for each publication. All but one of my breakthrough guest posts came from sending a fully researched, custom-tailored, completed article with a short email that basically said:</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>“Here’s a finished article. I wrote it just for you.”&#160;</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Followed by a link to a Google Doc or an attached Word document.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the <a href=\"https://school.copyhackers.com/courses/master-of-guest-blogging\">full Master of Guest Blogging course</a>, I walk through a host of real emails I have sent to editors &#8211; some successful, some not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those hard-won lessons culminated in three <em>short </em>email templates and two journalistic templates. Here’s one of the three short versions:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/One-of-the-three-short-versions-of-the-email-temlates.png?resize=787%2C374&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Short email template for guest posting pitch to editors\" width=\"787\" height=\"374\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seriously.

Most of them &#8211; to be honest &#8211; are excuses to shield us from the risk of rejection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most-plausible sounding protest goes like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>“Sure, guest blogging worked for you, Aaron. But you’re a writer. I’m not. It won’t work for me.”</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Lies! But don’t take my word for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than try to convince you that guest posting can add fuel to any career path or service… instead, I asked 35 influencer-status leaders in a variety of industries three questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Has guest blogging helped you grow your business?</li><li>How has guest blogging helped grow your business?</li><li>What’s the one thing you wish you knew when you started?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the best part…</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>20 of the 35 were not writers or content creators!</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an incredibly scientific scale, here’s how their answers to the first question about “has” guest blogging helped shook out…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hell yeah!</strong> 63%</li><li><strong>Yes:</strong> 26%</li><li><strong>Sorta:</strong> 11%</li><li><strong>No:</strong> 0%</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can  <a href=\"\" data-leadbox-popup=\"1450f2973f72a2:17f2c5a05b46dc\" data-leadbox-domain=\"copyhackers.lpages.co\">grab</a> all 35 answers to the second two questions, so &#8211; for now &#8211; I simply want to highlight three of my favorite responses from two non-writers and one content creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up: Savannah Sanchez, a paid media manager at the Facebook agency <a href=\"https://commonthreadco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Common Thread Collective</a>. Earlier this year, Savannah published her first guest post.

It’s easy to forget to comment moderate when the blog doesn’t live on your own website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“However, there could be valuable potential clients that are asking questions in the comments of your guest blog.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Ross Simmonds &#8211; CEO of <a href=\"https://foundationinc.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Foundation Marketing</a>. You may know Ross from his top-rated conference appearances, his prolific Twitter output or his writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Ross is <em>not</em> a writer by trade.

I really liked your post [post title]. I would like to contribute a guest post on this topic at no cost to you, just include a link to our website.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>“Instead of doing what everyone else is doing, playing the guest blog lottery and hoping you win by sending out a lot of emails, send fewer emails but increase the quality.”</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>“First, verify that they accept guest blog posts… Second, if they do accept guest posts, write a paragraph or two that don’t merely prove you know what they’ve already published but show you know where they’re going and what they want to publish in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Think of a blog owner as a collector of rare animals and find what’s missing from their collection.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If someone came to me and said, ‘I see you’re focusing a lot these days on your 7 Systems, but you haven&#8217;t published a lot about System #3 and I have some ideas for guest posts that could give you more content focused on that,’ then that would be pretty compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It would prove to me they’ve gone further than a temple and they really know the content on my site.

That is, it follows one idea. It’s written for one reader (who, admittedly, could be clearer). It’s got one offer (which, admittedly, could be more irresistible). And it’s got one promise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were emails that were based on email best practices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internally, our team was like, “Cool beans.

All stakeholders were on board. Everyone was perfectly fine with these emails going out the door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody was sure these emails would lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, no one was sure they would win, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Prezi team tested our new email sequence against the control, our results were</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#62;&#62;drumroll&#60;&#60;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>flat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the emails had never happened. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Prezi had invested no time or resources in them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Copyhackers had invested no time or resources in them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like they had never happened. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except they HAD happened. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were 1000s of Prezi trial users who’d been exposed to them. Thousands of Prezi users who’d taken very little action after reading them. Not NO action. But very little action. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prezi users were saying this about our copy: “Meh.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worst thing is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A part of me thinks all of us &#8211; my team and the Prezi team &#8211; were thinking the same thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just didn’t say it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hindsight 20/20, sure &#8211; but here’s what I’ve started noticing about copy that doesn’t a) beat the control or b) lose to the control.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as the world starts adopting a fashion trend, it’s already dead. Someone said that once. But you’ll have to trust me on that point because Google thinks I’m making it up. Evidently <a href=\"https://dilbert.com/search_results?terms=trends\">Dilbert</a> doesn’t have a comic for that yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as marketing recognizes a trend, it’s already dead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/design/branding-cartoon-illustration-design-trend/\">this now-famous Unbounce post</a> about the trend in illustrations on SaaS sites, which appears to have been first sparked by this tweet by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimmy_daly\">@jimmy_daly</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1575323705246_Screen+Shot+2019-12-02+at+2.52.08+PM.png\" alt=\"Sweet from Jimmy Daly featuring illustrations in SaaS design.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s never been a good idea that marketing hasn’t killed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I say that as a marketer. Who likes good ideas. Who’s had a few. And who’s killed many. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as we get wise to something, it’s already too late. As soon as you hear about it, it may already be time to consider it “inspiration” and use it to spark a better, fresher idea. Customers are already tuning it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started looking around at the emails I was paying attention to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because my thought was this:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There’s gotta be something out there that’s not an email best practice yet but could inspire great emails.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(Yeah, I’m a swiper. You should swipe, too.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first company that always springs to mind for me these days, when it comes to email, is <a href=\"https://www.stickermule.com/ca\">Sticker Mule</a>.

When I first started getting emails from CB Insights, it was Jan 5, 2016 &#8211; and this is how Anand signed that newsletter:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1576109999116_Screen+Shot+2019-12-11+at+5.19.08+PM.png\" alt=\"Another example of love in the signature.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WTF?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I love you.” “I still love you.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quoi? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That signature in what is essentially a finance newsletter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while CEO Anand Sanwal is signing newsletters with the phrase most 1950s father figures couldn’t easily utter, if what TV taught me is true, which it definitely is… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>and while Sticker Mule throws a friendly eff u at all of us crazies with our email best practices… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>we’ve got this one other tricky style of email that was brought to my attention in 2019:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@thatdeanjackson/an-amazing-9-word-email-that-revives-dead-leads-d1a1e97e5eea\">The 9-word email by Dean Jackson.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9-word email is an email framework that one of my team members told me about after I sent this two-sentence email, promoting a new blog post, to the Copyhackers list. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1577821746426_The+shortest+email+weve+ever+sent.png\" alt=\"An example of a short email Jo wrote.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My team member was like, “You used the nine-word email.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, “What’s the nine-word email?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she sent me to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thatdeanjackson/an-amazing-9-word-email-that-revives-dead-leads-d1a1e97e5eea\">this article</a>. (There are other articles out there. And videos. Worth a Bing. &#60;&#8211; my husband keeps trying to make Bing happen, so that&#8217;s for him)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the email I sent was not THE nine-word email; it was just a short email. Whatever the case, I found myself introduced to the nine-word email framework, which exists to revive dead leads. It does so using this formula:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subject line: <br></strong> {recipient name}?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Body: <br></strong> “Are you still looking for {the thing you’re selling}?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which turns into something like this, for example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subject line: <br></strong> Elon?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Body: <br></strong> “Are you still looking for smash-proof windshields?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the whole thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the results people share when they use the 9-word email are pretty incredible. I haven’t seen actual support for any of this, but if you’re cool with anecdotal evidence, people have used that formula to sell bigger-ticket items with longer sales cycles, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Real estate</li><li>Vacations</li><li>Consulting services</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The creator of the 9-word email, Dean Jackson lists these results for people who’ve used his formula:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A yacht broker sent “Are you still looking for a yacht?” and uncovered a $100 million dollar buyer. A Motorcycle jeans designer sold over $9000 in one week with a 9-word email. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to this point:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There are more interesting things working in marketing than “best practices” expose us to.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the above proceeds of my email swipe file review, I went back to the drawing board to work on a new round of Prezi onboarding emails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tossed out everything we’d done in the “flat” round of onboarding emails except for: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>the subject lines (which had good open rates) and </li><li>the basic flow of the emails &#8211; that is, which feature / benefit / outcome to talk about in the first email, then the second, then the third, etc. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In my writing, I swiped boldly from Sticker Mule… swiped lightly from CB Insights… and let the 9-word email keep me focused on a single point of relevance for the reader. In 45 minutes in my Macbook’s TextEdit program, I dashed out a brand new email sequence for Prezi, with this basic research question guiding the emails:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What if every single thing we know about emails needs to be challenged? </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y’know, just a small question. Challenging the work I’ve done for the last 15 years. No big deal. No big whoop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that and a new set of emails in hand, I reached out to Rita, Prezi’s lifecycle and growth marketing manager (who oversees email), to run my new copy by her. Thank God for Rita &#8211; she’s always open to experiments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some convincing &#8211; not a lot but some &#8211; Rita and the Prezi team were on board with testing our new round of emails, which we called “The Bare Emails Experiment.” Here’s a representative email from the sequence:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1576110990592_Onboarding_SUL_Plus_Business_day_8.png\" alt=\"Prezi email - bare.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These emails are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Intentionally stripped down visually &#8211; only a logo (to help with trust)</li><li>Short </li><li>Formatted simply, with one sentence per line and text links instead of buttons</li><li>Light in tone</li><li>Focused on instructing the trial user to do one thing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite part? The sign off:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You’re wonderful. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be the kind of sign-off to make Anand Sanwal proud. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And best of all: some folks at Prezi and at Copyhackers did NOT like the sign-off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I’ve started noticing, the copy that’s worth putting into the world &#8211; copy that’s worth putting in front of people who’d rather you send them cat gifs but who would, at the same time, rather you not send them cat gifs &#8211; is copy that does not get boardroom consensus. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy that’s worth publishing is copy that some of your team will like and others on your team will dislike. This “group discontent” is what we hypothesize to be the foundation of breakthrough or bust copy.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prezi tested our second round of emails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they beat the control with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An 18% lift in trial-to-subscribe rate, at 95% significance </li><li>A 71% lift in number of presentations created in 7 days after send, at 100% significance</li><li>A 93% lift in the number of presentations per user, at 100% significance</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that was only for one of their segments. For two of their segments, we saw the same thing as the previous time: flat results. So we’re now working on two new sequences for those segments, with a new hypothesis about how to achieve a breakthrough &#8211; this one swiping from the winning segment while doubling-down on relevance for the segments. (More soon!) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Of course, what we’re learning is NOT that emails should be a mash-up of Sticker Mule emails, CB Insights sign-offs and the 9-word email in order to convert. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather, emails have to be <em>different from the norm</em> or from best practices to stand a chance of converting. The flipside is that differing from the norm or best practices also puts you at higher risk of negatively impacting conversions. Safe copy keeps results flat. Everything else introduces the risk of winning big or losing big. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internally, we’ve started using the old direct-response term “breakthrough or bust” to describe the outcome of deviating from best practices, where the idea is that copy that stands a chance of converting may be a total breakthrough or a total bust… and you can’t tell before you launch it. You just have to be cool with the risk.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We once again tested what was developing into a recurring “breakthrough or bust hypothesis.” </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, the test was the trial-to-pro onboarding sequence for <a href=\"https://doodle.com/en/?utm_expid=.wXHXGBO5SoStV2KMwBRRog.1&#38;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">Doodle</a>, an easy platform for scheduling meetings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what a typical email from their Control sequence looked like. Have a read as if you’re a Doodle trial user:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1577824255270_Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.28.12+PM.png\" alt=\"A Doodle email.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you stripped away the design in the above Control email, you might end up with an email that was very much like the Prezi “bare emails” experiment. Just add an unexpectedly emotional sign-off, and you’d be set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could have proposed Doodle test a bare version of the exact same copy they already had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we did that… could we say we were following our higher-level “breakthrough or bust” hypothesis? Would we have actual reason to believe the new version would convert? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My opinion: nope. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re trying to increase conversions. So going with a “sure thing” seems to be the safest way to get there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that word “safe” is the first hint that you’re going down the wrong path. It takes you away from breakthrough or bust. It keeps you closer to flat results. Or so we’re learning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Losing test after winning test after losing test, I have little reason to believe that the best next test to run is one based on copy that won elsewhere.</strong> Rather the best next copy test to run <em>may be</em> copy that’s the exact opposite of the copy that won elsewhere. If you repeat a winning test, are you running the risk of seeking a new best practice and, in turn, bringing the client / company closer to the point of mediocrity? I dunno. But it’s a question we’re always asking these days. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So what if we took the bare emails approach we’d used for Prezi… and swung the pendulum in the opposite direction for Doodle?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our philosophies at Copyhackers is that you should write for people who read. If you don’t want to write for people who read, you shouldn’t hire a copywriter and you certainly shouldn’t <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/copywriting-agency/\">hire us</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doodle’s control emails were written not for people who read but for people who scan. Their emails were, we identified during our audit, too safe. Too timid. Some might say… a little scared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most emails are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hell, most copy is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we decided, in the interest of writing breakthrough-or-bust copy &#8211; which by this time we were starting to affectionally call “BOB copy” &#8211; Bob is turning into a mascot around here BTW &#8211; that we should write emails that are quite definitely not safe. Certainly not timid. And 100% courageous &#8211; the opposite of scared. That might lead us to a breakthrough. Or a bust. But NOT flat results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our email conversion copywriter Nikki is one of the most courageous copywriters you’ll ever meet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what an email Nikki wrote… and we proposed… and Doodle tested (Variation B) looked like. Give it a read like you’re a Doodle trial user:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1577824350428_Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.27.57+PM.png\" alt=\"A Doodle email.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first half of the Doodle onboarding sequence we wrote followed a similar style and format as the above email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t until the second half, when we recommend Doodle start sending more sales emails, that our emails shortened up a bit and started to look more like this one, which is Sales Email #5:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1577825677284_Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.54.20+PM.png\" alt=\"A Doodle email.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn’t just the style of the emails we recommended that challenged both email best practices and the Doodle control sequence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also the number of emails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This is where things get particularly interesting for this study.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doodle’s control sequence was 4 emails long. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ours was 16. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yup, we recommended 4x the emails to Doodle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize the changes we recommended that we believed to be BOB:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Four times the emails</li><li>Five times the sales emails</li><li>A near-daily send frequency, compared to intermittent sending with the control</li><li>Unexpected subject lines</li><li>Subject lines that mimicked those used when scheduling meetings, which some could argue is a dark UX practice even though it was an important part of the message and not dark in intent</li><li>Longer left-aligned copy with a narrative style</li><li>A signature from someone at Doodle</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We also wrote an email from Time itself. Not from Doodle. From Time, the thing Doodle helps you save:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1577826102822_Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+2.01.10+PM.png\" alt=\"A Doodle email.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was this classic subject line, which helped this email earn the highest unsubscribe rate Doodle had ever seen: &#8220;My coworkers hate me.&#8221; See it here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CD7DE7A5C9380F5D9F12F495522675BCEAC6EA146880A70D45A4E4BFBBA6CE84_1577826123226_Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+2.00.31+PM.png\" alt=\"A Doodle email.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s four times the emails sent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Way more sales-focused emails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some tone “problems.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some long-ass copy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the results:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>63.9% lift in purchases of the Pro product</li><li>18.3% lift in purchases of the Starter product</li><li>Double to triple the unsubscribes </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But those lifts were largely for US-based trial users. The Brits and the Aussies responded better to the control sequence. As did non-English speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A note from Val Geisler, our peer reviewer for this article and an email expert:</strong> <em>Too many marketers think unsubs are a bad thing. Unsubs are GOOD in this case (and pretty much every case) because people who don’t want to hear from you shouldn’t hear from you. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ready for something that’s quite a bit more interesting? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we’ve all seen stories of conversion lifts… and because this whole post is about how you can’t just repeat what someone did, hoping it’s a best practice, and expect to see the same results…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re starting to think about how to write BOB emails or BOB copy for your organization, you’re going to need to get ready for… reactions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allow me to illustrate:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly zero trial users replied to a single email in the Doodle control sequence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you guess how many replied to the emails in Variation B / the BOB sequence we wrote?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try 107 replies from Doodle Pro trial users… and 204 replies from Doodle Starter trial users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine explaining that to your success team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine getting the reluctant okay from your marketing team and the boardroom to move forward with a BOB email sequence… only to have CS call an emergency meeting when BOB launches to deal with 300+ emails from customers that include content like:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Please stop. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Your emails are hilarious.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Doodle is great. Trying to shame people into buying your product? Poor. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even a paid conversion lift of &#62;60% couldn’t keep your team from demanding you take the emails down. Which almost happened in this case. But instead we removed the particularly problematic email &#8211; which is the one with the subject line “My coworkers hate me” you saw above &#8211; and made some other technical modifications to deal with people getting more emails than they should have. Conversion rate stayed high. And angry emails went away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it make you nervous, the idea of getting 300x the email replies you used to get? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should make us all just as nervous to get ZERO replies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That part doesn’t make most marketers nervous. We try to keep our opens around 20%. And we use that as our primary measure of engagement. “People are still opening. We must be doing fine.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are doing fine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just fine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Y’know that feeling when you have no feeling about something?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think I’m overly ornery when I say that most copy out there is meh at best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great copy lives on the edge of the blade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s why so few people write or publish it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great copy is uncomfortable. A few people around the boardroom table will love it, but the vast majority will shoot it down fast. Some think it will be the breakthrough a company needs. Others think it will tank conversions. If you were to ask the room to vote on whether they think it would beat the control, no one would say yes. Even the copywriter who wrote it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>THAT’S potentially great copy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also potentially shit copy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a name for it now. It’s called BOB copy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not “fake news” headlines or clickbait. It’s also not copy that’s filled with swearwords. Or takes a hard right when the market goes left. Or is about sex when it shouldn’t be about sex. Or is anything Cambridge Analytica would have signed off on &#8211; gross manipulation disguised as &#8220;persuasion.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BOB copy makes you react. Makes you feel something. And for those huge marketing sins, it’s hated by the vast majority of the boardroom. A boardroom has never turned out great copy. Good copy, yes. The kind of copy your designer whips up while sketching out your new home page, yes. But not great copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have the theory behind BOB copy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now add this checklist to the mix to help you identify if your copy is likely to be a total breakthrough or a total bust (and importantly: you can&#8217;t be sure which one of those it’ll be). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>This is our current but growing checklist for writing breakthrough-or-bust copy.</h2>\n\n\n\n[ ] It boldly breaks best practices for the medium or channel. <br>\n[ ] It boldly breaks best practices for copywriting for that medium or channel.<br>\n[ ] It boldly breaks best practices in design / design conventions for that medium or channel.<br>\n[ ] It leverages insights from data without said data choking or stifling potentially fruitful ideas.<br>\n[ ] It boldly runs counter to the Control. <br>\n[ ] It is still technically on-brand for the company. <br>\n[ ] You are scared to present it. But you know it ticks the above boxes.<br>\n[ ] You are certain many people will hate it. But you know it ticks the above boxes.<br>\n[ ] You know there is a WHY for every practice challenged.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>If best practices breed mediocre results, Joanna, should I even learn how to write copy… or just throw wild guesses at the page?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a rule in writing: you don’t get to break the rules of grammar until you know the rules of grammar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My take is it’s the same in the copywriting world: you don’t get to break copywriting best practices until or unless you know those best practices. How would you know which best practices to challenge if you don’t know the best practices to begin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and keep a swipe file. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>~jo </p>\n<script

act of writing and structuring copy that moves digital users, like visitors and customers, toward accomplishing a goal in an intuitive way.&#160;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start by viciously ripping that term &#8211; UX copywriting &#8211; apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is user experience (UX)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>UX describes how, when and why people interact with a product or service &#8211; and how they feel about their experience. If you wear clothes, eat food and have a roof over your head, you’re having multiple user experiences every single second.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s use an article of clothing as an example. Socks!&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wear socks, you’re a user of that product, and your <em>experience</em> starts long before your toes get warm ‘n’ cozy.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you realize you need socks. Maybe, like me, you’ve got somewhat of a holey sock epidemic and almost every time you put on a pair, a circle of skin stares right back at ya. So you start shopping for new socks. You compare your options. You find some you want. You buy them. You unpackage them. And finally, you put them on.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost anything can contribute to a good or bad user experience. Like, if I ordered ankle socks online and received thigh highs instead. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Bad experience.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All user experiences are affected by things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The reason you decide to use or purchase something in the first place</li><li>The time of year and time of day you use the product</li><li>Any friction or pleasant surprises you encounter</li><li>How you feel throughout the whole journey</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>UX applies to both physical and digital products but for the rest of this post, I’ll be talking about digital.&#160;In digital marketing, we can optimize UX by understanding our audience and creating brand and product interactions that are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Intuitive</li><li>Relevant to people’s needs</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And we can use copy to guide them toward a user experience that satisfies both their goals &#8211; and ours.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Copywriting is all about purpose and persuasion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When copywriting, we write with a goal in mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to achieve that goal, we take the desires people already have and show them how to fulfill them with a product or service. (I’m paraphrasing the legendary Eugene Schwartz and his concept of mass desire here.)&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, copy should compel people to take an action. Without a word wasted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to make your copy more UX-friendly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>UX copywriting is the act of writing and structuring copy that moves people toward accomplishing a goal in an intuitive way.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve seen this in lots of headlines, microcopy and button copy. I’ll show you an example of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UX-friendly headlines</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m new to conversion copywriting, so I’m eager to learn everything I can. This means I’m on an endless hunt for books, courses and training to better my skills.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though I’m actively looking for guidance, I probably won’t buy a conversion copywriting kit from some guy in an alley. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or blindly follow advice I find online. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to make sure I’m getting copywriting resources from someone I trust.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Copyhackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_28F3A6DCBFCED9B1A5AAD72B59648BCCD0DB1DA86A12C7C0507FD716989622C5_1572829173502_Screen+Shot+2019-11-03+at+5.59.10+PM.png\" alt=\"Example of UX copywriting in a heading\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I’m greeted with the Copyhackers headline above, I’m snagged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline acknowledges where I’m at in my journey as a fresh-to-the-biz conversion copywriter and offers something I need &#8211; the essentials.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This headline contributes to a positive user experience by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Keeping the copy succinct</li><li>Using bold formatting to emphasize the benefit of this page</li><li>Directly relating to me and what I do by using the term conversion copywriting &#8211; so I’m keen to continue reading and eventually sign up to receive the Conversion Copywriting 101 course.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>UX-friendly microcopy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I write Facebook ads, so I have a vested interest in how social media advertising engages people.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_28F3A6DCBFCED9B1A5AAD72B59648BCCD0DB1DA86A12C7C0507FD716989622C5_1572884305560_Screen+Shot+2019-11-04+at+9.17.44+AM.png\" alt=\"Example of UX copywriting in microcopy\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I see this post, I’m instantly intrigued by the title. Below that, I notice the name of the author &#8211; Sarah Sal &#8211; as well as the microcopy: “19 Min Read.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estimated reading time answers an important question:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>How much time will I need to </em><em>set aside to </em><em>read this?</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I know how long it will take, I can decide if there’s enough cushion in my schedule at this exact moment or if I should save it for later.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even though I may not read the post right away, the microcopy gives me the details I need to plan to read it another day, which still brings me one step closer to accomplishing the main goal of reading the article.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UX-friendly button copy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The copy on any button should persuade people to click it because they believe it will make their life better.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The button text above makes that click extra enticing by offering me front-of-the-line-access to Copyhackers’ guest blogging course.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, the button copy creates a good user experience by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Centring the text so my eyes are focused right where the button should be clicked</li><li>Using a different colour from the rest of the text, so I understand it has a different purpose</li><li>Formatting the word ‘all’ in upper case which disrupts the sentence case pattern and stops me from skimming</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Steve Krug said it best&#8230;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Don’t make me think (opens in a new tab)\">Don’t make me think</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether clicking a button or scrolling down a page, people want clarity. And they want to make decisions they feel good about.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to make reader journeys easier with UX copywriting (so we can all accomplish our goals)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our job as copywriters and digital marketers is first to listen to what people want and need, then illustrate the easiest ways to accomplish their goals &#8211; without any distractions or wasted words.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We couldn’t do this without:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Listening to our audience (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2018/05/how-to-listen/\" target=\"_blank\">Listening to our audience</a>.</strong> Understanding their hopes. Fears. Desires. Frustrations.

They expect hyperlinks to be underlined. Headlines to be bolded. Messages to be matched. If we don’t follow best practices, we risk confusing (and losing) our audience.&#160;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Both clients and customers have important goals.

Product marketing is the intersection of three fields: product, marketing and sales, and customer research. By understanding how these three fields work together, I understood how to get sales faster than content marketing by itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CsrZiEQmaHR2OqoKml84jU-CSjrNyzZGPu0_CHEq_-1oIIjzLOqAqd38x6rv2628JI3rpfV1HZi4PelC3hLj_LiQL3_35SauAoyvZtVaG0d8O3uqVqzcp7f1aDtALz74gIC3M-j8\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, while a content marketer is likely focusing on traffic, a product marketer needs to know what traffic converts into customers. We do this by talking to customers, positioning the product, determining the price, and launching the go-to-market strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a product marketer for early-stage startups, I’m relentlessly testing what gets customers faster for my clients.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From my tests, I’ve found two areas content marketers often ignore, which leads to slower growth:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Defining the startup’s positioning with a unique sales proposition.</li><li>Knowing what content and keywords will generate sales sooner.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Content marketers often ignore positioning because it’s not easy to track how it leads to more traffic. Instead, they often “position” a startup by placing whatever keywords bring in more organic traffic on the homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because content marketers focus on getting more traffic, they also tend not to learn what keywords generates sales sooner. At best, they learn certain keywords have higher buyer intent.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They often look at PPC click costs to estimate buyer intent because they lack a meaningful framework. This approach is flawed because cost-per-click only tells you what advertisers are willing to pay. It doesn’t tell you how likely customer is to convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I say this as a reformed content marketer. It wasn’t until I worked with early-stage startups that I realized product marketing </strong><strong><em>with</em></strong><strong> content marketing was a more efficient path.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wanna learn the product marketing playbook I used to help Decibite double (+127%) their annualized revenue in 6 months? Then keep reading&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To understand the principles of product marketing playbook, we need to take a lesson from two of my favorite copywriters:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Rosser Reeves, who taught me the importance of creating a unique sales proposition (USP).</li><li>Eugene Schwartz, who taught me a framework to figure out what keywords will generate sales sooner.

You are in the business of providing a solution to someone’s problem. As such&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your goal is to gain insights on what customers </strong><strong><em>say they’ve done in the past or are currently doing</em></strong><strong>. You should also focus mainly on open-ended questions to get more in-depth responses too.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O060c2UmuwFWdLrXY5TqvgQi6igetRo4OLf6fmL4d_xACzfCTI1LoCot0qNbqgPbAw10CeIcBWsggPoJgcuBeHKgyMd2iQ_fdO1IapaMmoyV1t7Bz_x06cJ6h6TiK7g9JUZ9ASnn\" alt=\"voice of the customer\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Do this by <a href=\"https://www.growthramp.io/articles/voice-of-the-customer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">talking to them</a>. The Copyhackers blog has many techniques on how to talk to your customers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2019/11/customer-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3 techniques to interview your customers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/join-the-conversation-customer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to survey your new subscribers and new customers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/write-copy-amazon-review-mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to mine Amazon reviews for voice-of-customer data</a></li><li><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/a-super-speedy-formula-to-find-voc-fast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to find what customers are saying about you and competitors fast</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You wanna find out what they say because this language will fuel your copy.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding what previous customers have said, done, and thought, you can predict what future customers will say, do, and think. That is, as long as your future customers are similar to your past ones (which I’ve found are often easier to acquire).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By talking to your customers, you can find out why your customers choose to do business with you rather than with your competitors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t a post on interviewing your customers. (<a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/how-to-master-customer-interviews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">You can get a full tutorial on that for free here on Copyhackers.</a>) That said, here are some questions I prefer to ask during customer interviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What questions should you ask your customers when developing a USP?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Think back to the days before you started using our product/service. What was your life/work like before us?</li><li>If you can recall, what made you start looking for our product?</li><li>Since starting to use our product/service, what would you say is the can’t-live-without-it improvement it’s made to your work/life?</li><li>If you were to run our company, what is ONE thing you would do differently?</li><li>If you can recall what competitors have you used in the past, or are you using alongside our product now?<ol><li>What did you like most about them?</li><li>What was your biggest complaint? Was that the reason you left them?</li></ol></li><li>Imagine you were to talk to a friend/coworker about our product/service. What would you say about us that you’d be unlikely to say about any other solution like ours that you’ve used?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you ask a question, stop talking. Your job is to listen, <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2018/05/how-to-listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as Copyhackers teaches in detail here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will want to document what the customer is saying. For best results, you should consider just listening and taking notes on what you want to follow up on during the interview.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you document what the customer is saying as she’s saying it, you may notice some gaps afterward. Instead, be sure to record every interview with your customer’s permission. Alternatively, you can bring in a second interviewer to take thorough notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, avoid the feeling you <em>need</em> to reach statistical significance with these interviews. There is an art and a science to writing a unique sales proposition. The goal is to squeeze a lil’ more science into the process than art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s time to make sure the market agrees with what you’ve learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Ask the market to validate brand messaging.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If we refer to the Growth Ramp diagram I mentioned earlier, we’re now at the second step:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7Ik-SNx7MauOiIloAfwnErGCWobfKEh3GbCq_yqrPfeIilyHXeCmBOg1nQQbpAYa1797HWZ9yICBuJ409mqDYD2jNMhc0w4SchR46BKYaFHEaD_J4tLHWY9mHpch9ORJRzTZUm8G\" alt=\"brand messaging\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After interviewing your customers, I recommend you survey your market. This will give you more data to compare to what you learned from your customer interviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal is to avoid <em>only</em> confirming what you’ve learned. (AKA, you’re <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">avoiding confirmation bias</a>). Instead, the goal of market research is to help you validate or invalidate what you’ve found.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Here are 3 ways to survey the market</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2014/10/amazon-review-mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mine product reviews</a>.</li><li>Listen to social media. (Reddit is my favorite channel to do market research).</li><li>Use a tool like <a href=\"https://www.pollfish.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pollfish</a>, <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/market-research-surveys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SurveyMonkey Research</a>, or <a href=\"https://surveys.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Surveys</a> to run an actual survey. It costs money, but I find you’ll get better and more recent data.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The tricky thing about surveying people is that you can never be sure you’re surveying someone who’s actually a match of your future customer. This is an added danger of mining product reviews and social media eavesdropping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even customer surveys may not allow you to segment the market that will or should buy what you offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So take everything with a grain of salt.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re looking to triangulate data, not arrive at a guarantee of messaging success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Use the brand messaging to start figuring out your brand’s positioning.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let’s define brand positioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand positioning is where your brand sits in the hearts and minds of customers, particularly in relation to your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, your positioning is what separates you from the pack.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you land on your positioning, you first need to know how your competitors position themselves in the market.

Do a quick 3-minute brainstorm and list every competitor you can think of off-the-top of your noggin’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, find out what competitors your customers compare you to, including solutions that may not be direct competitors. You should have landed this info doing your customer interviews. If you didn’t (or need more data), you can use Google auto-suggest to help you find even more competitors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Type in the name of your biggest competitor and add &#8220;vs.&#8221; afterward.&#160;</li><li>Then go through each letter of the alphabet.&#160;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E9nFyMuZ9uxlk2PYSeg6HE6iR4thfmdYwlvXdSIUmET2xoq7BO3yzkAVbvCqfziCVIFqVq4anpGdN7LC_ZrDt4DgSc-R2DcU7-tZDCXKps_u4qRl8WqL1Iq5lV70sdkmwvNXSxiy\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 3.2: Look at how each competitor positions their company.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With your competitor list in hand, you’re ready to determine how each competitor positions their company in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple way to see how each competitor positions their company is to write down:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What each competitor lists on their homepage <a href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">title tag</a>.</li><li>What each competitor has as their main header on the homepage (typically their H1).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For example…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a quick trip to Google, you’ll find Hootsuite’s homepage title tag as &#8220;Social Media Marketing &#38; Management Dashboard.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LiQ4DdBWtpto-42RPTlZHAVQ13GNwf6saPc_4paqPMtTJN8_Q5K96hUBmUWh8jGykJmIKhjvq33q-yhHtRSYeGz5PEJd2-czqeT-FUIQdt9byUvb_emVUJynctfZTx6GgsBHHvKH\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main header on <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hootsuite’s homepage</a> is, &#8220;Manage all your social media in one place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0Bw7nDmTkq72q7DazhYTIqlIoPqs-7bNTFXmxiaiRvwiZwtyWw0tGx3bNsv4PJomlIflCnWELvUSf7o6FgHNH-jey17vBW6Bblr_r1XK3zUR9DR8kvPMSithZ5m4g3Xx9HZEart6\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus with this 80/20 trick, you learn that Hootsuite wants to help you manage all your social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you’re now asking:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How is Hootsuite different than Buffer, Sprout Social, and the 50-some odd other social media management tools out there?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating that distinction is what you’ll learn in the next step&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Express your brand’s positioning with a clear value proposition (pre-USP).</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although you may conflate value propositions and unique sales propositions, I’d like to encourage you not to. Let me show you how, in my years as a marketer, I’ve seen a distinction between value props and USPs.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A value proposition is the value you promise to deliver to your customers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow me to illustrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While competing in The Amazing Race, Blake Mycoskie took an eye-opening trip to Argentina.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four years later, Mycoskie revisited Argentina on vacation. There he met a woman who was volunteering to deliver shoes to shoeless children. The experience fueled his desire to start a footwear company to help more children in need. His goal was to donate one pair of shoes for every pair someone bought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard of this famous footwear company. It’s called TOMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With nothing more than 200 pairs of shoes and a strong value proposition, Mycoskie began to pitch journalists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Los Angeles Times picked up his story. To his surprise, <a href=\"https://danielsethics.mgt.unm.edu/pdf/TOMS%20Case.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mycoskie generated $88,000 in orders over the weekend</a>. Eight years later, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/blake-mycoskie-on-10-years-of-toms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TOMS valuation was $625 million</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A value proposition is the value you promise to deliver to your customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The better you communicate the value you promise (AKA, <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2012/03/value-propositions-and-usp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your value prop</a>), the more sales you’re likely to make. That is, as long as there’s a market to hear and love that promise, which I’ll dive into discussing in a moment.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to this stage in the process of writing a value proposition:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Uuk-dlIGwZ_BB3ulD6f0mhsVvGTedB_0YYJEO6mhrzgyBknuGghWBbYuVX41d7HsDk-f8yU01qiYhWhBtZRffR7PZ8ZZBCczGCvdLqyFWzHg_A2o02E-kbc4Fa2fP4kGSm8akCbz\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong value proposition should be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Relevant to your customers’</strong> acute pain. It’s written in the language of your customer, so your customers’ know it addresses their ongoing problems.</li><li><strong>Clear about the value</strong> you offer and how it will improve their lives. A customer should be able to read and understand your value prop in five seconds (or less). There should be no hype or business jargon.</li><li><strong>Specific about the benefits</strong> you offer. There is a concrete result a customer will get from buying from your product.</li><li><strong>Different or significantly better</strong> than what your competition offers.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a strong value prop, you’ll want to find out what benefit your customers receive when using your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The questions I recommended you ask your customers earlier in this article will give you the data to create your value prop.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But here’s where things get tricky…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your competitors can easily copy most value propositions. For example, I’ve found over 30 companies using the one-for-one model <em>(</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicaprobus/23-charitable-companies-that-actually-give-back\" target=\"_blank\"><em>source</em></a><em>, </em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.insidehook.com/article/food-and-drink/16-brands-use-toms-model-one-one-giving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>source</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://designgood.com/blog/9-brands-one-for-one-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>sourrce</em></a><em>)</em>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your competitors will often offer a similar value prop as you.</strong> Perhaps they will phrase it a bit differently. But it’s almost an exact copy in the eyes of your customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you write a powerful value prop that makes sales&#8230; and is nigh impossible for your competition to steal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By turning your value prop into a USP.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Add specificity to turn your value prop into a unique sales proposition.&#160;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some examples of unique sales propositions.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Domino’s: &#8220;Fresh, hot pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less or it&#8217;s free.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FedEx: &#8220;When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GEICO: 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on your car insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see what each USP has in common?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Each of these company’s USPs has two characteristics:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>A benefit that their customer finds valuable.</strong> This alone is valuable, but it would only be a strong value proposition, not a USP. &#8220;Fresh, hot pizza delivered to your door&#8221; could apply to Domino’s or any pizza joint. Further, the customer takes on the risk if the company fails to deliver on the value proposition.<br></li><li><strong>A specific claim that a customer can test to see if it is true.</strong> &#8220;&#8230;in 30 minutes or less or it&#8217;s free&#8221; becomes a guarantee where Domino’s takes on the risk. Yes, using a specific claim <em>could</em> influence a competitor to steal it. Yet, a USP often requires a change to the product or the company’s operations.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How to turn a value proposition into a unique sales proposition</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/shENuFsk98iqDGC_u2b2aUjCRk7gf0BMZhfzVkWEgN5SC-1HZybucbZKf58aBimF5iEaOHFhxdsGAIgG4_unmT2kw-I10psNuh6zHntaE-NgrJecFX1vaMXT_5uI3_JZiYcOApXm\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To turn a value prop into a USP, I recommend you create a specific claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s go back to Decibite to help you see how I create USPs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decibite is positioning itself in the web hosting market. Web hosts typically focus on one of four benefits:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Security</li><li>Scalability</li><li>Speed</li><li>Service</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Known as a point of parity, every web host needs to offer these four benefits. Decibite needs to offer all four benefits to be a worthy web host. That’s the baseline.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emphasis a web host chooses to put on one of these benefits shapes its position in the market.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To find out which benefit Decibite should focus on, I looked at…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What customers liked about Decibite,</li><li>What the market research revealed and&#160;</li><li>What the founders specialized in.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After examining the research, I identified &#8220;speed&#8221; as the benefit Decibite should focus on. Decibite customized their servers to increase their customers’ server speed. Good. The product had the unique sales prop baked inside it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, the co-founders love learning how to improve server and site speed too. This obsession, experience, and personality are <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/4-signs-founder-market-fit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">good signs of founder-market fit</a>. In simple terms, founder-market fit is a signal how founders have the gifts and skills to best serve this market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My job was to create a customer-facing unique sales prop out of the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To turn a benefit into a USP, you have two options, as I see it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You can either find a USP already in your product and create a specific promise.&#160;</li><li>Or you can create a USP and change your product to match the USP.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To create Decibite’s specific claim, I looked at my USP swipe file and tweaked Geico’s USP to fit.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So &#8220;15 minutes could save you 15% or more on your car insurance&#8221; became &#8220;Get 15% or faster web hosting by switching to Decibite, guaranteed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hypothesized that it would be a strong USP to test in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I didn’t stop there. And you shouldn’t either.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How should you use a USP to craft your content strategy?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Here’s how I applied Eugene Schwartz’s 5 stages of awareness to a USP to double (+127%) a startup’s annualized revenue in 6 months</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eugene Schwartz identified <em>The 5 Stages of Customer Awareness</em> in &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breakthrough-Advertising-Eugene-M-Schwartz/dp/0887232981/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Breakthrough Advertising</a>.&#8221; Each stage of awareness will change what you write to make a sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are the 5 stages of awareness?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2014/07/long-pages/\" target=\"_blank\">As discussed in detail here</a> and in a ton of other Copyhackers content, these are the five accepted stages of awareness that your prospects find themselves in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Most Aware:</strong> Prospect is in an excellent position to decide to buy your offer.&#160;</li><li><strong>Product Aware:</strong> Prospect is learning about your solution.</li><li><strong>Solution Aware:</strong> Prospecting is reviewing solutions.</li><li><strong>Problem Aware:</strong> Prospecting is experiencing pain.</li><li><strong>Unaware:</strong> Prospect is pre-pain.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In greater detail, those 5 stages of awareness are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Most Aware:</strong> Your customer knows your product, and he’s ready to buy. Now it’s your job to give him the best reasons to buy now &#8211; like time-limited offers and the most relevant testimonials.&#160;</li><li><strong>Product-Aware:</strong> Your customer knows what you sell and often what the competition sells. But she isn’t sure it’s right for her. At this stage, you need to position your product against the competition.</li><li><strong>Solution-Aware:</strong> Your customer knows the result they want. But they may not know of your product, or that it provides the results they&#8217;re looking for.</li><li><strong>Problem-Aware:</strong> Your customer senses she has a problem. But she doesn’t know what’s the right solution.</li><li><strong>Unaware:</strong> Your customer does not know of their pain, even though he has this problem. These prospects don&#8217;t realize they have a problem. Think of this audience like someone who has cancer, but a doctor has not diagnosed the issue.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Most copywriters use this <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2014/07/long-pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to explain how long copy should be</a>. Which is smart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a product marketer, I used these 5 stages to create content for each stage of the buyer journey.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, targeting certain SEO keywords will influence where a customer is when they first land on your website. (I’ll cover how you can target the right keywords in a moment). But unless you have a magic wand to direct them through your website, they’ll skip around your pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By targeting the 5 customer stages with different content, you’ll make it easier for customers to buy from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means it’s not just about mapping stages of awareness to pages like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Most Aware:</strong> Short offer-focused page.</li><li><strong>Product Aware:</strong> Product-detail page.</li><li><strong>Solution Aware:</strong> Long-form sales page, home page.&#160;</li><li><strong>Problem Aware:</strong> Home page, blog post.&#160;</li><li><strong>Unaware:</strong> Blog post.&#160;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, let’s look at how to create content for each of the 5 stages of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How can you create content for customers who are ready to buy (most aware)?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most-aware customers are often looong-time fans.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He or she is almost certainly on your email list. Heck, he may have even bought another product from you. All you need to do is to give him a buy button, and he’s ready to sign up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As an early-stage startup, a customer who’s most aware is a luxury.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s *<em>possible*</em> you might have a few of these customers on your list. More than likely, different pages on your website will help these customers move down the sales funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Okay Jason, why the heck did you write all that, only to tell me you don’t need to create content for these customers?!&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one simple reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve seen <em>waaay</em> too many home pages, sales pages, and every-other-pages with a call-to-action button buried 10-feet deep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2019/11/customer-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">talking to customers</a>, I’ve had some folks say to me:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<strong>I keep expecting</strong> to see a BUY NOW type of button…&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The endless promo page was doing exactly what you said [the product] would defeat.

Here’s <a href=\"https://www.podia.com/teachable-alternative\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Podia’s comparison as a Teachable alternative</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uyLpbJx2fbvaUBkQmlK2Hip4XmUP309_RWT3Fk611kvKGvYZPqvvovFsD7O7REuMzj0yV58iVjJ__u-RQDPIvqKI4iNNGyYGfjRLUzx3QdIwdZInLxNXLPNs9BBx_GTxxoiooX6j\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Another direction you can take is to create review articles.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grammar Gang reviews various grammar tools.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://grammargang.com/grammarly-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a review article they did of Grammarly</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xiAoq8SBXryaoieX3jGVnAMNfZ1cJOcj7BQQMfsn06lxV2nUVxTm39bagunUssYk56Z7ojNlztiM5x-SOtUyx3B4RhKGRRcBV6LhoGunYr46eR9FpFhStAGUIA2c_8VXRdIagQGq\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach works especially well if your SaaS tool has an affiliate program.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But an affiliate program isn’t necessary to create review articles.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, here’s <a href=\"https://www.chanty.com/blog/slack-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a Slack review article</a> Chanty did on their website:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5n7xM0xFrDv4vJ8gU_CPyQeiAzf0HAJ7MQiOR1yY36W6M59VPRdFkXE2Wv2DKcNDRNC8mgvoyTOnLJsZYqllBjSs1mu3r3BS34-VmTK4JFd9-_ceFP766nfSino1BqqJXViBwm6M\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One benefit to comparison pages is that unhappy customers are already searching for an alternative.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means these landing pages can bring you free traffic from Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four keyword categories you can target in this step. These are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>{{Competitor}} Alternative.<br>Example: Slack Alternative.</li><li>{{Competitor}} Pricing.<br>Example: Slack Pricing.</li><li>{{Competitor}} Review.<br>Example: Slack Review.</li><li>{{Competitor 1}} vs. {{Competitor 2}}.<br>Example: Slack vs. Hipmunk.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you worried that Google will penalize you for duplicate content for each landing page? Keep in mind, you’re duplicating and “refurbishing” your own content, not your competitors.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google didn’t penalize me for refurbishing our own content.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://decibite.com/ionos-alternative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my comparison of Decibite to Ionos</a> (formerly 1&#38;1) and <a href=\"https://decibite.com/inmotion-alternative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Decibite vs Inmotion</a>.

But they do not know your product exists. Nor do they know your product (or your competitor’s product) will cure them of their pain.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this customer knows is that she has a problem, but she’s not sure there’s a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, you’ll find these customers when they hit a transition in their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She may have changed jobs, started a startup, or tried out a new hobby. With this new adventure comes questions she wants answered. Sometimes it’s an event she’s been doing for years which triggers a problem, like planning her social campaigns for black friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this new adventure comes questions she wants answered.

(If you’re new to SEO, <a href=\"https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors\">more quality links = more traffic from Google</a>). As a result of getting more links, all the content you created for the other customer stages will rank higher in Google too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy is at the core of Copyhackers’s content’s success too. If you’ve read any articles on the Copyhackers’s blog, you’ve likely noticed several case studies:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2017/09/cold-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I used cold emails to 14x my freelance copywriting business.

So they aren’t motivated to pay attention to your content.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s like a person before they have their first child. They’re watching TV, and a diaper commercial comes on. They don’t care. But once they find out they’re expecting, suddenly they start to pay attention.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unaware prospects are still prospects.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re just… not ready for you yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The content which works best here are ones marketers hope will “go viral.” The goal is to take a seemingly unrelated topic and tie it into the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LucidChart does a fantastic job showing their product in action while “explaining the Internet”:</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe title=\"What is a Pupper?

Or,</li><li>You have a huge budget and can actually do some mass advertising.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, focus more on people in problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware stages.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Search engine optimized content is a long-term investment. But it doesn’t need to take 6-12 months for content marketing or SEO to &#8220;start working&#8221; either.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter your product marketing strategy, whether you use SEO, PPC, or some other three-letter acronym, there’s always a faster path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What I’ve shared with you is the product marketing strategy I used to help Decibite:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Double their annualized revenue (+127%).</li><li>Triple their monthly traffic (+241%).</li><li>Quadruple their organic traffic (+331%).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>All in six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you start by creating your USP, you’ll have a clear and compelling reason for customers to convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then use this messaging as your content helps customers at each stage in your funnel. (Or any part of your go-to-market strategy, for that matter).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps as you apply this marketing strategy to your startup, you’ll grow even faster than Decibite

Tone-deaf and broke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because even if you look at it purely from an engagement standpoint, <strong>getting it wrong at the top of the funnel is worse than getting it wrong at the point of sale.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.themarketingblender.com/statistics-every-b2b-company-know-boost-sales/\">MarketingBlender</a>, 73% of consumers report feeling frustrated when your website offers content that has nothing to do with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know what frustrated consumers do? They go somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not buying right away is one thing. Writing you off completely is another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a relevant landing page experience sounds easy-ish, but customers are picky as hell.&#160; “Nothing to do with them” is more nuanced than you might think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem isn&#8217;t that you’re offering something completely out of pocket. The problem is giving them information that doesn&#8217;t match their level of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What “Problem-Aware” really means</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you’re a first-time homeowner with a raccoon problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are almost positive you’ve seen them in your garage. They freak you out and you want them gone…but you don’t really know the extent of the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know next to nothing about raccoons. You don&#8217;t know if they bite or scratch or spit freaky raccoon acid. You don&#8217;t know if there’s something in your garage that could be attracting them.&#160; You don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re stealing your tools and you don&#8217;t even know if your cats are safe from their weird racoon hand-paws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You would definitely like a way to get rid of them, but you really want to know what the hell you&#8217;re dealing with.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are problem aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CNd9OiiRZ5eHq0sJUhy99xlYLTyZZ3c2jiG_BHdxX5jfynl3sa-TRaOXqW0AMFAM4IowzFk4ohZJQtx3IUqIBFLn50lRgmeqVic_mZfRm1l6akFEMa8bFc6Zqz_ba4OARYLJ2cKq\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In his copywriting classic Breakthrough Advertising, Eugene Schwartz identifies <a href=\"https://www.copyengineer.com/post_five_levels_customer_awareness/\">the five levels of customer awareness</a>, with problem-aware (just above unaware) described as this:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Problem aware prospects know they have a problem, and have some idea of what that problem is, but they may not completely understand it. They haven&#8217;t dealt with this problem before. They&#8217;re totally unfamiliar with possible solutions.”</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though your prospect knows he/she has a problem, chances are they don&#8217;t fully understand it. They&#8217;ve never had to deal with this before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors of your problem-aware landing page are relatively cold. They&#8217;re experiencing the pain of their problem and they don&#8217;t know anything about solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would they like one? Sure. But first they need someone who understands what they&#8217;re going through.&#160; The problem-aware landing page is where you set the tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of ways to analyze your prospect’s situation and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.widerfunnel.com/lift-model/\">Wider Funnel’s LIFT Model</a> does a good job showing you all that goes into the value proposition when a prospect first comes into contact, but in my opinion it doesn&#8217;t show the whole story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why I prefer the Hero’s Journey.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storybrand.com/\">Donald Miller</a> lays out the Hero’s Journey like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1_CPF8sAM0SH2SpHl6gsQsEMUO3ExyZe7xWTuFqrp9UlF7Vd0tKWmdhs3ChN4mTPDxnQEbtnqhtUdODiEk1u9wXyvRt3oAMLMGLPFP2k2yYnHr5EpSSKjbhbAcapRrEM2rEMz-fc\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hero (your prospect) has a problem, and even though they don&#8217;t know you, something (ad copy, search results, a well-placed referral link) is hinting that you may be able to point them in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your chance to enter the story, but remember — your prospect is at the beginning of their journey. It&#8217;s still relatively easy for them to “try out” different guides. Whether that&#8217;s you or someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can you make sure your problem-aware landing page shows that you understand the problem?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you show that you are worth your prospect’s trust?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy. A whole heaping amount of empathy.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working Empathy into Your Problem-Aware Landing Page</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Googs, empathy is <em>the ability to understand and share the feelings of another</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier said than done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because here&#8217;s the tricky thing about landing pages nowadays: they usually check all the boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Clear, benefit-driven copy</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Key elements above the fold</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Intuitive user design</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see whether or not you’re “optimized” for problem-aware visitors, you have to dig a little deeper. You have to look beyond <a href=\"https://usabilityhub.com/guides/five-second-testing\">the 5-second test</a> and ask yourself if you’ve appropriately positioned yourself as the helpful guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you do that, let&#8217;s look at a few common pitfalls that stop well-meaning copywriters, marketers, and business owners in their well-meaning tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pitfall #1: Misplacing the source of the pain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your problem-aware visitor might not have a full grasp of their problem, but it&#8217;s usually not due to complexity. It’s usually because they haven’t fully considered their situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes they aren&#8217;t even aware of what the real problem is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good opportunity for you to guide them, right? Absolutely. Except when you aren&#8217;t clear on what the real problem is either.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Tego. A location-tracking mobile app to help make sure friends get home safely.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SimrB_Vh6BbxeVLBmvhKBmZAr8bcM9neY04dZ0wSPPk-5le55GMkVCWuBEXkNaqQn3Ypk64MniPvleRfgmj5hVquFNET3kBY2ALn-g5GhkFecHFZ9QwfDWxjIOUX2H8vd7ibGOSz\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see what problem they are trying to solve: Not knowing whether your sweetheart made it home safely after a long night of “studying.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is that the real problem? Is there really no easy way to know if your friend got home safely?&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would argue there already is &#8211; a text message works just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that text message is connected to the real problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We always say “text me when you get home” but our friends never remember to do so. And if something were to happen, you would never know. (Are they gonna text you if they’re kidnapped? Not likely.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real problem is the drunk (I mean, over-studied) person <em>following through</em> and remembering to text their friends that they got home &#8211; a common situation that many college kids could relate to… and would probably consider a problem that they’d like solved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a problem-aware visitor, it’s easier to see the value when the problem references a specific situation, rather than a generic framing of a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If your prospect doesn&#8217;t fully appreciate the problem in the context of their own experience, they won&#8217;t have any motivation to search out a solution.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tego could address the real problem more accurately with a headline like:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Because You Can Do Better Than “Text me when you get home”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Don&#8217;t Leave Your Friend’s Life in the Hands of a Text Message</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does focusing on a specific aspect show a deeper understanding, it then becomes&#160; more of a priority in your prospect’s head.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads us to the second pitfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pitfall #2: Focusing on the surface-level problem&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Folks with problems don&#8217;t always know why they have problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, most of the problems that drive us to look for solutions aren&#8217;t problems at all. They are symptoms of the real causes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like framing customer problems into two types: internal and external.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>External Problems</strong> = Symptoms. Things that we Google solutions for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Internal problems</strong> = Causes. Things we don&#8217;t tell anyone due to shame, embarrassment, unawareness or complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:32% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talia-wolf-emotion-sells.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26664\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talia-wolf-emotion-sells.jpeg?w=225&#38;ssl=1 225w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talia-wolf-emotion-sells.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Not sure how to find external vs internal problems? </strong>Check out <a href=\"https://getuplift.co/cro-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Emotion Sells by Talia Wolf</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Problem-aware visitors might truly believe that the problems they are Googling are the reason they are looking for relief. But most (if not all) of the time, they&#8217;re driven by something deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the copywriter, you have to go deeper too.

Oh, also I wanna align with a brand that represents me as a worldly, conscious traveler. Preferably one that wants to support local initiatives and cares about using artisanal methods, rather than big factory production. Bonus points for funky patterns and extra-zippy zippers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would their prospects be able to tell you that right off the bat? Probably not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would they even agree that they want all of that if suggested to them? Probably not.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s your responsibility to dig into BOTH these external and internal drivers. (Hey, <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2018/05/how-to-listen/\">customer research</a>, you sexy beast.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get their head nodding by addressing an external symptom, and then back that up with an internal problem to show how much you understand their plight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re down for a three minute halftime speech, here&#8217;s a video where I break down internal and external problems a bit further.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"extvsint\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/373319989?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hitting them both is huge for you and your problem-aware landing page visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a couple of examples that nail it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I8FKXNteftp3asXgi9EF9-LhmJsdWKm1rayiCpy97wwC8DDiPm95pqGWW59pu4H0Cv6tzDz6j-ch_cZT_Puqf4_XogMg7fbAqGXeQ0IhwjwU-TghGJfYCaf24z3DaN0VHJDIpB-U\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>External problem</strong> &#8211; “I want to get better at drawing and painting.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Internal problem</strong> &#8211; “ I&#8217;ve always looked up to artists, and I want to become one myself.

I want to become an artist rather than just a fan or observer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See how this distinction creates a deeper level of empathy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Touching on those internal problems just shows that you <em>get it</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You aren&#8217;t just offering a product or solution.

I waste so much time going through folders, renaming files, and clicking around while I should be focusing on client work so I can make more money.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.eagle.cool/\">Eagle</a> shows an understanding that even its audience might not get about themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They realize that disorganization is the reason so many designers get frustrated and unhappy. They dig into the internal problem &#8211; the real cause driving them to look for a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a problem-aware landing page visitor, this tells me that they are designers too, not just some smart dudes who built a product. They&#8217;ve been through it, and they know what their audience needs to finally find relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the real source of pain and addressing both internal and external problems will solve a lot of your problem-aware landing page issues. But there&#8217;s one more pitfall that copywriters should always steer clear from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pitfall #3: Forgetting the emotion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.paulekman.com/\">Paul Ekman</a>, psychologist and co-discoverer of micro expressions, there are six basic emotions that every human in the world shares:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Happiness</li><li>Sadness</li><li>Anger</li><li>Fear</li><li>Surprise</li><li>Disgust</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason emotion is so powerful in copywriting is because every reader has his/her own frame of reference for a given situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of copywriters misconstrue <a href=\"https://anaandjelic.typepad.com/files/attention-web-designers-2.pdf\">the 5 second rule</a> as <em>“Since I have to quickly show that I&#8217;m valuable, I better explain exactly what we do right away.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Landing pages that breeze over the problem, completely minimizing the emotion and human element that is driving the audience to search for a solution in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this relatively standard SaaS landing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UXOtPNUmU4jY4_xGlYtffjg8PMHfxoSnXSWAK8uncmLs1ltEXcmNjqFaM21yZ8dxAFKrwHTFtLHUxVGGLLRu75VC29D2jNBCWlG5xTummEJSpvhR3E82srvuvYea1ab1rl3TZs2b\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no doubt that <a href=\"https://nurturelabs.co\">Nurture Labs</a> is solving a very important problem. But <em>they don&#8217;t sound very convinced</em>. Moreover, they don&#8217;t sound very in tune with what&#8217;s actually going on in their prospects’ lives. If they are, in fact, in tune, why not show it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s analyze it a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem they are solving is this: scaling is hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok fine. But they aren&#8217;t really showing prospects that <em>they understand </em>that scaling is <em>really</em> hard.&#160; There&#8217;s a lot that goes into it. Like, having to sacrifice time with your family, relationships and often money out of your own pocket just to see your baby flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the emotion that goes behind the problem is completely ignored upon first glance of this landing page. Fear, happiness, excitement, anguish. All emotions that, if I were able to feel them as a problem-aware landing page visitor, would instantly bring me closer to the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember: </strong>At this stage they aren&#8217;t necessarily looking for a solution. They are looking for someone who feels their pain &#8211; someone who can really talk to the problems and emotions they&#8217;re having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I were Nurture Labs, I would ask myself things like “what are the potential implications if an entrepreneur isn&#8217;t able to scale?” and “what problems in their lives are actually causing the scaling problem?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would lead me to copy (and a more appropriate CTA) that better targets prospects’s pains.&#160; Ideas like:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Need to free up your time and energy?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Is a slow pipeline preventing you from scaling?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Have you maxed out your resources?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Do you not know where to go from here?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However you put it, you need to dig into the real life issue behind the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean you have to use a lot of time or copy to marinate on the problem. You can speed up this connection by using emotion. Take this great landing page from <a href=\"https://www.ourbus.com/\">Ourbus.com</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Sm1fcX4uLXBj9DqmaxJtAunAO3yTPsUSxEhE5PflExsjBLPMPeupGVFCWXY4b4iCOB_C8ceL5Tis6iBdnHsRFC91zWBqk56ya-EWdMj4RNW9dYHBs55yycfwmh4pAXlD6k3_mKxr\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>External Problem</strong> &#8211; I want to take a trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Internal Problem</strong> &#8211; I miss my friends and I don&#8217;t want to be alone at Thanksgiving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than leading with “cheap bus rides anywhere in the country,” which would minimize the problem, they dig into the internal problem and the emotions surrounding it: the human desire for friendship and social contact. It also amplifies the ramifications of not finding relief to the problem. (You&#8217;ll be eating a turkey dinner for one.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skipping over the emotion is a fast way to make yourself replaceable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Coming to terms with your problem-aware landing page</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage, your prospect isn’t looking for you to tell them what they should understand about your solution. They are looking to be understood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the customer journey you will have time to show your capabilities and expertise. Right now you need to marinate in the pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your prospect needs to know that you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No amount of clever copywriting can substitute for deep customer research. Dig into the hopes, dreams, fears and limitations of your prospects. <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/join-the-conversation-customer/\">Tune in to the conversations already happening</a> in their minds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can get your prospects head-nodding at this stage, the all-important transaction of monies will be much easier and more fluid down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy writing y&#8217;all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And beware of those pesky raccoons.

Many of them are design, but <a href=\"https://conversionxl.com/blog/first-impressions-matter-the-importance-of-great-visual-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your copy also plays a part</a>.</p>\n<p>If we consider that <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most users leave a web page in the first 10 to 20 seconds</a>, the implications become quite clear. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;To gain several minutes of user attention, you must clearly communicate your value proposition within 10 seconds.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The necessity for a clear value prop in your hero section isn&#8217;t news.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to ensure your copy is making the right first impression: copy validation</strong></h2>\n<p>Usability analyst Craig Tomlin <a href=\"http://www.usefulusability.com/5-second-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suggests</a>&#160;that there are three pieces of critical information a new visitor should be able to answer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are you?</li>\n<li>What product/service do you provide?</li>\n<li>What’s in it for me?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Likewise, Peep Laja of ConversionXL <a href=\"https://conversionxl.com/blog/5-second-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suggests</a>&#160;that your first impression should communicate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where the visitor is</li>\n<li>What they can do there</li>\n<li>Why they should do it</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://conversionxl.com/blog/first-impressions-matter-the-importance-of-great-visual-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As well as</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your brand personality (chic, silly, sexy, savvy, smart, classic, etc.), and</li>\n<li>Your differentiating factor (what makes you different from the competition)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, where does the five second test fit into all of this?</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2659918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his book</a>&#160;The UX Five-Second Rules, Paul Doncaster says the advantages of the five-second&#160;testing method include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed</li>\n<li>Efficiency</li>\n<li>Portability</li>\n<li>Flexibility</li>\n<li>Simplicity</li>\n<li>Convenience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Those advantages were music to my ears the first time I read them.)</p>\n<p>And while Doncaster <a href=\"https://uxpod.com/designing-good-five-second-tests-an-interview-with-paul-doncaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notes</a>&#160;that the original reason for&#160;this test was to simply confirm that the purpose of a content page was obvious, this testing form can also be used for bigger, more critical website components.</p>\n<p>Like the hero shot of your homepage.</p>\n<p>And he notes that, because we&#8217;re testing an &#8220;in the moment&#8221; response, you don&#8217;t need to have access to a bunch of existing customers with prior knowledge of the product or service you&#8217;re selling. It&#8217;s all about visual perception and short-term memory.</p>\n<p>So, given what we know about the seemingly uncontrollable snap judgments our brain makes on our behalf that influence our behaviors and decisions, the five second&#160;test simply&#160;<a href=\"https://usabilityhub.com/guides/five-second-testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provides an opportunity</a>&#160;to receive feedback on the information a viewer is gathering during those first critical moments.</p>\n<p><strong>And I repeat: you don&#8217;t need to be a user testing expert to start running these tests.</strong></p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the five second&#160;test is a type of survey methodology&#160;&#8211; you&#8217;re going to be asking questions and gathering responses.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not so hard, right?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s basically like a really teeny tiny version of a <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/how-to-master-customer-interviews/\">customer interview</a>. But with anonymous strangers.&#160;And copy that&#8217;s in development.</p>\n<p><strong>But here&#8217;s the thing:</strong></p>\n<p>Just because you&#8217;re sending your copy out into the wild for validation&#160;does not mean it has to be &#8220;ready&#8221; or &#8220;perfect.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(Heck. It doesn&#8217;t even have to be done.)</p>\n<p>This is about innovation. And it&#8217;s about trying to solve problems (hopefully without creating new ones).</p>\n<p>So pull out that long list of value prop options, and choose a few standouts to test. Because we&#8217;re going to use an <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-iteration-brings-powerful-results-so-do-it-again-designer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iterative design process</a>&#160;to quickly gather feedback and continue writing.</p>\n<p><strong>The goal here is to improve through iteration&#8230; </strong><strong>n</strong><strong>ot just document all of its flaws</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t get hung up on perfection.</p>\n<p>(And, yes. I realize that is so much easier said than done. This is why you&#8217;re going to see some of my less-than-perfect tests below. Hi, my name is Carolyn and I&#8217;m getting comfortable being vulnerable.)</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24812\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image5.gif?resize=441%2C231&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image5\" width=\"441\" height=\"231\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>(If Kate Winslet can admit it, I&#160;can too.)</p>\n<p>But, as with other testing methods, this test has limitations.</p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;When all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.&#8221;</strong></h3>\n<p>Five second tests aren&#8217;t always the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>Similar to the way we form a first impression when we see a human face, in a five second&#160;span we are able to take in a lot of information&#8230; but may not necessarily be able to make sense of it. As Doncaster&#160;writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;A participant may take in a lot of information perceptually, but likely does not have time to make much sense of it as a whole entity, resulting in feedback that is limited in scope.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>In understanding the limits of a five-second test, you&#8217;ll be able to set up a test that effectively supports your learning goals.</p>\n<p>A five second&#160;test can&#8217;t tell you everything.</p>\n<p>And though this is perhaps obvious, it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://uxpod.com/designing-good-five-second-tests-an-interview-with-paul-doncaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not the right tool to choose</a>&#160;when the question you&#8217;re trying to answer requires more than five seconds of thought or consideration.</p>\n<p><em>Hint: This means that body copy is not a good fit for this method of testing.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Where the five second test fits in your R&#38;D tool belt</strong></h3>\n<p>Conversion copywriters, this is where it gets particular important for you.</p>\n<p>Five second&#160;tests are a great tool to add to your research-and-discovery tool belt for the simple fact that they allow you to <a href=\"https://data36.com/five-second-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">focus on the first touchpoints</a>&#160;between your copy and your audience.</p>\n<p>And, as data analyst Tomi Mester notes in the article linked above, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that <strong>you&#8217;re not looking for statistically significant results here.</strong>&#160;You&#8217;re looking for insights that can help you form an educated guess. And steer you away from bad ideas dressed in sheep&#8217;s clothing.</p>\n<p>And while Doncaster notes that homepages were originally &#8220;off limits&#8221; for this testing method, I would argue that because we&#8217;re testing an &#8220;in the moment&#8221; response, homepage hero shots and value props are ideally suited to this type of testing. Because this portion of your website is so critical to a visitor’s&#160;first impression of a website &#8211; and by extension of the company.&#160;Not to mention the success of the overall website as a whole.</p>\n<p>So the five second&#160;test becomes an opportunity to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Settle an internal bar where you have a team or internal stakeholders that have strong opinions about which approach they think is best</li>\n<li>Gather intel about how clearly your copy is communicating an aspect of your desired message</li>\n<li>Check the memorability of said message</li>\n<li>Check the clarity of said message</li>\n<li>And help guide your selection between value prop versions&#160;to begin validating before your copy goes live (or even graces your client&#8217;s desk)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sure. You could wait to run A/B tests on your live copy (if traffic and conversion rate&#160;allow).</p>\n<p>But why start with an experiment, with all its costs and risks, when you can first validate? Once you’ve validated a message, THEN split-test it.</p>\n<p>The five second&#160;test offers immediate feedback and <strong>a chance to ditch poor performers &#8211; and test variations that may tank &#8211; before they cost you</strong><strong>&#160;</strong><strong>leads or sales.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>How To Set Up Your Five Second Test So You Know Your Copy Is More Likely to Work</strong></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the step-by-step approach that I, a conversion copywriter who relies heavily on data and has run dozens of these tests, use when running 5-second tests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select copy for testing</li>\n<li>Define testing goals</li>\n<li>Select the right 5&#160;second test format</li>\n<li>Write the test</li>\n<li>Run the test</li>\n<li>Process the results</li>\n<li>Determine next steps</li>\n<li>Rinse and repeat (as necessary)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now assuming you’re interested in running tests like these, here’s a breakdown of what to do at each step.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Select your copy for testing</strong></h3>\n<p>For the purposes of ensuring a good first impression, you&#8217;ll want to choose copy placed at first touchpoints between you and your reader.</p>\n<p>Me? I use this method primarily for testing homepage value prop copy.</p>\n<p>While first impressions come from more than just headline copy, it&#8217;s already been noted <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2013/02/your-most-overlooked-home-page-opportunity/\">here</a>&#160;on Copyhackers that your value proposition is second only in importance to the visitor’s motivation for landing on your site in the first place.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, it makes sense to test the clarity of your value prop&#8217;s first impression within the context of the hero shot.</p>\n<p>As Joanna&#160;<a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2013/04/usp-value-proposition/\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Visitors to your site need to be told what’s unique or different about you that they’d really like.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>With our gauge on likeability beginning to form during those first few milliseconds, ensuring the clarity of your homepage copy messaging (which is likely to be a version of your value prop) becomes all the more critical.</p>\n<p>Because here&#8217;s the thing:</p>\n<p>Ensuring that your value prop is making a good first impression will <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2013/02/seo-agency-case-study-why-should-prospects-choose-you/\">improve your chances for success</a>&#160;(i.e., reducing bounce).</p>\n<p><strong>Running a </strong><strong>series of </strong><strong>five second tests helped me write this homepage hero copy</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong><img class=\"wp-image-24826\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"7 Consulting by Hart live\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?w=1340&#38;ssl=1 1340w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?resize=150%2C73&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?resize=300%2C145&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?resize=768%2C372&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?resize=800%2C387&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?resize=990%2C479&#38;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-Consulting-by-Hart-live.png?resize=1320%2C639&#38;ssl=1 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The results? </strong><strong>A 63.51%</strong><strong>&#160;drop in page bounces.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember: good first impression = improved chances for success.</p>\n<p><strong>Other&#160;&#8220;First Impression&#8221;&#160;Copy Elements You Could Try Testing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Landing page headlines</li>\n<li>Sales page headlines</li>\n<li>Any other headline you might be working on</li>\n<li>Facebook ads</li>\n<li>Instagram ads</li>\n<li>Adwords ads</li>\n<li>Email subject lines</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Define your testing goals</strong></h3>\n<p>In the wise words of Lewis Carroll:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“If you don&#8217;t know where you are going, any road will get you there.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, if you don&#8217;t clearly define why you&#8217;re testing and what you&#8217;re hoping to learn, it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll gather the results you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p>(More importantly, you risk wasting time and money.)</p>\n<p>In the context of making a good first impression, you&#8217;ll most likely be defining your testing goals as one of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is my value prop memorable?</li>\n<li>Is my value prop clear?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Tip: If you&#8217;re stuck on defining a testing goal, look to the </em><em><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2013/04/usp-value-proposition/\">5 critical points of a USP</a></em><em>&#160;and </em><em><a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2013/09/writing-powerful-headlines/\">headline scorecard</a></em><em>. Your low-scoring criteria becomes low-hanging fruit for testing.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Select the right five second test format</strong></h3>\n<p>Based on your defined testing goal, you&#8217;ll select a test type.</p>\n<p>Doncaster outlines the following four test formats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Memory dump test (i.e., what is most remembered overall)</li>\n<li>Target identification test (i.e., what is most remembered about a specific visual target)</li>\n<li>Attitudinal test (i.e., perceived appeal, quality and/or usefulness)</li>\n<li>&#8220;Mixed&#8221; test (i.e., combining aspects of the previously mentioned types of tests)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24807\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Four-five-second-tests-Copyhackers.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Four five second tests Copyhackers\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Four-five-second-tests-Copyhackers.png?w=940&#38;ssl=1 940w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Four-five-second-tests-Copyhackers.png?resize=150%2C126&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Four-five-second-tests-Copyhackers.png?resize=300%2C251&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Four-five-second-tests-Copyhackers.png?resize=768%2C644&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Four-five-second-tests-Copyhackers.png?resize=800%2C671&#38;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Could your five second&#160;test succeed without defining a test type? Maybe.</p>\n<p>But in doing so, you largely leave the results of your test up to chance.</p>\n<p>Defining your test format not only helps you more clearly align your learning goals with your results, but&#160;it also helps you write a better test.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to overthink this. Here are some guidelines to help you choose your test format:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Want to gain insights about the memorability of your value prop? Choose memory dump.</li>\n<li>Want to gain insights about the clarity of your value prop? Choose memory dump or target ID.</li>\n<li>Want to gain insights about the emotional response you&#8217;re eliciting? Choose attitudinal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice I didn&#8217;t mention the &#8220;mixed&#8221; test. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>As Doncaster notes, it&#8217;s simply more difficult to create a solid &#8220;mixed&#8221; test and, by default, more difficult to gather useful insights.</p>\n<p>Not impossible. But more difficult.</p>\n<p>So in the interest of saving budget and working to eliminate non-responses, your best bet is always to stay within one test format. With that in mind, your rule of thumb should be:</p>\n<p>One goal = one test format</p>\n<h3>4. Write your test</h3>\n<p>Just so you know, this is where most five second&#160;tests fail.</p>\n<p>There are two critical written components to your test (aside from the copy you&#8217;ll be testing):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your welcome screen</li>\n<li>Your test questions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Doncaster&#8217;s book sets forth his testing rules based on the analysis of over 300 public online five second&#160;tests.&#160;Of the eight &#8220;violations&#8221; listed, five of them were concerned with the writing of the test.</p>\n<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you write:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Your welcome screen: keep it simple</strong></h4>\n<p>This is the screen that your test participant will see immediately before viewing your test image. It&#8217;s at this point that you&#8217;re setting the stage for what&#8217;s to follow.</p>\n<p>While this is certainly an important moment in your participant&#8217;s journey through your test, you can (and should) keep this simple.</p>\n<p>Just like your value prop,<strong>&#160;your instructions should be clear, concise and specific.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Here are some examples pulled from&#160;Doncaster’s rules, organized by test format:</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Memory Dump Test Welcome Screen:</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;You will have 5 s to view the [image]. After, you&#8217;ll be asked a few short questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see a screen for 5 s. Try to remember as much as you can about what you see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Or, the basic UsabilityHub.com welcome screen message:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look at the interface for 5 seconds and remember as much as you can.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24820 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image6\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png?w=493&#38;ssl=1 493w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png?resize=150%2C73&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png?resize=300%2C146&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong><em>&#160;At the time of writing, UsabilityHub.com (my chosen five second test tool) limits custom welcome screens to researchers with a paid monthly membership.&#160;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sample Attitudinal Test Welcome Screen:</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;You will have 5 s to view the [image]. After, you&#8217;ll be asked a few short questions about your reaction to the [image/design/message].&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see a screen for 5 s. Pay attention to the general appeal of the [image/design/message].&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;After viewing the [image/design/message] for 5 s, you&#8217;ll be asked about your opinions on its look and feel.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Target Identification Test Welcome Screen:</strong></p>\n<p>If you are planning to only ask questions about one element among an image with many elements:</p>\n<p>&#8220;You will have 5 s to view the [image]. After, you&#8217;ll be asked a few short questions about the [specific target being assessed].&#8221;</p>\n<p>That said, if you&#8217;re hoping to understand whether the specific target is easily identifiable within the full design:</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see a screen for 5 s. Pay close attention to the [image/design/message].&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;After viewing the [image/design/message] for 5 s, you&#8217;ll be asked about your opinions on its look and feel.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>A word of warning:</strong></p>\n<p>Be careful that the information provided on the welcome screen doesn&#8217;t prime your users&#8217; responses.</p>\n<p>For example, if your welcome screen reads:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine you&#8217;re assessing companies that provide house cleaning services. You&#8217;ll see a screen for 5 s. Try to remember as much as you can about what you see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And then your first question reads:</p>\n<p>Q1. What service does this company provide?</p>\n<p>Well, you&#8217;ve primed the users response by tipping them off about what they&#8217;re about to see in the instructions. In turn, this will bias your results and waste the moment when your user&#8217;s memory is most clear. So don’t do that.</p>\n<p>And on the topic of writing questions:</p>\n<h4><strong>2. When it comes to your test questions, less is more</strong></h4>\n<p>First things first: there&#8217;s no magic number for how many&#160;questions you ask.</p>\n<p>That said, in the case of five-second tests, less is more.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/forgetting.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trace decay theory</a>&#160;helps to explain the memory fade taking place in your participant&#8217;s short-term memory bank. Simply put, unless the information being transmitted is rehearsed, the short-term memory can only hold that information for 15 to 30 seconds&#160;before it begins to decay and fade away.</p>\n<p>With this in mind. it&#8217;s best to ask the least number of questions possible to answer your research question and satisfy your learning goal. The original test questions used by <a href=\"https://articles.uie.com/five_second_test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perfetti</a>&#160;included only two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recall as much as you can remember about the design.</li>\n<li>What is the purpose of the page?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In his book, Doncaster notes that of the 300+ tests he analyzed, 80% asked three or more questions. While most five second&#160;test tools cap out at five questions, know that you don&#8217;t need to max out your question capacity.</p>\n<p>Doncaster makes a strong case for the &#8220;less is more&#8221; approach:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;In five-second tests, the acts of reading, understanding, and responding to questions place additional burden on the cognitive process in play, which contribute further to memory fade.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Only ask what needs to be asked to satisfy your learning goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned: It&#8217;s not just about the number of questions, it&#8217;s also about their order</strong></p>\n<p>The final questions on your five second&#160;tests are like the (questionable) leftovers in the back of your fridge: A little fuzzy and likely to elicit an &#8220;I dunno&#8221; response. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f937-1f3fb-200d-2640-fe0f.png\" alt=\"🤷🏻‍♀️\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24819\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image7.gif?ssl=1\" alt=\"image7\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h.aho6p8tmm4sl\"><strong>We&#8217;re going to look at one of my very early five second tests.</strong></h3>\n<p>My goal was to improve the clarity of communicating <a href=\"https://www.consultingbyhart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consulting by Hart</a>&#8216;s services.</p>\n<p>One of the issues with the existing copy that we identified during the initial project scope was that visitors couldn&#8217;t clearly identify the intended audience. As in, when it came to answering the question “Am I in the right place?” visitors may not confidently answer “yes.” The five second&#160;test run on the control hero shot&#160;helped us confirm this.</p>\n<p>Here’s the control hero shot:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24825 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-11.50.30-AM.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019 11 26 at 11.50.30 AM\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-11.50.30-AM.png?w=931&#38;ssl=1 931w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-11.50.30-AM.png?resize=150%2C73&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-11.50.30-AM.png?resize=300%2C145&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-11.50.30-AM.png?resize=768%2C371&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-11.50.30-AM.png?resize=800%2C387&#38;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>We started by asking them this question: “What do you remember about the site?”</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a look at the results to Q1:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24817 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image8\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png?w=958&#38;ssl=1 958w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png?resize=150%2C76&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png?resize=300%2C153&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png?resize=768%2C390&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png?resize=800%2C407&#38;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>My goal was to shine a&#160;spotlight on the services provided.</p>\n<p>My original question order for this series of tests was:</p>\n<p><em>Q1. What do you remember about the site?</em></p>\n<p><em>Q2. What can you do on this site?</em></p>\n<p><em>Q3. Who is this site for?</em></p>\n<p><em>Q4. What is the name of their business?&#160;</em></p>\n<p>Notice any issues here?</p>\n<p>For starters, Q4 doesn&#8217;t tie to the testing goal.</p>\n<p>I also learned, through the gathered responses, that Q3 was open to misinterpretation. Some of the respondents interpreted this particular question as meaning &#8220;Who is this site representing?&#8221; or &#8220;Who is the company that this site is for?&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>But the biggest issue?</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the most specific questions were asked at the <em>end</em>&#160;of the test. While the end results gathered were still promising (60% of the participants identified the name of their business correctly), this did leave my test with an increased vulnerability to participant non-responses.</p>\n<p><strong>Your solution:</strong>&#160;Ask the questions requiring the most specific memory recall first.</p>\n<p>Your participants’&#160;memories&#160;will be most clear immediately after your testing image disappears. From there, your participants’&#160;short-term memories&#160;will begin to fade.</p>\n<p>Doncaster dubbed this the &#8220;reverse-Polaroid effect&#8221; and noted that writing with this effect in mind helps you combat the &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; responses.</p>\n<p>If I were to do-over this test today I would rewrite&#160;those questions to look something like this:</p>\n<p><em>Q1. What is the service or product this company provides?</em></p>\n<p><em>Q2. What else do you remember about the image?</em></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>Because the goal was to improve the clarity of the offer, I&#8217;ve removed all of the questions that do not specifically tie back to that goal.</p>\n<p>And because the test is structured in a memory dump format, you&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;ve now re-ordered the remaining questions according to specificity. This allows me to capitalize on the test taker&#8217;s memory when it&#8217;s strongest.</p>\n<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve tweaked the wording of these questions to make my ask&#160;a little clearer. And adding the &#8220;else&#8221; in Q2 allows the participant to dump anything else they felt was memorable.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>&#160;Think carefully about the questions you ask and the order in which you ask them. Order questions from most specific to least specific.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Run the test</strong></h2>\n<p>You&#8217;re done the pre-work. Now it&#8217;s time to unleash your test on the public!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the step-by-step method to follow:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Load-in your test</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, you&#8217;ll need to choose your </strong><strong>five second</strong><strong>&#160;testing tool.</strong></p>\n<p>I like <a href=\"https://usabilityhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UsabilityHub.com</a>&#160;because&#160;it allows you to pay a small fee for platform-recruited test-takers. Meaning you don&#8217;t have to bug your friends, family, mom or colleagues to take your test.</p>\n<p>(It&#8217;s free to bring your own participants to your UsabilityHub test, but it still doesn&#8217;t open up the option to write your own instruction screen.)</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re bringing your own participants, you may want to consider&#160;<a href=\"https://userbob.com/tools/5sec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UserBob</a>. It allows you to set up a test with a custom instruction screen and then pushes your test taker toward your chosen survey tool (like Typeform).</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned: Choose your visual context carefully</strong></p>\n<p>You have a couple of choices&#160;when it comes to presenting your copy to your test takers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Test copy on a blank screen</li>\n<li>Test copy in a wireframe</li>\n<li>Test copy by editing copy on the existing site using <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-editor/gjhhlkjfglilanfckcmnjdhpapdmiijk?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an editor extension</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>(We&#8217;re going back to one of my first wireframed tests. I&#8217;m sweating.)</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, my goal on this project was to improve the clarity of the services my client provided.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s that wireframed copy:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24810 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image9.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image9\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image9.png?w=611&#38;ssl=1 611w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image9.png?resize=150%2C76&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image9.png?resize=300%2C152&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>And here are some of the lacklustre answers I received to the first question:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24814 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image10\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png?w=587&#38;ssl=1 587w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png?resize=150%2C79&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png?resize=300%2C158&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Highlights include:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The first thing was the big giant &#8220;X&#8221; going through the page.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s shaped like an envelope.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not exactly the great-first-impression-confirming insights I was hoping for. Womp, womp.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t that the answers as a whole were completely unusable, but it became immediately apparent that my very lo-fi wireframe spoiled the results.</p>\n<p><strong>The solution:&#160;</strong>Test your copy in a visual context that isn&#8217;t going to distract your participants.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing:</p>\n<p>Those spoiled results were entirely my fault. And I knew it as soon as they landed in my inbox.&#160;So I went back to the drawing board to try again. This time I tested my copy in a wireframe that actually resembled a website:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24816 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image11\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?w=761&#38;ssl=1 761w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?resize=300%2C168&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?resize=470%2C264&#38;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?resize=640%2C360&#38;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?resize=215%2C120&#38;ssl=1 215w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image11.png?resize=414%2C232&#38;ssl=1 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>And the resulting answers were decidedly more focused:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24803 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image12.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image12\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image12.png?w=687&#38;ssl=1 687w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image12.png?resize=150%2C74&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image12.png?resize=300%2C148&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, improving the visual context for&#160;the copy improved the overall quality of the answers I received from participants.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:&#160;</strong>Choose your visual context with care. I like running tests on my copy in context because that&#8217;s how a new visitor will actually experience it. If you decide to run your wireframes, make sure they look as much like a website as possible.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Set your audience demographics</strong></h4>\n<p>This step is only required if your testing tool will recruit participants on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Your gut will&#160;tell you to narrow down the participant demographics as much as possible. The <a href=\"https://userbrain.net/blog/demographic-targeting-will-hurt-usability-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">common thinking</a>&#160;here is that you&#8217;ll receive more qualified feedback if you set your demographic filters to match your target audience.</p>\n<p>Stop. Do not pass go. Do not collect $100.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24827\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image13.gif?resize=324%2C182&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image13\" width=\"324\" height=\"182\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Yes,&#160;<a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/how-to-validate-your-copy/\">validating your copy</a>&#160;with your market is important.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog/demographics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this isn&#8217;t the time</a>&#160;for that.</p>\n<p>This is about first impressions. Is the message clear? Is the message memorable?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need your testing participants to be carbon copies of your one reader. You just need them living in the same (figurative) neighborhood. Why? Because <a href=\"http://www.usefulusability.com/demographics-usability-test-recruiting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most demographic data</a>&#160;doesn&#8217;t help you understand your typical visitor&#8217;s behavior.</p>\n<p>Within your testing dashboard you&#8217;re likely to see at least some of the following options to filter your audience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language</li>\n<li>Viewing device</li>\n<li>Country</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Age range</li>\n<li>Education level</li>\n<li>Employment status</li>\n<li>Annual household income</li>\n<li>Technical proficiency</li>\n<li>Daily hours online</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of these options, I focus first on behavioral indicators, like education level, employment status, technical proficiency and daily hours online.</p>\n<p>I also set the viewing device filter. This helps ensure that the participant is viewing my image in the correct visual context&#160;&#8211; i.e. I don&#8217;t get participants viewing a desktop hero shot image on a mobile device.</p>\n<p>Depending on the project, I might also set the language settings to English. I&#8217;ve found that this can help protect my test results from increased &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; responses from participants that might have English as a second (or third) language.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong>&#160;Skip the granular &#8220;female, aged 25-34&#8221; details and focus on big-picture behavior-driving demographics instead.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Set your audience size</strong></h4>\n<p>This was one of the biggest questions I had when I first started using this testing method in my writing process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uxpajournal.org/how-to-specify-the-participant-group-size-for-usability-studies-a-practitioners-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The jury</a>&#160;is out on the &#8220;perfect&#8221; audience size for testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virzi says 3-5</li>\n<li>Perfetti says 20</li>\n<li>Faulkner says 10</li>\n<li>Turner et al. says 7</li>\n<li>And Nielsen says 5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After reviewing the research, I think that Nielsen&#8217;s suggestion of five is the sweet spot for our purposes.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p><strong>Nielsen suggests that your first five test participants will discover over 80% of all problems.</strong></p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t get into the specifics of Nielsen and Landauer&#8217;s formula&#160;(you can find that formula as well as the their graph demonstrating diminishing returns as new participants are added <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>), but usability experts <a href=\"https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/01/how-to-determine-the-right-number-of-participants-for-usability-studies.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">do seem to agree</a>&#160;that <strong>simple tests require </strong><strong>fewer</strong><strong>&#160;test takers</strong>.</p>\n<p>Sticking with five test takers also helps you make the most of your testing budget. As Nielsen states:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter whether you test websites, intranets, PC applications, or mobile apps. With 5 users, you almost always get close to user testing&#8217;s maximum benefit-cost ratio.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Granted, this decision is based on usability studies, not studies specifically relating to copy. But the fact remains that our use of the five-second&#160;test qualifies as &#8220;simple,&#8221; so using Nielsen&#8217;s rule of thumb works.</p>\n<p>And, as Nielsen also suggests, from a cost-benefit perspective, you&#8217;re better to run plenty of small iterative tests than one large test.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve experimented with larger audience sizes, but keep coming back to five participants.</p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s why five is the magic number:</strong></p>\n<p>During my work with&#160;<a href=\"https://www.porticapro.com/#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Portica</a>, a project management tool built specifically for architects and designers, its&#160;founder mentioned how he felt they were missing the mark in effectively communicating how they differed from more widely adopted document storage solutions. They weren&#8217;t really a document storage solution, but their existing messaging didn&#8217;t clearly articulate the full scope of what it is they actually offered.</p>\n<p>I decided to double my typical testing audience size on this particular project because we were limited to only a small handful of customer interviews. That meant that my VoC data was drawn largely from <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/write-copy-amazon-review-mining/\">raw mining research</a>&#160;and founder interviews. I felt that a slightly larger audience pool might help confirm whether or not I was on the right track with their new messaging.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s round one, version one:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24809 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image14.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image14\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image14.png?w=555&#38;ssl=1 555w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image14.png?resize=150%2C81&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image14.png?resize=300%2C161&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s round one, version two:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24815 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image15.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image15\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image15.png?w=556&#38;ssl=1 556w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image15.png?resize=150%2C78&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image15.png?resize=300%2C156&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>What I found as I toggled in and out of the audience filters on my completed results surprised me.</p>\n<p>The filtered responses of smaller response pools remained consistent with the full audience results.</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Preview your test</strong></h4>\n<p>This little step can save you from wasting time and money on a faulty test.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick checklist to help you run quality assurance (QA) on your test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Welcome Screen\n<ul>\n<li>Are your welcome screen instructions clear, concise and specific?</li>\n<li>Have you unintentionally primed your test taker with leading instructions that you should revise / remove to minimize bias?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Testing Image\n<ul>\n<li>Is your testing image fully visible without scrolling?</li>\n<li>Does your testing image display your copy in a visual context that accurately represents the way in which a reader would experience it? For example, if you’re testing homepage hero copy, does your testing image resemble a hero shot??</li>\n<li>Is there anything in your testing image that has the potential to distract your test taker?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Test Questions\n<ul>\n<li>Are your questions clear, concise and specific?</li>\n<li>Are your questions in the right order for your learning goals?</li>\n<li>Have you unintentionally primed your test taker with leading questions?</li>\n<li>Are there any questions that are unnecessary in helping you satisfy your learning goal? (If so, remove them.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This step takes about a minute total to complete:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24822 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image16.gif?resize=520%2C293&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image16\" width=\"520\" height=\"293\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>But that minute&#160;can save you from wasting budget on a problematic test. Don&#8217;t skip it.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Let your test run</strong></h4>\n<p>Arguably the easiest part of the process: hit submit and wait.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve opted to have your testing tool recruit participants on your behalf, you can typically expect your complete results in the next 5 to 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>Go grab a coffee, your work here is done (for now).</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24824\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image17.gif?resize=361%2C202&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image17\" width=\"361\" height=\"202\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"h.y99dg8ks7mxi\">6. Process your five-second test results</h4>\n<p>Your results are in! It&#8217;s time to get back to work.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of different ways you can go about&#160;processing the results.</p>\n<p>While the easiest and quickest way is to review your results inside your test dashboard, I prefer to process results in a Google sheet (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13713ewp38a9LAcsKQp08CSVza4WrJCvwUiJWkkoBnC4/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you can find that template here</a>)&#160;in order to have a full picture of my control and USP iterations as I work through my projects.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24808 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image18.png?resize=538%2C319&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image18\" width=\"538\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image18.png?w=616&#38;ssl=1 616w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image18.png?resize=150%2C89&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image18.png?resize=300%2C178&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Inside that worksheet I note down my pre-work decisions, test conditions and any demographic filters placed. Once I receive my results, I begin making my notes and tallying repetitions in language used by the test users (similar to Ashley Greene&#8217;s method demonstrated during <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/user-messaging/\">this Tutorial Tuesday</a>).</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re wondering:</p>\n<h2><strong>How will I know if my results are &#8220;useful&#8221;?</strong></h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m a firm believer that you can learn from all of your results.</p>\n<p>Receiving non-responses like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember&#8221; is&#160;a signal to head back to the drawing board and try again.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you receive a set of responses that indicate you&#8217;ve achieved your goal, that also becomes useful (and handy to report back to your client).</p>\n<p>For example, watershed protection and preservation organization&#160;<a href=\"https://friendsofthemuskokawatershed.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friends of the Muskoka Watershed</a>&#160;came to me asking for snappy copy that articulated their rather complex mission and methodology in a way that is easy&#160;to&#160;understand.</p>\n<p>I first confirmed their hunch about general audience confusion during the homepage hero control five-second&#160;test (as well as audience interviews and reviewing traffic flow through Google Analytics).</p>\n<p>I then found, through various research activities, that their &#8220;science to action&#8221; methodology was particularly attractive to their target audience and was also a key differentiator between them and their competitors.</p>\n<p>From there I worked up a variety of customer-facing options and began testing.</p>\n<p>Here were the wireframe images I started with:</p>\n<p>First the &#8220;snappy&#8221; version:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24805 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image19.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image19\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image19.png?w=572&#38;ssl=1 572w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image19.png?resize=150%2C76&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image19.png?resize=300%2C151&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Followed by the longer version:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24811 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image20.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"image20\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image20.png?w=572&#38;ssl=1 572w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image20.png?resize=150%2C75&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image20.png?resize=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>What I found?</p>\n<p>Only 20% of the &#8220;snappy&#8221; version test takers understood their core mission &#8211; protecting the Muskoka watershed.</p>\n<p>Compare&#160;that&#160;to 60% of the longer version test takers.</p>\n<p>These results supported my recommendation for longer copy. And I continue to develop and test this copy as we move toward a finalized project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h.jhte0btp3lts\"><strong>7. Determine your next steps</strong></h3>\n<p>Did your shift in messaging help you achieve your learning goals?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes? Great. Move forward feeling more confident in knowing that your copy is communicating what it needs to communicate in those first five seconds of a visitor landing on the site.</li>\n<li>No? Also great! Head back to the drawing board with that intel to continue working on your value prop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use those findings to inform future iterations of your copy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h.mi8bqaiihle0\"><strong>8. Rinse and repeat those five-second tests often (and when necessary)</strong></h3>\n<p>In the wise words of Eugene Schwartz:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Copy is not written. Copy is assembled.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>An engineer wouldn&#8217;t release a new product without testing it, right? You are an engineer of words. Testing should be built into the process of assembling.</p>\n<p>As Nielsen <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;After creating the new design, you need to test again. Even though I said that the redesign should &#8220;fix&#8221; the problems found in the first study, the truth is that you think that the new design overcomes the problems. But since nobody can design the perfect user interface, there is no guarantee that the new design does in fact fix the problems.&#160;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>A second test will discover whether the fixes worked or whether they didn&#8217;t. Also, in introducing a new design, there is always the risk of introducing a new usability problem, even if the old one did get fixed.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Everywhere he says &#8220;design,&#8221; replace it with copy.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling a little like a broken record at this point, but here goes:</p>\n<p><strong>Your </strong><strong>five-second test</strong><strong>s are experiments.</strong></p>\n<p>Test early. Test often. And don&#8217;t let that perfection monster rear his ugly head!</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-24813\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image21.gif?resize=295%2C295&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image21\" width=\"295\" height=\"295\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Test your copy before you think it&#8217;s perfect.</p>\n<p>And maybe even before you think it&#8217;s &#8220;ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I typically start testing two or three customer-facing value prop options during my initial research and discovery work (before I present my <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/creating-a-messaging-recommendations-report/\">messaging recommendations report</a>),&#160;simply because it allows me to present some initial results to help guide my client in understanding why my recommendations suggest that one direction might be better than the other.</p>\n<p>And it allows me to validate what I might think of a good idea as unclear and improves my work along the way to finalized copy.</p>\n<p>The end result?</p>\n<p>Copy that is communicating key information clearly within those first critical moments of a visitor landing on a website.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://uxpod.com/designing-good-five-second-tests-an-interview-with-paul-doncaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">critical deciding factors</a>&#160;in whether or not you should test should be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you know what you want to learn?</li>\n<li>Will displaying&#160;an image, with copy, for 5 seconds help you learn this?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you answered yes to both of those questions, then you should start testing.</p>\n<h3><strong>This all sounds great. But how do I get budget approval?</strong></h3>\n<p>Easy. I build my five-second test budget into the fee for my project.</p>\n<p>This is now a non-negotiable in my writing process. So I don&#8217;t ask for permission.</p>\n<p>Of course, exact numbers depend entirely on the project in question, but with each test costing about $10 USD, I usually build a $50 to $70 internal &#8220;Five Second Test Fund&#8221; into each project.</p>\n<p>But if you want to dig in and get started right now, remember this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford.&#8221; &#8211; Jacob Nielsen</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>User testing tools aren&#8217;t just for user testing experts. To get started with improving your copy&#8217;s first impression, you just need to be ready to learn and have some copy to test.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all part of the iterative process on your way to making that great first impression.</p>\n<p><strong>Author:</strong> Carolyn Beaudoin, conversion copywriter</p>\n<p><strong>Editor:</strong> Joanna Wiebe, founder of Copyhackers</p>\n<p><strong>Peer

These language patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rely on short sentence structures built around clear nouns, active verbs and direct objects.</li>\n<li>Use crisp, clear and direct language to imply the speaker&#8217;s control over the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In contrast, language patterns that imply reactive motivation and uncertainty include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sentence fragments that may be missing subjects or verbs, use passive verbs or use verbs transformed into nouns.</li>\n<li>Language implying that the speaker is powerless in the situation happening around them.</li>\n<li>Long, indirect sentences that mention thinking, analyzing, understanding or waiting.</li>\n<li>Conditional language, like if, would, might, may and might.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given WHO&#8217;s guidelines and the known desire for the population to find certainty, syntax in language used provides further clarity to the message and the authority figure&#8217;s control over the situation.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Primary source messaging from figures of authority</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the risk communication coming directly from the various U.S. official medical and government bodies, using WHO&#8217;s trust-building messaging guidelines plus an eye on messaging syntax as a framework for analysis</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a video from March 24:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k6Kh_A0LBk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k6Kh_A0LBk</a></p>\n<p>Based on the above-linked video where President Trump and Dr. Fauci (director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) on the reopening of the country:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the message easy to understand?</li>\n<li>Is the message consistent with official messaging found elsewhere?</li>\n<li>Is the message focused on specific actions we can take to protect our health?</li>\n<li>Does the message offer explicit information about uncertainties?</li>\n<li>Does the message indicate what&#8217;s known and not known?</li>\n<li>Proactive or reactive messaging?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider those same questions in relation to this video from April 10, where President Trump responds to a question regarding how he&#8217;ll make the decision to reopen the economy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1B8Sx9pEr8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1B8Sx9pEr8</a></p>\n<p>And consider those questions one more time, for this video from April 22 where Dr. Fauci discussing the likelihood of coronavirus as a long-standing health threat and reopening the economy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5dfOTX0iz4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5dfOTX0iz4</a></p>\n<p>The political climate in the U.S. is polarized&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. <em>to say the least</em>.</p>\n<p>With that in mind it&#8217;s perhaps unsurprising that messaging between government and medical authorities has been contradictory in nature.</p>\n<p>And while that may simply be annoying during regular everyday life, during a public health crisis it can be downright dangerous.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is a developing situation and messaging may change with the situation. But to find consistent contradictions between government and medical authorities on an ongoing basis?</p>\n<p>If the government isn&#8217;t certain about what to do and the medical authorities aren&#8217;t certain about what to do either, how are we to have any idea what to do?</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, while we can&#8217;t see the virus, we can certainly see the economy tanking.</p>\n<p>And all of this leaves us to spiral around questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When will the economy actually reopen?</li>\n<li>When will the borders reopen?</li>\n<li>When will schools reopen?</li>\n<li>Will my life ever go back to normal?</li>\n<li>And what should I actually be doing to protect my health?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enter the much larger, much scarier <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_1AyyeH8Hao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government-sponsored uncertainty currently looming in many peoples&#8217; daily lives</a>.</p>\n<p>(Disinformation is an entirely different can of worms which we&#8217;re not getting into.)</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Leveraging influencer and celebrity visibility to spread primary source messaging from official figures of authority</h3>\n<p>Of course, different authority figures apply different communication strategies, hopefully tailored to the cultural context of their population.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the Vietnamese National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health partnered with pop singers ERIK and MIN to produce &#8220;Ghen Co Vy,&#8221; an animated PSA that encourages handwashing:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtulL3oArQw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtulL3oArQw</a></p>\n<p>(I&#8217;ve included the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtulL3oArQw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video with English subtitles</a>&#160;above, see the original YouTube video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtulL3oArQw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Listeners beware: it&#8217;s definitely a bop.)</p>\n<p>In this case, the Vietnamese government leveraged a celebrity with public appeal to help spread the PSA by first posting it on MIN&#8217;s YouTube channel.</p>\n<p>The original PSA on YouTube has been viewed over 39M times since its posting on February 23, 2020. It hasn&#8217;t yet reached the realms of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/web/most-viewed-youtube-videos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most-viewed YouTube videos</a>&#160;ever, like Baby Shark (currently 4.91B views) or Despacito (currently 6.69B views).</p>\n<p>So how does it check-out in relation to our primary source messaging guidelines?</p>\n<p><strong>Is it easy to understand?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, the video includes in-picture subtitles to support the animated graphics and music.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it consistent with official messaging found elsewhere?</strong></p>\n<p>Unsure, though it doesn&#8217;t seem to explicitly contradict other messaging from government officials in Vietnam.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the message focused on specific actions we can take to protect our health?&#160;</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it provides clear written and visual instructions to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wash your hands</li>\n<li>Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes</li>\n<li>Limit going to crowded places</li>\n<li>Take care of your health</li>\n<li>Keep your home clean</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Does it offer explicit information about uncertainties?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it indicate what&#8217;s known and not known?</strong></p>\n<p>It briefly unpacks what was known at the time of the virus (e.g., originated in Wuhan) and doesn&#8217;t explicitly state what is not known.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it proactive or reactive messaging?</strong></p>\n<p>Acknowledging syntax variations between languages, this one is a little more difficult to analyze.

Not necessarily. But thanks to a decade of \n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiakle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">work as a disaster policy researcher and emergency manager</a>, I know there’s a way to \n<strong>plan for a recession, pandemic or anything else that could put you out of business</strong>.

Ultimately, it came down to 3 things… \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --> \n<h4 id=\"h.9t87xn2sv2wg\">1. Really good health insurance</h4> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> If you’re a \n<a href=\"https://www.raconteur.net/risk-management/insurance-cover-freelancers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">freelancer, health insurance sucks</a>. It’s even worse when you’re dealing with a chronic disease that requires regular lab work and tests. \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> So I focused on changing our business structure to qualify for a group health insurance plan. It’s almost (but not quite) as good as what I had as a full-time employee. \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --> \n<h4 id=\"h.pefccixph50o\">2. Long-term disability insurance</h4> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> We decided against purchasing \n<a href=\"https://www.policygenius.com/blog/long-term-disability-insurance-for-freelancers-101/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">long-term disability insurance</a>&nbsp;but it’s worth mentioning.

Life insurance</h4> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> We also decided against this.

Not at all.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start monetizing your blog as soon as you have your foundation laid out and a growing (even if slowly) subscriber list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seems straightforward enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s the catch: </strong>You need to be willing to commit designated time to create content. And not just dropping an article or two from time to time. You need to <strong><em>publish consistently.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because that’s how you grow and sustain that growth. There’s no way around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So&#8230;how often should you blog?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands that publish over 16 posts each month get nearly <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks\">3.5 times more traffic</a> than companies that publish zero to four monthly blog posts.

Then so will what’s next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Best Blog Monetization Tactics <br>That Are Actually Doable<strong>&#160;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re churning out content on the regular and building a solid audience, you’re ready to take it to the next level. So let’s get monetizing&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Write Sponsored Blog Posts and Product Reviews</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to leverage your blog audience is to connect with companies that will pay you to either:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Write a post about a relevant topic that includes a nestled link to their site (a sponsored post) or&#160;</li><li>Review one of their products and services in your article (a product review).&#160;&#160;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a real life example, check out Lou Martin, a pro blogger, in action on her <a href=\"https://www.productreviewmom.com/2019/09/after-huge-setback-updating-my-hair.html\">Product Review Mom</a> blog.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=800%2C547&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"product review\" class=\"wp-image-25154\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=800%2C547&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=300%2C205&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=150%2C103&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=768%2C525&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=990%2C677&#38;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?resize=379%2C259&#38;ssl=1 379w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18.png?w=1100&#38;ssl=1 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lou gets paid anywhere from $200 to $500 per post review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sounds like pennies to you, think again. She does this full-time while raising two teen girls. It adds up quick. Three to four quick reviews a week could give her full-time income. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does this blog monetization tip work so well?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your growing audience comes a <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2016/11/find-your-niche/\">niche market</a> that other relevant brands and organizations want to tap into. They’ll pay you to access your like-minded audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lou has drummed up a healthy niche audience that attracts large brand partners such as Disney, Nickelodeon, Neutrogena and more. She’s even got her <a href=\"https://www.productreviewmom.com/p/be-guest.html\">audience demo info</a> sorted out for partners to scan for a match.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.png?resize=800%2C620&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Lou Martins Blog Audience Demographics\" class=\"wp-image-25155\" width=\"800\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.png?resize=800%2C620&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.png?resize=300%2C232&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.png?resize=150%2C116&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.png?resize=768%2C595&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.png?w=862&#38;ssl=1 862w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Lou Martins Blog Audience Demographics</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Influencers really take the cake for sponsored posts, though &#8211;

Just like sponsored posts, affiliate blogging also involves hooking up with like-minded peeps.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference here is you’re paid a commission fee every time one of your readers purchases their products from one of your blog links.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to keep your integrity high and your reputation unscathed, make sure your affiliate partner sells products and services that your audience <em>actually cares about</em>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask yourself honestly: </strong>Will your audience benefit from your affiliate’s offer?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow in the footsteps of others who do affiliate blogging well.

There are several ways to do this, so no excuses here:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Post about it on your social channels</li><li>DM people</li><li>Email your subscriber list</li><li>Run a poll or survey</li><li>Make phone calls</li><li>Chat with people face-to-face</li><li>Scour forums and groups and engage in conversations</li><li>Check out Amazon’s book inventory on the topic and read reviews</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>HOWEVER, it’s not enough just to ask. You need to <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2018/05/how-to-listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">listen to what your customers want</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>That’s </em></strong><strong>the key ingredient </strong>for complete market research validation.

The more you diversify, the more you’ll earn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the cherry on top, let’s go back to our iconic blog monetization king, John Lee Dumas, one more time.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">In September, 2019, his revenue from sponsorships and affiliate revenue are basically even stevens.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?resize=610%2C379&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"From: Entrepreneurs on Fire \" class=\"wp-image-25190\" width=\"610\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?w=610&#38;ssl=1 610w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?resize=300%2C186&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?resize=150%2C93&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>From: Entrepreneurs on Fire </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But that wasn’t the case <em>just six months ago</em>. Affiliate revenue accounted for almost half of his blog income then.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?resize=610%2C379&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"From: Entrepreneurs on Fire\" class=\"wp-image-25190\" width=\"610\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?w=610&#38;ssl=1 610w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?resize=300%2C186&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/52.png?resize=150%2C93&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>From: Entrepreneurs on Fire </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Imagine how much more that change would’ve hurt if he had less streams to rely on. Or, at the very least, imagine how much more <em>stagnant </em>his income would be if he didn’t keep it varied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, be like John, ditch the ads and start loading up your plate with the buffet spread of blog monetization tactics:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Secure sponsors for your blog posts and review products and services of like-minded businesses</li><li>Include affiliate links in your blog and receive a commission each time someone purchases</li><li>Create a digital download and sell it on your blog</li><li>Productize your knowledge with an online course and sell it to your blog readers</li><li>Self-publish an ebook and sell it to your blog audience</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a choose-your-own-adventure kind of party, so long as you do actually choose.

And Why Does Every Copywriter Need One?","link":"https://copyhackers.com/?p=24651","description":"\n<p><em>A swipe file is a collection of memorable content you can use for copywriting ideas. Save emails, pages, ads, etc. in your &#8220;swipe file.&#8221; And refer to your swipes for inspiration (and in place of templates) when you start writing.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you look at the blank screen and feel unprepared to write copy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you should add an organized swipe file to your copywriting toolbox. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I depend on my swipe file for the many copywriting projects I work on as a conversion copywriter at Copyhackers Agency. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>This is how I set up my swipe file</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I save screenshots of pages and ads in swipe folders within Google Drive, which I share with our team</li><li>I star emails in Gmail, which sends them to <a href=\"http://airstory.co\">Airstory</a> as cards I can reference later, when I&#8217;m writing in Airstory</li><li>I also have a bunch of swipe-file folders set up in Gmail, and I move different emails to those folders</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting out with an email swipe file, consider using these folder names in Gmail, to organize the emails you&#8217;ll be saving:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Email Swipes: Welcome emails</li><li>Email Swipes: Nurturing emails</li><li>Email Swipes: Sales emails</li><li>Email Swipes: Cart abandonment emails</li><li>Email Swipes: Upsells and cross-sells</li><li>Email Swipes: SDR / 1-to-1 </li><li>Email Swipes: Other</li><li>Email Swipes: DIFFERENT</li><li>Email Swipes: BEST</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What goes under &#8220;Different&#8221; and &#8220;Best&#8221;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll save emails that are, respectively, different from the norm or expectations &#8211; which may or may not be good &#8211; and extremely, extremely awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind: A swipe file is a collection of ads and content you like. You probably have no idea if it&#8217;s performing well. So use your swipe file as inspiration &#8211; not as a Bible. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Here is an example of a swipe file </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you need to write a homepage for a client in the fitness industry. Even with research in hand, you could use a little inspiration to get started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A collection of fitness-specific landing pages, like this, would help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/H7tGl2G06XZUMRsQcQSEHd6yIST5AdDda7yfuM9k72UZOBeY1LUfC4q0HZ5AOrvaTPkOB1jH6l9Ex2cNAOh8ghJnUiC3afPXvo5DmkjiTLiIqDAJVO3knTlLrvjqxQwgbgdO3y-i\" alt=\"Example of a swipe file of fitness home pages\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the time to <em>start</em> looking for pages to swipe because I guarantee you will not find what you’re looking for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will, in fact, end up spending the next few hours sliding deeper and deeper into your search only to find yourself holding a serious opinion about the merits of a didgeridoo performance on Australia’s Got Talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to start swiping&#160;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Get yourself in the habit of collecting swipes regularly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, start with websites and swipe the following pages (by taking screenshots of them):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Home&#160;</li><li>Pricing&#160;</li><li>Features&#160;</li><li>Demo&#160;</li><li>About</li><li>Blog</li><li>Resources</li><li>Customer success</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you can further categorize your swipe files by industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to start with websites, of course. You can start with landing pages, or thank you pages or opt-in pop-ups. It doesn’t matter. What matters is getting in the habit of taking screenshots and adding them to your swipe file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me repeat that it’s the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140808111931.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">habit</a> part that’s important here. Make it a part of your routine. Set reminders for yourself.

How is it threaded through the page or email campaign?</li><li><strong>Messaging hierarchy:</strong> Can you follow a conversation? Or is it muddled?</li><li><strong>Formula or frameworks: </strong>Is there one? Is it used well?</li><li><strong>Voice of customer:</strong> Does it sound like something a customer would say? Or the way a marketer would talk?</li><li><strong>Emotion:</strong> What emotion or outcome is being sold?

Are testimonials supporting the conversion?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a comprehensive list.

But what creates actual <em>conversions</em> is text (ahem, copy!) and simple design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there’s a place for both kinds of emails. Design-rich and text-rich emails nurture and engage subscribers in different ways. And you can use text-rich emails when you want to increase conversion rates. (I prefer the nice sound of a <em>ka-ching </em>to praise, personally.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there’s a place for emails with more design than copy, and emails with more copy than design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we just need to figure out when a text-rich email makes sense and when you should be more to the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">“How do I know <em>how long </em>to make my email?

They need solution awareness and product awareness to continue sliding down the slope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in our example &#8211; the welcome sequence for the sustainable apparel brand &#8211; our one reader is new to our brand and probably knows little about what we offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in this case, I assumed they were in the earliest stage of awareness: pain aware. We use that information to answer the first question:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What’s my One Reader’s <strong>beginning stage of awareness</strong>?<br>Pain aware.</li><li>Where’s my One Reader in their <strong>customer lifecycle?</strong></li><li><strong>How many emails are in this sequence?</strong></li><li><strong>What’s the one goal</strong> of my email?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Great. One down, three to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2. Figure out where your One Reader is in their customer lifecycle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifecycle marketing is the idea that customers go through a… well, lifecycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early stages, a prospect becomes aware of you. Then they buy from you. (Hooray!) Then, they might buy from you again. (Whoopee!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;But eventually they lose interest in your products or stop needing them (how many {something funny} does one woman need anyway?) and they move on.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sad day, but an inevitable one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To visualize, the customer lifecycle looks like:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=800%2C271&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25295\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=800%2C271&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=300%2C102&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=150%2C51&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=768%2C261&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=1536%2C521&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=990%2C336&#38;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?resize=1320%2C448&#38;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image23-1.png?w=1760&#38;ssl=1 1760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main stages to remember, as they relate to email marketing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>New:</strong> New to our brand, never purchased</li><li><strong>Abandoned cart:</strong> Close to purchasing</li><li><strong>Post-purchase:</strong> Just after purchasing from the brand</li><li><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> The natural lifecycle of a product when it would make sense to purchase again (e.g. for a 30-day supply of vitamins, the lifecycle would be 30 days)</li><li><strong>Winback:</strong> When a customer has lapsed and is not purchasing at the normal lifecycle interval.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For our example…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it’s a <em>welcome sequence</em>, then we’re sending these to prospects who are new. They have yet to make a purchase from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What’s my One Reader’s <strong>beginning stage of awareness</strong>?<br>Pain aware.</li><li>Where’s my One Reader in their <strong>customer lifecycle</strong>?<br>New</li><li><strong>How many emails</strong> are in this sequence?</li><li>What’s the <strong>one goal</strong> of my email?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving right along&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3. How many emails are in your sequence?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this is something you can decide before you start creating content for your email sequence. It depends on the timing of your emails and how long you want your sequence to run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re sending a newsletter, then that would be a one-off and you can just fill in &#8216;one&#8217;. (The formula works the same way for newsletters.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you decide how many emails to include in your sequence, <a href=\"https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/triggered-emails-ecommerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">here’s benchmark data from Klaviyo</a> on how emails perform based on how many there are in the sequence:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?resize=800%2C721&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25284\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?resize=800%2C721&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?resize=300%2C270&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?resize=150%2C135&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?resize=768%2C692&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?resize=990%2C892&#38;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image12-1.png?w=1192&#38;ssl=1 1192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For my sequence, I wanted to send four emails (so I could send a mix of sales and nurture emails). So let’s answer question #3.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What’s my One Reader’s <strong>beginning stage of awareness</strong>?<br>Pain aware.</li><li>Where’s my One Reader in their <strong>customer lifecycle</strong>?<br>New</li><li><strong>How many emails</strong> are in this sequence?<br>4</li><li>What’s the <strong>one goal</strong> of my email?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4. Figure out the goal of your email</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, we move from questions about the entire sequence to questions about each individual email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, we need to refer back to our template from earlier:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image7-1.png?resize=800%2C199&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25279\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image7-1.png?resize=800%2C199&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image7-1.png?resize=300%2C75&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image7-1.png?resize=150%2C37&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image7-1.png?resize=768%2C191&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image7-1.png?w=876&#38;ssl=1 876w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s fill in the pieces that we already answered from the first three questions: lifecycle, stage of awareness and number of emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image11-1.png?resize=800%2C316&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25283\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image11-1.png?resize=800%2C316&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image11-1.png?resize=300%2C118&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image11-1.png?resize=150%2C59&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image11-1.png?resize=768%2C303&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image11-1.png?w=876&#38;ssl=1 876w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for each of the four emails in this sequence, we need to decide on what <em>kind</em> of email we’re going to send: nurture, sales or engage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determine the kind of email you’ll send based on your goal:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sales emails <em>sell</em>, so their KPI is revenue (if you&#8217;re generating more orders) or average order value (if you&#8217;re generating larger orders).</li><li>Nurture emails <em>nurture</em>, so the KPI&#8230; depends.</li><li>Engagement emails <em>engage</em>, so their KPIs are click-through rate followed by active time on site.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s look at my welcome sequence for my sustainable apparel client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my four-email welcome sequence, I’m going to send:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A welcome email with a discount coupon (which is the incentive to opt-in).</li><li>A nurture email that tells a story about the brand.</li><li>A second nurture email that tells another story about the brand.</li><li>A reminder email &#8211; that their discount coupon (from email #1) is expiring today.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That means emails #1, #2 and #3 are nurture emails because we’re nurturing new subscribers. And email #4 is a sales email because it’s the final email in the sequence and it’s closing on the expiring discount. So now our template looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image8-1.png?resize=800%2C313&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25280\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image8-1.png?resize=800%2C313&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image8-1.png?resize=300%2C117&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image8-1.png?resize=150%2C59&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image8-1.png?resize=768%2C301&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image8-1.png?w=874&#38;ssl=1 874w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: email #1 has <em>Sales</em> listed as a secondary goal. We won’t use that in our formula, but I included it because we may want to use revenue as a KPI for that email &#8211; since it has a discount coupon included.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Now, let’s use our formula to fill in all the grey cells for us.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the formula that will eliminate the guesswork from how long to make our emails:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For nurture emails</strong>, the ending stage of awareness of that email is one stage past the beginning stage of awareness of that email (e.g. Problem → Solution, Solution → Product).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For sales emails</strong>, it doesn’t matter what the beginning stage of awareness is. The ending stage of awareness is always <em>most aware.</em> (Since we’re trying to make the sale).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For engagement emails</strong>, the beginning and ending stages of awareness are the same. Since we’re trying to engage, not sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easy, here’s your handy-dandy formula:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nurture email: Add +1 to Stage of Awareness</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sales email: Ending SoA = Most Aware</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Engagement email: Beginning SoA = Ending SoA</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for our example welcome sequence, this fills in the rest of our template to look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image17-1.png?resize=800%2C372&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25289\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image17-1.png?resize=800%2C372&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image17-1.png?resize=300%2C139&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image17-1.png?resize=150%2C70&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image17-1.png?resize=768%2C357&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image17-1.png?w=878&#38;ssl=1 878w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this formula didn’t give me the description of our One Reader at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got that from all my voice of customer research. (You can check out content from master researchers &#8211; like <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/how-to-master-customer-interviews/\">the tutorial of Copyhackers&#8217;s own Hannah Shamji on getting quality VoC from customer interviews</a> &#8211; to learn how to get inside the head of your One Reader.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with your VoC research, and now with this template, you can see how to work your VoC data into the email sequence you’re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I made two promises to you…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That you’d know <em>how long</em> to make your emails AND that it would become clear <em>what</em> to write in your emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s see how this template helps us with both of these problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Problem #1: Knowing <em>how</em> <em>long </em>to make your email</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the original conversion copywriter, Joanna Wiebe, teaches: copy is as long as it <em>needs to be.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can figure out how long a piece of copy needs to be&#8230; by looking at the beginning and ending stages of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Where your prospect is now vs. where they need to be for your goal.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This template shows our beginning and ending stages of awareness <em>for each email.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at emails #1 and #4 from our sequence to see how this template influenced their length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you remember, both emails are giving a discount to the subscriber. So it would seem like they’d be identical in length. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what the template shows us, is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Email #1 moves from problem aware to solution aware</li><li>Email #4 is already at most aware &#8211; and stays there</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So email #1 is <em>slightly longer</em> than email #4 because it has more work to do. And email #4 is just going for the close. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18.png?resize=427%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24543\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18.png?resize=427%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 427w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18.png?resize=63%2C150&#38;ssl=1 63w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18.png?resize=125%2C300&#38;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18.png?w=500&#38;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Email #1</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24544\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19.png?w=700&#38;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19.png?resize=110%2C150&#38;ssl=1 110w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19.png?resize=220%2C300&#38;ssl=1 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Email #4</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re both <em>discount, promotional emails</em>, but that’s not what determines length.

You know where to start, which is a great way to end Blank Page Syndrome. And you know your destination, which means you&#8217;re less likely to ramble. Now just plug that VoC into a <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/\">compelling framework</a>! Well, there&#8217;s a little more to it&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">“I still don’t want to send long emails.”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re still against writing a longer email with more than just a sentence or two of copy…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darling, let’s not fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s compromise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Try</em> writing an email with just a bit more length, but feel confident by putting a call-to-action above the fold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I did in the first email of this sequence:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24546\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.png?w=450&#38;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.png?resize=112%2C150&#38;ssl=1 112w, https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.png?resize=224%2C300&#38;ssl=1 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So no one has to read, if they don’t want to. They can click-through right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(And you and I can pick up this discussion later.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">“Okay, but what about campaign emails? Those go to a variety of people.”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are absolutely right. I’ve got a suggestion for how to handle the varied audience of a typical email newsletter, but first I want to say&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>THIS is exactly why segmentation is so powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Segmentation helps you know which portion of your audience you’re speaking to, where they are in their customer lifecycle and what their stage of awareness is. The better your segmentation, the more you can dial-in your messaging and use this formula to your advantage. (Jo talks more about segmentation inside 10x Emails.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you (like many ecommerce stores) are sending newsletters to your whole list…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should switch it up between longer and shorter emails. Just like the examples I showed you above from Kettle &#38; Fire. By getting different messages to your email list, you’ll get more of the right message to more of the right people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use <em>nurture</em>, <em>sales</em> and <em>engagement</em> emails to engage your whole email list. Use variety to target the natural segments within your email list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A quick note on the <em>engagement</em> email &#8211;<br>the bread-and-butter of email newsletters.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many times your campaign emails will be <em>engagement </em>emails. That’s the classic newsletter email that people think of when they think of marketing emails, where you link to content and try to get people to click through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s talk about what an <em>engagement</em> email should look like. Since, from our formula, you remember that the beginning and ending stages of awareness are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engagement emails, as you expect, should be very short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our stage of awareness doesn’t change with an engagement email. The content that people click through to might change their stage of awareness, but that’s not <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2015/03/measure-your-copy-infographic/\">our email’s job</a>. Our email’s job is to get them to that content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, here, the copy should be very short. Just enough to entice them to want to know what’s after that button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why the very short Moo engagement email works.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7-1.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24547\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7-1.png?w=600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7-1.png?resize=102%2C150&#38;ssl=1 102w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7-1.png?resize=204%2C300&#38;ssl=1 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s doing just enough to get you curious, and not distracting you with anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyhackers also sends engagement emails that follow this principle:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/22.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24548\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/22.png?w=624&#38;ssl=1 624w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/22.png?resize=102%2C150&#38;ssl=1 102w, https://i1.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/22.png?resize=204%2C300&#38;ssl=1 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just enough to make your curious about the content. Nothing else to distract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s your sales emails and nurture emails that will be longer. Since those need to bring your subscribers further along in their journey. So make sure you’re still including engagement emails in your email newsletter strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Your ecommerce emails&#8230; <br>mapped, wrapped and ready </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By answering the following four questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What’s my One Reader’s <strong>beginning stage of awareness</strong>?</li><li>Where’s my One Reader in their <strong>customer lifecycle</strong>?</li><li><strong>How many emails</strong> are in this sequence?</li><li>What’s the <strong>one goal</strong> of my email?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And armed with our voice of customer data and the answers to those four questions, we are able to fill in the white cells of this chart:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img

interviews go badly, with one-word answers or poor engagement, try these three things: vocalize pauses, repeat back responses and &#8220;name their claim.&#8221; </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One question into your interview, the worst is clear: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your customer is <em>not</em> a talker.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing the customer interview and drawing out valuable customer data is, of course, your job. But landing a one-word answer when you’re anticipating a meaty response is an unpleasant surprise &#8211; no matter how good an interviewer you are.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you’re not braced to handle such unpleasantries, you&#8217;ll be thrown off-kilter and off-script.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/copyhackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/customer-interviews.gif?ssl=1\" alt=\"Don't let an awkward customer interview throw you off-kilter!\" class=\"wp-image-24693\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So before you hop on your next customer interview call, prep yourself with these three psychology-backed strategies to move beyond the awkward silence and glean rich nuggets of insight, even when your customer dishes out the tiniest of sentence fragments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Technique 1: Bring the customer interview to a momentary halt with a vocal pause&#160;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it’s your job to keep the conversation going. But more important than continuity is keeping the conversation on track.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<em> right track.</em>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The track where you end that Zoom recording with a deep and intimate understanding of who your customer truly is &#8211; and with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://copyhackers.com/how-to-use-voc-to-create-outlines-with-hannah-shamji/\" target=\"_blank\">voice-of-customer data you can actually swipe</a>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When your customer answers short, you go long &#8211; and take what I call a “vocal pause”&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A vocal pause is when you intentionally hesitate a second to regroup after being caught off guard, but you say something over the silence to mask it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of a vocal pause include: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Hmm, that’s interesting, okay.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I see, I see.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Okay, okay, that makes sense.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Ah, okay. Hmm, so let me see….”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are filler words. They mean little, but they accomplish a lot: they help you take pause without actually pausing.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> is<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />key <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t pause and instead panic and hop over to the next question, you’re wasting a golden opportunity to dig deeper.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s okay to be caught off guard. It happens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the vocal pause, you can still save face and stay in the driver’s seat of your customer interview &#8211; before you reroute to a sharper question.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Technique 2: Double-check your customer’s response&#160;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This step’s a tad cheeky, but it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’ve had a sec to recalibrate (a la Technique 1), the easiest and smartest way to dive back into the interview is to double-check where your customer is at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say what you heard them say right back at &#8217;em. In their words. Then, cheekily check you’ve got it right.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll show you what that sounds like in a minute, but here’s why it works. It’s called active listening, and done right, it achieves two monumental goals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It tells your customer <a href=\"https://copyhackers.com/2018/05/how-to-listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">you’re actually listening</a>!</strong> Which is huge. And ridiculously uncommon. When people feel <em>that</em> heard, they can’t help but feel THIIIIIIIIIIS AMOUNT of safe. And feeling safe is directly tied to how willing they are to open up to you… a stranger.&#160;&#160;</li><li><strong>When you reflect back what you heard your customer say, you’re kickstarting a sentence &#8211; </strong><em><strong>their</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>sentence</strong></em><strong> &#8211; for them to finish.</strong> Which they will. And nine times out of 10, they’ll add a little extra.&#160;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how you start to dig deep &#8211; by turning your customer interview into a conversation.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here’s an example of a customer interview, which I like to use when I lead customer research workshops:&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The interviewer below was trying to unpack why the customer chose a particular brand of cat food, but the customer kept coming back with an unhelpful response: “Well, I just go to the shop and buy it.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a role play, I used the double-check technique to dig deeper. Take a look at what happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468.png\" alt=\"👨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><strong>Customer:</strong> “I just go into the store and get it. It’s what’s on the shelf.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f482-200d-2640-fe0f.png\" alt=\"💂‍♀️\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><strong>Interviewer:</strong> “I see. Okay. So you buy that cat food because it’s just what’s in the store, what’s on the shelf. Did I get that right, or… ?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468.png\" alt=\"👨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><strong>Customer:</strong> “Yeah, it’s just there. It’s convenient and it’s the one I know.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bingo! Now we’re onto something.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to a super simple double-check, we now know that the customer is deeply loyal to his brand. So loyal he doesn’t think twice about it. To know it’s not just a matter of convenience and apathy like we thought at first, is actually a pretty big deal (<a href=\"https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/The-Psychology-of-Loyalty-100641.aspx\">see why</a>).&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let’s break down how we got to that insight using this customer interviewing technique:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>First, the customer offered up a two-dimensional answer. Nothing rich or emotional.&#160;</li><li>I paused, repeated it back to him IN HIS WORDS, and&#8230;</li><li>Checked if I’d gotten it right.&#160;How did I double-check? Here’s the clincher. By adding a two-letter word at the end of my question: “or?”. This mighty word flipped my double-check from a closed to an open-ended question.</li><li>And that’s exactly what helped the customer, all on his own, to take a step further and share more detail.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>See, most people don’t have well-thought out reasons for why they buy the things they do. They need your help to tease it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you repeat back what they <em>are</em> telling you, they get a chance to a) hear it and b) correct it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps you both unpack their true, unconscious rationale &#8211; together.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Technique 3: &#8220;Name their claim</strong>&#8220;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you do a vocal pause, double-check what you heard and your customer still dishes out a plain old “Yes, that’s right” when you reflect back?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you doomed? Is my three-step technique a farce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No and no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the game plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If your customer still isn’t giving you much and you want to go even deeper, here’s how:&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Give what your customer just shared a name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call it something. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it convenience? Is it ease? Is it a no-brainer? Is it being cost effective?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, even though people have lived their own experience and know it by heart, most haven’t had to talk about it. Which means they don’t know how to describe or articulate it. To do that, your customer needs your help.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is really good news for you.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you strap words to your customer’s personal experience, it’s like adding color to a black and white image. It’s a welcome attention to detail.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and naming their claim also gives them something to react to.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can yay or nay the label you&#8217;ve offered, and help you finetune and flesh it out.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see it in action. We’ll use the same interview as above so you get a fuller picture.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468.png\" alt=\"👨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><strong>Customer:</strong><em> </em>“I just go into the store and get it.
