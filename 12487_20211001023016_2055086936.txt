These gaps require security professionals to be more efficient, flexible, and ready to face the changes enterprises need to be competitive and grow. Cybercriminals can target any organization, and that is why we have seen organizations investing time and resources in extending their security capabilities in detection, response, and recovery.</p>\n<p><span class=\"marker-animation\">Two significant factors contribute to an effective cyber threat defense</span>. First, <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/5-traits-of-a-great-endpoint-security-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prevention capabilities</a> are all about blocking initial access to attackers; second, <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/5-traits-of-a-great-endpoint-security-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">efficient detection and response</a> are needed should a device be compromised.</p>\n<p>Looking at prevention more closely, one major challenge is that most security policies are typically generic. At best, there might be a difference between High-Value-Asset (HVA)-type endpoints versus standard endpoints, but all security policies treat endpoints as equals regardless of whether the endpoint is considered compromised or not. Complex security policies often degrade the end-user experience, while light policies increase the available attack surface.</p>\n<p><span class=\"marker-animation\">But what if security policies could be situationally-aware and automatically dial-up or dial-back security enforcement depending upon the endpoint’s risk status?</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.sentinelone.com/endpoint-protection/singularity-conditional-policy\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50573 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Feature-Spotlight-Introducing-Singularity&#x2122;-Conditional-Policy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" srcset=\"https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Feature-Spotlight-Introducing-Singularity&#x2122;-Conditional-Policy.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 1200w, https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Feature-Spotlight-Introducing-Singularity&#x2122;-Conditional-Policy-300x157.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 300w, https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Feature-Spotlight-Introducing-Singularity&#x2122;-Conditional-Policy-1024x536.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 1024w, https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Feature-Spotlight-Introducing-Singularity&#x2122;-Conditional-Policy-768x402.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If we could do this, organizations would be able to make risk-based decisions. Today, <span class=\"marker-animation\">SentinelOne is introducing <a href=\"https://assets.sentinelone.com/endpoint-protection/singularity-conditional-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Singularity Conditional Policy</a>, a new Zero Trust Network (ZTN) feature</span> that dynamically applies more security controls to devices that may be compromised, and then automatically unwinds these prudently-applied limitations once the device is deemed threat-free. With Singularity Conditional Policy, SentinelOne supports organizations in implementing Zero Trust Network (ZTN) concepts.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Singularity Conditional Policy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.sentinelone.com/endpoint-protection/singularity-conditional-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Singularity Conditional Policy</a> is <span class=\"marker-animation\">the world’s first endpoint-centric Conditional Policy Engine</span>. Organizations can choose what their security configuration for healthy endpoints should be and choose a different configuration for risky endpoints. With this capability, we empower organizations to dynamically change security configurations based on the risk level of the endpoint.</p>\n<p>Endpoints are no longer trusted by default but rather are continuously verified for their health state. When an active threat impacts a SentinelOne-protected endpoint, Singularity Conditional Policy temporarily moves the endpoint to the risky endpoint group and applies the respective security configuration. Once the threat is remediated, the endpoint moves back to the healthy endpoint group and is assigned its old security configuration. In this way, <span class=\"marker-animation\">Singularity Conditional Policy helps reduce the attack surface and prevent potential further damage</span>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50558\" src=\"https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/singularity-policy.jpg?lossy=0&strip=1&webp=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"954\" height=\"659\" srcset=\"https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/singularity-policy.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 954w, https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/singularity-policy-300x207.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 300w, https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/singularity-policy-768x531.jpg?lossy=0&#38;strip=1&#38;webp=0 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px\" /></p>\n<p>Singularity Conditional Policy is available for all SentinelOne customers. To enable Singularity Conditional Policy, just follow these two simple steps.</p>\n<h2>1. Create an Endpoint Group and Configure Relevant Security Controls</h2>\n<p>In the first step, you create a new endpoint group where compromised endpoints will be transferred in real-time by the Singularity Conditional Policy Engine.</p>\n<p>Once the new endpoint group is created, you can configure the relevant security policies.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to enable protection mode for suspicious activities, ensure that compromised endpoints can’t communicate with specific domains or IP ranges, and prevent usage of USB or Bluetooth peripherals.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_50545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-50545\" style=\"width: 1439px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50545\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zero.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1439\" height=\"958\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-50545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Create New Endpoint Group and Configure Security Policies</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>2. Install Singularity Conditional Policy</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your risky endpoint group created and the security policies configured, you can visit the Singularity Marketplace and <span class=\"marker-animation\">simply install the Singularity Conditional Policy app</span>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_50546\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-50546\" style=\"width: 1439px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50546\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/first.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1439\" height=\"958\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-50546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Install Singularity Conditional Policy app through Singularity Marketplace</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Real-Time Security Enforcement with Singularity Conditional Policy</h2>\n<p>Once this Zero Trust app is activated, you are all set: the Singularity Conditional Policy Engine is enabled. Moving forward, in the event that an endpoint is compromised, it will move in real-time to the risky endpoint group and increase the security enforcements. Once the threat is remediated, the endpoint will move back to its original group.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_50547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-50547\" style=\"width: 1439px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50547\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/second.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1439\" height=\"958\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-50547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Singularity Conditional Policy moving compromised endpoint to risky endpoint group and moving back to the original group once the threat is contained.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SentinelOne</a> continues to lead the way with innovations aimed at keeping organizations safe while supporting the operational challenges of business growth. The Singularity Conditional Policy app is part of SentinelOne’s ZTN strategy helping organizations protect, detect, respond, and recover from cyber threats. Our endpoint-centric ZTN trust-but-verify approach makes it possible to evaluate the health state of endpoints and adjust security enforcements based on that state.</p>\n<p>We can no longer assume that because the logged-on user is known to an organization, they should be safe and granted access to all corporate services and resources. Endpoints can no longer be treated equally without considering their risk profile.</p>\n<p>Instead, security policies must be situationally-aware and dynamically enforced. Singularity Conditional Policy is SentinelOne’s first endpoint-centric Conditional Policy Engine that is now available to all SentinelOne customers.
