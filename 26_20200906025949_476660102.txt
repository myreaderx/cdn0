The customer is no longer even allowed inside, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/that-whole-foods-is-an-amazon-warehouse-get-used-to-it/\">Connie Loizos details this week</a> in a closer look at Amazon and other online-first companies taking over commercial spaces near you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Americans sort of knew this was coming. Still, the pace at which buildings of all sizes are being either built or converted into e-commerce fulfillment centers — and closer to city centers — has become a bit breathtaking. According to the commercial real estate services firm CBRE, since 2017 at least 59 projects in the U.S. have centered on converting 14 million square feet of retail space into 15.5 million square feet of industrial space, and that trend is “absolutely going to continue,” says Matthew Walaszek, an associate director of industrial and logistics research at CBRE.</p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Some huge portion of existing retail space is disappearing from public life. Meanwhile, remote work is simultaneously gutting office demand, the even more lucrative part of commercial real estate.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">No doubt there will be wonderful new in-real-life experiences that commercial spaces provide for work and any other function. But the sector is taking massive systemic cuts and destroying landlords in one of the historically slowest moving industries in the world. This alone makes it incredibly exciting as a topic for TechCrunch to cover. The impact on startups makes the changes today profound. Will superstar cities and startub hubs retain the pull they&#8217;ve had in recent decades? Even if you want to be remote-first, what if you want to get out of the house and your team does too? What if you don&#8217;t want to live in a house, actually? </span></p>\n<p>To get more answers at the bleeding edge, Kirsten Korosec and your faithful correspondent did a fresh survey of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future/\">9 of the top investors in real estate and proptech</a> (based on our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/\">TechCrunch List</a> and other research). Extra Crunch readers can check out what they think will happen to startups soon in the middle of pandemic changes, and where they see proptech going along with the rest of the trends longer term. Here&#8217;s one of my favorite excerpts, from Brad Griewe of Fifth Wall:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We don’t believe that abandonment of central business districts will remain an issue following the pandemic. Because the concentration of startup and entrepreneurial activity occurring in cities such as San Francisco and New York is on the decline, we can expect smaller metro areas throughout the U.S. to benefit from a surge in innovation, and the pandemic only stands to accelerate this trend, with many entrepreneurs and knowledge workers having already discovered the benefits of remote work and life outside of high-density areas. While this will not alter our investment strategy, we’re spending time with the office landlords in our network considering alternative spaces for work (e.g., flexible workplace solutions, flex passes, smaller and scattered HQs, cross-purpose retail and dynamic food venues), advances in collaboration technology and the ways in which physical assets can accommodate strong connectivity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stay tuned for part two of survey responses coming next week, looking at specific trends that investors are seeing now, like the ongoing growth of coliving.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1909939\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg 1360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bumble.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h2>As markets adjust to Softbank, will we see a slowdown in tech IPOs?</h2>\n<p>In addition to the numerous other reasons for real and unreal enthusiasm in the stock market, Softbank has been buying up huge shares of tech stocks, and propelling the market further upwards — until this information become clearer in the last few days and the market dropped below what had been surprising peaks. Here&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/stocks-are-selling-off-again-and-saas-shares-are-taking-the-biggest-lumps/\">summing up how the week ended and what&#8217;s next</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tech stocks are taking the worst hits. And inside of tech stocks, SaaS and cloud stocks are enduring even bigger declines. As we’ve noted that some tech shares have taken lumps when their growth has underwhelmed investors, perhaps we’re seeing the entire SaaS sector see their growth expectations slip?</p>\n<p>Bulls may say that the above declines are merely a few weeks’ gains and that the accelerated digital transformation is still a key tailwind for SaaS. Bears may say that this is the start of a real correction in the value of tech shares that had become simply too expensive for their fundamentals. What we can say with confidence is that software shares are in a technical correction, and other equities cohorts that we care about are not far behind.</p>\n<p>Monday is an off day for stocks. Let’s see what happens Tuesday and if the bleeding stops or simply keeps on letting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With this update in mind, here&#8217;s our ongoing coverage of the busy return (to date) of the IPO market after the pandemic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/the-ipo-parade-continues-as-wish-files-bumble-targets-an-eventual-debut/\">The IPO parade continues as Wish files, Bumble targets an eventual debut</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/what-happens-when-public-saas-companies-dont-meet-heightened-investor-expectations/\">What happens when public SaaS companies don’t meet heightened investor expectations?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/in-amended-filing-palantir-admits-it-wont-have-independent-board-governance-for-up-to-a-year/\">In amended filing, Palantir admits it won’t have independent board governance for up to a year</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/its-not-just-airbnb-an-ipo-expert-pushes-back-against-the-spac-frenzy-and-other-new-ways-to-going-public/\">An IPO expert bats back at the narrative that traditional IPOs are for ‘morons’</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/frugal-startups-should-pay-attention-to-how-jfrogs-ipo-prices/\">Frugal startups should pay attention to how JFrog’s IPO prices</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/everybody-is-racing-to-ipo-even-laird-hamiltons-young-superfood-company/\">Everybody is racing to an IPO — even Laird Hamilton’s young ‘superfood’ company</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/zooms-q2-report-details-some-of-the-most-extraordinary-growth-ive-ever-seen/\">Zoom’s Q2 report details some of the most extraordinary growth I’ve ever seen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/the-good-and-the-less-good-from-sumo-logics-updated-ipo-filing/\">The good and the less-good from Sumo Logic’s updated IPO filing</a></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1684202\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1684202\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1684202\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/snap-word-filter-speech-recognition.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1684202\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<h2>Snapchat a winner so far from TikTok ban threat</h2>\n<p>As the September 15 deadline looms for Bytedance, and the likelihood of either a full shutdown or hollow acquisition seem to grow, TikTok users are moving. Even if you&#8217;re not working on a consumer startup, the future may be getting rewritten now for your marketing plans on hot social platforms. Nearly every company these days needs to have a public brand presence and a growing number sell direct, after all. So get ready for&#8230; Snapchat.</p>\n<p>Our resident app expert, Sarah Perez, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/snapchat-had-a-big-august-amid-tiktok-uncertainty/\">writes that Snap&#8217;s app has a massive 28.5 million new app installs over August</a>, a 29% year-over-year growth rate nearing or beating its past records, and well above July&#8217;s (pre-ban announcement) 9%. What about other platforms? It&#8217;s harder to track the impact on larger social sites like Facebook and Instagram, as she notes. But my guess is you&#8217;ll probably still be buying those Facebook ads well into the future, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/facebook-watch-growth/\">probably for more videos too</a>.</p>\n<p>The bans probably aren&#8217;t done, either. India, which was first to ban TikTok, has added dozens more apps from China, as those two countries continue an armed face-off in real life. Manish Singh, our startup reporter in India, has been following the story closely, and writes for Extra Crunch that so far, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/tiktoks-rivals-in-india-struggle-to-cash-in-on-its-ban/\">TikTok replacements have not been emerging so clearly</a>.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2037996\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2037996\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2037996\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228240961.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2037996\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Julien Mattia/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)</p></div></p>\n<h2>Investing in startup hubs around the world</h2>\n<p>Speaking of the uncertain future of startup hub cities versus the world, the EC team took a different angle to the question this week, by considering the question of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/3-views-on-the-future-of-geographic-focused-funds/\">how geography-focused investors remain by today</a>? Here&#8217;s a blisteringly spicy take from resident former VC Danny Crichton:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It should never have mattered before, of course, but then, sometimes <del>idiots</del> Harvard Business grads need a global pandemic to prove that they can actually do their jobs in novel ways. The arbitrage that existed for geographical-focused venture funds is gone, and there is now functionally a nationwide market for VC investments compared to the archipelago of local regions that existed before.</p>\n<p>There is still room for the absolute earliest capital in these regions, accelerators and pre-PMF funds that will invest in founders with no idea for a startup yet. For all other funds larger than a few million though, the transition is clear: they will likely build upon a successful portfolio company or an area of interest and become vertical-focused. The knowledge arbitrage for an industry vertical is much more defensible than knowledge that the 279 should be avoided at certain times of the day in downtown Pittsburgh or that Tomukun is the best Korean BBQ in Ann Arbor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Editor-at-large Mike Butcher has also been getting at this question through a series of Extra Crunch surveys with investors across key European startup cities. This week he talked to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/12-paris-based-vcs-look-at-the-state-of-their-city/\">dozens of investors across Paris</a> and Berlin. The unsurprising theme is that basically everyone is investing across the Continent already, and maybe well beyond. At the same time, many investors in each city expressed a strong belief in the particular city where they are located. Maybe the future unicorns coming out of Europe won&#8217;t have massive headquarters in their home cities, but these companies will still be arising from the ether of local people who work in technology — so it won&#8217;t end up feeling that different? Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/30/9-berlin-based-vcs-discuss-how-covid-19-has-changed-their-strategy/\">how Berlin-based Mathias Ockenfels of Vienna-headquartered Speedinvest explains it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />\nThe Network Effects team works from Speedinvest offices in Vienna, London, Berlin and Munich. We’ve made about 75% of our investments within these hubs, and more than half specifically in London and Berlin. While a local focus is very important to us, we do not shy away from making investments in what other investors may consider “fringe” locations, such as Utah in the U.S., Helsinki or Warsaw.</p>\n<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not)? Which founders?</strong><br />\nBerlin continues to be a major hub for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"aax-b20d\">fintechs </a> — despite not having a strong finance ecosystem. It also has a strong base of consumer tech companies, such as Zalando, Lieferando/TakeAway and Delivery Hero, but has seen a surge in more B2B-oriented startups in recent years.</p>\n<p>I believe the startup ecosystem in Berlin will continue to grow and become even more diverse, as it attracts great talent from across the world and becomes a go-to “playground” for entrepreneurs. As the first batch of successful B2B founders are exiting their companies and inspiring other entrepreneurs, I expect more opportunities in the B2B space in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Madrid and

It’s broadly based on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/\">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p> \n<h2>How one VC firm wound up with no-code startups as part of its investing thesis</h2> \n<p>Throughout all the chaos of 2020’s economic upheaval in the startup world, I’ve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/tracking-the-growth-of-low-code-no-code-startups/\">worked to pay more attention to low-code and no-code services</a>. The short gist of chats I’ve had with investors and founders and public company execs in the past few weeks is that market awareness of no-code/low-code terminology is starting to spread more broadly.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>Why? Again, summarizing aggressively, it seems that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/whats-ahead-for-no-code-and-low-code-startups/\">the gap between what different business units need</a> (marketing, say) and what in-house or external engineering teams are capable of providing is widening. This means there is more total pain in the market, hunting for a solution, often with a tooling budget in hand.</p> \n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/covid-19-is-driving-demand-for-low-code-apps/\">no-code and low-code startups</a>, and even big-company services alike that can help non-developers do more without having to beg for engineering inputs.</p> \n<p>I spoke with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ammathew?lang=en\">Arun Mathew</a> this week. He’s a partner at <a href=\"https://www.accel.com/\">Accel</a>, a venture firm that has invested in all sorts of companies that you’ve heard of — including <a href=\"https://webflow.com/\">Webflow</a>, which raised a $72 million Series A last August that Mathew led for his firm. (More <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/webflow-raises-72m-series-a-continuing-the-trend-of-outsized-early-stage-rounds/\">on the round here</a>, and notes from TechCrunch on Webflow’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/11/responsive-website-builder-webflow-raises-1-5-million-from-khosla-tim-draper-others/\">early days here</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/05/webflow-lets-you-design-responsive-websites-visually-publish-instantly-when-youre-done/\">and here</a>, if you are curious.)</p> \n<p>More interesting than that single round is how <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"accel\">Accel <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> wound up building a thesis around no-code startups. According to Mathew, Accel had made large investments into companies like Qualtrics, for example, when they were already pretty big and had found product-market fit. That same general approach led to the Webflow deal last year.</p> \n<p>At the time, Webflow “wasn’t really defining what they were doing as n- code, they just said ‘we have a very simple drag and drop UI, to build websites, and soon full web applications, very simply,’ ” he told TechCrunch. But, according to Mathew, what Webflow was doing “lined up really well” with the “rising movement of no-code.”</p> \n<p>From there, Accel “made a couple [more no-code] investments in Europe where [it has] an early-stage team and a growth team,” along with a few more in India. In the investor’s view, some of the investing activity was “thesis driven because we think [no-code is] a really interesting theme,” but some of the deals “happened opportunistically” where Accel had found “really talented founders in the space that we thought was interesting, executing on a vision that we found appealing.”</p> \n<p>In the “span of a year, year-and-a-half,” Accel totted up “seven or eight companies in this no-code space,” which over the last five or six quarters became “a real thesis” for the firm, Mathew said. Accel now has “a global team” of around a dozen people “spending a lot of our time in and around no-code” he added.</p> \n<p>Apologies for the length there, but what Mathew said makes me feel a bit less behind. After dipping a toe into learning more about no-code services and tooling (and, yes, low-code as well) it felt somewhat like I was playing catch-up. But as I covered that Webflow round and have since started paying more attention to no-code as well, perhaps you and I are right on time.</p> \n<p>(We also recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/\">ran an investor survey on the no-code topic</a>, so hit it up if you want more VC scribbles on the topic.)</p> \n<h2>Market Notes</h2> \n<p>For Market Notes this week, we have four things. First, riffs from chats with two public company execs about the software market, some public market stuff and then some neat Airbnb spend data by which I am confounded:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>I spoke with Apple MDM company <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/\">Jamf’s</a> CFO <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/about/leadership/jill-putman/\">Jill Putman</a> this week, after her company <a href=\"https://ir.jamf.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jamf-announces-second-quarter-2020-financial-results\">reported its first set of earnings as a public company</a>. I wanted to know a bit more about the education market — a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/\">hot topic here at TechCrunch, given outsized rounds and huge market demand</a> — and the medical world.</li> \n <li>Regarding the software market for education, Putman noted that schools are buying lots of hardware, and that software sales should follow. Our read from that is that the boom in education software is not going to slow for some time as schools work on reopening.</li> \n <li>Ditto the medical market, where Jamf has found uptake as hospitals roll out hardware to patients and families thereof to facilitate all sorts of demand that COVID has engendered. (Hardware needs software, enter Jamf!)</li> \n <li>Chatting with the CFO our key takeaway was that there are still sectors that could generate a continued COVID tailwind, even if not all Jamf customers fit that bill. For startups that did catch a wave, this is probably good news.</li> \n <li>And then there was <a href=\"https://www.yext.com/\">Yext</a>, a company that helps other companies’ customers find accurate information about them around the Web, and has <a href=\"https://www.yext.com/products/knowledge-graph/\">recently gotten into the search game</a>. Yext launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/tc50-yext-offers-local-businesses-a-smart-inbox-for-phone-calls/\">at a TechCrunch conference back in 2009</a>, which is a neat bit of history. Anyway, Yext is public company now and we wanted to chat about which industries are driving growth for the former startup, and how the general climate for software is for the company, so we got on Zoom with its CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/howard?lang=en\">Howard Lerman</a>.</li> \n <li>So, which sectors are accelerating from Yext’s perspective? Government, education (again), insurance and financial services. Let that guide your take on the health of various startups.</li> \n <li>Turning to the business climate, Lerman had some notes: “I will tell you in Q2,” he said, “things came back a bit from Q1.” In what sense? Retention rates, for one, according to the CEO. A return to form is welcome, but Lerman did caution that some companies were slower to “pull the trigger on big deals.”</li> \n <li>Lerman also said that his perspective on the macro-climate has bounced back as well from a local-minima set around 30 days ago.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Public company execs are pretty guarded in how they talk because they have to be. But what Putman and Lerman seemed to intimate is that economic damage — provided you are selling to business, and not individuals — seems more contained on a per-sector basis than I would have anticipated. And that there are some good things ahead, at least in a handful of hot sectors.</p> \n<p>Opening our aperture a bit, some SaaS companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/what-happens-when-public-saas-companies-dont-meet-heightened-investor-expectations/\">struggled this week to meet investor expectations</a>, even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/the-ipo-parade-continues-as-wish-files-bumble-targets-an-eventual-debut/\">as more companies added themselves to the IPO queue</a>.

According to <a href=\"https://trends.edison.tech/research/airbnb-hotel-sales-sept-2020.html\">the folks over at Edison Trends</a>, things are going better for the home-booking site than I would have guessed. Per the group:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Airbnb’s bookings recovery outstripped its traditional rivals, growing “32% week-over-week” from late April into early June.</li> \n <li>And, most critically: “Airbnb spending in July was up 22% over the previous July, and spending the week of August 17 was 75% higher than the equivalent week in 2019.”</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Wild, right?

In a move aimed at protecting consumer privacy, Apple was poised to introduce a new, in-app prompt in iOS 14 that would ask users whether they would like to allow targeted ad tracking or not. Because most consumers generally don&#8217;t like the stalker-ish nature of digital ads, you know what they&#8217;d choose!</p>\n<p>The change involves an identifier known as IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) that allows advertisers to track how well their ad performs, including which channels drove what quality of users. This lets advertisers make better, more informed choices on their digital ad spend. It&#8217;s a key part of app marketing today.</p>\n<p>Overall, we&#8217;re talking about a massive industry being disrupted. According to eMarketer, the U.S. mobile advertising reached <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-mobile-ad-spend-in-2019-was-lower-than-previously-estimated\">$87.3 billion in 2019</a>. Globally, app install ad spend was $57.8 billion in 2019 and was poised to grow to $118 billion in 2022, per <a href=\"https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/app-install-ad-spend/#chart-1\">AppsFlyer data.</a> And yet, Apple doesn&#8217;t really participate here. Instead, it only offers Search Ads in its App Store. But to promote apps, Apple relies on editorial &#8212; like curated collections in the App Store and stories about apps on the Today tab. These can help direct traffic to apps, as can outside press, but the most efficient way to acquire users is paid spend on app install ads.</p>\n<p>The mobile ad industry built itself up around the IDFA, offering tools focused on making it easier to measure ad performance and optimize ad spend. Apple was ready to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/06/24/apple-just-made-idfa-opt-in-sending-an-80-billion-industry-into-upheaval/\">wipe that industry out of existence</a>. And marketers, as you can imagine, were panicking. Even calling it an <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/apocalypse-soon-what-happens-when-the-idfa-is-deprecated/\">apocalypse</a>.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, Apple was offering SKAdNetwork, introduced in 2018. <a href=\"https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/apples-skadnetwork-gets-real-is-it-the-future-of-mobile-app-attribution-on-ios/\">But it lacked a lot of the information marketers rely on,</a> like attribution or information on impressions, creative, remarketing, in-app events, lookback windows, user lifetime value, ROI, retention or cohort analysis.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1973953\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1973953\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1973953\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-936261594.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1973953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This photo illustration taken on March 22, 2018 shows apps for Facebook and other social networks on a smartphone in Chennai. (Photo credit: ARUN SANKAR/AFP via Getty Images)</p></div></p>\n<p>Last week, Facebook spoke up about how serious the change would be to its own business, saying that, in testing, it found that without targeting and personalization, mobile app install campaigns brought in 50% less revenue for publishers. &#8220;The impact to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/25/facebook-audience-network/\">Audience Network</a> on iOS 14 may be much more,&#8221; the company noted, referencing the ad network that uses Facebook data to target ads on publishers&#8217; websites and apps.</p>\n<p>A few days later, Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=hx9s63c5\">announced</a> the change was being put on hold, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe technology should protect users’ fundamental right to privacy, and that means giving users tools to understand which apps and websites may be sharing their data with other companies for advertising or advertising measurement purposes, as well as the tools to revoke permission for this tracking. When enabled, a system prompt will give users the ability to allow or reject that tracking on an app-by-app basis. We want to give developers the time they need to make the necessary changes, and as a result, the requirement to use this tracking permission will go into effect early next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Apple plans to respond to any of the industry&#8217;s concerns during this delay, or if it&#8217;s just given mobile marketers more time to figure out how to proceed in a data-less future. But at the very least, it&#8217;s the latter. Apple only announced the change to IDFA at WWDC this year &#8212; not enough time for an entire industry to retool itself around SKAdNetwork or implement <a href=\"https://www.adjust.com/blog/mobile-measurement-in-ios-14-four-possible-scenarios/\">other workarounds</a>. The bigger question has to do with Apple&#8217;s long-term goals. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1298620343192391684.html\">rewriting the rules to give itself a seat at the table</a>, after all.</p>\n<h2>Apple puts an end to App Store Jail&#8230;for bug fixes</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1905954\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1905954\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1905954\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"app store icon 2\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-store-icon-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1905954\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p>Apple often put iOS users at risk when it blocked developers from publishing their apps to the App Store over policy violations. In some cases, developers have urgently needed to release security patches and other bug fixes that could cause major problems for their users.</p>\n<p>As Apple has increasingly begun to crack down on App Store violations, including those that require apps to use Apple Pay for in-app purchases, more developers have been caught in desperate situations.<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat/\"> Apple put Basecamp&#8217;s new email app on ice</a> almost immediately after it launched, and even temporarily <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apple-apologizes-for-botched-wordpress-rejection/\">rejected the free WordPress app</a>, because in some web views, users could make their way to a page where they could upgrade to a paid plan:</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Heads up on why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordPressiOS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WordPressiOS</a> updates have been absent&#8230; we were locked by App Store.

The move caught Apple&#8217;s attention, and the situation was addressed. Apple even <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apple-apologizes-for-botched-wordpress-rejection/\">apologized</a>.</p>\n<p>A change to App Review, now live, will give developers caught in similar situations a way to keep pushing out their most critical updates, but not other app improvements. Apple&#8217;s plans had been previously announced at WWDC, but the rollout is timely as Apple steps up its policing of the App Store. However, making these rejections less of a potential disaster for developers may also see fewer developers talking publicly about their rejections or running to the press. With the urgency of a critical bug fix to drive them, the everyday rejection may go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Developers in the past had been scared of punitive actions for talking to the press about their troubles. But in the new antitrust era, more have begun to speak up when they feel Apple is unfairly punishing their business. That&#8217;s been good for U.S. regulators, at least. Congress has been collecting testimonies from developers that could ultimately impact the government&#8217;s decision to regulate the App Store. One has to wonder why Apple thinks the fight is worth it. It&#8217;s battling in the courtroom with Epic Games and it&#8217;s risking regulation, when the whole problem could have gone away with a small cut to its commission structure. Guess &#8220;services&#8221; <em>really</em> is the future of Apple&#8217;s business if it&#8217;s willing to take this sort of risk.</p>\n<h2>TikTok deal gets more complicated</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2028551\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2028551\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2028551\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"a TikTok logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227925807.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2028551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CHINA &#8211; 2020/08/05: In this photo illustration, a TikTok logo is seen displayed on a smartphone.

One of the world&#8217;s biggest mobile apps, TikTok is going to be banned in the U.S. if it fails to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/\">get a deal by the September 20 deadline</a>. China has now thrown a wrench in deal negotiations, when it issued new restrictions over the export of AI technology. The order could possibly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-deal-talks-are-snarled-over-fate-of-apps-algorithms-11598995674?mod=djemalertNEWS\">complicate a TikTok deal,</a> as it could mean that TikTok needs to get Chinese government approval to transfer TikTok&#8217;s algorithms along with other IP to any potential U.S. acquirer.</p>\n<p>That leaves buyers to either <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-bytedance-exclusive/exclusive-aspiring-tiktok-buyers-pursue-four-options-in-effort-to-revive-talks-sources-idUSKBN25T2IG\">pursue a deal without the algorithms</a> in order to meet the deadline, or try to negotiate some sort of transition period for the deal with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The latter would take some of the pressure off by dialing back on the immediacy required by the Trump E.O. Buyers could also try to get China to approve the export (which isn&#8217;t a timely option, really) or maybe license the algorithm from TikTok parent ByteDance.</p>\n<p>Anyone who downplays the success of the continued success of TikTok without its algorithm has clearly not spent enough time on the app. While it now has the reach, its addictiveness comes from its eerily accurate algorithm that learns exactly what you want to see by way of using more than just basic signals. It&#8217;s non-trivial to spin that up again from scratch, but not an insurmountable hurdle, either, given the right investment and talent. Still, that&#8217;s not what buyers were looking for.

The app saw approximately 28.5 million new installs last month — its single largest month for first-time downloads since May 2019, according to Sensor Tower, when it had then seen 41.2 million new installs. The only other month, besides May 2019, where Snapchat had seen more monthly downloads than it did in August was December 2016. Downloads were up 29% year-over-year in August 2020, compared with 9% growth in July.

Instead, Apple said it <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-06/apple-assessing-new-hong-kong-law-as-others-pause-data-responses\">was &#8220;assessing&#8221; the new law</a>.</p>\n<p>When reached by TechCrunch, Apple did not say how many requests for user data it had received from Hong Kong authorities since the new national security law went into effect. But the company reiterated that it doesn&#8217;t receive requests for user content directly from Hong Kong. Instead, it relies on a long-established so-called mutual legal assistance treaty, allowing U.S. authorities to first review requests from foreign governments.</p>\n<p>Apple said it stores iCloud data for Hong Kong users in the United States, so any requests by Hong Kong authorities for user content has to be first approved by the Justice Department, and a warrant has to be issued by a U.S. federal judge before the data can be handed over to Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>The company said that it received a limited number of non-content requests from Hong Kong related to fraud or stolen devices, and that the number of requests it received from Hong Kong authorities since the introduction of the national security law will be included in an upcoming transparency report.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong authorities made 604 requests for device information, 310 requests for financial data, and 10 requests for user account data during 2019.</p>\n<p>The report also said that Apple received 5,295 requests from U.S. authorities during the second half of last year for data related to 80,235 devices, a seven-fold increase from the previous six months.</p>\n<p>Apple also received 4,095 requests from U.S. authorities for user data stored in iCloud on 31,780 accounts, twice the number of accounts affected during the previous six months.</p>\n<p>Most of the requests related to ongoing return and repair fraud investigations, Apple said.</p>\n<p>The report said it received 2,522 requests from U.S. authorities to preserve data on 6,741 user accounts, allowing law enforcement to obtain the right legal process to access the data.</p>\n<p>Apple also said it received between 0-499 national security requests for non-content data on between 15,500 and 15,999 users or accounts, an increase of 40% on the previous report.</p>\n<p>Tech companies are only allowed to report the number of national security requests in ranges, per rules set out by the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>The company also published two FBI national security letters, or NSLs, from 2019, which the company petitioned to make public. These letters are subpoenas issued by the FBI with no judicial oversight and often with a gag order preventing the company from disclosing their existence. Since the introduction of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/senate-votes-67-32-to-reform-the-nsas-phone-record-program/\">the Freedom Act in 2015</a>, the FBI was required to periodically review the gag orders and lift them when they were no longer deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>Apple also said it received 54 requests from governments to remove 258 apps from its app store. China filed the vast majority of requests.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8Sr4cXXcXK\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/facebook-whatsapp-hong-kong-data/\">US tech giants halt Hong Kong police help</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;US tech giants halt Hong Kong police help&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/facebook-whatsapp-hong-kong-data/embed/#?secret=8Sr4cXXcXK\" data-secret=\"8Sr4cXXcXK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vVQu5rcJlPk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 16:28:29 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"111bbdc540b5822421ca7356899b06ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-23-482_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Zack Whittaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-23-482_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_5/2020/09/06/02-59-24-744_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn56@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-24-899_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-47-113_1865c0260a5f1edd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vVQu5rcJlPk:DlNdwMfkV7E:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-24-910_d42b77e9d6c2c422.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_5/2020/09/06/02-59-42-947_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vVQu5rcJlPk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-24-873_64caf027cb504162.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361163148},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:23","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:23","title":"PandaDoc employees arrested in Belarus after founders protest against Lukashenko regime","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2041938","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Yesterday the four employees (pictured) of US-headquartered enterprise startup <a href=\"http://PandaDoc.com\">PandaDoc</a> were arrested in Minsk by the Belarus police, in what appears to be an act of state-led retaliation, after the company’s founders joined protests against the 26 year-long regime of President Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko is widely believed by international observers to have rigged the country&#8217;s recent elections in his favor, preventing the election of opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/pandadoc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pandadoc\">PandaDoc <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> — which has raised $51.1M and is now headquartered in San Francisco <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/06/berlin-meetup-sees-city-brimming-with-talent-ahead-of-techcrunch-disrupt-europe/\">after debuting at a TechCrunch Meetup in Berlin in 2013</a> — issued a statement saying their Minsk development office was raided by police and the ‘Financial Investigation Department’ yesterday morning.</p>\n<p>PandaDoc has released a statement on a new web site, <a href=\"https://savepandadoc.org/\">SavePandaDoc</a>, outlining the incident, saying employees had been prevented from leaving the office, refused access to lawyers, and a director was taken away by Police.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>One of the founders of the company, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/mikita-mikado\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mikita-mikado\">Mikita Mikado, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> who lives in the US, has also released a statement to this effect <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEup6BjHwLO/\">on his Instagram</a> and Youtube.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8IxjuW97ZrE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=3&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Four of the arrested PandaDoc employees have been charged with embezzling 107,000 BYR ($41,000) from company and therefore avoiding tax. The employees have been detained for two months.</p>\n<p>However, PandaDoc released a statement saying: “We declare that this accusation is completely untrue and has no basis whatsoever. All activities of the company were carried out in full compliance with the legislation, which is confirmed by repeated international audits and inspections.”</p>\n<p>Now held in custody are (also pictured):</p>\n<p>Yulia Shardiko, Chief Accountant<br />\nDmitry Rabtsevich, Director<br />\nVictor Kuvshinov, Product Director<br />\nVladislav Mikholap, HR</p>\n<p>Although the company HQ is in San Francisco, it has a large office on the Belarusian High Technologies Park, which was set up by the government supposedly to support the tech industry.</p>\n<p>PandaDoc said the police raid was likely linked to the fact that the founders of PandaDoc, in particular Mikado, have protested publicly against the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters by Lukashenko, but have done so strictly in a personal capacity.</p>\n<p>Mikado recently became a leading voice in the protest movement. He set up an initiative, <a href=\"http://www.protectbelarus.org\">ProtectBelarus.org</a>, offering Belarusian police officers who had decided to disobey orders to beat and torture protesters financial aid and re-training in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>Belarussian police officers are effectively ‘indentured employees’ because they are paid in large sums at the beginning of their contract, but this immediately becomes a debt to the state the moment they decide to break leave their contract.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Mikado said that as of August 29th, the platform had received more than 6,000 messages and almost 600 requests for help. The platform is run by volunteers and has no relation to PandaDoc, the company.</p>\n<p>Mikado said in a statement: “We are asking international tech community to support PandaDoc by sharing this message and reaction to it with a #SavePandaDoc tag.”</p>\n<p>“There is no more law. The authorities do not even try to act according to the law, they simply fabricate cases for political orders that come from above. And if you thought that this would not affect you, then we can safely assure you of the opposite &#8211; it has already affected everyone,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>“We will not be silent anymore! The country is full of legal chaos. The actions of the authorities cannot be called anything except genocide and repression. The further it goes, the longer the road back. And soon there will be a cliff. We demand to immediately release our colleagues, close the criminal case, let the company work normally and bring benefits and income, including to the state.”</p>\n<p>The company now says it will be forced to close the company in Belarus and “will begin to establish an alternative to the Park of High Technologies outside the Republic of Belarus.”</p>\n<p>PandaDoc <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/pandadoc-announces-second-series-b-extension-worth-30m\">only recently raised $30 million</a> in a Series B extension from One Peak, Microsoft Venture Fund M12 and EBRD Venture Fund.</p>\n<p>After the Belarusian presidential election on August 9th (which was not recognized as free and fair by the EU, the UK and the US due to widely reported and documented vote-rigging in favor of Lukashenko) the police violently cracked down on peaceful protests, leading to six reported deaths and 450 UN-documented cases of police torture.</p>\n<div
