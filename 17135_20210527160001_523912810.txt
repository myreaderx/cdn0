More consumers are shopping online than ever before, and they’re meeting a brand-new generation of digital-first retailers, each with their own unique products, stories and values to share. At Google, we’re working on more ways to bridge the connection between retailers and consumers, so that retailers can build direct and lasting relationships with their customers. </p><p>Last week at Google I/O, we announced a new <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/more-ways-to-shop/\">Shopify integration</a>, and today, we’re sharing that retailers on <a href=\"https://goo.gle/wooblog\">WooCommerce</a>, <a href=\"https://goo.gle/godaddyblog\">GoDaddy</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gle/squareblog\">Square</a> will soon be able to integrate with Google easily and for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/10033607?hl=en\">free</a>. This open ecosystem approach means that retailers will have even more ways to get discovered across Google, and shoppers will have even more choice.</p><p>As this generational shift to e-commerce accelerates, having a digital presence is just the minimum — it’s now imperative for you as a retailer to stand out and speak directly to your customers. That’s why today at <a href=\"https://adsonair.withgoogle.com/events/google-marketing-live-2021\">Google Marketing Livestream</a>, we’re introducing new tools that will help tell your unique brand story, from the point of discovery to checkout.</p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Build your brand and highlight what makes you unique</h3>We’re reimagining entirely new ways to help you connect with your customer at decision making points in the journey - across Search, Shopping, Images, Maps and YouTube.

We’ve listened to this feedback, and following the successful launch of a <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/black-history-month-2021/\">Black-owned business attribute</a> earlier this year, we’ll launch new identity attributes, including a women-led attribute, soon.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"An animation showing a search for planter stands and a store that identifies as Black-owned in the shopping tab results.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/1440x960_3_2_Screenshot_1_No_Shell_ico8ctx.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Nine in 10 shoppers say they spend more or the same on beauty products online than before the pandemic, according to a PowerReviews Survey. What if you could use digital to offer the kinds of “hands-on” experiences that inspire consumers in real life? <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/shopping-beauty-product-try-it-google/\">We launched</a> an AR (augmented reality) makeup kit try-on experience for lipstick and eyeshadow, and soon consumers will be able to find that perfectly matching foundation, from brands like L'Oreal and Estee Lauder.  </p><p>Consumers also want to visualize how clothing will look on them.
