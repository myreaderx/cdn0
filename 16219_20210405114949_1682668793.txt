That&#8217;s the word that pops into my mind when I see the vibrant, candy-colored work of Canadian painter <a href=\"https://www.andreasoosart.com/\">Andrea Soos</a> <em>{who’s clearly been an artist since childhood!}</em> Andrea’s process is just as joyful as the final piece: &#8220;she may not know the outcome of the piece when she begins &#8211; the artwork evolves as a visceral and therapeutic practice, driven by music and song lyrics.&#8221; LOVE! Andrea&#8217;s work is part of a group show that opens TODAY. It&#8217;s titled <a href=\"https://www.artwrk.ca/brushstrokes/\">&#8220;Brushstrokes&#8221;, and can be found at ARTWRK.ca</a> <em>{an online gallery by <a href=\"https://www.alissasexton.com/\">Alissa Sexton</a>}</em>. Here&#8217;s the description of the show:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"\"><em>&#8220;Do you speak brushstroke?</em></p>\n<p class=\"\"><em>An artist’s brushstroke can be as unique as their voice, and as recognizable as a written signature. For this show, I’ve brought together a handful of my favourite artists, who, on the surface, could be seen to be painting similar subjects. However, the beauty here is in comparing the individual brushstrokes, or voices, of the artists. In one show, we’re able to compare individual strokes and methods of paint application, to fully understand the diversity of this painted language.</em></p>\n<p class=\"\"><em>Featuring some of our favourite painters: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/karamcintoshstudio/\">Kara McIntosh</a> / <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sharonbarrpaintings/\">Sharon Barr</a> / <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johanna_reynolds/\">Johanna Reynolds</a> / <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sueamillerart/\">Sue A Miller</a> / <a href=\"https://www.andreasoosart.com/\">Andrea Soos</a>&#8220;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artwrk.ca/brushstrokes/\"><em>&#8220;Brushstrokes&#8221;</em></a> runs until March 25th, 2021.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 09:00:19 +0000","feedId":16219,"bgimg":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/andreasoos.jpg","linkMd5":"02230a175f043ede9a4cd07f8247a3ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/05/11-49-48-901_785a3f4ab25ef7cf.webp","destWidth":584,"destHeight":4249,"sourceBytes":2023792,"destBytes":335598,"author":"the jealous curator","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/andreasoos.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/05/11-49-48-901_785a3f4ab25ef7cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617623383859}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 19:49:43","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 19:49:43","feedId":16219,"fetchDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 11:49:43 +0000","fetchMs":7485,"handleMs":13210,"totalMs":26262,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"0865f377fd8c2e1426818b6d3afe734f","hostName":"us-031*","requestId":"e38aeb0045f44821b747e3def39228a8_16219","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":335598,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:12:21","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:30:53","id":16219,"name":"The Jealous Curator","url":"http://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/feed/","subscriber":206,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":335598,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1617623363113,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":7536,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":13210,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/andreasoos.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":584,"destHeight":4249,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/05/11-49-48-901_785a3f4ab25ef7cf.webp","sourceBytes":2023792,"destBytes":335598,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":16219,"totalSpendMs":5450,"convertSpendMs":824,"createdTime":"2021-04-05 19:49:43","host":"us-008*","referer":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/?p=38085","linkMd5ListStr":"02230a175f043ede9a4cd07f8247a3ab,02230a175f043ede9a4cd07f8247a3ab","githubUser":"myreaderx12","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.9 MB","destSize":"327.7 KB","compressRate":"16.6%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
