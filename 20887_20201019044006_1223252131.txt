C 60 and FNWs hardly adsorbed amino acids. Most of the amino acids\r\nused have a hydrophobic side chain. Ala and Val, with an alkyl chain, were not adsorbed by the C 60\r\nor FNWs. Trp, Phe and Pro, with a cyclic structure, were not adsorbed by them either. The aromatic\r\ngroup of C 60 did not interact with the side chain. The carboxyl or amino group, with the frame\r\nstructure of an amino acid, has a positive or negative charge in solution. It is likely that the C\r\n60 and FNWs would not prefer the charged carboxyl or amino group. Tri-Ala was adsorbed slightly by\r\nthe C 60 and FNWs. The carboxyl or amino group is not close to the center of the methyl group of\r\nTri-Ala. One of the methyl groups in Tri-Ala would interact with the aromatic structure of the C 60\r\nand FNWs. We compared our results wi...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":20887,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d60b8c6368316e8329cf010bd6b7ba3c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Hideo Hashizume, Chika Hirata, Kazuko Fujii and Kun’ichi Miyazawa","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603082406879}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 12:40:06","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 12:40:06","feedId":20887,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 04:40:06 +0000","fetchMs":32835,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":32848,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"c010f58b6f9b7cd7575ac500c58e1de6","hostName":"us-026*","requestId":"5f2f16240b7840249f76641b94261c05_20887","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:23:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:11:41","id":20887,"name":"Science and Technology of Advanced Materials - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1468-6996/?rss=1","subscriber":159,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/06/20-11-41-263_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Science and Technology of Advanced Materials","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603082374037,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":32837,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
