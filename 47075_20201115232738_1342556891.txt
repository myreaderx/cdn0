Providing scant information about the attack, but it does have all the hallmarks of a ransomware outbreak. The council says it is working with the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Ministry of Housing to investigate and understand the impact of the incident. Ransomware attacks continue to be a major blight for UK public services, with councils to hospitals struggling to defend their IT systems against ransomware. Earlier this year Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council said it had been hit by a ransomware attack, which cost it more than £10m.</p><p>It looks like the ransomware will continue to pose a major threat to the UK for some time to come, with separate reports advising a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-280a\" target=\"_blank\">resurgence in the Emotet trojan, a common dropper of ransomware,</a>&nbsp;while the <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/fbi-probes-string-recent-ransomware-211449819.html\" target=\"_blank\">hacking group behind the notorious Ryuk ransomware</a>&nbsp;has been reported as being active again.

The attackers initially compromised the BA network through a third-party worker’s remote access (not MFA protected), gaining access to BA's Citrix environment. Once inside the BA network, the attackers were gifted privilege level access after finding a domain admin account username and password in plaintext on a server folder. I understand investigators found the storage of payment cards in plaintext, including CVV numbers post-payment authorisation which is never permitted under PCI DSS rules. Aside from the ICO fine and reputational damage, this breach cost is likely to have cost BA a small fortune in specialised PCI PFI digital investigation forensic work, a complete solution rebuild, and with card brand penalties. The Visa Chief Enterprise Risk Officer once said <i>‘no compromised entity has yet been found to be in compliance with PCI DSS at the time of a breach’, </i>I understand that statement still rings true today.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54748843\" target=\"_blank\">The ICO didn't hold back in dishing a massive DPA (GDPR) fine to the Marriott Hotels chain to the tune of £18.4m</a>&nbsp;after a major data breach which affected up to 7 million UK guests.
