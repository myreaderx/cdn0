One out of every 30 websites in the world including Lufthansa, the CDC National Prevention Information Network, the European Commission, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders, NASA, GRAMMYs/Recording Academy and Stanford University trust Drupal as the platform for their ambitious digital experiences.</p> \n   <h2>Drupal 9 - Continuous innovation in technology and user experience</h2> \n   <p>The updated version delivers powerful new features and an enhanced user experience. These features empower Drupal’s vision for the next generation of the web and include: &nbsp;</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Dramatically easier tools</strong>— a new layout builder, WYSIWYG media management system and content workflow tools make Drupal much easier to use. It enables users to take advantage of Drupal's robust technical architecture more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</li> \n    <li><strong>Continuous innovation</strong>—powerful new features delivered continuously, keeping Drupal at the cutting edge of the web.&nbsp;</li> \n    <li>E<strong>asiest upgrade in a decade</strong>—and Drupal’s commitment to easy upgrades in the future means never having to worry about a major replatforming to stay up to date.&nbsp;</li> \n   </ul> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>One of the key reasons Drupal has been successful is we have always made big, forward-looking changes,” says Dries Buytaert, founder and project lead of Drupal. “As a result, Drupal is one of very few CMS platforms that has stayed relevant for 20 years.\"&nbsp;</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>One of Drupal’s key users says they depend on Drupal’s easy-to-use interface to keep their content up-to-date—even when their developers aren’t immediately available.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> \n   <p>In a case study about how the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/case-study/aclu-partners-with-tag1-to-raise-most-ever-120m-in-donations-at-mission-critical-moments\" rel=\"nofollow\">ACLU uses Drupal</a>, the ACLU team says, \"With Drupal's new capabilities to create and administer content, including robust media support ...[and] full layout control, <em>without the aid of developers</em>, ... [Drupal] empowered the ACLU to be more dynamic and responsive to external events.\"&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> \n   <p>While this new version makes it easier for non-developers to contribute to dynamic web platforms, it also continues to advance the underlying technology at the forefront of digital experiences—enabling developers to build the next generation of the web.</p> \n   <p>\"Drupal's API-first architecture puts it years ahead of competitors as a decoupled or headless framework,” says Tim Lehnen, chief technology officer for the Drupal Association. “Drupal can serve as the content hub for rich experiences built with the latest technologies, including modern javascript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, or even with emerging channels like digital assistants and AR/VR applications.\"&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Buytaert says a key focus was making the process of upgrading as easy as possible for its users.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>\"Drupal's innovation has only accelerated since the release of Drupal 8 four years ago,” says Buytaert. “Historically, major upgrades have been costly. With Drupal 9 we wanted to innovate quickly and provide an easy upgrade path from Drupal 8. We did exactly that! The upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 is the easiest major upgrade in the last 10-plus years.\"</p> \n   <h2>Powered by a global community</h2> \n   <p>Drupal is a true open source project, leveraging the expertise of tens of thousands of developers around the world. Drupal has earned a reputation for security, performance, accessibility and scalability that is unparalleled in the CMS ecosystem. Drupal's core strength has always been its ability to manage structured data—written once, and reused anywhere—and the Drupal community has doubled down on this with Drupal 9.&nbsp;</p> \n   <h2>To upgrade or get started</h2> \n   <p>If you’re ready to experience Drupal, discover how easy it is to build or integrate your digital portfolio by visiting <a href=\"https://drupal.org/9\" rel=\"nofollow\">drupal.org/9</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Need some help onboarding with Drupal or building a digital experience from scratch?

I've always been a bit jealous of our developers contributing code to Drupal, so being able to contribute my own business and community leadership experience to the Association board is a great opportunity for me to give something back at a global level.\"</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"lo's headshot photo\" class=\"left\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Lo%20Li%20Photo.png\" width=\"118\" />Lo Li is the Senior Vice President, CIO of Global Consumer Solutions at Equifax.

This helps ensure that critical <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/security/psa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Public service announcements (PSA)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Security Advisories</a> (SA) from the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal security team</a> will be seen directly by site owners.&nbsp;</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li> <p>This provides yet another communication mechanism before an update so site owners can verify they are ready for an upcoming update, before it lands.</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>The feed of alerts comes directly from the feed of PSAs and SAs that the security team and release managers are already producing.&nbsp;</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>This will vastly increase the ability of the Drupal project to get the word out about critical and highly critical updates - ensuring the community can respond fast.&nbsp;</p> </li> \n   </ul>\n   <h2>Readiness checks, or “Pre-flight” checks</h2> \n   <p>These automated and extensible readiness checks are built into the Automatic Updates system to verify that a site doesn't have any blockers that would prevent it from being updated.</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li> <p>These checks are slated to run at least every 6 hours on a site via Drupal Cron and will inform site owners if they are ready to auto update their site.</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>Examples of the readiness checks include:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li> <p>Is the site is running on a read-only file system?</p> </li> \n      <li> <p>Have any files included in the update been modified from what they should be?&nbsp;</p> </li> \n      <li> <p>Does the site still need to run database updates, etc.?&nbsp;</p> </li> \n     </ul></li> \n   </ul>\n   <p>There’s about 8 or 9 of these readiness checks and some are warnings (Cron isn’t running frequently enough to automatically update the site in a timely manner) and some are errors (the file system is read-only). Warnings won’t stop automatic updates, but errors will.</p> \n   <h2>In place updates</h2> \n   <p>Finally, the key pillar of the automatic updates feature is the update itself. Drupal.org generates a signed and secure package of files which can be overlaid atop the existing site files in order to apply the update.&nbsp;</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li> <p>This update package is downloaded as a signed zip file from Drupal.org. The automatic updates module on the site then compares the signature of the zip file using drupal/php-signify, which is based on BSD’s Signify and libsodium to verify the package.</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>It then proceeds to backup the files about to be updated and updates the site.</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>If all goes well, the site is upgraded. If something fails, the backup is restored.</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>Many workflows are supported and you can customize how the updates are performed. Updates can flow through your CI/CD system, be staged for review and approval, and or automatically go live.</p> </li> \n   </ul>\n   <p>In the past few weeks, the Drupal Association has been invited to participate in TagTeamTalks, a new recorded talk series about various tech projects supporting the Drupal project. This bi-weekly format provides real-time shared collaboration and informative discussions.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p><a href=\"http://tag1.com/TagTeamTalks\" rel=\"nofollow\">TagTeamTalk</a> launched its <a href=\"https://tag1consulting.com/blog/drupal-automatic-updates-tagteamtalk-003\" rel=\"nofollow\">webinar focused on <strong>Automatic Updates</strong></a><strong> </strong>this week.<strong> </strong>The group dives deep into the nuts and bolts of Drupal's groundbreaking Automatic Updates feature, and the strategic initiative sponsored by the <a href=\"https://association.drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal Association</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mtech-llc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MTech</a>, <a href=\"https://tag1.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tag1 Consulting</a>, and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">European Commission</a><strong>.</strong> Guests include <strong>Preston So </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/prestonso\" rel=\"nofollow\">prestonso</a>)<strong>,</strong> Contributing Editor at Tag1 and Moderator of the TagTeamTalks; <strong>Michael Meyers </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/michaelemeyers\" rel=\"nofollow\">michalemeyers</a>), Managing Director of Tag1; <strong>Lucas Hedding</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/heddn\" rel=\"nofollow\">heddn</a>), Senior Architect and Data and Application Migration Expert at Tag1; <strong>Fabian Franz</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/fabianx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabianx</a>), Senior Technical Architect and Performance Lead at Tag1; and <strong>Tim Lehnen</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/hestenet\" rel=\"nofollow\">hestenet</a>) CTO at the Drupal Association. <a href=\"https://tag1consulting.com/blog/drupal-automatic-updates-tagteamtalk-003\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Read the TagTeamTalks blog.</strong></a></p> \n   <p><strong>“</strong>Content marketing is one of the most effective ways to promote your brand and capabilities - it has been a really powerful approach for the organizations that I’ve worked for,” said Michael. “The goal is to give our team an opportunity to talk about the cool things they’re working on and excited about and to share it with people. It helps get the word out about the latest developments in the open source communities we contribute to, and it promotes Tag1’s expertise - it helps us recruit new hires, and drives new business.”&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Meyers is the Managing Director of Tag1, and has been involved with the Drupal community for over 15 years. He was Founder and CTO of the first venture backed drupal based startup, CTO of the first Top 100 website on Drupal, and VP of Developer Relations at Acquia before joining Tag1.&nbsp; “The great thing about TagTeamTalks is that it doesn’t take a tremendous amount of effort or energy. Our engineers are subject matter experts. We decide on a topic for the week, spend 15 minutes brainstorming a rough outline as a guide, and then record the talk. We don’t want to be rehearsed. The conversation is what makes it dynamic and enjoyable for us to do, and for people to listen to. And, the team loves it because they want to talk about what they are working on, and this format doesn’t take a lot of time away from what they enjoy doing most - writing code.”&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Hedding is one of the top 20 most active contributors to Drupal 8, and is also the Drupal Core Migrate Sub-system Maintainer, a core contribution mentor, and a D.O. project application reviewer. “Auto Updates has long been one of the most requested Drupal features, it is a capability the platform really needs that will help everyone using Drupal. Now that the alpha is available, we need to early adopters to start using it, we need feedback so we can continue to improve it. We also need to get more people involved in development, and we need to raise more money from organizations to support the project - it might sound like a simple feature, but it is actually really complex and requires a lot of effort. TagTeamTalks are a great way to get the word out and to enlist support from the Drupal community.”</p> \n   <p>Lucas added, “The European Commission provided generous funding for this initiative. The focus has been exclusively or largely around the European Commission’s features and functionality. The funding is running out very soon. There is a need for other people to help continue to build Automatic Updates by adding the features they need with their developers or by providing funding.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>“It is critical for us to spread the message and make that call to action; that this is a community-driven effort and that without continued community support, it is not going to be as successful or as robust in the timeframe that we would like,” said Meyers.</p> \n   <p>The first year of funding from the European Commission provided for readiness checking, delivery of update 'quasi-patches,’ and a robust package signing system. The focus of this first phase of the Automatic Updates initiative has been on support for security updates in particular.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>In the second phase, as yet unfunded, we hope to extend this foundational work in the following ways:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li> <p>Provide more robust composer support. The first phase of the automatic updates project should be compatible with composer-ready sites, but as the site’s composer.json file and vendor directory of a site change from the default, then more controls and though need to be implemented.&nbsp;</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>Create an A/B front-end controller for the site being updated to further increase our confidence in the success of the update, allow for additional post-update testing and provide an easy mechanism to roll-back the update. This is also when updates will be able to move into Drupal core from the contrib project.</p> </li> \n    <li> <p>Expand to more types of updates (particularly further support for contrib updates), and also handle multiple updates in a row, for sites that are several versions behind.&nbsp;</p> </li> \n   </ul>\n   <p>To accomplish all of this, we will continue to seek more funding and more partners.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>“I’m looking forward to seeing where this goes now that we have the first release out, ” said Hedding. “ There’s a larger community needed to get this initiative completed.”</p> \n   <p>The initial alpha version of the <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/automatic_updates\" rel=\"nofollow\">Automatic Updates</a> module can be tested by the community right now. The plan is to: demonstrate Automatic Updates at DrupalCon Amsterdam this month, complete the scope of the funded work by the European Commission by the end of this year, and stabilize Automatic Updates by DrupalCon Minneapolis in May 2020.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>“The Automatic Updates initiative is designed to reduce the friction in keeping a Drupal site secure and up-to-date. The team behind the initiative is architecting a robust system, secure by design, and building components that can be shared with the broader PHP community,” said Tim Lehnen.</p> \n   <p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://www.mtech-llc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MTech</a>, <a href=\"https://tag1consulting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tag1 Consulting</a>, and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">European Commission</a> FOSSA program for funding this initiative.

This means that developers can write migration paths without worrying for stability of the underlying system.</p> \n   <p>On top of that the Migrate Drupal and Migrate Drupal UI modules (providing Drupal 6 and 7 to Drupal 8 migrations) are considered stable for upgrading monolingual sites. All of the remaining critical issues for the Migrate Drupal module's upgrade paths and stability are <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2208401\" rel=\"nofollow\">related to multilingual migration support</a>&nbsp;(so multilingual site upgrades are still not fully supported).</p> \n   <p>Support for incremental migrations is now also available, which means that site owners can work gradually on their new Drupal 8 site while content is still being added to the old site. When migrations (including incremental migrations) are run through the user interface, site owners will now see a warning if some data on the Drupal 8 site might be overwritten.&nbsp;(A <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_drush/issues/2937563\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar fix for Drush</a> is not yet available, so be careful not to overwrite data if you run a migration on the command line.)&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Upgrade instructions for Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 sites can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upgrading to Drupal 8 handbook</a>.

Multilingual sites with reference fields (node_reference, entity_reference) or multilingual menus can <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/upgrade-using-drush\" rel=\"nofollow\">upgrade to Drupal 8 using Drush</a>, executing the desired migrations one by one. In this process you need to create and run <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2912348#comment-12348135\" rel=\"nofollow\">a series of additional custom migrations</a> to reflect the new entity identifiers assigned during earlier migrations. There is no automation implemented for this process yet.</p> \n   <p>Data can be migrated to Drupal 8 also from non-Drupal sources such as CSV, XML, JSON, or directly from 3rd party systems' databases.

Each report looks at data collected in the 12-month period between July 1st and June 30th.</p> \n   <p>This year's report shows that:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Both the recorded number of contributors and contributions have increased.</li> \n    <li>Most contributions are sponsored, but volunteer contributions remains very important to Drupal's success.</li> \n    <li>Drupal's maintenance and innovation depends mostly on smaller Drupal agencies and Acquia. Hosting companies, multi-platform digital marketing agencies, large system integrators and end users make fewer contributions to Drupal.</li> \n    <li>Drupal's contributors have become more diverse, but are still not diverse enough.</li> \n   </ul>\n   <h3 id=\"0\">Methodology</h3> \n   <h4>What are Drupal.org issues?</h4> \n   <p>\"Issues\" are pages on Drupal.org. Each issue tracks an idea, feature request, bug report, task, or more. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/issues\">https://www.drupal.org/project/issues</a>&nbsp;for the list of all issues.</p> \n   <p>For this report, we looked at all Drupal.org issues marked \"closed\" or \"fixed\" in the 12-month period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. The issues analyzed in this report span Drupal core and thousands of contributed projects, across all major versions of Drupal.</p> \n   <h4>What are Drupal.org credits?</h4> \n   <p>In the spring of 2015, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/a-method-for-giving-credit-to-organizations-that-contribute-code-to-open-source\">proposing initial ideas for giving credit</a>, Drupal.org added the ability for people to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/a-guide-to-issue-credits-and-the-drupal.org-marketplace\">attribute their work in the Drupal.org issues</a>&nbsp;to an organization or customer, or mark it the result of volunteer efforts.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Example issue credit on drupal org\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/screenshot_66.jpg\" width=\"632\" /></p> \n   <p><em>A screenshot of an issue comment on Drupal.org. You can see that jamadar worked on this patch as a volunteer, but also as part of his day job working for TATA Consultancy Services on behalf of their customer, Pfizer.</em></p> \n   <p>Drupal.org's credit system is truly unique and groundbreaking in Open Source and provides unprecedented insights into the inner workings of a large Open Source project. There are a few limitations with this approach, which we'll address at the end of this report.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"1\">What is the Drupal community working on?</h3> \n   <p>In the 12-month period between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, 27,522 issues were marked \"closed\" or \"fixed\", a 13% increase from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2018\">24,447 issues in the 2017-2018 period</a>.</p> \n   <p>In total, the Drupal community worked on 3,474 different Drupal.org projects this year compared to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2018\">3,229 projects in the 2017-2018 period</a>&nbsp;— an 8% year over year increase.</p> \n   <p>The majority of the credits are the result of work on contributed modules:</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A pie chart showing contributions by project type: most contributions are to contributed modules.\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/piechart.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>Compared to the previous period, contribution credits increased across all project types:</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph showing the year over year growth of contributions per project type.\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/bar-graph.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>The most notable change is the large jump in \"non-product credits\": more and more members in the community started tracking credits for non-product activities such as organizing Drupal events (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalcampdelhi\">DrupalCamp Delhi project</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/ddd_event_2019\">Drupal Developer Days</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupaleurope\">Drupal Europe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalconeur\">DrupalCon Europe</a>), promoting Drupal (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/promote_drupal\">Drupal pitch deck</a>&nbsp;or community working groups (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/diversity\">Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Working Group</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/governance\">Governance Working Group</a>).</p> \n   <p>While some of these increases reflect new contributions, others are existing contributions that are newly reported. All contributions are valuable, whether they're code contributions, or non-product and community-oriented contributions such as organizing events, giving talks, leading sprints, etc. The fact that the credit system is becoming more accurate in recognizing more types of Open Source contribution is both important and positive.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"2\">Who is working on Drupal?</h3> \n   <p>For this report's time period, Drupal.org's credit system received contributions from 8,513 different individuals and 1,137 different organizations — a meaningful increase from last year's report.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph showing that the number of individual and organizational contributors increased year over year.\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Contrib.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>Consistent with previous years, approximately 51% of the individual contributors received just one credit. Meanwhile, the top 30 contributors (the top 0.4%) account for 19% of the total credits. In other words, a relatively small number of individuals do the majority of the work. These individuals put an incredible amount of time and effort into developing Drupal and its contributed projects:</p> \n   <table>\n    <tbody>\n     <tr>\n      <th>Rank</th> \n      <th>Username</th> \n      <th>Issues</th> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>1</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/kiamlaluno\">kiamlaluno</a></td> \n      <td>1610</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>2</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/jrockowitz\">jrockowitz</a></td> \n      <td>756</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>3</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/alexpott\">alexpott</a></td> \n      <td>642</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>4</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/rajabnatshah\">RajabNatshah</a></td> \n      <td>616</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>5</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/volkswagenchick\">volkswagenchick</a></td> \n      <td>519</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>6</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/bojanz\">bojanz</a></td> \n      <td>504</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>7</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/alonaoneill\">alonaoneill</a></td> \n      <td>489</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>8</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/thalles\">thalles</a></td> \n      <td>488</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>9</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/wim-leers\">Wim Leers</a></td> \n      <td>437</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>10</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/damienmckenna\">DamienMcKenna</a></td> \n      <td>431</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>11</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/berdir\">Berdir</a></td> \n      <td>424</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>12</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/chipway\">chipway</a></td> \n      <td>356</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>13</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/larowlan\">larowlan</a></td> \n      <td>324</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>14</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/pifagor\">pifagor</a></td> \n      <td>320</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>15</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/catch\">catch</a></td> \n      <td>313</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>16</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/mglaman\">mglaman</a></td> \n      <td>277</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>17</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/adci_contributor\">adci_contributor</a></td> \n      <td>274</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>18</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/quietone\">quietone</a></td> \n      <td>266</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>19</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/timplunkett\">tim.plunkett</a></td> \n      <td>265</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>20</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/gauravkapoor\">gaurav.kapoor</a></td> \n      <td>253</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>21</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/renatog\">RenatoG</a></td> \n      <td>246</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>22</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/heddn\">heddn</a></td> \n      <td>243</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>23</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/chrfritsch\">chr.fritsch</a></td> \n      <td>241</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>24</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/xjm\">xjm</a></td> \n      <td>238</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>25</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/phenaproxima\">phenaproxima</a></td> \n      <td>238</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>26</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/mkalkbrenner\">mkalkbrenner</a></td> \n      <td>235</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>27</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/gvso\">gvso</a></td> \n      <td>232</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>28</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/dawehner\">dawehner</a></td> \n      <td>219</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>29</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/e0ipso\">e0ipso</a></td> \n      <td>218</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>30</td> \n      <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/drumm\">drumm</a></td> \n      <td>205</td> \n     </tr>\n    </tbody>\n   </table>\n   <p>Out of the top 30 contributors featured this year, 28 were active contributors in the 2017-2018 period as well.

We value the organizations that sponsor these remarkable individuals, because without their support,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/the-privilege-of-free-time-in-open-source\">it could be more challenging for these individuals to be in the top 30</a>.</p> \n   <p>It's also nice to see two new contributors make the top 30 this year —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/alonaoneill\">Alona O'neill</a>&nbsp;with sponsorship from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hook42.com/\">Hook 42</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/thalles\">Thalles Ferreira</a>&nbsp;with sponsorship from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ciandt.com/\">CI&amp;T</a>. Most of their credits were the result of smaller patches (e.g. removing deprecated code, fixing coding style issues, etc) or in some cases non-product credits rather than new feature development or fixing complex bugs. These types of contributions are valuable and often a stepping stone towards towards more in-depth contribution.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"3\">How much of the work is sponsored?</h3> \n   <p>Issue credits can be marked as \"volunteer\" and \"sponsored\" simultaneously (shown in jamadar's screenshot near the top of this post). This could be the case when a contributor does the necessary work to satisfy the customer's need, in addition to using their spare time to add extra functionality.</p> \n   <p>For those credits with attribution details, 18% were \"purely volunteer\" credits (8,433 credits), in stark contrast to the 65% that were \"purely sponsored\" (29,802 credits). While there are almost four times as many \"purely sponsored\" credits as \"purely volunteer\" credits, volunteer contribution remains very important to Drupal.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Contributions by volunteer vs sponsored\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/volunteer.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>Both \"purely volunteer\" and \"purely sponsored\" credits grew — \"purely sponsored\" credits grew faster in absolute numbers, but for the first time in four years \"purely volunteer\" credits grew faster in relative numbers.</p> \n   <p>The large jump in volunteer credits can be explained by the community capturing more non-product contributions. As can be seen on the graph below, these non-product contributions are more volunteer-centric.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph showing how much of the contributions are volunteered vs sponsored.\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/type_0.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <h3 id=\"4\">Who is sponsoring the work?</h3> \n   <p>Now that we've established that the majority of contributions to Drupal are sponsored, let's study which organizations contribute to Drupal. While 1,137 different organizations contributed to Drupal, approximately 50% of them received four credits or less. The top 30 organizations (roughly the top 3%) account for approximately 25% of the total credits, which implies that the top 30 companies play a crucial role in the health of the Drupal project.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Top conytinuying organizations\" height=\"1563\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/companies.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><em>Top contributing organizations based on the number of issue credits.</em></p> \n   <p>While not immediately obvious from the graph above, a variety of different types of companies are active in Drupal's ecosystem:</p> \n   <table>\n    <thead>\n     <tr>\n      <th>Category</th> \n      <th>Description</th> \n     </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n     <tr>\n      <td>Traditional Drupal businesses</td> \n      <td>Small-to-medium-sized professional services companies that primarily make money using Drupal. They typically employ fewer than 100 employees, and because they specialize in Drupal, many of these professional services companies contribute frequently and are a huge part of our community. Examples are Hook42, Centarro, The Big Blue House, Vardot, etc.</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>Digital marketing agencies</td> \n      <td>Larger full-service agencies that have marketing-led practices using a variety of tools, typically including Drupal, Adobe Experience Manager, Sitecore, WordPress, etc. They tend to be larger, with many of the larger agencies employing thousands of people. Examples are Wunderman, Possible and Mirum.</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>System integrators</td> \n      <td>Larger companies that specialize in bringing together different technologies into one solution. Example system agencies are Accenture, TATA Consultancy Services, Capgemini and CI&amp;T.</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>Hosting companies</td> \n      <td>Examples are Acquia, Rackspace, Pantheon and Platform.sh.</td> \n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td>End users</td> \n      <td>Examples are Pfizer or bio.logis Genetic Information Management GmbH.</td> \n     </tr>\n    </tbody>\n   </table>\n   <p>A few observations:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Almost all of the sponsors in the top 30 are traditional Drupal businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Only five companies in the top 30 — Pfizer, Google, CI&amp;T, bio.logis and Acquia — are not traditional Drupal businesses. The traditional Drupal businesses are responsible for almost 80% of all the credits in the top 30. This percentage goes up if you extend beyond the top 30. It's fair to say that Drupal's maintenance and innovation largely depends on these traditional Drupal businesses.</li> \n    <li>The larger, multi-platform digital marketing agencies are barely contributing to Drupal. While more and more large digital agencies are building out Drupal practices, no digital marketing agencies show up in the top 30, and hardly any appear in the entire list of contributing organizations. While they are not required to contribute, I'm frustrated that we have not yet found the right way to communicate the value of contribution to these companies. We need to incentivize each of these firms to contribute back with the same commitment that we see from traditional Drupal businesses</li> \n    <li>The only system integrator in the top 30 is CI&amp;T, which ranked 4th with 795 credits. As far as system integrators are concerned, CI&amp;T is a smaller player with approximately 2,500 employees. However, we do see various system integrators outside of the top 30, including Globant, Capgemini, Sapient and TATA Consultancy Services. In the past year, Capgemini almost quadrupled their credits from 46 to 196, TATA doubled its credits from 85 to 194, Sapient doubled its credits from 28 to 65, and Globant kept more or less steady with 41 credits. Accenture and Wipro do not appear to contribute despite doing a fair amount of Drupal work in the field.</li> \n    <li>Hosting companies also play an important role in our community, yet only Acquia appears in the top 30. Rackspace has 68 credits, Pantheon has 43, and Platform.sh has 23. I looked for other hosting companies in the data, but couldn't find any. In general, there is a persistent problem with hosting companies that make a lot of money with Drupal not contributing back. The contribution gap between Acquia and other hosting companies has increased, not decreased.</li> \n    <li>We also saw three end users in the top 30 as corporate sponsors: Pfizer (453 credits), Thunder (659 credits, up from 432 credits the year before), and the German company, bio.logis (330 credits). A notable end user is Johnson &amp; Johnson, who was just outside of the top 30, with 221 credits, up from 29 credits the year before. Other end users outside of the top 30, include the European Commission (189 credits), Workday (112 credits), Paypal (80 credits), NBCUniversal (48 credits), Wolters Kluwer (20 credits), and Burda Media (24 credits). We also saw contributions from many universities, including the University of British Columbia (148 credits), University of Waterloo (129 credits), Princeton University (73 credits), University of Austin Texas at Austin (57 credits), Charles Darwin University (24 credits), University of Edinburgh (23 credits), University of Minnesota (19 credits) and many more.</li> \n   </ul>\n   <p><img alt=\"A graph showing that Acquia is by far the number one contributing hosting company.\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/company2.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Contributions by system integrators\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/company3.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if more end users mandated contributions from their partners. Pfizer, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/why-large-organizations-are-choosing-to-contribute-to-drupal\"><em>only</em>&nbsp;works with agencies that contribute back to Drupal</a>, and uses Drupal's credit system to verify their vendors' claims. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN_zar8J2G0\">State of Georgia started doing the same</a>; they also made Open Source contribution a vendor selection criteria. If more end users took this stance, it could have a big impact on the number of digital agencies, hosting companies and system integrators that contribute to Drupal.</p> \n   <p>While we should encourage more organizations to sponsor Drupal contributions, we should also understand and respect that some organizations can give more than others and that some might not be able to give back at all. Our goal is not to foster an environment that demands what and how others should give back. Instead, we need to help foster an environment worthy of contribution. This is clearly laid out in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles\">Drupal's Values and Principles</a>.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"5\">How diverse is Drupal?</h3> \n   <p>Supporting diversity and inclusion within Drupal is essential to the health and success of the project. The people who work on Drupal should reflect the diversity of people who use and work with the web.</p> \n   <p>I looked at both the gender and geographic diversity of Drupal.org contributors. While these are only two examples of diversity, these are the only diversity characteristics we currently have sufficient data for. Drupal.org recently rolled out support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.isdnetwork.org/what-is-diversity.html\">Big 8/Big 10</a>, so next year we should have more demographics information</p> \n   <h4>Gender diversity</h4> \n   <p>The data shows that only 8% of the recorded contributions were made by contributors who do not identify as male, which continues to indicate a wide gender gap. This is a one percent increase compared to last year. The gender imbalance in Drupal is profound and underscores the need to continue fostering diversity and inclusion in our community.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph showing contributions by gender: 75% of the contributions come from people who identify as male.\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/gender_0.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>Last year I wrote a post called about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/the-privilege-of-free-time-in-open-source\">the privilege of free time in Open Source</a>. It made the case that Open Source is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a meritocracy, because not everyone has equal amounts of free time to contribute. For example, research shows that women still spend more than double the time as men doing unpaid domestic work, such as housework or childcare. This makes it more difficult for women to contribute to Open Source on an unpaid, volunteer basis. It's one of the reasons why Open Source projects suffer from a lack of diversity, among others including hostile environments and unconscious biases. Drupal.org's credit data unfortunately still shows a big gender disparity in contributions:</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph that shows that compared to males, female contributors do more sponsored work, and less volunteer work.\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/male-female.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p>Ideally, over time, we can collect more data on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/offering-more-inclusive-user-demographic-forms\">non-binary gender designations</a>, as well as segment some of the trends behind contributions by gender. We can also do better at collecting data on other systemic issues beyond gender alone. Knowing more about these trends can help us close existing gaps. In the meantime, organizations capable of giving back should consider financially sponsoring individuals from underrepresented groups to contribute to Open Source. Each of us needs to decide if and how we can help give time and opportunities to underrepresented groups and how we can create equity for everyone in Drupal.</p> \n   <h4>Geographic diversity</h4> \n   <p>When measuring geographic diversity, we saw individual contributors from six continents and 114 countries:</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph that shows most contributions come from Europe and North America.\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/geography.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Contributions per capita\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/continents.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><em>Contribution credits per capita calculated as the amount of contributions per continent divided by the population of each continent. 0.001% means that one in 100,000 people contribute to Drupal. In North America, 5 in 100,000 people contributed to Drupal the last year.</em></p> \n   <p>Contributions from Europe and North America are both on the rise. In absolute terms, Europe contributes more than North America, but North America contributes more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita\">per capita</a>.</p> \n   <p>Asia, South America and Africa remain big opportunities for Drupal, as their combined population accounts for 6.3 billion out of 7.5 billion people in the world. Unfortunately, the reported contributions from Asia are declining year over year. For example, compared to last year's report, there was a 17% drop in contribution from India. Despite that drop, India remains the second largest contributor behind the United States:</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A graph showing the top 20 contributing countries.\" height=\"1117\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/countries_0.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><em>The top 20 countries from which contributions originate. The data is compiled by aggregating the countries of all individual contributors behind each issue. Note that the geographical location of contributors doesn't always correspond with the origin of their sponsorship. Wim Leers, for example, works from Belgium, but his funding comes from Acquia, which has the majority of its customers in North America.</em></p> \n   <h3 id=\"6\">Top contributor details</h3> \n   <p>To create more awareness of which organizations are sponsoring the top individual contributors, I included a more detailed overview of the top 50 contributors and their sponsors. If you are a Drupal developer looking for work, these are some of the companies I'd apply to first. If you are an end user looking for a company to work with, these are some of the companies I'd consider working with first.

For example, Drush is maintained on GitHub instead of Drupal.org, and companies like Pantheon don't get credit for that work. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association\">Drupal Association</a>&nbsp;is working to integrate GitLab with Drupal.org. GitLab will provide support for \"merge requests\", which means contributing to Drupal will feel more familiar to the broader audience of Open Source contributors who learned their skills in the post-patch era. Some of GitLab's tools, such as in-line editing and web-based code review will also lower the barrier to contribution, and should help us grow both the number of contributions and contributors on Drupal.org.</li> \n    <li><strong>The credit system is not used by everyone.</strong>&nbsp;There are many ways to contribute to Drupal that are still&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.palantir.net/blog/drupal-sustainability-contribution-credit-and-impact\">not captured in the credit system</a>, including things like event organizing or providing support. Technically, that work could be captured as demonstrated by the various non-product initiatives highlighted in this post. Because using the credit system is optional, many contributors don't. As a result, contributions often have incomplete or no contribution credits. We need to encourage all Drupal contributors to use the credit system, and raise awareness of its benefits to both individuals and organizations. Where possible, we should automatically capture credits. For example, translation efforts on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://localize.drupal.org/\">https://localize.drupal.org</a>&nbsp;are not currently captured in the credit system but could be automatically.</li> \n    <li><strong>The credit system disincentives work on complex issues.</strong>&nbsp;We currently don't have a way to account for the complexity and quality of contributions; one person might have worked several weeks for just one credit, while another person might receive a credit for 10 minutes of work. We certainly see a few individuals and organizations trying to game the credit system. In the future, we should consider issuing credit data in conjunction with issue priority, patch size, number of reviews, etc. This could help incentivize people to work on larger and more important problems and save smaller issues such as coding standards improvements for new contributor sprints. Implementing a scoring system that ranks the complexity of an issue would also allow us to develop more accurate reports of contributed work.</li> \n   </ul>\n   <p>All of this means that the actual number of contributions and contributors could be significantly higher than what we report.</p> \n   <p>Like Drupal itself, the Drupal.org credit system needs to continue to evolve. Ultimately, the credit system will only be useful when the community uses it, understands its shortcomings, and suggests constructive improvements.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"8\">A first experiment with weighing credits</h3> \n   <p>As a simple experiment, I decided to weigh each credit based on the adoption of the project the credit is attributed to. For example, each contribution credit to Drupal core is given a weight of 11 because Drupal core has about 1,1 million active installations. Credits to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/webform\">Webform module</a>, which has over 400,000 installations, get a weight of 4. And credits to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce\">Drupal's Commerce project</a>&nbsp;gets just 1 point as it is installed on fewer than 100,000 sites.</p> \n   <p>The idea is that these weights capture the end user impact of each contribution, but also act as a proxy for the effort required to get a change committed. Getting a change accepted in Drupal core is both more difficult and more impactful than getting a change accepted to Commerce project.</p> \n   <p>This weighting is far from perfect as it undervalues non-product contributions, and it still doesn't recognize all types of product contributions (e.g. product strategy work, product management work, release management work, etc). That said, for code contributions, it may be more accurate than a purely unweighted approach.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Top contributing individuals based on weighted credits.\" height=\"1563\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/names.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><em>The top 30 contributing individuals based on weighted Drupal.org issue credits.</em></p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Top contributing organizations based on weighted credits.\" height=\"1564\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/top30.png\" width=\"1280\" /></p> \n   <p><em>The top 30 contributing organizations based on weighted Drupal.org issue credits.</em></p> \n   <h3 id=\"9\">Conclusions</h3> \n   <p>Our data confirms that Drupal is a vibrant community full of contributors who are constantly evolving and improving the software. It's amazing to see that just in the last year, Drupal welcomed more than 8,000 individuals contributors and over 1,100 corporate contributors. It's especially nice to see the number of reported contributions, individual contributors and organizational contributors increase year over year.</p> \n   <p>To grow and sustain Drupal, we should support those that contribute to Drupal and find ways to get those that are not contributing involved in our community. Improving diversity within Drupal is critical, and we should welcome any suggestions that encourage participation from a broader range of individuals and organizations.</p> \n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:22 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"https://www.drupal.org/files/screenshot_66.jpg","linkMd5":"819bc8c7b077dc2a7fa856a643e1efe3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-12-20-337_e1f414ce3221cbef.webp","destWidth":632,"destHeight":135,"sourceBytes":25816,"destBytes":11068,"author":"Dries","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.drupal.org/files/screenshot_66.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-12-20-337_e1f414ce3221cbef.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/piechart.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-12-44-270_0dcc9936bbfcc5c2.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/bar-graph.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-43-273_34b1e5df4393d041.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/Contrib.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-12-44-025_7ed3aa68ee5dafa0.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/volunteer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn65@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-43-324_099d63d676123028.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/type_0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-43-021_83166edff28faa40.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/companies.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-44-091_3ea70d3c5d170069.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/company2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-43-922_aae0e0dbe64764d9.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/company3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-42-959_f3043411cb6e853f.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/gender_0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-43-252_e0d31480c854f8aa.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/male-female.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn87@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-43-799_fc56a8664c500d0e.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/geography.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-43-268_97fc2e4861c46021.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/continents.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-43-244_2aa6471ba5f48868.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/countries_0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-12-43-045_1e91bacf1d2e6e41.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/names.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-12-43-104_745800fbb0911fcb.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/top30.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-12-44-011_9315e76518ec5a0c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733344},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"My first event: DrupalCamp Atlanta","link":"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/my-first-event-drupalcamp-atlanta","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\">\n   <p>Many thanks to Kaleem Clarkson (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/kclarkson\" rel=\"nofollow\">kclarkson</a>) and his team for organizing a great DrupalCamp Atlanta.

Joining me was Rudy Dodier, from Platform.sh. Doug covered everything from the history of Drupal, to setting up a basic website to how the word “system” in Content Management System can be an acronym for: <strong>S</strong>aves <strong>Y</strong>ou <strong>S</strong>ome <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>E</strong>nergy <strong>M</strong>oney.</p> \n   <p>I took copious notes, as I continue to connect the dots to the power of the Drupal project - to how it is leading a digital transformation across industries. I absorbed it all, and was eager to learn more. I met other developers and individuals who contribute so much to the Drupal project and to the Drupal community. From my conversations with Ray Saltini (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/rgs\" rel=\"nofollow\">rgs</a>) and Mike Anello (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/ultimike\" rel=\"nofollow\">ultimike</a>) to Suzanne Dergacheva (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/pixelite\" rel=\"nofollow\">pixelite</a>), I was struck by the level of commitment demonstrated by the community.

I am looking forward to being a communications and marketing advocate for the Drupal community, the Drupal project and the Drupal Association. From the specific needs of developers, to the importance of broadening our audience, to the necessity of career fairs to bring students on the Drupal train, and to the need for marketing to grow Drupal adoption, I heard and learned so much in a short visit to Atlanta.

The following are results from the 2019 Drupal Business Survey conducted by One Shoe and Exove, in partnership with the Drupal Association.</em></p> \n   <p>The annual Drupal Business Survey is an initiative of Drupal agencies One Shoe and Exove, and was published in 2016 for the first time. The survey aims to gather valuable insights from Drupal business leaders to identify opportunities and challenges for the Drupal market. This year, the survey asked Drupal business leaders from all over the world about their experiences with selling Drupal projects, their vision on community contributions and their expectations toward Drupal 9.</p> \n   <p><strong>In total, 118 C-level Drupal agency leaders participated in the 2019 edition of the Drupal Business Survey. These leaders have a total of 118 offices, of which the majority (72 offices) are located in Europe and 36 in the United States.</strong></p> \n   <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"World map showing locations of survey respondents with green and red dots\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_respondent_map.png\" width=\"599\" /></p> \n   <p>43% of the respondents are CEOs and 35.6% of the respondents are founders of Drupal businesses, mostly working at mid-size Drupal agencies with between 11 and 50 employees (33.9%). The majority of the companies have been in business for more than four years (89.8%).</p> \n   <h3>How is Drupal business doing?</h3> \n   <p>The news is positive for business – the Drupal project pipeline has grown or stayed at the same level as the previous year whilst the average deal size has increased. Drupal project win rates have stayed roughly at the same level and future of Drupal project pipeline is predicted steady based on this year’s responses.</p> \n   <p>Each year the respondents are asked about their Drupal project pipeline, average deal size and project win rate, as well as their expectations for next year. Half of the respondents said that their Drupal project pipeline grew and when compared to last years results, even more than expected. One third of the business leaders responded that their pipeline has stayed approximately the same and only 16.9% stated that their project pipeline shrank.</p> \n   <p>Average deal size has also grown, according to majority of the respondents (65%), and only about 7% answered that their deal size shrunk in 2018.</p> \n   <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Drupal Project Pipeline pie chart - 17% shrank, 33% stayed the same, 50% grew\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_drupal_project_pipeline_pie_chart.png\" width=\"405\" /></p> \n   <div> \n    <h3>Popular industries for Drupal projects</h3> \n    <p>Drupal is used for endless types of digital solutions: from easy-to-manage sites to large-scale portals and platforms. As a result, you can find Drupal projects in all kinds of industries. Each year the respondents of the Drupal Business Survey are asked about the type of projects they completed in the past year, and industries in which they use Drupal to create digital experiences.</p> \n    <p>Interestingly, this year the category 'Education' is added for the first time after respondents in the previous edition indicated they missed this category. Education is the most popular industry in which Drupal projects are implemented this year.</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Top 5 industries in which Drupal clients operate - 66,1% education, 65,3% charities &amp; non-profit, 54,2% government &amp; public administration, 49,2% healthcare &amp; medicine, 47,5% arts &amp; culture\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_top_5_industries_bar_graph.png\" width=\"505\" /></p> \n    <p>We asked this question also in previous years and when comparing results, we see some differences. Travel &amp; Tourism became a more popular industry in Drupal project implementation with 330% growth when compared to the 2018 Drupal Business Survey results. Furthermore, Telecom, Sports and Logistics &amp; Support grew their popularity whilst Consumer Electronics, Consultancy and Construction decreased popularity in Drupal projects implementation according to the survey data.</p> \n    <p><strong>Top 3 industries which became more popular compared to 2018:</strong></p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Travel &amp; Tourism (+330%)</li> \n     <li>Telecom (+77.78%)</li> \n     <li>Sports (+77.78%)</li> \n     <li>Logistics &amp; Support (+72.73%)</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p><strong>Top 3 industries with fewer Drupal projects compared to 2018:</strong></p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Consumer Electronics (-59.09%)</li> \n     <li>Consultancy (-37.74%)</li> \n     <li>Construction (-37.50%)</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h3>‘Contributing to Drupal should be a no-brainer’</h3> \n    <p>One of the distinguishing factors and forces behind Drupal's success is the large and active community. For a long time, the slogan for Drupal has been \"Come for the software, stay for the community.” Dries Buytaert each year publishes the <a href=\"https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2019\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">‘Who sponsors Drupal development?’</a> report. According to the 2018–2019 edition, small-to-medium-sized Drupal businesses (fewer than 100 employees) contribute frequently, while larger full-service agencies are not actively contributing to Drupal.</p> \n    <p>According to the Drupal Business Survey, 111 out of the 118 businesses contribute to Drupal and only 7 businesses don’t. What’s the vision of Drupal’s agency leaders about the subject of contributing to Drupal? How do they contribute, and why (not)?</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\" 93 - development (contributing modules, patches, documentation or file bug reports), 64 - sponsoring events, 62 - organising events, 55 - marketing (helping get the word out about Drupal), 54 - user support (sharing what you know with other users), 48 - donations, 35 - improivng Drupal's documentation, 26 - translations, 21 - testing, 17 - design &amp; usability (contributing feedback to Drupal's usability), 10 - themes \" height=\"271\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_contributions_bar_graph.png\" width=\"601\" /></p> \n    <p>The Drupal businesses from the survey contribute in many different ways. It varies from non-technical contributions, like sponsoring events and organising events such as MeetUps and DrupalCamps, to improving Drupal’s documentation or development (contributing modules and patches). Reasons for contributing are, among others, because it feels like ‘the right thing to do’, because of branding and marketing reasons, or in order to give the developers a sense of the community:</p> \n    <p><em>“Drupal has given a lot to our company, so it is only fair to give back. Also, we see that the Drupal business community is not that well served, so it is an easy choice for us to contribute to (besides technical stuff).”</em></p> \n    <p><em>“Without contributions, the Drupal project wouldn't exist. It should be a no-brainer.”, </em></p> \n    <p><em>“ I wouldn't have made a career in Drupal if others wouldn't have contributed before; it's a give and take and everyone should do so.” </em></p> \n    <p><em>I believe in supporting the community that supports me and provides the basis for my income. Also, there are side-benefits to contributing. My contributions have helped me win clients.” </em></p> \n    <h3>Limited time and resources</h3> \n    <p>Even though the vast majority of agencies are aware of the importance of contributing to Drupal, they also face difficulties combining the pro-bono contributions with their day-to-day business. The analysis shows that those who don’t contribute are either sole entrepreneurs or are working at a Drupal company with more than 100 employees. Almost all respondents saying that their business doesn’t contribute, explain that the reason is that they don’t have the time and resources to do so: “In a resource limited business, contribution is difficult to balance with the bottom line. We do what we can. However, the teams are all encouraged to be vocal advocates of Drupal on all Social Media platforms, challenging misconceptions wherever they occur.” Someone else suggests: “Maybe introduce paid development for updating, testing and maintaining core and most used contributed modules.”</p> \n    <h3>Does size matter?</h3> \n    <p>When we compare the size of the Drupal companies with the kind of Drupal contributions, we see that:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>The larger the Drupal business is in terms of employees, the more often they financially support the Drupal project by – for example – sponsoring an event and/or making donations.</li> \n     <li>Also, larger Drupal businesses tend to contribute to developing (contributing modules, patches, documentation or bug reports) more than smaller ones.</li> \n     <li>The smaller the business, the more often they share knowledge with other users (User Support).</li> \n     <li>Except that, there is no significant difference between the size of the Drupal companies and other types of contributions they make to the Drupal project. All different sizes of organisations contribute in the form of translations, marketing, testing, and contributing to design &amp; usability.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Line chart with how companies contribute by company size. \" height=\"329\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_contributing_ways_line_chart.png\" width=\"599\" /></p> \n    <h3>Businesses expect easier Drupal upgrades starting with D9</h3> \n    <p>Drupal 9 is targeted for release in June 2020. We asked the Drupal business leaders what their expectations are toward Drupal 9. The general trend among companies is ‘Finally no hard upgrade path anymore!’ One respondent says: ‘We hope the upgrade path will be smooth, and it will be easier to justify the investment of upgrading.’</p> \n    <p><em>“[I expect] it will become easier to do the operation things, as update core, modules etc. Better media handling and user interface, that it doesn't have this large jumps on functionality changes from one version to another - so the upgrades from 8 to 9, 9 to 10 and so on can go much much smoother than before.”</em></p> \n    <p><em>“[I expect] that we don’t have to reimplement all our customers solutions the way we had to from earlier solutions. I expect that when we have upgraded all our solutions to the latest version of Drupal 8.X, the upgrade to Drupal 9 needs to be smooth and without any major rewriting of code. When upgrading our ecommerce solutions from D6 -&gt; D7 and D7 -&gt; D8, it almost killed our business. We had to basically reimplement the solutions (not upgrade them) and the clients were not willing to pay the actual cost. So we had to invest a lot of money into those upgraded. We are not willing to do the same for D8 -&gt; D9.”</em></p> \n    <p>Business leaders also express their desire for a better interface and a UX enhancements: ‘I hope that D8 will provide a better admin UI and UX, and an improved preview mode.’ Another one says: ‘I hope for focus on the end user experience.’</p> \n    <p>The Drupal community has noted the user experience needs and there is a specific Admin UI modernisation strategic initiative going on – for more information, see <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/strategic-initiatives/admin-ui-js\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.drupal.org/about/strategic-initiatives/admin-ui-js</a></p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\" 32% easier upgrades, 12% better UX/UI, 10% no expectations, 9% other, 8% neutral/negative, 6% more/better functionalities, 4% good business opportunities, 4% increase in popularity, 4% better integrations, 2% losing business, 2% increased stability, 2% ignorance of the market, 2% headless opportunities, 2% just excited\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_expectations_drupal_9_pie_chart.png\" width=\"576\" /></p> \n    <div> \n     <p>However, a number of owners also express their doubts. One respondent states:</p> \n     <p><em>“Many clients are still on Drupal 7 without a plan (or desire) for Drupal 8, there is some surprise that Drupal 9 is already on the way. Some may be waiting for Drupal 9 before moving anyway. The D7-D8 move is seen as such a big one that projects may come to a natural end or move away from Drupal before clients ever get to D8 or D9.”</em></p> \n     <p><em>“We think it will be hard to convince people to migrate from Drupal7 to Drupal9. On the other hand we think that project size will continue to grow.”</em></p> \n     <p>The comments about Drupal 7 show that the system is still in wide use and there is a threshold for the clients to upgrade to later versions. The updates have been laborious projects in the past, and now businesses expect this issue will be mitigated with the new release cycle and the release of Drupal 9.</p> \n     <h3>More ease of use of Drupal</h3> \n     <p>We asked the Drupal business leaders what developments they hope to see in the coming years regarding Drupal in general.</p> \n     <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\" 26% improved dev/editor/user experience, 10% more/better features, 9% other, 7% ease of updates, 7% more visibility of Drupal, 6% easier development, 6% integration with other services, 5% increased stability, 4% I am happy, 4% suitable for small/mid-budget projects, 4% personalization, 2% easier to contribute, 2% growing the community, 2% headless opportunities, 2% marketing automation capabilities, 2% e-commerce capabilities\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/2019_business_survey_development_hopes_pie_chart.png\" width=\"594\" /></p> \n     <p>The answers given by the respondents were varied, ranging from making Drupal development easier to making Drupal more suitable (again) for small and mid-size projects. However, most of the answers were about the user-friendliness of Drupal: 26% of all the answers had to do with Drupal’s user experience for developers as well as administrators, editors, content managers and end users. Or, as one respondent stated it: “Continued ease-of-use for both semi-technicals/semi-professionals as well as professional developers and UX and UI designers.”</p> \n     <p><em>“A better out-of-the box user experience (in terms of design, media handling &amp; editing, for example). Improved admin experience - e.g. react-based admin interface.”</em></p> \n     <p><em>“I hope that Drupal is going to have a better and more modern UI/UX for the clients, ease to integrate Drupal as API first/headless, from a DX perspective continue to use OOP and modern methods. Ease to do functional tests. Ease to update modules/core with automatic process.”</em></p> \n     <p>The Drupal Business Survey results indicate that businesses are eagerly waiting for the first versions with a radically improved admin user interface. This is something that has already been taken into account; see the Drupal community’s strategic initiative.</p> \n     <p>The second thing that the respondents mention is that they hope the features and capabilities of Drupal will continue to improve or expand (10% of the answers):</p> \n     <p><em>“Continue to develop more content-friendly toolkits/features, expand upon configuration management processes/workflows”</em></p> \n     <p><em>“We see more out of the box features in the platform and more tools suited for enterprises.”</em></p> \n     <p><em>“Closer to a microservices CMS, allowing me to pick the bits I need/want.”</em></p> \n     <h3>Conclusion</h3> \n     <p>The survey shows that Drupal business is doing well, with slight growth in project pipeline and more substantial growth in average deal size. Drupal is used for various types of digital solutions. However the most popular industry for Drupal project implementation is Education based on this year’s survey results. Other top industries include Charities &amp; Non-profit and Government &amp; Public Administration. The fastest growing industry in terms of the number of Drupal implementations this year is Travel &amp; Tourism, with a growth of 330%, followed by Telecom (+77,78%), Sports (+77,78%) and Logistics &amp; Support (+72,73%).</p> \n     <p>Contributions to Drupal have remained active, as 111 out of the 118 businesses taking part in the survey report that they contribute to Drupal. The most common ways of contributing include development as well as sponsoring and organising events. The report shows that those who cannot contribute to Drupal are either sole entrepreneurs or are working at a company with over 100 employees, facing challenges in combining pro bono work with day-to-day business.</p> \n     <p>Drupal business leaders share various hopes on the development of Drupal. The most common ones include improved dev/editor/user experience, more/better features and ease of updates. Expectations towards the upgrade to Drupal 9 are mostly optimistic, the only thing that businesses shared was their concerns that customers may want to move away from Drupal because of the difficult upgrade from 7 to 8.</p> \n     <p>As one of the business leaders states: <em>“Agency leaders play a key role in growing the Drupal community. This survey provides a great way for us to start working together. Next, we need to take the results and come up with strategies for growth!”</em> The findings of this survey – and possible strategies for growth – were discussed at the Drupal CEO Dinner during DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019, where more than 60 Drupal Business leaders from all over the world came together.</p> \n    </div> \n    <p>-----</p> \n    <p>See <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-business-survey-2018\" rel=\"nofollow\">the 2018 survey results</a>.</p> \n    <p>For more information, please contact Janne Kalliola (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/jannekalliola\" rel=\"nofollow\">jannekalliola</a>) or Michel van Velde (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/michel-van-velde\" rel=\"nofollow\">michel-van-velde</a><a href=\"mailto:michel.vanvelde@oneshoe.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">)</a>.</p> \n    <h4><strong>About Exove</strong></h4> \n    <p>Exove delivers digital growth.

The new stable JSON:API core module as well as the intuitive and accessible stable Layout Builder are game-changing.</p> \n   <!--break--> \n   <p><a class=\"link-button\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.7.0\">Download Drupal 8.7.0</a></p> \n   <h3>Layout Builder is stable</h3> \n   <p>The Layout Builder module was originally introduced as an experimental module in Drupal 8.5.0. As of Drupal 8.7.0, Layout Builder&nbsp;is now stable and ready for production use! It provides a powerful, accessible, mobile-friendly page building tool that is fully compatible with revisions, workflows, and in-context previews.</p> \n   <p>The Layout Builder&nbsp;enables site builders to rapidly create layout templates for content that speed up the development process. It also permits content authors to easily customize individual pages with unique layouts.</p> \n   <p>The interface allows drag-and-drop management of your content blocks. It additionally supports keyboard controls and toggling the content preview on and off to give the content editor complete control of their experience while building their layouts.</p> \n   <p>The result of all these features is a state-of-the art content management solution that streamlines mass-production while also supporting unique creation. 123 individuals and 68 organizations contributed to this feature. More than 40 of the individual contributors volunteered some or all of their time.</p> \n   <p>Check out this demonstration based on the core Umami demo:</p> \n   <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oB28lfIUcNU\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n   <p>The team is working on implementing translation support for layouts in a future release.</p> \n   <h3>New stable JSON:API support</h3> \n   <p>JSON:API support is now included as a stable core feature. The <a href=\"https://jsonapi.org/\">JSON:API specification</a> is an easy and fast way to build decoupled applications. Drupal core's JSON:API module is feature-complete and easy to use with robust out-of-the-box support and simple setup. JSON:API makes it simpler than ever to build ambitious projects. 147 contributors and 76 organizations contributed to this new feature. Among the individual contributors, more than 50 volunteered some or all of their time.</p> \n   <p>For example, by simply navigating to a URL like <code class=\"language-php\">https://example.com/jsonapi/node/article</code>, you can get a list of available articles on your site, and filter further from there, to display your Drupal content in decoupled websites, mobile applications, and so on.</p> \n   <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zEsNlAeYRn8\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n   <h3>Improvements in experimental Media Library</h3> \n   <p>The experimental Media Library has numerous significant improvements in this release. The Media Library is built on top of the stable Media module, which allows reuse of images, documents, and even embedded remote media like YouTube videos. Items in the Media Library can be managed with drag-and-drop. This release improves the design and accessibility of the user interface, allows inline media creation in the library, and provides more flexible grid and table views. 310 contributors and 122 organizations contributed to this new feature. More than 100 individuals volunteered some or all of their time!</p> \n   <p>Check out this demonstration based the core Umami demo with Media Library enabled:</p> \n   <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R3DT99QllGQ\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n   <p>There are various tasks left to make Media Library stable in a future release, including WYSIWYG integration.</p> \n   <h3>Revisionable menus and taxonomy terms</h3> \n   <p>Custom menu links and taxonomy terms are now revisionable, which allows them to be used in editorial workflows (similarly to nodes, media, and custom blocks). The Entity system now also provides a new Update API to support conversion of further entity types. It supports&nbsp;converting the schema of any content entity type between&nbsp;non-revisionable or non-translatable and revisionable or translatable, which also works when there is pre-existing data for the entity type whose schema is being changed. All these changes improve core support for the <a href=\"https://dri.es/an-update-on-the-workflow-initiative-for-drupal-8-4-8-5\">Workspaces module</a>.</p> \n   <h3>New features in the Umami demo profile</h3> \n   <p>The Umami food magazine demo is now more accessible and demonstrates more features out of the box, including a new welcome tour, Layout Builder integration for recipes, and multilingual features. The profile now includes a curated set of Spanish translations, and more languages are in the works. 187 contributors and 84 organizations have contributed to Umami, with more than 60 individuals volunteering some or all of their time.</p> \n   <p>Umami empowers first-time users to spin up a Drupal project in no time so that they can use to evaluate Drupal and learn about its major components.</p> \n   <h3>On the way to Drupal 9</h3> \n   <p>Drupal 8.7.0 includes optional support for Twig 2 (for sites that can patch their Composer configuration). Optional support for Symfony 4 also received a lot of contributions and should be complete in 8.8. This is important work, because <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/plan-for-drupal-9\">Drupal 9 is planned for June 3, 2020</a> and will update various dependencies, primarily Symfony. Testing Drupal with updated third-party dependencies will help us get better feedback on our compatibility with these dependencies&nbsp;and any difficulties sites encounter when upgrading.</p> \n   <h2>What does this mean for me?</h2> \n   <h3>Drupal 8 site owners</h3> \n   <p>Update to 8.7.0 to continue receiving bug&nbsp;fixes. The next bugfix release (8.7.1) is scheduled for June 5, 2019. (See the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview#windows\">release schedule overview</a> for more information.) As of this release, sites on Drupal 8.5&nbsp;will no longer receive security coverage. (Drupal 8.6&nbsp;will continue receiving security fixes until December 4, 2019.)</p> \n   <p>Note that new Drupal 8.7.0 installs now require at least PHP 7.0.8. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/3044409\">Existing sites still work on at least PHP 5.5.9 for now, but will display a warning</a>. Drupal security updates will begin requiring PHP 7 as early as Drupal 8.8.0 (December 2019), so <strong>all users are advised to update to at least PHP 7.0.8 now</strong>.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2700999\">Updating your site</a> from 8.6.15 to 8.7.0 with <code class=\"language-php\">update.php</code> is exactly the same as updating from 8.6.14 to 8.6.15. Drupal 8.7.0 also has updates to several dependencies. Modules, themes, and translations may need updates for these and other changes in this minor release, so test the update carefully before updating your production site. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.7.0\">Read the 8.7.0 release notes</a> for a full list of changes that may affect your site.</p> \n   <h3>Drupal 6 and 7 site owners</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-02-25\">Drupal 7 is fully supported by the community until November 2021</a>, and will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout this time.

The new experimental Claro administration theme brings a fresh look to site management. This is also the first release to come with native Composer support.</p> \n   <!--break--> \n   <p><a class=\"link-button\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.8.0\">Download Drupal 8.8.0</a></p> \n   <h3>Stable Media Library</h3> \n   <p>The Media Library module allows easy reuse of images, documents, videos, and other assets across the site. It is integrated into content forms and seamlessly fits into CKEditor. You can upload media right from the library and even reuse a combination of uploaded and existing media. Media Library was previously included with Drupal core as a beta experimental module.</p> \n   <p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qwvBuSApro\" title=\"A demo of WYSIWYG image embedding in Drupal 8.8\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n   <h3>New experimental administration theme</h3> \n   <p>The Claro administration theme was added to Drupal core with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta\">beta experimental stability</a>. The new theme is clean, accessible, and powerful. Administration pages are more touch-friendly, and color combinations and contrasts are more accessible.</p> \n   <p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-aFkS0_LEVs\" title=\"An update on Drupal 8's new administration theme called Claro\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n   <h3>Significant improvements to Workspaces</h3> \n   <p>It is now possible to define hierarchical workspaces (such as preparing a \"New Year's\" issue for a magazine under the \"winter issue\", while both receive changes to be deployed). Workspaces can now work with Content Moderation, and path alias changes can also be staged.</p> \n   <p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_51rAkhlvIo\" title=\"Hierarchical workspaces in Drupal 8.8.0 demo by Dick Olsson\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n   <h3>Native Composer support included</h3> \n   <p>Drupal 8.8.0 is the first release to include native Composer support without reliance on third-party projects to set up Drupal with its dependencies. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/starting-a-site-using-drupal-composer-project-templates\">New sites can be created using a one-line command</a>.</p> \n   <h3>Migration improvements</h3> \n   <p>The multilingual migration path is still experimental, but has received various updates. This includes handling of vocabulary language settings, term language information, and localization. Modules can now specify whether migrations provided by them are finished or not finished to help audit completeness of available migrations.</p> \n   <h3>New experimental Help Topics module</h3> \n   <p>The existing help system is module based, whereas users intend to complete tasks, not use modules. A new task-based Help Topics beta experimental module has been added to bring in-Drupal help to the next level.</p> \n   <h2>The way to Drupal 9</h2> \n   <p>Drupal 8.8 is the last minor release of Drupal 8 to include significant new features or deprecations prior to 9.0.0. The next (and final) minor release, 8.9, is planned to be a long-term support release that will include all the same changes as Drupal 9.0. It will not contain significant new features compared to 8.8.0, although existing experimental modules may become stable, and small API and UX improvements can still be added.</p> \n   <p>Drupal 8.9.0's planned release date is June 3, 2020, and our target release date for Drupal 9.0.0 is the same day. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/9/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9\">Most Drupal 9 preparation steps can be done on your Drupal 8 site, custom code and contributed modules now</a>.</p> \n   <h2>What does this mean for me?</h2> \n   <h3>Drupal 8 site owners</h3> \n   <p>Update to 8.8.0 to continue receiving bug fixes and prepare for 9.0.0 (or 8.9.0). The next bug-fix release (8.8.1) is scheduled for January 8, 2020. (See the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview#windows\">release schedule overview</a> for more information.) As of this release, sites on Drupal 8.6 will no longer receive security coverage. (Drupal 8.7 will continue receiving security fixes until June 3, 2020.)</p> \n   <p>Note that all Drupal 8.8.0 sites (new installs and updates) now require at least PHP 7.0.8.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2700999\">Updating your site</a> from 8.7.10 to 8.8.0 with <code class=\"language-php\">update.php</code> is exactly the same as updating from 8.7.8 to 8.7.9.

But the cancellation of the Drupal Association’s annual keystone fundraising event—originally scheduled for May 2020—put the nonprofit’s finances in jeopardy.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>&nbsp;<br /> COVID-19 has delivered a particularly hard economic hit to non-profits, and the Drupal Association (DA) is no exception,” says Heather Rocker, executive director of the DA. “When we made the decision to cancel DrupalCon North America 2020 for the safety of our attendees, the next question was how to recover those funds so we could continue operations for our community of millions around the world.”</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>&nbsp;<br /> Enter #DrupalCares, a global fundraiser conceived with the hopes of bridging the significant funding gap left as a result of the pandemic. While the campaign had a strong start, what really put the fundraising into overdrive was the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/drupal-cares-challenge\" rel=\"nofollow\">#DrupalCares match challenge</a>, a <a href=\"https://dri.es/pledging-100000-usd-to-support-the-drupal-association\" rel=\"nofollow\">$100,000 matching grant for individual contributions</a> funded by Drupal creator Dries Buytaert and his wife Vanessa. Then a <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupalcares-thanks-to-drupal-businesses-you-can-now-triple-your-impact\" rel=\"nofollow\">coalition of Drupal businesses</a> came together to match those contributions again—bringing the potential impact up to $300,000. These contributions, together with the contributions from Drupal service providers and end-users, accelerated the campaign dramatically.<br /> &nbsp;<br /><strong>As of today, May 11, 2020, #DrupalCares has raised $500,000, meeting its 60-day goal in just over 30 days. &nbsp;Nearly 150 businesses and organizations, along with over 2,000 individual donors and members donated, to reach the goal in record time. &nbsp;</strong><br /> &nbsp;<br /> \"I'm in awe of how quickly the Drupal community rallied to raise funds for the Drupal Association,” said Dries Buytaert, founder of Drupal. “With this fundraising campaign behind us, the Drupal Association can refocus on key initiatives such as the Drupal 9 launch next month.</p> \n   <p>“DrupalCon has been an important reason for Drupal's success,” said Buytaert. “Even though we'll be gathering virtually this summer, I'm very excited that DrupalCon will live on. I'd like to thank everyone who helped us reach our goals—the Drupal community is stronger than ever.\"<br /> &nbsp;<br /> While the nonprofit Drupal Association was impacted by COVID-19, the Drupal ecosystem remains strong. As Buytaert wrote in March, <a href=\"https://dri.es/is-open-source-recession-proof\" rel=\"nofollow\">open source software seems to be recession-proof.</a><br /> &nbsp;<br /> “Open Source has grown to be more secure, more flexible, and more stable than ever before,” said Buytaert. “Today, the benefits of Open Source are even more compelling than during past recessions.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Open source contribution also provides an excellent opportunity for individuals to expand their skills—or even re-skill—during this time of record unemployment. Drupal has demonstrated once again that the power of community and the open source model make projects like Drupal the best possible investment in uncertain times.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In addition to the #DrupalCares campaign, the majority of original <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/global2020/sponsors\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon 2020 sponsors</a> allowed the Association to retain their sponsorship dollars as the event prepares to shift to its first-ever virtual <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/global2020\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon Global 2020</a>. &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> “Like so many organizations, we had to pivot quickly on a major keystone event, but we also had to pivot quickly on a product launch, as we were planning to introduce Drupal 9, our first major software upgrade in almost five years, at DrupalCon,” says Rocker. “DrupalCon was originally scheduled to host approximately 3,000 attendees in May 2020 in Minneapolis, so we didn’t have time for a ‘wait and see’ approach. I’m grateful to a solid, creative Association staff and the extended leadership of our Drupal community who are willing to do whatever it takes to make this event a success.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> “Additionally, Drupal 9 is scheduled to launch on schedule in early June, which is a testament to how dedicated this community is to continuing to be trailblazers—even now, when a delay caused by these world events would have been no surprise,” said Rocker.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The #DrupalCares fundraising campaign remains active through May 31, 2020.

In addition to <a href=\"https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-april-2018.pdf\">sharing my slides</a>, I wanted to provide more information on how you can participate in the various initiatives presented in my keynote, such as growing Drupal adoption or evolving our community values and principles.</p> \n    <h3>Drupal 8 update</h3> \n    <p>During the first portion of my presentation, I provided an overview of Drupal 8 updates. Last month, the Drupal community celebrated an important milestone with the successful <a href=\"https://dri.es/drupal-8-5-0-released\">release of Drupal 8.5</a>, which ships with improved features for content creators, site builders, and developers.</p> \n    <p>Drupal 8 continues to gain momentum, as the number of Drupal 8 sites has grown 51 percent year-over-year:</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Drupal 8 site growth\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-8-site-growth-742x1114.jpg\" width=\"742\" /></p> \n    <p><em>This graph depicts the number of Drupal 8 sites built since April 2015. Last year there were 159,000 sites and this year there are 241,000 sites, representing a 51% increase year-over-year.</em></p> \n    <p>Drupal 8's module ecosystem is also maturing quickly, as 81 percent more Drupal 8 modules have become stable in the past year:</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Drupal 8 module readiness\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-8-module-readiness-742x1114.jpg\" width=\"742\" /></p> \n    <p><em>This graph depicts the number of modules now stable since January 2016. This time last year there were 1,028 stable projects and this year there are 1,860 stable projects, representing an 81% increase year-over-year.</em></p> \n    <p>As you can see from the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/roadmap\">Drupal 8 roadmap</a>, improving the ease of use for content creators remains our top priority:</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Drupal 8 roadmap\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-8-roadmap-742x1114.jpg\" width=\"742\" /></p> \n    <p><em>This roadmap depicts Drupal 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7+, along with a column for \"wishlist\" items that are not yet formally slotted.

It was time to take a step back and assess additional growth initiatives based on what we have learned so far.</p> \n    <p>In an effort to better understand the biggest hurdles facing Drupal adoption, we interviewed over 150 individuals around the world that hold different roles within the community. We talked to Drupal front-end and back-end developers, contributors, trainers, agency owners, vendors that sell Drupal to customers, end users, and more. Based on their feedback, we established four goals to help accelerate Drupal adoption.</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Lets grow Drupal together\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/lets-grow-drupal-together-742x1114.jpg\" width=\"742\" /></p> \n    <h4>Goal 1: Improve the technical evaluation process</h4> \n    <p>Matthew Grasmick recently completed an exercise in which he <a href=\"http://matthewgrasmick.com/compare-php-frameworks\">assessed the technical evaluator experience of four different PHP frameworks</a>, and discovered that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E34hSVFE94\">Drupal required the most steps to install</a>. Having <a href=\"https://dri.es/three-ways-we-can-improve-drupal-evaluator-experience\">a good technical evaluator experience is critical</a>, as it has a direct impact on adoption rates.</p> \n    <p>To improve the Drupal evaluation process, we've proposed the following initiatives:</p> \n    <table>\n     <thead>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Initiative</td> \n       <td>Issue link</td> \n       <td>Stakeholders</td> \n       <td>Initiative coordinator</td> \n       <td>Status</td> \n      </tr>\n     </thead>\n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Better discovery experience on Drupal.org</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/roadmap\">Drupal.org roadmap</a></td> \n       <td>Drupal Association</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/hestenet\">hestenet</a></td> \n       <td>Under active development</td> \n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Better \"getting started\" documentation</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2956879\">#2956879</a></td> \n       <td>Documentation Working Group</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/grasmash\">grasmash</a></td> \n       <td>In planning</td> \n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td>More modern administration experience</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2957457\">#2957457</a></td> \n       <td>Core contributors</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/ckrina\">ckrina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/yoroy\">yoroy</a></td> \n       <td>Under active development</td> \n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>To become involved with one of these initiatives, click on its \"Issue link\" in the table above. This will take you to Drupal.org, where you can contribute by sharing your ideas or lending your expertise to move an initiative forward.</p> \n    <h4>Goal 2: Improve the content creator experience</h4> \n    <p>Throughout the interview process, it became clear that ease of use is a feature now expected of all technology. For Drupal, this means improving the content creator experience through a modern administration user interface, drag-and-drop media management and page building, and improved site preview functionality.</p> \n    <p>The good news is that all of these features are already under development through the <a href=\"https://dri.es/an-update-on-the-media-initiative-for-drupal-8-4-8-5\">Media</a>, <a href=\"https://dri.es/an-update-on-the-workflow-initiative-for-drupal-8-4-8-5\">Workflow</a>, <a href=\"https://dri.es/an-update-on-the-layout-initiative-for-drupal-8-4-8-5\">Layout</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2926656\">JavaScript Modernization</a> initiatives.</p> \n    <p>Most of these initiative teams meet weekly on <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/slack\">Drupal Slack</a> (see the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=happypunch.com_eq0e09s0kvcs7v5scdi8f8cm70%40group.calendar.google.com\">meetings calendar</a>), which gives community members an opportunity to meet team members, receive information on current goals and priorities, and volunteer to contribute code, testing, design, communications, and more.</p> \n    <h4>Goal 3: Improve the site builder experience</h4> \n    <p>Our research also showed that to improve the site builder experience, we should focus on improving the three following areas:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The configuration management capabilities in core need to support more common use cases out-of-the-box.</li> \n     <li>Composer and Drupal core should be better integrated to empower site builders to manage dependencies and keep Drupal sites up-to-date.</li> \n     <li>We should provide a longer grace period between required core updates so development teams have more time to prepare, test, and upgrade their Drupal sites after each new minor Drupal release.</li> \n    </ul>\n    <p>We plan to make all of these aspects easier for site builders through the following initiatives:</p> \n    <table>\n     <thead>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Initiative</td> \n       <td>Issue link</td> \n       <td>Stakeholders</td> \n       <td>Initiative coordinator</td> \n       <td>Status</td> \n      </tr>\n     </thead>\n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Composer &amp; Core</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2958021\">#2958021</a></td> \n       <td>Core contributors + Drupal Association</td> \n       <td>Coordinator needed!</td> \n       <td>Proposed</td> \n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Config Management 2.0</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2957423\">#2957423</a></td> \n       <td>Core contributors</td> \n       <td>Coordinator needed!</td> \n       <td>Proposed</td> \n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td>Security LTS</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2909665\">2909665</a></td> \n       <td>Core committers + Drupal Security Team + Drupal Association</td> \n       <td>Core committers and Security team</td> \n       <td>Proposed, under discussion</td> \n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <h4>Goal 4: Promote Drupal to non-technical decision makers</h4> \n    <p>The fourth initiative is unique as it will help our community to better communicate the value of Drupal to the non-technical decision makers. Today, marketing executives and content creators often influence the decision behind what CMS an organization will use. However, many of these individuals are not familiar with Drupal or are discouraged by the misconception that Drupal is primarily for developers.</p> \n    <p>With these challenges in mind, the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association\">Drupal Association</a> has launched the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/promotedrupal\">Promote Drupal Initiative</a>. This initiative will include building stronger marketing and branding, demos, events, and public relations resources that digital agencies and local associations can use to promote Drupal. The Drupal Association has set a goal of fundraising $100,000 to support this initiative, including the hiring of a marketing coordinator.</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"$54k raised for the Promote Drupal initiative\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/54k-raised-for-the-promote-drupal-initiative-742x1114.jpg\" width=\"742\" /></p> \n    <p>Megan Sanicki and her team have already raised $54,000 from over 30 agencies and 5 individual sponsors in only 4 days. Clearly this initiative resonates with Drupal agencies. Please consider how you or your organization can contribute.</p> \n    <h3>Fostering community with values and principles</h3> \n    <p>This year at DrupalCon Nashville, over 3,000 people traveled to the Music City to collaborate, learn, and connect with one another. It's at events like DrupalCon where the impact of our community becomes tangible for many. It also serves as an important reminder that while Drupal has grown a great deal since the early days, the work needed to scale our community is never done.</p> \n    <p>Prompted by feedback from our community, I have spent the past five months trying to better establish the <a href=\"https://dri.es/defining-drupal-values-and-principles\">Drupal community's principles and values</a>. I have shared an \"alpha\" version of Drupal's values and principles at <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles\">https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles</a>. As a next step, I will be drafting a charter for a new working group that will be responsible for maintaining and improving our values and principles. In the meantime, I invite every community member to provide feedback in <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/governance\">the issue queue of the Drupal governance project</a>.</p> \n    <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Values and principles alpha\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/values-and-principles-1-0-alpha-742x1114_0.jpg\" width=\"742\" /></p> \n    <p><em>An overview of Drupal's values with supporting principles.</em></p> \n    <p>I believe that taking time to highlight community members that exemplify each principle can make the proposed framework more accessible. That is why it was very meaningful for me to spotlight three Drupal community members that demonstrate these principles.</p> \n    <h4>Principle 1: Optimize for Impact - Rebecca Pilcher</h4> \n    <p>Rebecca shares a remarkable story about Drupal's impact on her Type 1 diabetes diagnosis:</p> \n    <iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNatUGl9trE\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n    <h4>Principle 5: Everyone has something to contribute - Mike Lamb</h4> \n    <p>Mike explains why Pfizer contributes millions to Drupal:</p> \n    <iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/diP95t6dto0\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n    <h4>Principle 6: Choose to Lead - Mark Conroy</h4> \n    <p>Mark tells the story of his own Drupal journey, and how his experience inspired him to help other community members:</p> \n    <iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGNAPvBLvdE\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n    <h3>Watch the keynote or download my slides</h3> \n    <p>In addition to the community spotlights, you can also watch a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HkOdpNT8Ec?start=1170\">recording of my keynote</a> (starting at 19:25), or you can <a href=\"https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-april-2018.pdf\">download a copy of my slides</a> (164 MB).</p> \n    <iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HkOdpNT8Ec?start=1170\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n   </div> \n   <div class=\"entry__meta__date\"></div> \n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 16:11:49 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"https://www.drupal.org/files/cowboy-dries-at-drupalcon-nashville-742x1114.jpg","linkMd5":"ae0dc353af7e61940090a75f6b205782","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-12-20-324_0cec2f37f9944f04.webp","destWidth":742,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":80134,"destBytes":50936,"author":"Dries","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.drupal.org/files/cowboy-dries-at-drupalcon-nashville-742x1114.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-12-20-324_0cec2f37f9944f04.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-8-site-growth-742x1114.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-43-100_7308f0f1a1794744.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-8-module-readiness-742x1114.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-43-240_e24be7057b1884fd.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-8-roadmap-742x1114.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-12-42-867_3d481e7cbedecdaf.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/lets-grow-drupal-together-742x1114.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-43-770_fbb470dc8fabb81a.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/54k-raised-for-the-promote-drupal-initiative-742x1114.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-42-937_63f10a0676f6ffa1.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/values-and-principles-1-0-alpha-742x1114_0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn61@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-12-42-958_da7ac0b1611c2e71.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733343},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"Kevin Thull, from behind the camera","link":"https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/community-spotlight/2018-04-24/kevin-thull-from-behind-the-camera","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\">\n   <p><img alt=\"Kevin Thull holding Aaron Winborn award\" class=\"right\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Kevin_thull_web_1.jpg\" width=\"350\" />Chances are if you've attended any of the Drupal camps in North America you've run into <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/kthull\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kevin Thull</a>. He's the fellow that is dashing from room to room before the first session begins to set up the AV equipment and checking in with presenters making sure they all \"push the red button\". Because of him, we are all able attend the sessions we miss while busy elsewhere. He is personally responsible for recording over 800 sessions and donating countless hours of his time.</p> \n   <p>Not only does he record sessions at camps, he also helps organize Midwest Drupal Camp. For this next year he has been charged as their fearless leader. He will be working on their web team, arranging catering, organizing the venue, as well as doing all the audio visual.</p> \n   <p>This year at DrupalCon Nashville the Drupal Community awarded Kevin the Aaron Winborn award. The Aaron Winborn award is presented annually to an individual who demonstrates personal integrity, kindness, and above-and-beyond commitment to the Drupal community. Kevin's commitment to capturing knowledge to share with the whole community is truly inspirational. He has provided a platform that helps tie local Drupal Communities together.</p> \n   <p>The Drupal Community Spotlight Committee's AmyJune Hineline (<a href=\"http://www.drupal.org/u/volkswagenchick\" rel=\"nofollow\">volkswagenchick on drupal.org</a>)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>sat with Kevin before Nashville and asked him some questions about contributing to the Drupal Community.</p> \n   <p>Ironically, AmyJune&nbsp;had chosen to write this spotlight on Kevin a few weeks before DrupalCon. AmyJune&nbsp;had asked him if he was coming to Nashville and he relayed that he had a prior commitment to attend another conference for his job. Unbeknownst to us, during the interview Kevin knew he had been awarded the honor and managed to keep it a secret. While he did mention that the marketing conference only ran through Wednesday, AmyJune was pleasantly surprised to see him take the stage.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>Well, not too surprised, after all he truly deserves the honor.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p><strong>How long have you been involved in the Drupal community?</strong></p> \n   <p>I’m not involved with Drupal through my employer, I work in Marketing, but I got into Drupal through freelance.</p> \n   <p>My first meet up was when the Using Drupal 6 book first came out. I would say that is when I first started getting involved in the community. So, that's close to 10 years now.</p> \n   <p>I started recording Drupal Camps back in 2013. The official Chicago Camp was having issues and so we as a far western Suburban group decided to have our own camp. I thought I could do some of the logistics and session recordings since that's what I do for work. I had the same setup with video cameras in the back of the room and I spent countless hours rebuilding these presentations. It's a similar process, but it's a very a different presentation between a marketer and someone from the Drupal community giving a presentation on diversity. A marketer might have 20 slides, but a Drupal talk may have 104.</p> \n   <p>Everybody at the time was telling me I was insane for doing this, but my response was, \"Nope, it's important.\"</p> \n   <p>In 2014 was the first MIDCamp and we were able to get the DA recording kits. But that was not great either. There was a lot of setup, they were expensive to ship them back and forth, they didn't work terribly well, so that's when Avi Schwab ( <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/froboy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.drupal.org/u/froboy</a>) and I started collaborating. He did all the setup for the laptops and I did all the running around from room to room and post production. We brainstormed and I started doing research. The next Suburban Camp is when I had my first test kit for what I am using today.</p> \n   <p><strong>I saw that you recorded Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit remotely this year? Can you share that experience with us?</strong></p> \n   <p>That's a funny story. It was the same weekend as Jersey Camp and I tend to favor camps I have already recorded. They had committed before Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit and when Amber Matz saw me at BADCAmp, I explained the conflict. I told her I had started working on the next step and would be shipping the kits to camps. I sat with her and showed her how the kit worked and she said it didn't seem too difficult, and we said \"Let's do this\".</p> \n   <p>I got a new case, sent 5 kits to them. It's funny how talking with the organizers of camps helps all of this come together. Because later at New England Camp, I was explaining to one of their organizers how I was shipping kits and he suggested labeling the cables. I thought that was brilliant so I got a label maker and labeled all the cables. I wrote out more a detailed instruction guide, and all these things were things I had been meaning to do.</p> \n   <p>I sent 5 kits, insured FedEx for around $50, whereas the DA sends this giant pelican case that must cost hundreds of dollars. That was part of the plan originally; we wanted something lightweight and easy to use. I heard they had an 84% capture rate which is a great start. The issue is that non-Macs recordings have no sound and so I have to lay up the backup recording into the video. A lot of times that back up recorder gets turned off or stopped for some reason.</p> \n   <p>While I was in Florida I started working on pinpointing why non-Mac machines don't have audio. Later, I had mixed success at MIDCamp, I captured a couple, some didn't work, one being an Ubuntu build. At lunch I worked with that presenter to test various setups and we found a setup that worked. Once I can crack that nut, then shipping with even more instructions will increase the capture rates.</p> \n   <p><strong>Now that you're capturing some camps remote, how does that cut into how much you like to travel?</strong></p> \n   <p>I do like to travel, but there are a couple of issues. A) I can't be everywhere. B) I am potentially doing 13 or 14 camps this year. Which is cool now, but it may not be cool in couple of years. And C) I don't do Drupal at work and when I first starting doing this I was using all my PTO. I don’t do any Drupal at work, but I brought back all kinds of information and my boss recognized that. She said I could count those as remote days, but of course there's a limit.</p> \n   <p>There is a balance to be found between visiting the camps and sending the kits remotely.</p> \n   <p><strong>What are some of your favorite camps?</strong></p> \n   <p>Everybody asks me that, that question is not fair. I like them all. It's generally the places I know the most people and/or I go ahead of time to play before camp starts. I am not a solo traveller, so if I know a lot of people at the camp I tend to like those: Badcamp, Twin Cities, St. Louis, Texas (cuz of Austin), and Montreal.</p> \n   <p><strong>What are the things you like to do before a camp that makes it more fun?</strong></p> \n   <p>HaHaHa, eat and drink all the things. Bar Crawls, Food Crawls, you name it.</p> \n   <p><strong>Have you given any thought to helping with camps outside the States?</strong></p> \n   <p>I would like to, but it’s a time and cost issue. The camps now reimburse my travel expenses. To fly to a European camp - I don’t know if that would be in their budget.</p> \n   <p>It’s interesting, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/dinarcon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mauricio Dinarte</a>&nbsp;tailed me for a few camps and he wanted, and he did, get some kits to start recording Nicaragua. One day he tweeted that he saw my kits at Drupal Camp Antwerp. It’s cool to see how these things grow organically. There’s not a camp that goes by where someone from the community doesn’t ask me about how everything works.</p> \n   <h3>Congratulations Kevin!</h3> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>Kevin’s not just the guy who reminds us all to push the red button. He is the guy who loans out his phone when a presenter is doing a live demo and needs an internet hotspot. He is the guy spending hours during and after Drupal Camps piecing together audio and video for maximum quality. The Drupal Community has so much to thank him for, the Aaron Winborn award couldn’t have been awarded to anyone more deserving.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFxLfML0U28&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m59s\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Youtube video screenshot showing Kevin Thulls award acceptance\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Aaron_winborn_Kevin_thull_web_1.png\" width=\"550\" /></a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/nFxLfML0U28?t=3m59s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link to Kevin Thull Youtube acceptance</a></p> \n   <h3>On Kevin, from the community:</h3> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>“It has become a no-brainer to invite Kevin to Florida DrupalCamp and have him record and post all of our sessions online.

Media in Drupal 8.5 supports uploading and playing audio and video files, as well as listing and reusing media.</p> \n   <p>For an optimal user experience, we suggest enhancing the core feature set with the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2860796\" rel=\"nofollow\">rich ecosystem of contributed modules</a> that extends the core Media module. In future releases, we will improve the core user experience with a media library and other tools, add WYSIWYG integration, add support for remote media types like YouTube videos, and provide an upgrade path for existing basic File and Image field data on existing sites.</p> \n   <h3>Settings Tray and Content Moderation now stable</h3> \n   <p>Two experimental modules originally added with Drupal 8.2.0 have been steadily improving in past releases and are now stable. The Settings Tray module provides a quick solution to manage settings in context, such as moving items around in a menu block. The Content Moderation module allows defining content workflow states such as Draft, Archived, and Published, as well as which roles have the ability to move content between states. Drupal 8.5.0 also adds support for <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2950608\" rel=\"nofollow\">translations to be moderated independently</a>.</p> \n   <h3>New experimental Layout Builder module</h3> \n   <p>The new experimental Layout Builder module provides display layout capabilities for articles, pages, user profiles, and other entity displays. Layout Builder uses the same \"<a href=\"https://dri.es/examples-of-how-to-make-drupal-outside-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">outside-in</a>\" user interface that Settings Tray module does, allowing site builders to edit their layouts on the actual page (rather than having to go to a separate form on the backend). The current user interface is a basic implementation but we expect it will improve significantly in the coming months.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Demonstration of placing blocks with the Layout Builder\" height=\"1275\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/umami-8.5-layout-builder.gif\" width=\"1445\" /></p> \n   <h3>Big steps for migrations</h3> \n   <p>After over four years of work, this release marks the Migrate system's architecture stable. The Drupal Migrate and Drupal Migrate UI modules are also considered stable for upgrading monolingual sites. (Multilingual site upgrades are still not fully supported.) Support for incremental migrations is also included in this release. See <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/big-steps-for-migrations-in-drupal-850\" rel=\"nofollow\">the migrate announcement for further details on migrating to Drupal 8</a>.</p> \n   <h3>BigPipe by default</h3> \n   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/bigpipe/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">BigPipe module</a> provides an advanced implementation of Facebook's BigPipe page rendering strategy for greatly improved perceived performance for pages with dynamic, personalized, or uncacheable content. The module was added in Drupal 8.1.0 experimentally and became stable in Drupal 8.3.0. Following real-world testing, Big Pipe is now included as part of Drupal 8.5.0's Standard installation profile, so that all Drupal 8 sites will be faster by default. BigPipe is also the first new Drupal 8 feature to mature from an experimental prototype all the way to being part of a standard installation!</p> \n   <h3>Groundwork for a Drupal 8 \"Out of the Box\" demo</h3> \n   <p><img src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/UmamiScreenshot.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Umami Demo\" /></p> \n   <p>Drupal 8.5.0 includes the groundwork for a new demo profile and theme from the Out of the Box Initiative, which will be a beautiful, modern demonstration of Drupal's capabilities. This will allow us to provide the demo experimentally, possibly in a future Drupal 8.5 release. (The demo profile and theme should not be used on actual production or development sites since no backwards compatibility or upgrade paths are provided.) If you'd like to see this demo in action, you can also see it in the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.6.x-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">8.6.x development version</a>.</p> \n   <h3>PHP 7.2 now supported</h3> \n   <p>Drupal 8.5.0 now runs on PHP 7.2, which comes with new features and improves performance over PHP 7.1. PHP 7.2 is now the recommended PHP version to use with Drupal 8.</p> \n   <h2>What does this mean for me?</h2> \n   <h3>Drupal 8 site owners</h3> \n   <p>Update to 8.5.0 to continue receiving bug and security fixes. The next bugfix release (8.5.1) is scheduled for April 4, 2018.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2700999\" rel=\"nofollow\">Updating your site</a> from 8.4.5 to 8.5.0 with update.php is exactly the same as updating from 8.4.4 to 8.4.5. Drupal 8.5.0 also has updates to several dependencies, including a backwards-compatible update to a Symfony long-term-support release (which will be supported for many years). Modules, themes, and translations may need updates for these and other changes in this minor release, so test the update carefully before updating your production site.</p> \n   <p>Note that Drupal 8 will require PHP 7 starting in March 2019, one year from now. If your site is hosted on PHP 5.5 or 5.6, you should begin planning to upgrade (and consider upgrading to PHP 7.2 now that it is supported). See the <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/node/518200\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal core announcement about the PHP 5 end-of-life</a> for more information.</p> \n   <h3>Drupal 6 and 7 site owners</h3> \n   <p>Drupal 7 is still fully supported and will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout all minor releases of Drupal 8. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal 6 is no longer supported</a>. See <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/big-steps-for-migrations-in-drupal-850\" rel=\"nofollow\">the migrate announcement for further details on migrating to Drupal 8</a>.</p> \n   <h3>Translation, module, and theme contributors</h3> \n   <p>Minor releases like Drupal 8.5.0 include backwards-compatible API additions for developers as well as new features. Read the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">8.5.0 release notes</a> for more details on the improvements for developers in this release.</p> \n   <p>Since minor releases are backwards-compatible, modules, themes, and translations that supported Drupal 8.4.x and earlier will be compatible with 8.5.x as well. However, the new version does include some changes to strings, user interfaces, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy\" rel=\"nofollow\">internal APIs</a> and API deprecations. This means that some small updates may be required for your translations, modules, and themes. See the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-850-rc1-is-available-for-testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">announcement of the 8.5.0 release candidate</a> for more background information.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:51:41 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"https://www.drupal.org/files/umami-8.5-layout-builder.gif","linkMd5":"a51fc2bd5f2d80800f37fae87c8b3483","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-39-398_01407fa951a92d04.webp","destWidth":1445,"destHeight":1275,"sourceBytes":7491349,"destBytes":7457590,"author":"Gábor Hojtsy","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.drupal.org/files/umami-8.5-layout-builder.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-39-398_01407fa951a92d04.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/UmamiScreenshot.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-43-988_067c1d4fb97fc3ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733343},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"Remembering Rachel Olivero","link":"https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/community-spotlight/2019-02-22/remembering-rachel-olivero","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\"> \n   <p>\n    <figure class=\"image right\">\n     <img alt=\"Rachel Olivero, smiling in a red dress.\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/rachel_olivero.jpeg\" width=\"275\" />\n     <br />\n     <figcaption>\n      <em>Rachel Olivero, courtesy of National Federation of the Blind</em>\n     </figcaption>\n     <br />\n    </figure></p> \n   <p>Earlier this month we saw the passing of <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/rachelolivero\">Rachel Olivero</a>. Rachel touched a lot of people in both the Drupal and accessibility communities. She worked at the <a href=\"https://nfb.org/\">National Federation of the Blind</a>, as the Director of Organizational Technology. I am not sure that this is where she was first exposed to Drupal, but she became involved in the community after attending DrupalCon in her hometown of Baltimore in 2017. It was there where she participated in her first code sprint and contributed her <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2873389\">first bug report</a>.</p> \n   <p>After attending the first-ever <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/nonprofit-summit\">Nonprofit Summit at DrupalCon Baltimore</a>, Rachel stepped up to lead an accessibility breakout at <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/nonprofit-summit\">DrupalCon Nashville</a>. She was always willing to share her knowledge and never got annoyed no matter how many times she was asked her whether the &lt;aside&gt; element was ever useful to a screen reader. Fortunately, about 20 minutes of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPM69Udod8\">accessibility roundtable was recorded</a>. She engaged with a few folks throughout the week, many remember her from Drupal Trivia Night.</p> \n   <p>As a technical user who was blind, her opinion was sought often in the Slack Channel. She also engaged with the <a href=\"https://www.drupaldiversity.com/\">Drupal Diversity and Inclusion</a> team. &nbsp;Rachel was active in Twitter and other social media platforms too, where she engaged with other members of the Drupal community. As a person who was blind, transgender, and a lesbian, Rachel understood a lot about the importance of diversity.</p> \n   <p>Rachel became involved in the <a href=\"https://www.nten.org/\">NTEN</a> <a href=\"https://www.nten.org/event/community-practice-drupal-community-call/\">Drupal Community of Practice</a> calls a few years ago, when she came on a monthly call to share some accessibility knowledge. Subsequently, she became a more regular attendee of these calls. Johanna Bates and Rachel were slated to co-present a session on accessible content entry for content editors at the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.nten.org/ntc/\">NTEN 19NTC in Portland</a>. This would have been her first ever NTEN NTC.</p> \n   <p>Rachel also served on the <a href=\"https://www.nten.org/ntc/ntc-accessibility-committee/\">NTEN NTC’s first-ever accessibility committee</a>, contributing her knowledge to <a href=\"http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/\">making conferences more accessible</a>. This is a perfect example of how willing Rachel was to share her expertise and experience with others. She was generous with her knowledge, kind, collaborative, and extremely funny. The loss of her warmth, humor, and brilliance in the Drupal community, the nonprofit tech community, and in the a11y community is a massive and sad loss.</p> \n   <p>This fall Rachel contributed an article to the latest 24 accessibility series, <a href=\"https://www.24a11y.com/2018/more-than-just-the-tab-key/\">Not Your Father’s Navigation Strategy: There’s More Than Just the TAB Key</a>. She argued for developers to invest in proper semantic markup so that screen reader users can make full use of their assistive technology. This annual series of articles really draws on a Who's Who of accessibility.</p> \n   <p>Rachel was also the president of the NFB’s Amateur Radio Division. As a modern HAM enthusiast, she was <a href=\"https://github.com/RachelOlivero\">active on GitHub</a> working to create a Software-defined radio (SDR) scanner that could continuously record a set of frequencies for on-demand playback. She was interested in public safety.</p> \n   <p>Rachel had been working on NFB.org’s new Drupal 8 site for a long time. She was so excited to see it launch at the end of January. Rachel had recently been promoted at the NFB to Director of Technology. &nbsp;This launch was a huge piece of her work, and the site looks amazing. It is terrific to see how she was able to modernize the NFB’s website and leverage Drupal to help her create a modern responsive website.</p> \n   <p>As Rachel said in an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nationalfederationoftheblindofmaryland/posts/rachel-olivero-rachel-olivero-as-a-child-i-was-blessed-with-family-that-always-e/1330167303705818/\">NFB Facebook campaign</a>:</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>“I’m lucky, and thankful, that blindness hasn’t caused a lot of resistance in my life. From the support of family during my early years to the encouragement of friends, to the emergency management director who I never saw blink an eye when I said, “I want to take the CERT class. You can teach me to get people out from under a collapsed wall too, right?” to all those who supported my gender transition. I’ve generally never felt that I couldn’t do something as a blind person. However, it’s the love, hope, and determination of my family in the National Federation of the Blind, that has given me the extra strength and answered the, ‘but how do I…” And that is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/whyimafederationist\">#WhyImAFederationist</a>”</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Rachel was also quoted in a very recent Vox.com article by s.e. smith, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/5/18210912/websites-ada-compliance-lawsuits\">Websites need to be more accessible for disabled people</a>. &nbsp;Rachel clearly identified that “Accessibility is still a sidebar when it comes to web development.”</p> \n   <p>A few community members shared memories of Rachel:</p> \n   <p>What I admired most about Rachel was her willingness to help at any level necessary and the kindness with which she acted. &nbsp;She was enthusiastic about building community and eager to contribute. She regularly gave time, experience, resources (like her server space, and other infrastructure) and energy to connecting people and working for a future in which technology would be accessible to all. &nbsp;Her unique perspective brought insight, empathy and patience to her work, and I’m sad that the world has lost such a passionate champion for inclusion.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>- <em>Nikki Stevens (drnikki)</em></p> \n   <hr />\n   <p>Rachel was the kind of person who immediately made you feel at ease when you were spending time with her, even if you had just met. She was great about making sure that nobody got left out, and was quick to invite new or shy people at events who might have eaten alone to come sit with her and her friends instead.</p> \n   <p>She was generous with her time whenever I asked to bounce an idea off of her to see if what I was considering suggesting would actually be helpful for the blind community or not, and she never made me feel like a bother when I asked for her thoughts. To the contrary, she always seemed happy to help. She was encouraging when I was right, and gracious when I was wrong; she never made me feel stupid about an idea if I was off-base, and instead provided valuable insight that I apply to my work to this day.</p> \n   <p>Rachel was an awesome woman, and I wish that we had gotten to spend more time together. The Drupal community (and the world at large) will definitely be feeling her loss. I hope that we can all put what she has given to each of us to good use to carry forward what was always her mission - to make the world better for people.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>- <em>Helena McCabe (helenasue)</em></p> \n   <hr />\n   <p>Rachel Olivero was really an adventurous spirit. I remember a NFB conference several years ago when Rachel mused \"I've always wanted to ride a mechanical bull - y'know do as Texans do in Texas\". &nbsp;After fighting the management of the establishment, who were not inclined to let her ride, she got to ride - for a full 30 seconds:-). Everyone at Deque will miss her. Rachel is an inspiration to all those who strive to be true to themselves and the cause of digital equality.</p> \n   <p>- <em>Preety Kumar</em></p> \n   <hr />\n   <p>In 2007, Rachel was one of the first accessibility experts I worked with after I joined Deque and I was always impressed with her technical strength and her ability to keep people at the center of any discussion. I remember the demonstration she made to Wal-Mart’s checkout team, that the shopping cart was inaccessible. Their response was getting off-track into technical mumbo-jumbo when Rachel loudly interrupted, “excuse me...excuse me. The point is that I want to put money in your pocket but since the shopping cart won’t work for me, I can’t do that. Do you want me to put my money in Target’s pocket instead?!?!” &nbsp;I always enjoyed working with her on any project and will miss her.</p> \n   <p>- <em>Wes Dillon</em></p> \n   <hr />\n   <p>Rachel Olivero will always be an an accessibility super hero to me. From the moment I met her, I knew she was wicked smart and a powerful force for good. She moved a11y forward through her technical work and leadership at NFB and Humana.</p> \n   <p>Every time I hung out with Rachel, I felt like I was on an a11y adventure. She could even make javascript and aria entertaining. I loved how she used quotes from “Green Eggs and Ham” to show how accessible a live chat module could be. She had the whole room laughing and learning. Her joy was contagious and inspiring.</p> \n   <p>Our friendship grew each time we were together...from AHG to NFB to CSUN, to Penn State Web Conf and more. I think some of my favorite memories are from the “accessibility slumber party” at the Margarita Inn with Rachel, Elle, Sharron and others. Elle had brought together a team of a11y experts to solve big problems...we worked night and day...because we care so deeply about equal access for all.</p> \n   <p>A world without Rachel seems impossible to me. And then I remember how with Rachel, nothing seemed impossible. So I guess we all have to find our way to keep Rachel’s positive energy moving forward. Now It is up to each of us to make Rachel’s a11y dreams become a reality.</p> \n   <p>So with that, I raise a glass of cherry coke (one of her favs) and toast “To Rachel! To A11Y &amp; Beyond!”</p> \n   <p>- <em>Glenda Sims</em></p> \n   <hr />\n   <p>I enjoyed talking with Rachel at both of her DrupalCons. We mostly talked shop. I was very impressed with her knowledge and patience dealing with people interested in learning. I remember talking about getting organizations like the NFB to approach technology more as makers than consumers. We also talked about challenges with procurement and the work that she was doing to revise how technology was purchased. She seemed hopeful and focused. She was clearly a big thinker.</p> \n   <p>By being involved in the Drupal community, Rachel reminded a lot of us of the importance of building our tools to work for everyone.</p> \n   <p>We were all looking forward to working with her more. She will be missed.</p> \n   <div class=\"note\"> \n    <p>In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made to the National Federation of the Blind to support projects in which Rachel personally invested her time, treasure, and talent.</p> \n    <p>Contributions can be mailed to National Federation of the Blind, 200 East Wells Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21230, or given online at <a href=\"https://nfb.org/donate\">https://nfb.org/donate</a>.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 14:23:04 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b937b33ffd364ff34bea5c2dba87dd98","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"mgifford","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.drupal.org/files/rachel_olivero.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-42-911_082d8410cbf3846e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733342},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"Plan for Drupal 9","link":"https://www.drupal.org/blog/plan-for-drupal-9","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"> \n <div class=\"field-items\"> \n  <div class=\"field-item even\"> \n   <div class=\"note-tip\"> \n    <p><strong>Update</strong>: Since the publication of this blog Drupal 9 is closer than ever.

Unfortunately Dries' blog does not allow for comments at the moment,&nbsp;feel free to post them here.</em></p> \n   <p>At&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupaleurope.org/\">Drupal Europe</a>, I announced that Drupal 9 will be released in 2020. Although I explained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/drupal-7-8-and-9\">why we plan to release in 2020</a>, I wasn't very specific about when we plan to release Drupal 9 in 2020. Given that 2020 is less than thirteen months away (gasp!), it's time to be more specific.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"1\">Shifting Drupal's six month release cycle</h3> \n   <p><img alt=\"A timeline that shows how we shifted Drupal 8's release windows\" src=\"https://dri.es/files/cache/drupal/drupal-8-shifted-release-windows-640w.jpg\" /></p> \n   <p><em>We shifted Drupal 8's minor release windows so we can adopt Symfony's releases faster.</em></p> \n   <p>Before I talk about the Drupal 9 release date, I want to explain another change we made, which has a minor impact on the Drupal 9 release date.</p> \n   <p>As announced over two years ago,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/the-transformation-of-drupal-8-for-continuous-innovation\">Drupal 8 adopted a 6-month release cycle</a>&nbsp;(two releases a year).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://symfony.com/\">Symfony</a>, a PHP framework which Drupal depends on, uses a similar release schedule. Unfortunately the timing of Drupal's releases has historically occurred 1-2 months before Symfony's releases, which forces us to wait six months to adopt the latest Symfony release. To be able to adopt the latest Symfony releases faster, we are moving Drupal's minor releases to June and December. This will allow us to adopt the latest Symfony releases within one month. For example, Drupal 8.8.0 is now scheduled for December 2019.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"2\">We hope to release Drupal 9 on June 3, 2020</h3> \n   <p>Drupal 8's biggest dependency is Symfony 3, which has an end-of-life date in November 2021. This means that after November 2021, security bugs in Symfony 3 will not get fixed. Therefore, we have to end-of-life Drupal 8 no later than November 2021. Or put differently, by November 2021,&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;should be on Drupal 9.</p> \n   <p>Working backwards from November 2021, we'd like to give site owners at least one year to upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9. While we could release Drupal 9 in December 2020, we decided it was better to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3007300\">try to release Drupal 9 on June 3, 2020</a>. This gives site owners 18 months to upgrade. Plus, it also gives the Drupal core contributors an extra buffer in case we can't finish Drupal 9 in time for a summer release.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"A timeline that shows we hope to release Drupal 9 in June 2020\" src=\"https://dri.es/files/cache/drupal/drupal-9-targeting-june-2020-640w.jpg\" /></p> \n   <p><em>Planned Drupal 8 and 9 minor release dates.</em></p> \n   <h3 id=\"3\">We are building Drupal 9 in Drupal 8</h3> \n   <p>Instead of working on Drupal 9 in a separate codebase, we are building Drupal 9 in Drupal 8. This means that we are adding new functionality as backwards-compatible code and experimental features. Once the code becomes stable, we deprecate any old functionality.</p> \n   <p>Let's look at an example. As mentioned, Drupal 8 currently depends on Symfony 3. Our plan is to release Drupal 9 with Symfony 4 or 5. Symfony 5's release is less than one year away, while Symfony 4 was released a year ago. Ideally Drupal 9 would ship with Symfony 5, both for the latest Symfony improvements and for longer support. However, Symfony 5 hasn't been released yet, so we don't know the scope of its changes, and we will have limited time to try to adopt it before Symfony 3's end-of-life.</p> \n   <p>We are currently working on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2937984\">making it possible to run Drupal 8 with Symfony 4</a>&nbsp;(without requiring it). Supporting Symfony 4 is a valuable stepping stone to Symfony 5 as it brings new capabilities for sites that choose to use it, and it eases the amount of Symfony 5 upgrade work to do for Drupal core developers. In the end, our goal is for Drupal 8 to work with Symfony 3, 4 or 5 so we can identify and fix any issues before we start&nbsp;<em>requiring</em>&nbsp;Symfony 4 or 5 in Drupal 9.</p> \n   <p>Another example is our support for reusable media. Drupal 8.0.0 launched without a media library. We are currently working on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/an-update-on-the-media-initiative-for-drupal-8-4-8-5\">adding a media library to Drupal 8</a>&nbsp;so content authors can select pre-existing media from a library and easily embed them in their posts. Once the media library becomes stable, we can deprecate the use of the old file upload functionality and make the new media library the default experience.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"4\">The upgrade to Drupal 9 will be easy</h3> \n   <p>Because we are building Drupal 9 in Drupal 8, the technology in Drupal 9 will have been battle-tested in Drupal 8.</p> \n   <p>For&nbsp;<strong>Drupal core contributors</strong>, this means that we have a limited set of tasks to do in Drupal 9 itself before we can release it. Releasing Drupal 9 will only depend on removing deprecated functionality and upgrading Drupal's dependencies, such as Symfony. This will make the release timing more predictable and the release quality more robust.</p> \n   <p>For&nbsp;<strong>contributed module authors</strong>, it means they already have the new technology at their service, so they can work on Drupal 9 compatibility earlier (e.g. they can start updating their media modules to use the new media library before Drupal 9 is released). Finally, their Drupal 8 know-how will remain highly relevant in Drupal 9, as there will not be a dramatic change in how Drupal is built.</p> \n   <p>But most importantly, for&nbsp;<strong>Drupal site owners</strong>, this means that it should be much easier to upgrade to Drupal 9 than it was to upgrade to Drupal 8. Drupal 9 will simply be the last version of Drupal 8, with its deprecations removed. This means we will not introduce new, backwards-compatibility breaking APIs or features in Drupal 9 except for our dependency updates. As long as modules and themes stay up-to-date with the latest Drupal 8 APIs, the upgrade to Drupal 9 should be easy. Therefore, we believe that a 12- to 18-month upgrade period should suffice.</p> \n   <h3 id=\"5\">So what is the big deal about Drupal 9, then?</h3> \n   <p>The big deal about Drupal 9 is … that it should not be a big deal. The best way to be ready for Drupal 9 is to keep up with Drupal 8 updates. Make sure you are not using deprecated modules and APIs, and where possible, use the latest versions of dependencies. If you do that, your upgrade experience will be smooth, and that is a big deal for us.</p> \n   <p><em>Special thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy\">Gábor Hojtsy</a>&nbsp;(Acquia),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick\">Angie Byron</a>&nbsp;(Acquia),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/xjm\">xjm</a>(Acquia), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/catch\">catch</a>&nbsp;for their input in this blog post.</em></p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 18:38:05 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"https://dri.es/files/cache/drupal/drupal-8-shifted-release-windows-640w.jpg","linkMd5":"18f6c9373a22bdeb9bd1ba8a9e48350b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-20-271_38f989d0c027623a.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":251,"sourceBytes":22033,"destBytes":16012,"author":"Dries","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dri.es/files/cache/drupal/drupal-8-shifted-release-windows-640w.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-12-20-271_38f989d0c027623a.webp","https://dri.es/files/cache/drupal/drupal-9-targeting-june-2020-640w.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-42-946_578cf577ffd013d2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733342},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"Thunder, the Drupal 8 Distribution for Professional Publishing","link":"https://www.drupal.org/blog/thunder-the-drupal-8-distribution-for-professional-publishing","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\">\n   <blockquote>\n    <p><em><strong>Thunder is proud sponsor of the Media and Publishing Summit ahead of the DrupalCon in Nashville.

Thunder was designed by Hubert Burda Media and released as open-source software under the GNU General Public License in 2016. As members of the Thunder community, publishers, partners, and developers build custom extensions and share them with the community to further enhance Thunder.</p> \n   <p>Thunder consists of the current Drupal 8 functionality, lots of handpicked publisher-centric modules with custom enhancements (our own Thunder Admin Theme, the Paragraphs module, the Media Entity module, the Entity Browser module, and lots more), and an environment which makes it easy to install, deploy and add new functionality (e.g. the Thunder Updater).</p> \n   <p>To learn more about Thunder projects, read these case studies: German magazine Mein Schöner Garten (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/case-study/gardening-magazine-for-hubert-burda-media\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gardening Magazine for Hubert Burda Media</a>), US magazine American Heritage (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/case-study/american-heritage-magazine-migration-drupal-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Heritage Magazine Migration – Drupal 8</a>), and Serbian television and radio station PannonRTV (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/case-study/news-portal-for-media-house-pannonrtv\" rel=\"nofollow\">News portal for media house – PannonRTV</a>).</p> \n   <h4>About the idea:</h4> \n   <p>We at the Thunder Core Team believe that publishers do not compete with each other through technology, but rather through content and brands. That is why the German publisher Hubert Burda Media established the Thunder community which aims to join forces among media companies by sharing code and innovation power. The goal is to innovate faster and spend less money overall by working together.</p> \n   <p>The Thunder community’s core product is the open-source content management system Thunder. Community members develop useful modules, use them for their own purposes and share them with the community by publishing them under the GNU General Public License. Neither Hubert Burda Media nor the other publishers in the community charge anyone for their contributions.</p> \n   <p>Any company publishing content professionally is welcome as a member of the Thunder community - both as user and as contributor. Anyone can join by contributing to the distribution. The usefulness and richness of Thunder’s functionality directly benefit from the number of contributors.</p> \n   <h3>Why Drupal was chosen:&nbsp;</h3> \n   <p>For Burda, Drupal is the content management platform of choice. It is a free and open-source content-management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License.</p> \n   <p>The standard Drupal core already provides the essential features, e.g. user management, menu management, RSS feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. It is easily adaptable and extensible with thousands of modules provided by a global community of users and developers. In addition, developers at Hubert Burda Media have had previous good experiences with Drupal. Drupal is therefore a tried and tested basis and has become even better with Drupal 8.</p> \n   <h3>Describe the project (goals, requirements and outcome):&nbsp;</h3> \n   <p>Thunder started as a way to share innovation and synergies among the many different brands and products within the Burda Corporation to save costs and speed up the time to market. It did not take long until we realized that the model that worked within the very diverse Burda universe would be useful for almost all digital publishers. That was when we decided to open source the distribution.</p> \n   <p>Due to its open source basis on Drupal 8, all features and functionality within Thunder are available to anyone wishing to benefit from Burda’s industry experience. Individual brands can add modules to tailor the system to their specific needs. Many of those “specific” customizations will prove to be valuable to more than just the organizations they originated from. We therefore designed Thunder in a way that we can easily incorporate those add-ons into the main distribution and share the features among all brands.</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Thunder2.png\" width=\"620\" /></p> \n   <h4>Goals:</h4> \n   <p>We aim at becoming the best open-source content management system for professional publishing. In this, we focus on the creation of content. We want to help editors to create articles, to add media, to build landing pages, in short, to share their stories with the world.<br /> We want Thunder to be a CMS jointly developed by its users and are therefore working towards building a community of publishers, IT agencies, and anyone else who shares our ideas and contributes to Thunder.</p> \n   <p>Our aim in doing so is to stay very close to the Drupal community and the Drupal core instead of creating a Thunder fork. Whenever we want to implement a new functionality or solve a problem, we try to do this in Drupal core or in the modules Thunder uses instead of fixing things in the distribution.</p> \n   <h4>Time spent:</h4> \n   <p>It’s difficult to measure the time spent on the development of Thunder, as this is an ongoing process. Currently, there are four developers employed by Hubert Burda Media working on the distribution full-time, plus several external developers. They focus on the advancement of Thunder as well as Drupal core and the contrib modules used in the distribution. A community manager is working on coordinating and growing the Thunder community of publishers, developers, and other partners.</p> \n   <h4>Timeline and Milestones:</h4> \n   <ul>\n    <li>30th August 2015: Repository and first commits for Thunder</li> \n    <li>September 2015: playboy.de – the first website running on Thunder</li> \n    <li>November 2015: instyle.de – the second website running on Thunder as well as proof of concept of the sharing model</li> \n    <li>17th March 2016: Official press release about Thunder</li> \n    <li>October 2016: produceretailer.com is the first professional non-Burda website running on Thunder</li> \n    <li>30th January 2017: Release of Thunder 1.0</li> \n    <li>March 2016: One year after the official launch of the Thunder initiative, 15 websites (we know of) are running on Thunder.</li> \n    <li>1st June 2017: Release of Thunder 2.0</li> \n    <li>20th July 2017: Release of Thunder Admin Theme</li> \n    <li>20th November 2017: First community event, the Thunder Day in Hamburg</li> \n   </ul>\n   <h4>Results:</h4> \n   <p>We released Thunder 1.0 in January 2017. One year later, at least 60 professional websites that we know of now run on Thunder. In the meantime, we have also released Thunder 2.0 and the Thunder Admin Theme.</p> \n   <p>Publishing houses grabbed the idea of working together. The Austrian publisher kurier.at, for example, contributed to the liveblog module used in Thunder and developed a new functionality to split text paragraphs.</p> \n   <p>In community matters, we talked to more than 300 companies worldwide. We established the “Certified Thunder Integrator” program to help publishers to find IT agencies as well as IT agencies to find customers. As of now, there are more than 20 companies certified or in the certification process.</p> \n   <p>We aim at bringing people together to share experiences. For this purpose, we introduced a Slack team for the Thunder community as well as several social media accounts. Furthermore, we organized the first community event – the Thunder Day – with around 120 participants in November 2017.</p> \n   <h4>Challenges and how we resolved them:</h4> \n   <h5></h5> \n   <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/thunder4.png\" width=\"620\" /></p> \n   <h5>Updating:</h5> \n   <p>Distributions such as Thunder face the problem of losing control after the installation. How should a distribution actually deliver features and updates? We thought a lot about this problem and introduced the Thunder Updater, the “Thunder way to keep your site up to date”. Thunder checks if installed configurations have been changed – if not, they can be updated. Otherwise, you will get a message telling you there’s an update pending and what to do if you wish to have it. This functionality is currently an integral part of the distribution but we plan to detach it and publish it as a module on drupal.org soon so that everybody can use it.</p> \n   <h5>Testing:</h5> \n   <p>Writing an Admin Theme is very difficult because Drupal offers so many possibilities to adapt things: If you change something it can have unexpected effects in unexpected places. To avoid surprises, we developed Sharpeye, a visual regression tool. It takes screenshots and compares them in automated tests. This gives us a good overview. We open sourced the tool and you can download it here: github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/sharpeye</p> \n   <h4>Technical details, tips, and tricks:</h4> \n   <h5>Tooling:</h5> \n   <p>We invested a lot of time into automated testing but it was well worth the effort, not only for Thunder but also for Drupal core and the contrib modules we use since we discovered a lot of bugs there too.</p> \n   <h5>Development process:</h5> \n   <p>We don’t use a closed issue tracker but publish our tickets on drupal.org, thereby creating transparency. We use Github rather than drupal.org for the development because the developer experience is much better.</p> \n   <h3>Organizations involved:&nbsp;</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/thunder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunder</a></p> \n   <p>Modules/Themes/Distributions</p> \n   <h3>Key modules/theme/distribution used:&nbsp;</h3> \n   <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paragraphs</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/media_entity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Media entity</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">Entity Browser</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder_admin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunder Admin Theme</a></li> \n   </ul>\n   <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Thunder3.png\" width=\"620\" /></p> \n   <h3>Why these modules/theme/distribution were chosen:&nbsp;</h3> \n   <h3>Requirements / Key modules</h3> \n   <h4>Storytelling</h4> \n   <p>In professional publishing, it’s all about the story. It has to be easy to create a story, to extend it, to change its narrative strand, and to enrich it with multimedia content. We use the Paragraphs module for this. Instead of putting all their content in one WYSIWYG body field including images and videos, end-users can now choose on the fly between pre-defined Paragraph Types independent from one another. Paragraph Types can be anything you want from a simple text block or image to a complex and configurable slideshow. This allows editors to structure an article into sub-elements which can easily be created, edited, and reorganized.</p> \n   <h4>Media Handling</h4> \n   <p>Editors want to enrich their articles with pictures, videos, content from social media, and whatever else you might think of. Paragraphs are one part of this, the other is the combination of the Media Entity module and the Entity Browser module. With those modules, editors can easily upload new content but also find and reuse existing entities.</p> \n   <h4>SEO</h4> \n   <p>Search engine optimization plays a major role in every editor’s life. Thunder therefore gas a plethora of different adjusting screws, from several meta tags for Facebook, Twitter, and Open Graph up to the simple XML sitemap.</p> \n   <h4>Scheduled Publishing</h4> \n   <p>The editor’s daily life is a lot about planning. With Thunder, you can schedule articles, ensuring they will be published at a given date and time. Even more importantly, you can also schedule the time at which an article or a picture should not be shown on the website anymore, e.g. if the contract period for a photograph has ended or an event announcement isn’t useful anymore.</p> \n   <h4>Improved Authoring Experience</h4> \n   <p>Our primary focus is making the editors’ work with Thunder as easy as possible. In order to achieve this, we created the Thunder Admin Theme based on findings of user tests and a survey conducted with editors working with Thunder.</p> \n   <h4>Detailed Module List</h4> \n   <p>Find a detailed list of the modules we use in Thunder here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://burdamagazinorg.github.io/thunder-documentation/modules\" rel=\"nofollow\">burdamagazinorg.github.io/thunder-documentation/modules</a></p> \n   <h3>Community contributions:&nbsp;</h3> \n   <p>Since we get a lot from the Drupal community, we give our best to contribute back, e.g. by fixing the bugs we find through automated tests and by supporting Drupal events and code sprints with developer time, talks, and sponsoring. Christian Fritsch, a member of the Thunder Core Team, contributed a lot of his time to the media initiative.

The top 10 winners shown on each leaderboard will be entered to win a handcrafted Drupal prize (<em>hint:</em> it might be pictured in this photo)!&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>#GivingTuesday</p> \n   <p><img alt=\"Opening reception with dasjo and lizzjoy in DrupalCon Seattle. photo by hussainweb\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/46661625495_12c388c4f3_c.jpg\" width=\"501\" /><br /><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/hussainweb/46661625495/\" rel=\"nofollow\">photo from DrupalCon Seattle</a> opening reception by Hussain Abbas (hussainweb)</em><br /></p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 22:13:27 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7938b0b9fcc94c507fa733bc11fa66a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"lizzjoy","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.drupal.org/files/Global%20Logo_0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-42-913_1ecfae739e4d852a.webp","https://www.drupal.org/files/46661625495_12c388c4f3_c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn48@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-12-43-006_a810841d4837948f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733341},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"Implementation Guide on Headless and Decoupled CMS","link":"https://www.drupal.org/association/supporters/blog/implementation-guide-on-headless-and-decoupled-cms","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\">\n   <p><em>The following blog was written by Drupal Association Signature Hosting Supporter,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/open-social\" rel=\"nofollow\">A</a><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/acquia\" rel=\"nofollow\">cquia</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> \n   <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/Drupal-%20Coupled%20vs.%20Decoupled.png\" width=\"1000\" /></p> \n   <p>The rapid evolution of diverse end-user clients and applications has given rise to a dizzying array of digital channels to support.</p> \n   <p>Websites in the past were built from monolithic architectures utilizing web content management solutions that deliver content through a templating solution tightly “coupled” with the content management system on the back-end.</p> \n   <p>Agile organizations crave flexibility, and strive to manage structured content across different presentation layers consistently in a way that’s scalable.</p> \n   <p>Accomplishing this efficiently requires that teams have flexibility in the front-end frameworks that dominate the modern digital landscape.

After all,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line\">Gutenberg's lack of accessibility has been a big topic of debate</a>, and a point of frustration in the WordPress community.</p> \n   <p>I understand why organizations might be tempted to de-prioritize accessibility. Making a complex web application accessible can be a lot of work, and the pressure to ship early can be high.</p> \n   <p>In the past, I've been tempted to skip accessibility features myself. I believed that because accessibility features benefited a small group of people only, they could come in a follow-up release.</p> \n   <p>Today, I've come to believe that accessibility is not something you do for a small group of people. Accessibility is about promoting inclusion. When the product you use daily is accessible, it means that we all get to work with a greater number and a greater variety of colleagues. Accessibility benefits everyone.</p> \n   <p>As you can see in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles\">Drupal's Values and Principles</a>, we are committed to building software that everyone can use. Accessibility should always be a priority. Making capabilities like the Layout Builder accessible is core to Drupal's DNA.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles\">Drupal's Values and Principles</a>&nbsp;translate into our development process, as what we call an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/gates#accessibility\">accessibility gate</a>, where we set a clearly defined \"must-have bar.\" Prioritizing accessibility also means that we commit to trying to iteratively improve accessibility beyond that minimum over time.</p> \n   <p>Together with the accessibility maintainers, we jointly agreed that:</p> \n   <ol>\n    <li>Our first priority is&nbsp;<strong>WCAG 2.0 AA conformance</strong>. This means that in order to be released as a stable system, the Layout Builder must reach Level AA conformance with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a>. Without WCAG 2.0 AA conformance, we won't release a stable version of Layout Builder.</li> \n    <li>Our next priority is&nbsp;<strong>WCAG 2.1 AA conformance</strong>. We're thrilled at the greater inclusion provided by these new guidelines, and will strive to achieve as much of it as we can before release. Because these guidelines are still new (formally approved in June 2018), we won't hold up releasing the stable version of Layout Builder on them, but are committed to implementing them as quickly as we're able to, even if some of the items are after initial release.</li> \n    <li>While&nbsp;<strong>WCAG AAA conformance</strong>&nbsp;is not something currently being pursued, there are aspects of AAA that we are discussing adopting in the future. For example, the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/2928103\">2.1 AAA \"Animations from Interactions\"</a>, which can be framed as an achievable design constraint: anywhere an animation is used, we must ensure designs are understandable/operable for those who cannot or choose not to use animations.</li> \n   </ol>\n   <p>Drupal's commitment to accessibility is one of the things that makes Drupal's upcoming Layout Builder special: it will not only bring&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dri.es/why-drupal-layout-builder-is-so-unique-and-powerful\">tremendous and new capabilities</a>&nbsp;to Drupal, it will also do so without excluding a large portion of current and potential users. We all benefit from that!</p> \n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 19:58:14 +0000","feedId":6817,"bgimg":"https://www.drupal.org/files/figure-opening-doors-Driesblog.jpg","linkMd5":"ae8d15cea9f6336132eb18b0143eeae3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn75@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-20-431_037509ed213e5965.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":25585,"destBytes":10214,"author":"Dries","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.drupal.org/files/figure-opening-doors-Driesblog.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn75@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-12-20-431_037509ed213e5965.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310733342},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:12:13","title":"Meet us at Booth 3 at DrupalCon Amsterdam","link":"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/meet-us-at-booth-3-at-drupalcon-amsterdam","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\">\n   <p><img alt=\"Delona at Drupal Association table at GovCon 2019\" class=\"right\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/delona_association_booth_at_govcon_2019.png\" width=\"400\" /></p> \n   <p>Our staff will be at <em>Booth 3</em> ready to talk with you about the Drupal community, how you can get more involved as a contributor, and to hear about your needs.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Make sure you....</p> \n   <p>✓ pick up some Drupal stickers</p> \n   <p>✓ show your support by signing up for membership or partner programs</p> \n   <h2><img alt=\"DrupalCon sticker - be inspired\" class=\"right\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/drupalcon_nashville_be_inspired.png\" width=\"300\" />Session highlights</h2> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Tuesday at 16h15, in G107, attend the Drupal Association Townhall with our Executive Director Heather Rocker (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/hrocker\" rel=\"nofollow\">hrocker</a>), CTO Tim Lehnen (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/hestenet\" rel=\"nofollow\">hestenet</a>), and our Board Chair Adam Goodman (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/adamgoodman\" rel=\"nofollow\">adamgoodman</a>).

He went on to participate in two Drupal Camps as well thus far. It’s been these in-person experiences that left a lasting impression.</p> \n   <p>“It’s a great feeling to walk up to the maintainer of a project you use every single day and ask them a question,” he says.</p> \n   <p>This feeling was amplified at the New Jersey Drupal Camp afterparty earlier this year, when he met people and they all spontaneously opened up their computers and worked on a Drupal Core issue that had come up in conversation.</p> \n   <p>“I realized that I could probably learn a lot about Drupal from the people at the table,” [who he offers a ‘shout out’ to: @traviscarden, @bnjmnm, @tedbow, and @jrockowitz], “and I wanted to do more than build sites with Drupal—I wanted to help build Drupal. They were kind enough to show me their process.</p> \n   <p>Travis Carden notes: “What I thought was particularly compelling about his story was the fact that he didn't previously view himself as a potential Drupal contributor. He said, ‘I would like to <em>someday</em> be able to contribute.’ But he was eagerly received by the group of us.”&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>Their conversation continued on Slack:</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><a href=\"https://app.slack.com/team/U5BKZ1RQ9\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Travis Carden</strong></a> I don't know if you already saw it or not, but your Drupal core patch got committed the same night:<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3110525\" rel=\"nofollow\"> https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3110525</a> It now appears on your profile:<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/pekens\" rel=\"nofollow\"> https://www.drupal.org/u/pekens</a> Congratulations, and welcome to the ranks of Core contributors! 😀</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><a href=\"https://app.slack.com/team/U6FDJ3DN2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Pekens Antoine</strong></a> Thanks Travis!

I often forget that. There’s always something that you can teach or share, even if you only know a little bit. I’ll be keeping an eye out for opportunities to share and collaborate more on Drupal projects in the future.”</p> \n   <p>Antoine reflects on the overall meaning of both choosing Drupal and becoming a Drupal contributor: “Trying to understand every single piece of code for any project its size is impossible to do overnight. The Drupal community understands this.
