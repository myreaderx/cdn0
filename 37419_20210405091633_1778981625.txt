People try new technologies, explore new ideas, get coffee together and we all end up debriefing with a cold beverage and a cheese board 🧀🍻.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"hackday\" src=\"https://getaround.tech/assets/posts/hack-day/team.jpg\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <a href=\"https://getaround.tech/drivy-hack-day/\">Writeup</a> of our first hackday. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the pandemic and the fact that we’re currently all working remotely, we didn’t see any reason to miss out on the fun. Thus, the first fully-remote Hackday was born!</p> \n<h3 id=\"the-organization\">The organization</h3> \n<p>A day is short and to come up with something meaningful, you need some organization.<br /> When I say meaningful, I don’t mean some <em>code</em> you could put in production at the end of the day but really anything that would make this day different from the others; work with a coworker you never work with and learn he/she likes cats, discover and play with a new technology or plant a seed for a future feature.</p> \n<p>So, to make sure the day is used to its fullest the objective was mostly to have groups and ideas ready for d-day.<br /> One month before the event, we created a slack channel for people to pitch ideas and find their crew.</p> \n<p>We also had a spreadsheet accessible to the whole company - not only people participating - to submit ideas.</p> \n<h3 id=\"the-format\">The format</h3> \n<p>We had 32 people participating from the tech and data teams split into 12 groups of 2 to 5 people.</p> \n<p>We met in the morning on a Google Meet and, while people finished their breakfast, did a small round table to explain what we’d be working on during the day.</p> \n<p>People then gathered in their own Meet to work together during the day. There also was a global “breakroom” to chitchat during breaks.</p> \n<p>Later in the evening, we had a virtual beer to debrief the day and chill out 🍻.</p> \n<h3 id=\"the-results\">The results</h3> \n<p>Some projects warrant a blog post in their own right, but in the meantime here is a quick overview and some demos.</p> \n<h4 id=\"ios-app-clip\">📱 iOS App Clip</h4> \n<p>Jean-Élie created a proof-of-concept allowing anyone to scan QR codes off of in-street-cars and book them instantly 😍<br /> He created an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/\">iOS App Clip</a> so that users don’t need to download the full aplication.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"iOS App Clip\" src=\"https://getaround.tech/assets/img/app_clip.gif\" /> \n</figure> \n<h4
