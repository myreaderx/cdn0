For developers, this API allows them to determine whether their access to browser-based storage is restricted by a user’s privacy settings and to request storage access from users if so. This capability can be used to create graceful fallback experiences in cases when storage access may be restricted by features such as <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2019/12/03/improving-tracking-prevention-microsoft-edge-79/\">tracking prevention</a> in Microsoft Edge. For users, this API provides greater transparency into and control over the sites that are requesting access to browser-based storage that could be used to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4533959/microsoft-edge-learn-about-tracking-prevention\">track their behaviors</a> across the web. This post outlines what the addition of the Storage Access API means for both developers and users.</p>\n<h1>Developer Experience</h1>\n<p>Using the Storage Access API is as easy as updating your code to leverage the following new functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>hasStorageAccess()</code>\n<ul>\n<li>Useful to check if access to cookies and other storage exists in the current context.</li>\n<li>Returns a promise with a boolean result indicating if storage access exists or not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>requestStorageAccess()</code>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires a <strong>user gesture</strong> to invoke.</li>\n<li>Useful to request access to storage for a single third-party context.</li>\n<li>Returns a promise that will resolve if access is either available or granted and reject if unsuccessful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since we are still gradually rolling out the Storage Access API, it’s possible that you may not have it enabled by default on your device. If you want to test it early, please enable the “Storage Access API” flag in edge://flags.</p>\n<p>The usage of these new functions is best demonstrated with an example.</p>\n<h2>Example:</h2>\n<p>A social media site, contoso.social, offers sites the ability for developers to embed social media widgets as third-party content on their sites. One site where these widgets appear is www.contoso.example. To offer the ability for contoso.social users to comment on, save, or share contoso.example content with friends, contoso.social’s embedded content needs access to its own storage such as cookies or localStorage in the context of contoso.example in order to associate these actions with a visitor’s account.</p>\n<h3>Checking for Access:</h3>\n<p>contoso.social can use <code>document.hasStorageAccess()</code> to see if access to storage already exists and to provide an alternative user experience such as displaying a request to login or request access if not:</p>\n<style>.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; }</style>\n<div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"kypflug/c598dfe63893ae31556f72415fdf4110.json\"></div>\n<h3>Requesting Access:</h3>\n<p>If no storage access is currently present, contoso.social can request access during a user gesture. As an example, the onclick handler of a login button could be tied to a request for storage access (see the “User Experience” section below) using the <code>document.requestStorageAccess()</code> method.</p>\n<style>.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; }</style>\n<div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"kypflug/c8453ca6f5d2cf1080d58b867f66bd78.json\"></div>\n<h2>Sandboxing</h2>\n<p>The <strong><code>allow-storage-access-by-user-activation</code></strong> token can be used to enable the usage of the API when embedded content is loaded in a sandboxed iframe. In practice, both the <strong><code>allow-scripts</code></strong> and <strong><code>allow-same-origin</code></strong> tokens will also be required as well to ensure the API can be effectively used.</p>\n<style>.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; }</style>\n<div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"kypflug/42f8fa765b01bfe765c5a2f3659628ac.json\"></div>\n<p>As a developer, we hope you will leverage the Storage Access API to create web-based experiences that will continue to be compatible even as browsers place more restrictions on third-party storage.</p>\n<h1>User Experience</h1>\n<p>With the introduction of the Storage Access API, you may notice an “Allow cookies and site data?” prompt like the one below when you interact with third-party content such as social media widgets or embedded videos while browsing:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/8289a156ebedb9f81f12a5520f05489d.png\" alt=\"Screen capture showing the &#34;allow cookies and site data?&#34; prompt in Microsoft Edge\" width=\"544\" height=\"338\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24367\" srcset=\"https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/8289a156ebedb9f81f12a5520f05489d.png 544w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/8289a156ebedb9f81f12a5520f05489d-300x186.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" /></p>\n<p>This indicates that the site whose embedded content you’re interacting with (contoso.social in the example above) currently has its storage restricted by Microsoft Edge’s privacy settings and is requesting your permission to access its storage within the context of the site you’re visiting (https://www.contoso.example in the example above). While several types of sites require storage access for legitimate scenarios such as making sure you’re signed in when you expect to be, allowing this access can allow the site requesting it track your activity on the site you’re currently visiting.</p>\n<p>Clicking “Allow” will temporarily allow the requesting site access to its storage on the site you were visiting when the prompt appeared. This allowance will last for a 30-day period after which it will automatically expire. Clicking “Block” will prevent the requesting site from accessing its storage on the site you were visiting when the prompt appeared. If you change your mind, interacting with the third-party content a second time will cause the prompt to be displayed again, giving you the option to revisit your choice.</p>\n<p>To give you control over any storage access requests you’ve allowed before they automatically expire, you’ll notice a new “Cookies and site data you’ve temporarily allowed” section at the bottom of the edge://settings/content/cookies page. Here, you can review and revoke the storage access requests you’ve granted in a single list:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/c1f20b06698f2d4419b4ff3c32f70791.png\" alt=\"Screen capture showing &#34;Cookies and site data you’ve temporarily allowed&#34;\" width=\"1080\" height=\"620\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24366\" srcset=\"https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/c1f20b06698f2d4419b4ff3c32f70791.png 1080w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/c1f20b06698f2d4419b4ff3c32f70791-300x172.png 300w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/c1f20b06698f2d4419b4ff3c32f70791-1024x588.png 1024w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/c1f20b06698f2d4419b4ff3c32f70791-768x441.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /></p>\n<h1>Community Involvement</h1>\n<p>We implemented the Storage Access API upstream so that all Chromium-based browsers could benefit from it. We are also actively participating in <a href=\"https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access\">standardization discussions</a> that are ongoing in the W3C Privacy Community Group to ensure that the API works uniformly across browsers. If you have any feedback on the functionality or capabilities of the API itself, please feel free to join the standardization discussions by <a href=\"https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access/issues\">filing an issue on GitHub</a>. If you have any feedback on the Storage Access API as it exists in Microsoft Edge, please send us feedback using in-app feedback tool (Alt + Shift + I).</p>\n<p>To close, we’d like to thank our friends at Apple and Mozilla for their early work on the Storage Access API and our friends at Google for helping pave the way for getting the API implemented in Chromium.

Traditionally, these surfaces have been almost exclusively focused on apps, forcing users to take additional steps to get to the tab they need—until now.</p>\n<p>With the latest Insider versions of Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge, your tabs now appear in Alt + Tab, allowing you to quickly switch between both apps and sites. You can also easily access the tabs for your most important sites directly on the Taskbar. The changes are just the first of many designed to make you more productive and save you time while multitasking.</p>\n<h1>Browser tabs in Alt + Tab</h1>\n<p>Have you ever tried to use the Alt + Tab keyboard shortcut only to be surprised when it took you to the <em>last app</em> you were using rather than the <em>last</em> <em>thing</em> you were doing? The line between apps and sites has blurred as people spend more and more time in web browsers, but Alt + Tab was still limited to just apps. We’ve heard your feedback about how frustrating this was, so we’ve updated Alt + Tab to show your browser tabs right alongside your apps. This makes switching between open tabs as seamless as switching between open windows.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24374\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/7b3363808d5e77a67c94c56123d774fe.gif\" alt=\"Animation showing individual Edge tabs in the Alt-Tab interface\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>We know Alt + Tab is sacred, so you can choose whether to show all, some, or none of your tabs by going to <strong>Settings &#62; System &#62; Multitasking</strong> in Windows. All your tabs are shown by default, but if you find it to be a bit much you can set Alt + Tab to only show the last three or five tabs instead. We’d love to hear which setting you prefer!</p>\n<h1>Quickly access tabs for your pinned sites via the Taskbar</h1>\n<p>We’ve given pinned sites on the Taskbar a big upgrade, making it easier than ever to get back to the tabs for your most important sites. Pinned sites have always let you quickly open a website or switch to your most recent tab. With today’s update, pinned sites will now appear as running on the Taskbar and you can click on the icon to see all of your open tabs across any of your Microsoft Edge windows. This makes it easy to quickly find and switch to a tab for a specific site without having to search through all your open tabs and browser windows.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_24375\" style=\"width: 730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/6dd3e446c99b7fc15c293668c6ef4fcd.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24375\" class=\"wp-image-24375 size-full\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/980a280b08cad165d154a803d3441485.gif\" alt=\"Animation showing pinned sites with grouped tabs on the Taskbar\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-24375\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pinned sites will now appear as running on the Taskbar, and you can click on the icon to see all of your open tabs across any of your Microsoft Edge windows.

Watch out for the kraken! Players can also collect hearts to extend their lives and boosts for a burst of speed. Surf as far as possible in an endless ocean, compete for the shortest time, or zig zag through as many gates as you can in a row. With three distinct game modes, players have a variety of ways to pass the time.</p>\n<p>To catch the wave, simply navigate to edge://surf in the address bar. If you are not connected to the internet, Microsoft Edge will also provide a handy link to the game to help you pass the time.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9u2exqfp4HY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>An early version of the surf game originally debuted in November as part of a special Easter Egg. Insiders followed a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FindWhatsNext&#38;src=typed_query\">series of cryptic hints and puzzles</a> in the run-up to Microsoft Ignite 2019 which eventually led them to unlock the hidden surf game using Collections. Upon reaching the end of the game, Insiders were treated to the world’s first look at the <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/11/04/introducing-the-new-microsoft-edge-and-bing/\">new icon for Microsoft Edge</a>—two days before the official reveal.</p>\n<p>Upon the conclusion of the Easter Egg, the number one request from Insiders was to turn the surfing game into an endless runner as the permanent “offline game” for Microsoft Edge. The team took this feedback to heart and has spent the last few months polishing edge://surf and adding new gameplay features and improvements, including support for accessibility features like high contrast, screen readers, and even the Xbox Adaptive Controller. Here’s a look at what’s included:</p>\n<h2>Let’s surf: Endless mode</h2>\n<p>Surf as far as you can while avoiding obstacles and the kraken. You can switch modes via the game settings menu.</p>\n<h2>Time trial mode</h2>\n<p>Reach the end of the course as fast as you can! Collect coins to help you achieve an even shorter time. The course is always the same—can you find the shortest possible route? You can switch modes via the game settings menu.</p>\n<h2>Zig zag mode</h2>\n<p>Surf through as many gates as you can in a row! Your streak will reset if you miss a gate, but you can keep playing until your lives run out. You can switch modes via the game settings menu.</p>\n<h2>Play with keyboard, mouse, touch, or gamepad</h2>\n<p>Play your way with support for keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepads, including Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, and the Xbox Adaptive Controller. The game also supports gamepad haptic feedback (rumble) for a more immersive experience. Instructions for how to play, including the controls for each input method, can be found in the game’s settings menu.</p>\n<h2>Personal high scores</h2>\n<p>Each game mode keeps a record of your high score, and you’ll see a notification every time you set a new record. You can also reset your stats from the game settings menu.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24310\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/05/305f636c74b116e8d87f40d6ca21df5a.gif\" alt=\"Animation showing the core gameplay loop in the surf game.\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<h2>High visibility mode</h2>\n<p>High visibility mode (accessible via the game settings menu) highlights the hit boxes around objects, making it easier to identify and avoid obstacles in the water.</p>\n<h2>Reduced speed mode</h2>\n<p>For users who prefer a more relaxed pace or need extra time to pull off those surfing moves, they can enable the new reduced speed mode (accessible via the game settings menu) to slow down the speed of the game.</p>\n<h2>And much more!</h2>\n<p>The final release of edge://surf has many changes based directly on user feedback from the Easter Egg version, including an enhanced user experience, numerous gameplay improvements (such as smarter enemy logic) and bug fixes, and much more. Who knows? There might even be a few secrets just waiting to be found.</p>\n<p>Thanks again to our incredible community that made this possible.

We have been listening to your feedback on the desktop experience and hear that you want to access your collections on-the-go.</p>\n<p>Collections helps you easily collect and organize content that you find across the web. But of course you’re not always in front of your laptop and a lot of research happens while you’re out and about! Collections on mobile makes it easy to add more content and start new collections directly from your phone. We’ve specifically designed Collections on mobile so that you can easily jump between webpages and compare items in your collections. A collapsible Collections drawer allows you to view webpages alongside your collections for easier multi-tasking. Expand the drawer to see more of your collection or collapse it so you can focus on the webpage.</p>\n<p>Install Microsoft Edge from the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx&#38;hl=en_US\">Google Play</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-edge/id1288723196\">Apple App</a> store today to get started! If you already have the Microsoft Edge mobile app, make sure you have the latest updates (Android—version 45.06.2.5042 or higher, iOS—version 45.6.2 or higher).</p>\n<h1>Access Collections</h1>\n<p>Get started by opening Collections from within the “…” browser menu at the bottom of the screen. Once synced, you will see all collections that you’ve previously created on your PC. Just as you would expect on desktop, clicking on any card will take you back to the website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/f9b397053dd6b80f277b28cbc33ec659.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-24407 size-large\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/f9b397053dd6b80f277b28cbc33ec659.gif\" alt=\"Animation of Collections user interface\" width=\"474\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<h1>Start a new collection</h1>\n<p>When you open Collections on your mobile device, tap the <strong>+ </strong>button to create a new collection and give it a title.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/045e7d99a366507f7264a7fb592a8520.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-24409 size-large\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/045e7d99a366507f7264a7fb592a8520.gif\" alt=\"Animation of creating a collection\" width=\"474\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<h1>Use the collapsible drawer</h1>\n<p>The Collections pane on mobile acts like a collapsible drawer to provide multiple views of your collection, making it easy to browse and collect on a small screen.

The individuals we spoke with made it clear they find notification requests bothersome and distracting—except when they don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>These users were typically bothered if they couldn’t understand the value of notifications from a given site, or if the prompt appeared immediately upon visiting the site. However, many of these same users want or even <em>depend</em> upon notifications from a site that’s important to them: for example, meeting alerts from a calendar web app or updates from their favorite media subscriptions.</p>\n<p>Because we know that notifications are a key part of valuable web app scenarios, we continue to invest in a great end-to-end notification experience with open source collaboration on improved integration with the Windows 10 Action Center. As part of this investment, we recognized an opportunity to improve upon the notification request experience.</p>\n<h2>Quiet notification requests</h2>\n<p>Beginning with Microsoft Edge 84, we’re introducing support for a new notification request experience called quiet notification requests. This experience is currently enabled by default for all Microsoft Edge users, but users can turn off the &#8220;Quiet notification requests” setting at edge://settings/content/notifications if they prefer.</p>\n<p>With quiet requests enabled, site notification requests made via the Notifications or Push APIs will appear as a bell labeled “Notifications blocked” in the address bar, as opposed to the typical full flyout prompt.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24382\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/00b673b234fb82c1b7b00736c123a339.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the &#34;Notifications blocked&#34; bell in the address bar.\" width=\"324\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/00b673b234fb82c1b7b00736c123a339.png 324w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/00b673b234fb82c1b7b00736c123a339-300x246.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" /></p>\n<p>This treatment reduces the prominence of notification requests so the user can stay focused on their current task, but keeps the request at a noticeable location in the UI. If the user wants to subscribe to notifications, they can click the &#8220;Notifications blocked” bell icon and accept the request:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24383\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/b434be807acd69b6b850779226f1c28c.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of dialog to allow notifications for an individual sites.\" width=\"480\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/b434be807acd69b6b850779226f1c28c.png 480w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/33/2020/07/b434be807acd69b6b850779226f1c28c-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></p>\n<h2>Planned updates</h2>\n<p>We’ve opted to turn on this setting by default for users in Microsoft Edge 84 due to high volumes of user feedback around unwanted notification subscriptions; we hope quiet notification requests will help reduce unintentional subscriptions.</p>\n<p>As we found in our user research, however, there are some scenarios where notification requests are particularly welcome and may warrant the full prompt. We’re currently exploring turning on the full flyout prompt when data suggests users find a given site’s notification request valuable. Users would be able to keep the quiet notification requests experience for all sites if they prefer. Stay tuned for updates!</p>\n<p>In addition to the notification request experience, we&#8217;re also improving notification reception and interaction experience. We found that many users were frustrated by “high priority” Toast notifications set with the <a href=\"https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-notificationoptions-requireinteraction\">requireInteraction</a> member, as these notifications never disappear without user interaction. Starting with Microsoft Edge 85, these notifications will now auto-dismiss in Windows Action Center after 25 seconds. Stay tuned to our upcoming blog for more details on this and other improvements.</p>\n<h2>Best practices: providing a great notification request experience</h2>\n<p>While web developers don’t have control over the browser UI for permission requests, carefully crafting the moment you make this request can have a positive impact on your users’ experience and engagement with your site. We’d recommend the following best practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid prompting the user the moment they land on your site.</strong> We’ve found that some users will completely abandon a website that requests permissions up front. Instead, tie your request to some logical moment in the user journey—maybe the user would like notifications on new videos after they’ve watched several of the latest additions?</li>\n<li><strong>Consider using the “double request” pattern. </strong>In this pattern, web developers use site UI to first gain consent from the user, <em>then </em>fire a notification request via the Notifications or Push API. The least intrusive way to do this would be to add a “notifications” setting to site UI, then request permissions when that site setting is turn on. Tread carefully with “popup” UI for double requests, as these may disrupt users similarly to the flyout prompt.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider using site UI to communicate the value of your notifications. </strong>Some individuals may feel more comfortable signing up for notifications when they understand the content and cadence of those notifications. For example, an eCommerce site might explain that notifications will be used to communicate sales and coupons only.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid designing for specific browser UI.</strong> Users&#8217; browser configurations may have UI which differs from your expectations. For example, Microsoft Edge users may or may not have turned on quiet notification requests. It&#8217;s best if your site doesn&#8217;t depend on specific browser UI. We recommend avoiding content-blocking overlays—which may block core site functionality on the request—or popups containing screenshots of browser UI.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Please share your feedback</h2>\n<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts on quiet notification requests and permission requests in general.  If you run into any issues or have any feedback, use the in-app feedback button (or Alt+Shift+I).
