One use case scenario is towing a <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/trailer/\">trailer</a> on the back of the Cybertruck for adventure trips. Even better is to have a collapsible camper that fits right in the vault (the bed of Cybertruck). Meet the Cyberlandr, a telescopic pop-up camper attachment for the Cybertruck which almost pans double the height of the truck when fully retracted vertically.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Cybertruck, the Cyberlandr does away with external door handles and opens when an authorized person puts the foot on the steps or gains access via the compatible app. On the inside, the minimalistic pop-up camper has a very airy feel to it, thanks to the dual-pane windows with electrochromic dimming when required. It even makes space for a bathroom (with a showerhead and self-cleaning dry flush toilet) and a multi-use living area which can be used as a section for the kitchen, office work, or night sleep. For this, the kitchen utility comes in the form of a counter with a large sink, dual induction burners embedded in the cooktop, and a refrigerator. Once you no longer require meal prepping, the pair of lounge chairs can be used for your work or simply having some rest – it even has two pivoting desks. When the nighttime hits, the chairs unfold meticulously into a sleeping area as they morph into a double bed.</p>\n<p>To ensure you have a comfy space to relax, the compact all-season camper comes with heated floors, a voice-activated faucet, 32-inch TV, and a 4-stage water filtration system. All this equipment is powered by the 500-watts of slide-out solar roofs, one on top of the other. One of them extends beyond the edge of the camper, doubling as an overhead shade for the entrance section.</p>\n<p>The total weight of the accessory is around 1,360 pounds and it only affects 5 percent of the Cybertruck’s total driving range – way better than some of the other camper trailers designed for the Tesla’s truck that also add to the aerodynamic drag. Cyberlandr however, doesn&#8217;t add any drag since it retracts into the truck&#8217;s bed. The retractable trailer can be booked with a security deposit of just $100, and taking that up higher to $5,000 will give you preference over others. The pop-up trailer will cost $49,995 in total, and we’ll be looking forward to seeing it in action when the Cyber truck hits the roads!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.cyberlandr.com/\"

Founded by brother-duo David &#38; Noah Pomphrey, Pompeak has managed to, in a limited span of time, surprise and stun the watch aficionado community with incredibly designed, precisely manufactured, dapper-looking watches, without sporting that premium price tag. With their latest watch, the Sub-Aquatic, Pompeak hopes to add a little diversity to their lineup by building a watch centered around performance&#8230; specifically, performance underwater.</p>\n<p>Meet the Sub-Aquatic, a timepiece that combines the best that British design has to offer with the best that Swiss engineering has to offer. Classy on the outside, capable on the inside, the Sub-Aquatic is a 40mm dive watch that&#8217;s been designed, tested, and perfected over the last 12 months. With a body made out of brushed and highly polished 904L Stainless Steel, a ceramic rotating bezel, incredibly powerful Super-LumiNova markings, and a sapphire crystal display capping it all, the Sub-Aquatic looks stunning out in the open, but it really shines when you venture into the waters. Equipped with 200M water-resistance, the Sub-Aquatic is a watch that isn&#8217;t afraid of being thrown into the deep end.</p>\n<p>The Sub-Aquatic is a pretty serious flex from Pompeak, and propels them as a watch brand to be reckoned with. The 904L Steel is an upgrade from the default 316L Steel, but it&#8217;s in every way a premium, luxury metal and comes with more chromium in the alloy that gives it an unmistakable polished appearance and unbeatable corrosion resistance. Given the circumstances under which the Sub-Aquatic watch is meant to be used, the timepiece comes with high-visibility BGW9 Swiss Super-LumiNova markings on the rotating bezel as well as on the watch face, allowing the numbers to be visible even at the depths of the ocean. The visibility of the numbers is increased further by the presence of a double-domed Sapphire crystal on the top, complete with multiple Anti-Reflective (AR) coatings to give the watch-face utmost clarity. The watch face itself is simple and sophisticated, prioritizing minimalist cleanliness more than anything. The face sports a dark-ish blue gradient hue that sets the perfect contrast for the white, LumiNova coated numbers&#8230; and a date window at the 3 o&#8217;clock position gives you all the information you need at a mere glance. On the inside, a self-winding Sellita SW200-1 movement gives the watch its life, lending its signature Swiss-backed accuracy to the timepiece.</p>\n<p>Pompeak&#8217;s dive-watch (its first one so far) manages to pull it all off while still sticking to its ethos of being honestly priced. With a Kickstarter launch price of just £389 ($530), the watch matches up to (and surpasses) other luxury brands with its use of high-end materials like sapphire crystal and 904L Steel, and its stunning water-resistance of 20ATM (200 meters).

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>The 1970 Chevrolet SS is one classic car that serves as the perfect platform for hotrod lovers to modify – and its hot property even to date. The big fat tires, the bulging V8 engine, a distinct street racing character, and the pure joy of driving this mean machine to bamboozle onlookers is something of an addiction. But when the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/Chevrolet/\">Chevrolet</a> SS gets a makeover that takes it to a god-like level, it is undeniable.</p>\n<p>Coming from the designer of the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/13/dodge-demon-meets-bumblebee-in-this-intimidating-avatar-making-it-richard-hammonds-wet-dream/\">Dodge Demon</a> having a striking Bumblebee character – yes we are talking about Al Yasid – this concept design elevates the muscular charisma of the Chevrolet to a level where it can even be deemed as a Batman worthy ride. Yes, a Batmobile-like extended rear gives it that peculiar crime-fighting machine aesthetic – only if the hotrod could be painted in the signature all-black hue. The look comes courtesy of Yasid’s second layer of modification to the Bandido Chevrolet SS from one of his earlier renders – virtually bettering the remake a step further. According to Yasid, who gave the ride aero feel overall thanks to the over fenders, “The single central fin always work, no doubt about that.”</p>\n<p>The mean machine gets a dual-tone color with the hood, front bumper, and front fenders painted in black and the rest of the body getting a light silver treatment. The black dual stripes on the roof and the hint of black on the rear, give this Chevrolet a definite road presence. Of course, the big fat wheels hint at the muscle car’s drag racing DNA, and the presence of a wheelie bar would do this ride the justice. I’m sure it has got the thrust boosters and a fire-spitting exhaust ready for a duel!</p>\n<p>Designer: Al Yasid</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309362\"

The sports car will be a fully electric vehicle with the battery pack right in the middle of the chassis under the interior cabin, and to keep the overall weight down a carbon fiber frame is used.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the inside, this electric Lamborghini gets the single-seater configuration – just like the ones on the fighter jet planes or racing prototypes. The steering on this concept gets a futuristic vibe with its dynamic shape, and the HUD is integrated right behind it. The paddle shifters look so inviting – I virtually want to try them out. To charge up the powerful ride, all one has to do is plug in the charging hose into the retracting portal located at this Lamborghini concept&#8217;s front left-hand side – just behind the front wheel. Like some other concepts or even prototype vehicles having an all-glass windshield that runs to the rear, this one has a body-colored perforated film. How that&#8217;s going to affect the visibility is anybody&#8217;s guess.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To lend the Lamborghini a futuristic DNA, this sports car gets an array of LED projectors that run all the way along the upper grill section. The designer has not tinkered much with the look for the rear, giving it a balanced mix of the Aventador, Centenario, and even the Huracan. So, could the future electric Lamborghini look like this one? You can bet your bottom dollar on that assumption since the concept is highly practical. Lamborghini needs to give this one consideration!</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Designer: Andrea Ortile</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309188\"

width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Drones are quite honestly taking over the world! They&#8217;re more than just toys to fly around or simple accessories, they are now being used for critical functions as well! Drones these days are saving lives, relaying important information, landing on Mars, and even diving underwater. The scope and potential of drones are being massively unlocked and they seem unlimited. They are innovative and fascinating objects that can carry out many tasks, that we, humans are unable to do. Hence, we&#8217;ve curated a collection of inventive, super functional, and futuristic drones that will surprise you with their capabilities, and make you wonder what the world will really look like ten years down the line!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/12/this-rescue-drone-turns-into-a-human-safety-net/net_guard_drone_1.jpg\" alt=\"net_guard_drone_1\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/12/13/this-rescue-drone-turns-into-a-human-safety-net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Net Drone</a> is a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) made together by joining four identical quadrants with propellers. The drone takes off into the sky to rescue victims stuck at the top of high-rises in the event of a calamity requiring evacuation. It then, promptly, splits into four parts, as a safety net unfurls between the individual parts, creating a protective bed the victim can jump onto. Once the victim lands safely in the net, the drone carries them to safety, ensuring no human lives are endangered in the high-altitude, high-risk rescue attempt. While the technology to pull off such a complex rescue doesn’t really exist, the concept definitely makes a great case for how drones should be built in the future to assist humans in life-threatening situations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/auto-draft/ahadrone_kit_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/auto-draft/ahadrone_kit_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/auto-draft/ahadrone_kit_3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">I love the Ahadrone kit’s DIY touch! Designed to be the “drone for everyone”, it democratizes one of the hottest (and sometimes expensive) categories in consumer electronics. With all the makings of a very capable drone, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/06/06/first-we-had-diy-cardboard-vr-headsets-now-weve-got-diy-cardboard-drones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Ahadrone</a> is just like any other remote-controlled quadcopter, but it comes with a complete corrugated board body, allowing it to stay light, but stiff, the perfect property for a drone exterior! Cardboard isn’t new to consumer electronics. The Google Cardboard VR headset, and the cardboard Nintendo Switch Labo kits, have both showcased paper board to be a very capable low-cost solution to plastic parts. The board serves as a great packaging material too, knocking two birds with one stone.. and while it isn’t as permanent as plastic (the Ahadrone wouldn’t last 5 minutes in the rain), with the right template, people can rebuild their own cardboard parts, either out of a board, plastic sheets, or even 3D printing them!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/djis-new-fpv-drone-gives-you-the-superpower-of-flight-well-almost/dji_fpv_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/djis-fpv-drone-gives-you-the-superpower-of-flight-well-almost/dji_fpv_3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"http://yankodesign.com/tag/dji\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DJI</a>‘s latest drone doesn’t want you to simply operate it… it wants to put you in a virtual cockpit.<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/02/djis-new-fpv-drone-gives-you-the-superpower-of-flight-well-almost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> The DJI FPV Drone</a> isn’t so much about being an incredible drone as it is about boasting of its one, standout feature – the FPV or First Person View. Armed with a pretty futuristic-looking pair of goggles, a low-latency video transmission unit, and a redesigned set of controllers, the DJI FPV drone is about giving YOU the thrill of the flight by allowing you to see exactly what the drone sees… in real-time! At the heart of the DJI FPV drone are two incredibly revolutionary innovations. Firstly, its HD Low-Latency Transmission of video that gives you the ability to view high-definition footage from the drone in stunning real-time; and secondly, its set of hardware controllers, which allow all sorts of users to experience the FPV’s glorious adrenaline rush, whether you’re a novice or a pro-drone-flyer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/this-designer-drone-adapts-the-best-of-helicopter-and-aircraft-design/Dartz-PromDrone-Black-Bee-Drone-9.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/this-designer-drone-adapts-the-best-of-helicopter-and-aircraft-design/Dartz-PromDrone-Black-Bee-Drone-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Latvia-based company Dartz Motorz takes that vision as an inspiration for a future where drones will complement our style and panache. They want to change the image of drones from being mere toys or industrial assets to that being an accessory that enhances the owner’s individuality. Dubbed the Dartz Prombdrone Black Bee, it is co-developed with drone pros <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/08/this-badass-drone-adapts-the-best-of-helicopter-and-aircraft-design\\\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fixar</a> who’ve given it the advantages of a helicopter and unmanned aircraft while doing away with the disadvantages of tilt rotors. The designer drone based on the Fixar 007 Outdoor model can take off and land like a copter and also has a high flight range courtesy of the wing lift. The design is such that the transition from the helicopter mode to the aircraft mode is seamless.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/auto-draft/traverse_ai_drone_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/auto-draft/traverse_ai_drone_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designed by the students of the Hongik University, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/15/this-artificially-intelligent-drone-wants-to-be-your-personal-fitness-trainer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Traverse</a> is a conceptual drone powered by AI that’s designed to be a personal trainer for recreational runners. The autonomous drone comes with a quad-propeller layout, and also features multiple fish-eye cameras that help it navigate through spaces without requiring any external controls. A main gimbal-mounted camera focuses on you, the runner, and the camera focuses on you as you run, monitoring your speed, performance, technique, laps, and charts your overall progress. While running, Traverse takes photos and videos of runners to give them Form correction &#38; visual running feedback by tracking their posture with deep learning. The Traverse drone is accompanied by the Pod, a wearable that sits around your neck. The drone uses the wearable as a tracking tag, while the Pod itself works as your personal coach, giving you audio feedback to improve your form and performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/07/aurora/aurora_01.jpg\" alt=\"aurora_01\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/07/aurora/aurora_02.jpg\" alt=\"aurora_02\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Did you know that Nikola Tesla patented a drone before there were drones?! Over 100 years ago he called these imagined vessels as being used to carry packages, establish communication with inaccessible regions, and “many other scientific purposes.” Drones are basically in the brand’s DNA, so it’s no wonder that there is so much hype around what a Tesla drone might be like! In this concept, called <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2017/08/16/leave-the-drones-to-tesla/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aurora</a>, Tesla’s electric motor technology is applied to a tricopter design to facilitate long-range, extended-time camera capability. Operating either autonomously or controlled manually, it’s ideal for reconnaissance, checking on out-of-reach machinery, routine structure inspections, or simply for capturing vivid photography and video for fun. The three-rotor design allows for larger propellers. This results in fewer required rotations and less energy to fly, making it more efficient with up to 35% more battery life. Because of the size of the propellers, it also has greater acceleration and better maneuverability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/draft-adesign-tech/adesign_tech_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/draft-alvix-drone/alvix_multifunctional_drone_4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/09/25/this-cylinder-shaped-drone-helps-keep-an-eye-on-extreme-sports-enthusiasts-in-the-outdoors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Alvix Multifunctional Drone</a> isn’t designed to look like your average hobby drone. It comes in a compact cylindrical format, made for easy carrying, and opens out into a rugged drone capable of recording and monitoring extreme sports enthusiasts and players, who always carry heavy equipment and perform high-risk sporting activities alone. Think of the Alvix drone as your spotter, but in the outdoors – keeping a watchful eye on you as you engage in extreme sports. Its cylindrical format makes it easy to carry, as well as gives it a protective covering, as the drone’s propellers have built-in circular guards around them. The drone comes with a wearable that helps it track the wearer at all times, keeping a watchful eye on them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/this-aerial-drone-for-nasa-will-help-discover-prospective-landing-sites-on-mars/Anton-Weaver_Mars-Aerial-Exploratory-Drone-2030_Aerial-Vehicle_Yanko-Design-newhero.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/this-aerial-drone-will-scout-red-planets-surface-for-prospect-habitat-zones/Anton-Weaver_Mars-Aerial-Exploratory-Drone-2030_Aerial-Vehicle_Yanko-Design-3-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/10/21/this-aerial-drone-for-nasa-will-help-discover-prospective-landing-sites-on-mars/\\\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Mars Aerial Exploratory Drone 2030</a> which is the brain-child of 3D Generalist <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/anton-weaver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anton Weaver</a> aims to be the lead aerial surveillance vehicle that helps in tracking out the key habitat zones or detect any unknown threats in advance with its vantage position up in the air. The drone is inspired by the NASA Mars Helicopter which is planned for use with the scouting tasks for the future Mars rovers. According to Anton, the drone is more advanced than NASA’s iteration, with “bigger, smarter, and more utility.” It has soft landing pads for any surface on the planet and runs on the solar power of the sun. That said the primary objective of the drone will be to identify the points of interest for the research team and detect sites that’ll be of interest to the ground team.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/auto-draft/oasis_aeronaval_rescue_drone_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/auto-draft/oasis_aeronaval_rescue_drone_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Meet <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/11/20/seaplane-inspired-drone-can-rescue-people-trapped-at-sea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oasis</a>, an Aeronaval Rescue Drone capable of helping rescue people drowning in waters by not just locating them, but also pulling them to the nearest vessel to safety. Designed in the aftermath of the accidents caused by the Boeing 737 Max, the Oasis aims at being able to help search-and-rescue teams to reach farther and cover much more ground in lesser time. The autonomous drones are instantly deployed in an emergency situation. They fly in grid patterns to efficiently scan waters for any signs of humans. When found, the drone descends to the water’s surface, relying on two buoyancy devices to float on top of the water. The human then latches onto the drone, as it essentially does the job of a tugboat, pulling the human either to shore or to the nearest rescue vessel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/02/auto-draft/sitewasp_2.jpg\" alt=\"sitewasp_2\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/02/auto-draft/sitewasp_1.jpg\" alt=\"sitewasp_1\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designed for site-recon for buildings under construction, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/02/14/the-sitewasp-drone-basically-replaces-the-supervisor-at-a-construction-site/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the SiteWasp</a> was built to be your all-in-one monitoring drone. “The objective of the SiteWasp drone is to remotely provide stakeholders with construction updates, thus unifying the planning process and the building process. This 3D drone system scans, measures, analyses, and documents with high-resolution images of the current state and process of construction. It uses the digital BIM (Building Information Model) so that all remote stakeholders can react directly to crucial errors and differences, which leads to a more synchronized and efficient workflow.” Made to do a better job than a construction supervisor, and in less time, the SiteWasp can complete an entire recon in a matter of hours, whereas it would take a human day to complete an exhaustive check of the building and its progress.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=WVX6-lvbOO4:XC1ZPy0hoUE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img

a room. It can be the final piece that makes a space come full circle, building a comfortable and cohesive haven, rather than a random area. Furniture pieces make or break a home, they add on to the essence or soul of a home, hence one needs to be extremely picky while choosing a furniture design. The design should be a reflection of you, and what you want your home to be. When you place a piece of furniture in a room, it should instantly integrate with the space, creating a wholesome and organic environment. We&#8217;ve curated a collection of furniture designs with brilliant little details that we believe will do this! Each of these pieces is unique, well-crafted, and made with a whole lot of love, and the love really shines through in the fine detailing and workmanship.

In recent times, tourism has grown markedly and so too the volume of refuse. bottle-up seeks a solution to this issue. Most furniture for hotels in Zanzibar is currently imported from foreign countries and is often made of wood, which means it can be badly affected by the weather conditions on the island.

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/boston-dynamics/\">Boston Dynamics</a> is the hot property ever since its inception – evident from the change of ownership it has gone through in the last decade. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/02/02/boston-dynamics-spot-gets-an-ultra-nimble-robotic-arm-extension-making-him-the-perfect-pet-and-companion/\">Spot</a> is Boston Dynamics crowning jewel that anyone can buy if they’ve got fat pockets, and one can call the Spot robotic dog, the alpha male of the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/robot/\">robotics world</a>. Now the Spot dog seems to have met its worthy competitor in the form of SN-3 Nova, a specialized robot built to accompany the maintenance technicians for inspection and repair tasks in places where it is too dangerous for humans to venture.</p>\n<p>The SN-3 Nova is the work of Iranian concept designer Amin Akhshi, and he envisions this tall postured robot with muscular legs, reassuring its ability to take on any inclement task you throw at it. While Amin imagines it to be the tech wizard of the team – solving any electronic problems that a system might encounter. I, however, see it good enough to be a part of the disaster management fleet or even a member of the military dog squad to take on the bad guys.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it is a machine powered by a 48V lithium-ion battery loaded with a 3D laser scanner and HDR camera for advanced vision to tread in low-lit conditions. When it comes down to performing the tasks, SN-3 Nova takes pride in its hand-eye coordination to work with fully-wristed instruments and a highly advanced CMOS sensor for precision tasks. Without a doubt, the robotic dog is built for the future, and don’t be surprised if you witness Amin’s vision turn to reality in your lifetime. As they say, the robots are coming!</p>\n<p>Designer: Amin Akhshi</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309420\"

width=\"1050\" height=\"587\" /></p>\n<p>One future<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/apple/\"> Apple</a> product that’s shrouded in mystery and evokes intense excitement is the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/02/04/this-apple-car-showcases-a-futuristic-automotive-revolution-that-makes-the-tesla-cybertruck-look-old-school/\">Apple Car</a>. What the electric car will look like or the kind of features it will have is still anybody’s guess. One thing is for sure, it will be nothing like what’s on the market when eventually it is released, why’s that? Because Apple is known to release products only when they are sure, it brings a unique experience for the end-user. After the rumors of Hyundai-Kia and Apple collaborating on the Apple Car were shunned into submission, Apple is still speculated to be in talks with other automotive companies like Foxconn and Magna to strike a manufacturing agreement.</p>\n<p>That said, differentiating the Apple Car from big guns like Tesla or other big automotive names like <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/bmw/\">BMW</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/audi/\">Audi</a> or <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/mercedes/\">Mercedes</a> will be crucial – be it the aesthetics of the car or its functionality. The former can be imagined in any number of ways and that’s what Leasefetcher has done with its latest rendering of Apple Car designs. Although there have been countless designs showing the future Apple EV, these are a mash-up of popular cars with Apple products. They’ll make you twitch, grin, and even wowed depending on your interpretation – but they sure are interesting!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.leasefetcher.co.uk/content/apple-ev-concept-mashups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leasefetcher</a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Nissan GT-R x iPhone 12 Pro</strong></h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308177\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/apple-car-designs-mashup-iconic-apple-products-with-popular-cars/Nissan-GT-R-x-iPhone-12-Pro_-Apple-Car.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"587\" /></p>\n<p>This performance-laden render truly demonstrates the future aesthetics of the Apple Car since it is an amalgam of one of the most iconic supercars of all time – the Nissan GT-R and the best ever iPhone that one can own – the iPhone 12 Pro. The Nissan GT-R is undoubtedly one of the best aesthetically inviting designs that Apple could take some cues.</p>\n<p>Leasefetcher emphasis the adoption of the Nissan Ultimate Silver color along with the flowing shape extenuated by the iPhone 12 Pro button-styled door handles. The LED headlights are inspired by the camera module and the grille takes shape of the edges of the smartphone.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Toyota Supra vs iPod Classic </strong></h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308176\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/apple-car-designs-mashup-iconic-apple-products-with-popular-cars/Toyota-Supra-vs-iPod-Classic_Apple-Car-Design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine powered Supra is Toyota’s most unique production car, and combining it with the contoured form of the iPod Classic doesn’t seem odd one bit. Laid to rest in 2014, the iconic portable music player changed the complexion of the music industry.</p>\n<p>Here, the Apple Car takes shape of the Toyota Supra and the iPod Classic in Turbulence Grey color. For the iPod elements, the alloys adopt the nostalgic ClickWheel shape of the portable player, and the grill is tweaked to have a smooth flowing shape to highlight the Apple logo bang in the middle.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Hyundai Ioniq Electric x Apple Mouse</strong></h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309179\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/future-apple-car-designs-iconic-apple-products-mashed-up-with-popular-cars/Apple-Concept-Cars-of-Future.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Being the first car that was offered as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and a full EV – the Hyundai Ioniq is the inspiration for this render mashed up with the Magic Mouse in a render that looks so future-forward and balanced for a compact EV design. The Apple logo is prominent even on the panoramic windshield, and the front grill. But would anything like this take shape of the Apple Car?</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Honda E x iMac G3</strong></h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308174\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/apple-car-designs-mashup-iconic-apple-products-with-popular-cars/Honda-E-x-iMac-G3_Apple-Car.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>While you might want to dismiss this as the future of the Apple Car, still the design looks interesting if ever there was a low rung variant of the Apple car like the iPhone 12 Mini. While it might not turn any eyeballs, still it is an interesting take, mashing up the Honda E with the retro iMac G3. It has the G3 split-color design draped in Platinum Pearl White front and a transparent Bondi blue black-end. Sure nostalgia is the dominating emotion here, but pitting it against a Tesla Model 3 won’t be a good idea.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Kia Soul EV x iMac Pro </strong></h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308173\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/apple-car-designs-mashup-iconic-apple-products-with-popular-cars/Kia-Sould-EV-x-iMac-Pro_Apple-Car.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Since Apple and Kia were in the limelight a few months ago for their speculated collaboration, it didn’t see the light of day. This amalgam was destined to be here with the quirky looking Kia Soul EV crossover SUV morphing partly into an iMac Pro which is a p[owerful machine to own. That said, the machine is going to be discontinued from the Apple family. Leasefetcher imagines the Apple Car could have the iMac’s Space Grey skin, highlighted by the tall profile of the windscreens on the back and the rear.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

traditional music systems. Yes, I&#8217;ve put it out there! Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do enjoy music. What I hate is the trail of wires my Bose surround sound system creates around my rental apartment. And sure, there are a TON of wireless speakers that deliver performance, but watching the conceptual designs on Yanko Design has my bar set a little higher than usual. That is why the latest Instagram announcement by SONOS and <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/ikea/\">IKEA</a> has me truly intrigued by what it can do to my living room!</p>\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s favorite furniture design brand IKEA has teamed with SONOS once again and what is promised are two new products at least. The first new product, as showcased <a href=\"https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632\">filing</a>, is a revamped version of the Symfonisk table lamp. It’s expected to be sold for around the same price ($179) as the original product. The second product is a piece of wall art! To quote the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370130/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-2021-lamp-wall-art-artwork-speaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verge</a>, &#8220;<em>The Verge</em> has seen an early image of this product, codenamed “Titan,” but details about how it functions couldn’t yet be learned. Specifically, it’s unclear whether the entire artwork print is the product or if the speaker unit can be transferred between different exterior art housings.&#8221; Imagine this, wall art or frame that lets you display your favorite image, in your preferred print quality that plays soothing music, wirelessly! Historically, any collaboration between these brands has resulted in products that deliver value on multiple levels &#8211; be it the Symfonisk bookshelf speaker or the table lamp speaker. It carries the golden triage &#8211; form, functionality, and extreme versatility and modularity that comes with the budget-friendliness of IKEA. My toes are literally tingling from the excitement.</p>\n<p>Personally speaking, the entire enterprise for me hinges on 2 factors &#8211; the variety of the pictures available and the second one is the price range. Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; a digital frame with multi-image displaying capacity is nothing new for us. What is new is putting together two of our favorite brands and their powerhouse research into creating a product that meets the needs we did not even know existed till we see it hanging on our wall. Now that, for me, is pure magic!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/\">IKEA</a> x <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en/home\" target=\"_blank\"

they may be short-lived. A company has built what they claim is a &#8216;pizza vending machine&#8217; that uses robots to automate the pizza-making process. Called the Piestro (a portmanteau of Pie and Maestro), this machine allows you to order artisanal pizzas with a few button-taps. Choose your toppings and the entire apparatus puts your pizza together from scratch, dispensing sauce evenly on the base, generously scattering the toppings, loading it with cheese, and then baking the pie before dispensing it out to you neatly tucked in a pizza-box. Sure, the Piestro won&#8217;t replace actually eating a true-blue New York-style pizza handmade by a master pizzaiolo, but it sort of rings the death knell for pre-packaged pizzas, and possibly even for fast-food chains like Dominos and Pizza Hut&#8230; because guess what, the Piestro can run 24&#215;7, allowing you to order a pizza even at 3am in the morning.</p>\n<p>The Piestro&#8217;s process starts with a pre-made pizza base (it&#8217;s easier and lasts longer than fresh wet dough) onto which it pours generous dollops of sauce. The pizza moves down the conveyor belt where the toppings you choose (using a touchscreen interface) are scattered on top of it, right before the pizza makes its way into an oven that cooks the toppings. Sort of like one of those toy-grabbing machines, the entire process is visible behind a transparent panel, before the pizza finally pops out of an opening at the base of the machine taking just 3 minutes from start to finish.</p>\n<p>The creators of the Piestro highlight how useful a pizza-vending machine would be in current times. It works without any human intervention, and apart from the fact that it needs to be replenished with fresh ingredients ever so often, the Piestro can practically work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing fresh pizzas to people even in a lockdown. Not to mention the fact that the pizza comes untouched by human hands (try and match that, Dominos). The company&#8217;s even partnering with PopID to ensure contactless payments by relying on facial recognition to authenticate payments to the pizza machine. The Piestro is currently in its funding stages, looking for partners and investors to hop on board and bring this robotic pizza-master to life.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.piestro.com/\"
