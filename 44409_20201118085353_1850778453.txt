Using this tool, information can be instantly and securely sent to partners on the other side of the world, and personal information can be verified without divulging sensitive data about a user.</p>\n<p>Along with this widespread use, however, comes key security measures that must take place in order to ensure the safety of your organization and data. This is particularly the case when receiving email information from previously unknown sources. These risks can include phishing attempts, malware, and other threats that can cause a negative impact to your business. Furthermore, when receiving an email address via account forms and user sign up information, you need to check that the information you are given is not only correct and real, but also that it does not lead to any malicious sources that could harm your organizational security.&#160;</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 19:00:34 +0000","feedId":44409,"bgimg":"https://dzone.com/thumbnail?fid=14135508&w=600","linkMd5":"63d550909d6274f5fb0c874f65f21f1d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn97@2020_2/2020/11/18/08-53-53-088_df4c5059ae49edb6.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":375,"sourceBytes":68258,"destBytes":34468,"author":"Katherine Coyle","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605689401879}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 16:50:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 16:50:01","feedId":44409,"fetchDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:50:01 +0000","fetchMs":473,"handleMs":65,"totalMs":232630,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"6923885023856883326b4ebb589fbdad","hostName":"us-035*","requestId":"93524a97d119411eb2db02754926b8a9_44409","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:34:35","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:52:29","id":44409,"name":"DZone Java Zone","url":"http://feeds.dzone.com/zones/groovy","subscriber":72,"website":null,"icon":"https://dzone.com/themes/dz20/images/favicon.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn60@2020_2/2020/09/06/21-52-27-325_b540a11648b59e3a.png","description":"Recent posts in Java on DZone.com","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605689401338,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":476,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":65,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":232087,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://dzone.com/thumbnail?fid=14135508&w=600","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":600,"destHeight":375,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn97@2020_2/2020/11/18/08-53-53-088_df4c5059ae49edb6.webp","sourceBytes":68258,"destBytes":34468,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":44409,"totalSpendMs":1136,"convertSpendMs":34,"createdTime":"2020-11-18 16:53:52","host":"us-007*","referer":"https://dzone.com/articles/3051336","linkMd5ListStr":"63d550909d6274f5fb0c874f65f21f1d","githubUser":"myreaderx12","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"66.7 KB","destSize":"33.7 KB","compressRate":"50.5%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
