With this release we are adjusting the version numbering for our Gradle plugin and decoupling it from the Android Studio versioning scheme. In this blog post we'll explain the reasons for the change, as well as give a preview of some important changes we're making to our new, incubating <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/new-apis-in-the-android-gradle-plugin-f5325742e614\">Android Gradle plugin APIs and DSL</a>. \n</p>\n  \n<h3>New versioning scheme</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWith AGP 7.0.0 we are adopting the principles of <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a>. What this means is that only major version changes will break API compatibility. We intend to release one major version each year, right after Gradle introduces its own yearly major release. \n</p>\n<p>\nMoreover, in the case of a breaking change, we will ensure that the removed API is marked with <code>@Deprecated</code> about a year in advance and that its replacement is available at the same time. This will give developers roughly a year to migrate and test their plugins with the new API before the old API is removed.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlignment with <a href=\"https://gradle.org/releases/\">Gradle's version</a> is also why we're skipping versions 5 and 6, and moving directly to AGP 7.0.0. This alignment indicates that AGP 7.x is meant to work with Gradle 7.x APIs. While it may also run on Gradle 8.x, this is not guaranteed and will depend on whether 8.x removes APIs that AGP relies on.\n</p>\n<p>\nWith this change, the AGP version number will be decoupled from the Android Studio version number. However we will keep releasing Android Studio and Android Gradle plugin together for the foreseeable future.\n</p>\n<p>\nCompatibility between Android Studio and Android Gradle plugin remains unchanged. As a general rule, projects that use <strong>stable versions</strong> of AGP can be opened with newer versions of Android Studio. \n</p>\n<h3>Java 11 requirement</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nYou can still use Java programming language version 8 with AGP 7.0.0-alpha01 but we are changing the minimum required Java programming language version to Java 11, starting with AGP 7.0.0-alpha02. We are announcing this early in the Canary schedule and many months ahead of the stable release to allow developers time to get ready. \n</p>\n<h3>Incubating APIs and important API changes</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis release of AGP also introduces some API changes. As a reminder, a number of APIs that were introduced in AGP 4.1 were marked as incubating and were subject to change. In fact, in AGP 4.2 some of these APIs have changed. The APIs that are currently incubating do not follow the deprecation cycle that we explain above. \n</p>\n<p>\nHere is a summary of some important API changes.\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>The <code>onVariants</code>, <code>onProperties</code> and <code>onVariantProperties</code> blocks are removed in version 4.2 beta.\n\n<li>These APIs are replaced with  <code>beforeVariants</code> and <code>onVariants</code> in the new <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/4.2/com/android/build/api/extension/AndroidComponentsExtension\">androidComponents</a></code> block. Both <code>beforeVariants</code> and <code>onVariants</code> can optionally use a <code>VariantSelector</code> to reduce the number of variants the callback will run on, based on build type, name or flavor by using <code>withBuildType</code>, <code>withName</code> and <code>withFlavor</code> accordingly. The lambda <code>onVariants</code> and <code>beforeVariants</code> receives is executed after AGP computes variant combinations in <code>afterEvaluate</code>. Nesting properties inside <code>onVariants</code> is removed.\n\n<li>Similar APIs are added to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/4.2/com/android/build/api/extension/AndroidComponentsExtension\">androidComponents</a> to allow separate blocks for UnitTests (<code>beforeUnitTest</code> and <code>unitTest</code>) and AndroidTests (<code>beforeAndroidTest</code> and <code>androidTest</code>) instead of nesting tests inside variants.\n\n<li>Two classes used by both the old and new way of registering actions for variants were renamed. <code>Variant</code> is now <code>VariantBuilder</code>, and it is used in the <code>beforeVariants</code> phase. <code>VariantProperties</code> is now <code>Variant</code> and it is passed to the new <code>onVariants</code> block. \n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nLet’s take a look at some of these changes. Here is a sample <code>onVariants</code> block which targets the release build<code>. </code>The <code>onVariants</code>  block Is changed to <code>beforeVariants</code> and uses a variant selector in the following example.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">```\nandroid {\n   …\n   //onVariants.withName(\"release\") {\n   //   ...\n   //}\n   …\n}\nandroidComponents {\n   val release = selector().withBuildType(\"release\")\n   beforeVariants(release) { variant ->\n      ...\n   }\n}\n\n```</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nSimilarly<code> onVariantProperties </code>block  is changed to<code> onVariants.</code>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">```\nandroid {\n   ...\n   //onVariantProperties {\n   //   ... \n   //}\n   …\n}\n\nandroidComponents.onVariants { variant ->\n      ... \n}\n\n```</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nNote, this customization is typically done in a plugin and should not be located in build.gradle. We are moving away from using functions with receivers which suited the DSL syntax but are not necessary in the plugin code.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are planning to make these APIs stable with AGP 7.0.0 and all plugin authors must  migrate to the new androidComponents. If you want to avoid dealing with such changes, make sure your plugins only use stable APIs and do not depend on APIs marked as incubating.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you want to learn more about other changes coming with this release, make sure to take a look at the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features#2020.3.1\">release notes</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n   \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.</em>\n</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=IwX2mSayXqI:FSv6DnnbeiE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=IwX2mSayXqI:FSv6DnnbeiE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=IwX2mSayXqI:FSv6DnnbeiE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/IwX2mSayXqI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:11:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V_Z0XIQokGM/X8afs3RR--I/AAAAAAAAP50/KVRo9j43uoQP--wfD2qL8iP2HagX9DucwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/1_idoNj7WMAAZecVB0j6OL0A%2B%25281%2529.png","linkMd5":"dd3995e67177b7101f155203be119f62","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-42-684_aa380e1d2e26d9af.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":560,"sourceBytes":35384,"destBytes":23866,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V_Z0XIQokGM/X8afs3RR--I/AAAAAAAAP50/KVRo9j43uoQP--wfD2qL8iP2HagX9DucwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/1_idoNj7WMAAZecVB0j6OL0A%2B%25281%2529.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-42-684_aa380e1d2e26d9af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-52-158_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=IwX2mSayXqI:FSv6DnnbeiE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn27@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-52-043_746a61d62cbcbe31.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/IwX2mSayXqI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn42@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-52-130_7bf32d8ecabca217.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910982130},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:42","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:42","title":"Announcing Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) & Android Gradle plugin 7.0","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/deiunbqLQ2E/announcing-android-studio-arctic-fox.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fl_E3FcJWTk/X8aDwEsSl6I/AAAAAAAAP44/FLRzAJ8D_3EHia79Vi93dlX6bu2hsasMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/compose_preview%2B%25281%2529.gif\">\n<img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fl_E3FcJWTk/X8aDwEsSl6I/AAAAAAAAP44/FLRzAJ8D_3EHia79Vi93dlX6bu2hsasMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/compose_preview%2B%25281%2529.gif\">\n\n<p><em>Posted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamaleason\">Jamal Eason</a>, Product Manager </em><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LgTa-xDiknI/X4EflN56boI/AAAAAAAAPuk/24YyKnqiGkwRS9-_9suPKkfsAwO4wHYEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image9.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"Android Studio logo\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1217\" data-original-width=\"1197\" id=\"floatRight\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LgTa-xDiknI/X4EflN56boI/AAAAAAAAPuk/24YyKnqiGkwRS9-_9suPKkfsAwO4wHYEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image9.png\" style=\"width: 35%;\"/></a>\n\n<p>\nToday marks the release of the first version of Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) on the canary channel, together with Android Gradle plugin (AGP) version 7.0.0-alpha01. With this release, we are adjusting the version numbering of Android Studio and our Gradle plugin. This change decouples the Gradle plugin from the Android Studio versioning scheme and brings more clarity to which year and IntelliJ version Android Studio aligns with for each release.\n</p>\n\n<h3>New versioning scheme - Android Studio</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWith Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) we are moving to a year-based system that is more closely aligned with IntelliJ IDEA, the IDE upon which Android Studio is built. We are changing the version numbering scheme to encode a number of important attributes: the year, the version of IntelliJ it is based on, plus feature and patch level.  WIth this name change you can quickly figure out which version of the IntelliJ platform you are using in Android Studio. In addition,  each major version will have a canonical codename, starting with Arctic Fox, and then proceeding alphabetically to help make it easy to see which version is newer.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe recommend that you use the latest version of Android Studio so that you have access to the latest features and quality improvements. To make it easier to stay up to date, we made the version change to clearly de-couple Android Studio from your Android Gradle Plugin version. An important detail to keep in mind is that there is no impact to the way the build system compiles and packages your app when you update the IDE. In contrast, app build process changes and APK/Bundles are dictated by your project AGP version. Therefore, it is safe to update your Android Studio version, even late in your development cycle, because your project AGP version can be updated in a different cadence than your Android Studio version. Lastly, with the new version system it is even easier than before for you or your team to run both the stable and preview versions of Android Studio at the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/install-preview\">same time</a> on your app project as long as you keep the AGP version on a stable release. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn the previous numbering system, this release would have been Android Studio 4.3. With the new numbering system, it is now Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) Canary 1 or just, Arctic Fox.\n</p>\n\n\n<center> <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-slq6xg2pRmE/X8aDA3R0LUI/AAAAAAAAP4w/vplqs6aknvYd4X532vMr8xVzTW1-HDamACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-12-01%2Bat%2B12.45.26%2BPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"184\" data-original-width=\"1400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-slq6xg2pRmE/X8aDA3R0LUI/AAAAAAAAP4w/vplqs6aknvYd4X532vMr8xVzTW1-HDamACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-12-01%2Bat%2B12.45.26%2BPM.png\"/></a></div> </center>\n\n\n<p>\nGoing forward, here is how the Android Studio version number scheme will work:\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&lt;Year of IntelliJ Version>.&lt;IntelliJ major version>.&lt;Studio major version></strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>The first two number groups represent the version of the final IntellIj platform that a particular Android Studio release is based on (earlier canaries may still be on the earlier version). For this release, this is 2020.3.\n\n<li>The third number group represents the Studio major version, starting at 1 and incrementing by one for every major release.\n\n<li>To make it easier to refer to each version, we are also giving major releases a code name, incrementing from A to Z based on animal names. This initial release name is Arctic Fox.  \n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New versioning scheme - Android Gradle plugin</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWith AGP 7.0.0 we are adopting the principles of <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a>, and aligning with the Gradle version that AGP requires. Compatibility between Android Studio and Android Gradle plugin remains unchanged. Projects that use <strong>stable versions</strong> of AGP can be opened with newer versions of Android Studio. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe will publish <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/12/announcing-android-gradle-plugin.html\">another post</a> soon with more details about our AGP versioning philosophy and what is new in AGP 7.0.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>What is new in Android Studio Arctic Fox</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWe are in early days in the feature development phase for Arctic Fox, but we have invested much of our time in addressing over 200 quality improvements and bugs across a wide range of areas in the IDE from the code editor, app inspection tools, layout editor to the embedded emulator. Check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/releases\">release notes </a>for the specific bug fixes. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor those trying out <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\">Jetpack Compose</a>, we have a host of new updates, like deploy <code>@Preview</code> composables to device/emulator:\n</p>\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fl_E3FcJWTk/X8aDwEsSl6I/AAAAAAAAP44/FLRzAJ8D_3EHia79Vi93dlX6bu2hsasMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/compose_preview%2B%25281%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=imgFull border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fl_E3FcJWTk/X8aDwEsSl6I/AAAAAAAAP44/FLRzAJ8D_3EHia79Vi93dlX6bu2hsasMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/compose_preview%2B%25281%2529.gif\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a>\n\n  <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Deploy preview composable</p> </center> \n\n\n<p>\nAlso try out the new Layout Validation Tool in Arctic Fox to see how your layout responds to various screens sizes, font sizes, and Android Color Correction/Color Blind Modes. You can access this via the <strong>Layout Validation</strong> tool window when you are using the Layout Editor. \n</p>\n\n\n<center> <a
