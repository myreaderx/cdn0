They'll initially be found flying on the East Coast, as well as in the Bahamas and some Caribbean countries, before expanding to the West Coast and some parts of Canada and Mexico.&#160;</p><p>Thomas Flohr, the CEO of XO's parent company Vista Global, told Business Insider that \"explosive\" membership growth since April by nearly double was a primary catalyst for the expansion into the light jet realm.&#160;</p><p>Private jet firms across the US including XO are reporting a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-private-aviation-execs-are-preparing-for-business-travel-loss-2020-9\">faster-than-expected recovery from the pandemic centered around an increase in leisure travel</a>, encouraging expansion for the largest companies. Combined with XO's existing fleet of super-midsize and long-range aircraft, the light jet fleet will make the firm a one-stop-shop for a variety of planes.&#160;</p><p><em>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/private-jet-ceos-are-preparing-for-post-pandemic-boom-2020-5?r=tp-sub\" data-analytics-position=\"201\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Private jet industry CEOs say business will boom as the wealthy abandon airlines and reveal what they're doing now to take advantage</a></em></p><p>The move also strengthens XO's appeal in capturing the new market by offering the entry-level light jets that are more cost-effective than the larger super-midsize aircraft the firm has traditionally operated. New entrants often start by chartering light aircraft to get a feel for the industry and the perks of flying private before moving to the larger models.</p><p>The Ultra is an ideal aircraft for the popular short hops for which a large aircraft would be overkill, such as between New York City and Massachusetts Islands or Los Angeles and Las Vegas. And as the aircraft are owned by XO, getting owner approval for short flights – a common issue in the charter world where aircraft typically require approval by their owners, often an wealthy individual – won't be an issue.&#160;</p><p>Boasting a range of 1,960 nautical miles, according to <a href=\"https://www.jetcraft.com/jetstream/2015/12/textron-cessna-citation-ultra-1994-1999-2/\">Jetcraft</a>, XO can fly the jet on city pairs such as New York-Palm Beach, Los Angeles-Dallas, and Chicago-Phoenix without stopping for fuel, under the right conditions. Cessna produced the aircraft as part of its popular Citation family from 1994 until the turn of the century and during that time, it earned the title of \"Best Business Jet\" from Flying Magazine, <a href=\"https://www.jetcraft.com/jetstream/2015/12/textron-cessna-citation-ultra-1994-1999-2/\">Jetcraft</a> reported.&#160;</p><p>XO will be refurbishing the cabins and will soon include free WiFi onboard the jets. The firm just recently embarked on a fleet renewal for its Cessna Citation X and Bombardier Challenger 300 super-midsize aircraft, the latter of which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-a-newly-refurbished-xojet-aviation-private-jet-2020-11\">Business Insider toured in October</a>, giving the jets a new paint job and interior improvements.&#160;</p><p>Light jets are often the perfect compromise who want the benefits of private aviation but don't need a Gulfstream or Global Express every time they fly. Even before the pandemic, these types of light jets were popular because they are the least expensive jet aircraft to charter.</p><p>Smaller airports with shorter runways are also more accessible for light jet than with larger aircraft. And with service to regional cities being cut by the major airlines, leisure and business travelers are finding themselves with fewer options when it comes to commercial aviation.&#160;</p><p>\"We looked at how the world has changed in the last 10 months since COVID was hitting and a lot of the commercial infrastructure fell away,\" Flohr said. \"We saw that the demand for short-term travel is needed and many flyers living outside or working outside major aviation hubs, they're facing restrictions to get from A to B.\"&#160;</p><p>XO members have always had access to light jets, as well as over 2,100 aircraft through what the firm calls the XO Fleet Alliance, but having them owned and operated in-house allows XO to offer a consistent product.</p><p>Members can also book private jet charter flights online or through a new XO app that gives users a guaranteed price for the charter, eliminating the need to go through a third-party broker. The app also gives additional booking options allowing flyers can see different prices on different days as flexibility is key to <a

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>JetBlue Airways is joining the growing list of airlines that plan to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-blocking-middle-seats-for-thanksgiving-travel-2020-10\">fill their aircraft to capacity</a>&#160;in the upcoming months, abandoning a policy of onboard social distancing that was thought to be necessary in order to restore confidence in air travel.&#160;</p><p>Starting December 2, JetBlue will increase capacity on its aircraft to 85% through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. The airline's current policy for Thanksgiving travel is to limit capacity to 75%, which blocks most middle seats but doesn't guarantee that they're all empty.&#160;</p><p>Come January 8, all capacity limits will be removed and any seat on any JetBlue aircraft can be booked. In a message to the airline's crewmembers, JetBlue President and Chief Operating Officer Joanna Geraghty said that the airline expects less full flights during the winter as travel demand usually decreases.&#160;</p><p>The New York City-based airline is <a href=\"http://blog.jetblue.com/guidedbyscience/\">citing</a> a science-based approach in removing the seat restrictions, pointing to recent studies from Harvard and the US Department of Defense that show the efficacy of high-efficiency particulate air filters, or HEPA filters, and mask usage in stopping the onboard spread of coronavirus. All JetBlue passengers are required to wear masks at all times when flying, except when eating or drinking, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-jetblue-airways-during-the-pandemic-review-photos-details-2020-8\">Business Insider found on a recent flight in August</a>.&#160;</p><p>Unhappy passengers who have travel booked on JetBlue for January 8 or later, however, can request a full refund. Travel must have been booked by November 13 and the latest day to apply for the refund is November 27.&#160;</p><p>Passenger numbers from the <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput\">Transportation Security Administration</a> still show that under a million passengers are flying every day in the US but planes are filling up as airlines consolidate their route schedules. JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-08-13/jetblue-ceo-says-day-of-reckoning-is-near-for-airlines-video\">Bloomberg</a> in August that his airline would evaluate individual flights up to four days prior to departure to determine if they're financially viable and cancel them if they are not.&#160;</p><p>JetBlue joins Southwest Airlines, once a leading airline in the push to block seats, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/southwest-airlines-filling-planes-no-longer-blocking-middle-seats-2020-10\">which will open its planes come December 1</a>. America's largest low-cost airline cited the same Harvard and US government studies as JetBlue in its announcement last month that followed a $1.2 billion third-quarter loss.&#160;</p><p>Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines are the only two airlines to announce that all middle seats on their jets will be blocked through January 6, 2021, when the holiday travel season will have likely died down. Delta CEO Ed Bastian has said that he expects the policy to end in mid-2021</p><p>Hawaiian Airlines is blocking middle seats on its aircraft until December 15, as of now, and hasn't yet announced an extension into 2021. A spokesperson for the airline told Business Insider in October that the airline is confident in the current science surrounding mask usage and air filters, as well as its new cleaning practices.&#160;</p><p>The policy change also comes as JetBlue seeks a return to profitability following a third-quarter loss of <a href=\"http://investor.jetblue.com/investor-relations/financial-information/quarterly-results/27-10-2020\">$578 </a>million, announced last&#160;month. JetBlue is also planning to add a new aircraft to its fleet next month, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jetblue-unveils-airbus-a220-aircraft-built-in-alabama-photos-details-2020-10\">the Airbus A220 that's slated to dramatically boost the passenger experience</a> and replace the airline's aging Embraer E190 fleet.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The goal: to sell pendants and watches to festival-goers. The mantra: to just have a good time.&#160;</p><p>\"We just drive it around blasting music,\" Christian Johnston, GLD cofounder told Business Insider. \"It creates a good atmosphere.\"&#160;</p><p>It's just what's expected, perhaps, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shopgld/?hl=en\">of the popular jewelry brand</a>, whose elite client roster includes Justin Bieber, Cardi B, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Durant.</p><p>The brand is cool enough to snag partnership with the NFL, the NBA, the MLB, and Marvel, creating pendants designed as superheroes, and with basketball, football, and baseball team logos.&#160;</p><p>Johnston, 28, cofounded GLD alongside his childhood friend, Dan Folger, 27, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2015. Growing up, Johnston told Business Insider, they both always wanted to have nice jewelry, but never had the option to buy any for an affordable price.&#160;</p><p>\"You either had to spend thousands of dollars or you were getting something that was not so nice and you couldn't really be proud of,\" Johnston said. \"To me, you should always be proud of your jewelry if you're going to have it.\"&#160;</p><p>Each put just under $1,000 into the idea of making high-quality jewelry at a lower price point and the concept was a hit.</p><p>Five years later, the company is on track to do $50 million in revenue before the end of this year, per documents reviewed by Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>\"It was once a joke that everything we had we put into a cardboard box — our whole business could fit into a box,\" Johnston said. \"Then the box got a little bigger, and a little bigger, and then before we knew it, we had our first office in Pittsburgh.\"&#160;</p><h2>Johnston credits Instagram for helping the brand grow</h2><p>GLD, a play on the word \"gold,\" seeks to create affordable jewelry for the aspirational customer. A Rolex, for example can go anywhere from $5,000 to above $12,000. The lowest-priced — and best-selling — GLD watch goes for $899.</p><p>It's a watch that is fully covered in diamonds — a process known as \"icing.\" It is offered in either 18-carat plated gold or 14-carat solid gold, with the dial options of either white, red, and black. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fadcbab1e8d500019813468?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Christian Johntson GLD\" height=\"3000\" width=\"2417\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Christian Johnston cofounder of GLD</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Watches take a long time to produce, Johnston said, but GLD aims to create products that can compete with the Rolexes and the Audemars Piguets that the average consumer is priced out of buying. This means paying close attention to how the band, case, bezel, movements, and dials come together.&#160;</p><p>Johnston said he is also particular about the types of diamonds he uses, making sure to source from a dealer that allows him to track each diamond's origin.&#160;</p><p>One of GLD's first celebrity clients and supporters was Pittsburgh native Wiz Khalifa, who Johnson met through his manager back when Khalifa was just starting out in the rap game, he said. The company has since been able to expand its brand to heavy-hitter clients such as Justin Bieber and Cardi B.&#160;</p><p>Johnston credits GLD's Instagram presence for its brand growth, saying that GLD stayed consistent in posting content that showcased the brand and its products. The aesthetic of the brand is streetwear, glitz, and new money glamour, so its Instagram has photos that show <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CFOIaQNHqJb/\">rapper Rick Ross decked out in GLD diamond chains</a> and a GLD watch <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEx2t5kHf7p/\">wrapped around a bottle of Veuve Clicquot</a> champagne.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fadcbab1e8d500019813467?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Christian Johntson GLD\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Christian Johnston cofounder of GLD</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>GLD currently has just over 1 million followers on Instagram, and many clients, like Bieber, make requests through the social platform's direct messaging service.</p><p>Outside of social media, GLD has also fielded custom requests from country duo Florida Georgia Line and the Kardashians.&#160; Sometimes when big-name clients come to GLD, Johnston said, they request jewelry pieces on a tight deadline, sometimes two weeks or less.&#160;</p><p>When that happens, he said,&#160;\"We literally have to work day and night to get the sketches down and get the 3D cast done. And then hurry up and get it printed and then get it cast and then hurry up and get the diamond set.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fadcba94652d40019744250?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Christian Johntson GLD\" height=\"2062\" width=\"2197\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Trippie Redd custom choker.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Christian Johnston cofounder of GLD</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Those are extreme circumstances, however. Johnston said it typically takes them about a month to create each piece. One of the company's most memorable requests came from rapper Trippie Redd, who asked for a diamond choker necklace that fit perfectly around his neck. The choker is valued at around $100,000.&#160;</p><p>\"It was a skull that was bending backwards and the eyes lit up,\" Johnston continued. \"There was an on-and-off switch and the eyes had neon lights in them. [Redd] wears jewelry everywhere, so we had to make it waterproof.\"</p><h2>'You ice something out completely, you do risk potentially losing some value'&#160;</h2><p>Though GLD is known for making iced-out jewelry, Johnston acknowledged the risk of icing out a product too much.</p><p>Business Insider has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthy-people-buying-luxury-watches-as-they-shift-from-stocks-2020-4\">previously reported on how watches</a> such as Rolex, Philippe Patek Audemars Piguet, Richard Milles are typically seen as an investable asset class that retains its value over time. These watches are often made in styles that are seen to be classic and timeless.&#160;&#160;</p><p>But there's no telling how much an iced-out Richard Mille will go for in 20 years.</p><p>\"In general, you ice something out completely, you do risk potentially losing some value,\" Johnston says, adding that the investment value of a watch is tied to what's trending among consumers.&#160;</p><p>\"If you do it right, it will keep the value,\" Johnston continued. \"You have to make sure you're putting the right diamonds on to keep with the value of the watch and have the diamond paperwork to back it all up.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fadd5291e8d500019813471?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Christian Johntson GLD\" height=\"2250\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Up close of the Trippie Redd choker.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Christian Johnson cofounder of GLD</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Right now, the demand for iced-out diamonds has propelled GLD to popularity. Three years ago, the company relocated from Pittsburgh to Miami, and amid the pandemic, the company moved to an even larger space, doubling its team to 55 employees.</p><p>\"We were really back-and-forth between Miami and LA,\" he says. \"[In] Miami, we felt like there's more of an opportunity down here to create something new. LA has a lot more history with streetwear, but in Miami, there's more of an opportunity for us to really make a name for ourselves and take over.\"&#160;</p><p>Johnston said the coronavirus pandemic hasn't financially affected the company and credits its strong brand identity and loyal customer base with putting it on pace to reach $50 million in sales this year.</p><p>\"There were definitely challenges that came from it on the back end,\" Johnston said. \"Just in terms of keeping people safe, and my operations and things like that. But in terms of sales, we've had a great year. We didn't have to lay off any people.\"&#160;</p><p>During this time, the company has been focusing on its partnerships. In 2019, GLD entered into a partnership with both the National Basketball Association and Disney's Marvel, the latter of which has yet to be released. This year, GLD formalized its partnership with the NFL and released its collaboration with the MLB.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fadd79a4652d40019744261?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GLD Christian Johnston\" height=\"1632\" width=\"3264\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The piece GLD made for Kevin Durant\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Christian Johnston</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It's a testament to taking one's time, Johnston said. It took him five years to exceed 1 million followers on Instagram, he said — a piece of cake compared to what it took to formalize its partnership with the NBA.&#160;</p><p>\"There's a lot of things you gotta do to become eligible to work with the NBA,\" he says. \"They're very specific with who they work with.\"</p><p>He said there was not only a lot of&#160;paperwork, but associates from the NBA came to GLD to inspect its factories and its full behind-the-scenes process of how makes jewelry.&#160;</p><p>\"Luckily we, from the beginning, always made it a point to do things the right way,\" he said. \"I think that's made it a lot easier.\"&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-jewelry-exec-cofounder-gld-on-track-to-hit-50-million-in-sales-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/aU64Z4ZOQjY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 13:55:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fadcbed4652d40019744258?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"03a1aab8477db5de9250393fb3a526e8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn98@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-40-464_8c54a1babe1422bf.webp","destWidth":1019,"destHeight":766,"sourceBytes":74466,"destBytes":74466,"author":"ddavis@businessinsider.com (Dominic-Madori Davis)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fadccd21e8d50001981346c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn19@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-27-789_219523e1ba640e84.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fadcbab1e8d500019813468?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn90@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-33-722_e04a0abb8e723d1b.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fadcbab1e8d500019813467?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-36-177_f0966509e36367a0.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fadcba94652d40019744250?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-31-867_69e86964e575bedf.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fadd5291e8d500019813471?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn36@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-27-040_54bf2a97ee35abe3.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fadd79a4652d40019744261?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn65@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-34-766_9b33ae31a214e9ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn73@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-37-247_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn70@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-34-424_380249fb8d56642b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn77@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-37-288_ea17a0d51ecf3924.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn83@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-31-512_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aU64Z4ZOQjY:uHxsJPY2JXE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-32-245_a84ddc063cb7dd97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/aU64Z4ZOQjY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-24-982_18ce1995a2e333cb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374991897},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","title":"The racial wealth gap in real estate is growing.

The researchers calculated that Black families will spend $13,464 more than white families over the life of a home loan, which they estimated ultimately amounts to $67,320 in \"lost retirement savings for Black homeowners.\"</p><p>MIT's Edward L. Golding, Michelle Aronowitz, and Jung Hyun Choi labeled it \"the Black tax.\"</p><p>\"The average Black family has about $130,000 less in savings at the time of retirement than the average white family,\" Golding, who is also the executive director of the MIT Golub Center for Finance and Policy, told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-10-22/black-americans-pay-more-to-be-homeowners-than-other-groups-mit-video\">Bloomberg</a>. \"About half of that disparity can be directly attributed to the higher cost that they're paying on homeownership.\"</p><p>The difference is more than enough to keep minorities priced out of the housing market, which, to compound matters for Black Americans seeking to buy, has only <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-home-prices-rise-august-inventory-pandemic-2020-10\">gotten more expensive</a> throughout the pandemic year of 2020.</p><h2><strong>Black-owned homes are appraised at lower values</strong></h2><p>Even today, the racial makeup of a neighborhood can dictate its homes' value.</p><p>In 2015, the difference between the average home value in a predominantly white neighborhood and a predominantly Black neighborhood was $164,000, according to a September <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/socpro/spaa033/5900507?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">Oxford University Press study</a>. In 1980, it was $86,000.&#160;</p><p>The researchers said this widening gap could be attributed to appraisers using the \"sales comparison approach\" to valuing homes. This strategy, based off previously sold properties nearby, can result in appraisers valuing homes based on pricing that was determined prior to the implementation and enforcement of fair housing laws in the 1960s and 1970s. By using neighboring properties as benchmarks — whose prices may have been depressed for decades — appraisers today \"literally baked into the system the racialized element and continued it,\" said Junia Howell, one of the authors on the study.</p><p>The National Association of Realtors' director of fair housing policy, Bryan Green, told <a href=\"https://grow.acorns.com/how-race-affects-home-values-ownership/\">CNBC</a> that even when appraisers try to stay unbiased, they still use \"market conditions\" to estimate home values. But those very conditions may well have been shaped by the pervasive practice of lower prices in minority neighborhoods.</p><p>\"If race is baked into market conditions, everyone can disavow blame for a big problem,\" Green said. \"Everyone can say they are innocent, but there remains a big systematic problem.\"</p><p>The study noted that minority communities have built less wealth than white communities over the last 50 years as a direct result of the disparity in home appraisals.</p><h2><strong>A lawsuit alleges Redfin discriminates against Black home sellers</strong></h2><p>On top of paying more to own homes and having their homes valued at a lower prices, Black Americans could also struggle with discriminatory real estate practices.</p><p>On October 29, the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) <a href=\"https://nationalfairhousing.org/2020/10/29/nfha-files-federal-discrimination-lawsuit-to-stop-redfins-real-estate-redlining/\">filed a lawsuit</a> against Redfin, the popular real estate brokerage. The lawsuit alleges that the company \"discriminates against sellers and buyers of homes in communities of color in many metropolitan areas.\"</p><p>The lawsuit hinges on Redfin's minimum home price policy, which requires that properties be listed at a specific minimum price that varies from market to market. Certain services, like agent assistance and virtual tours, are only available for listings above that minimum.</p><p>Listings in Chicago, for example, have to exceed a $400,000 listing minimum for sellers and realtors to receive those supplemental services. The city's population is 30.1 percent Black, according to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/chicagocityillinois\">census data</a>. Meanwhile, listings in the next county over, DuPage County — which <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/dupagecountyillinois\">census statistics</a> record as 5.6% Black — have a $275,000 listing minimum, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/02/housing-groups-sue-redfin-alleging-federal-discrimination-violations/\">Washington Post.</a> The difference in the minimum prices effectively \"restricted access to services and financial incentives for sellers and buyers of homes in predominantly non-white areas.\"</p><p>In addition to Chicago, the NFHA's two-year investigation found that \"Redfin offers no services in non-white ZIP codes at a disproportionately higher rate than in white ZIP codes\" in and around Baltimore, Detroit, Kansas City, Memphis, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Long Island, and Newark. The lawsuit's plaintiffs called the practice a form of \"digital redlining,\" referencing <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-redlining-kept-black-americans-from-homeownership-and-still-does-2020-6\">the 1930s housing practice</a> of what the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) describes as \"denying credit to residents of predominantly minority neighborhoods.\"</p><p>\"Redfin's policies redline communities of color and will further exacerbate the racial wealth and homeownership gaps,\" the president of the NFHA, Lisa Rice, said in a statement. \"We must ensure that all neighborhoods are treated fairly and have access to the full range of services provided by real estate companies.\"</p><p>Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman posted <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-and-fair-housing/\">a statement</a> on the company's website in response to the lawsuit saying the company abides by the federal laws of the Fair Housing Act. \"The challenge,\" he wrote, \"is that we don't know how to sell the lowest-priced homes while paying our agents and other staff a living wage, with health insurance and other benefits.\"</p><p>Some changes could be on the horizon. Kelman pledged to \"expand into lower-priced communities ... faster,\" while the <a href=\"https://www.inman.com/2020/11/11/nar-considers-local-mandates-for-fair-housing-diversity-and-equity/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+inmannews+%28Inman+News+-+Headlines%29lines%29\">National Association of Realtors</a> just said it is considering requiring diversity, equity, and inclusion and fair housing components into their strategic plans and leadership trainings.&#160;</p><p>Experts like Green and Golding, however, say that sizable change will only come with new, equitable policies or further regulation at the local, state, and federal levels.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/race-real-estate-wealth-gap-housing-redfin-black-americans-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nHPTSxprnvQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 16:40:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fac57a998669500182b57f8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7dca0dfe9687ce21df7fc1cc96c5412e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-04-386_e10b556ed1017ed7.webp","destWidth":5119,"destHeight":3840,"sourceBytes":314830,"destBytes":314830,"author":"tborden@businessinsider.com (Taylor Borden)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fac57a998669500182b57f8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-04-386_e10b556ed1017ed7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn73@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-37-247_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-24-937_4d687bfeacb2dc9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn47@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-32-305_b5cded1c386a6575.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn83@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-31-512_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nHPTSxprnvQ:BElSyt3Exa4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-24-957_2d86a56b12c7ed1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nHPTSxprnvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn46@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-39-066_ab4a16f356bf8438.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374991860},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","title":"Restaurants are setting up tents and temporary structures to extend outdoor dining during the winter.

Outdoor dining has become so popular and lucrative that it's becoming a more permanent fixture everywhere from <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/real-estate/commercial/2020/10/21/extension-milwaukees-outdoor-dining-program-moves-ahead/6003924002/\">Milwaukee</a> to <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/news/temporary-outdoor-extension-licensed-premise-guidance-and-application\">Boston</a>.

In Chicago, for example, <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/bacp/supp_info/WinterDining.html\">the city mandates</a> that temporary outdoor structures must have 50% of the sides open in order to ensure air flow. New York City <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openrestaurants.shtml\">has the same rule</a>, but will allow fully enclosed structures — they'll just be regulated like indoor dining and capped at 25% capacity. Cities in <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Covid_Business_Recovery-Sept-17-updates/CTReopens_IndoorDining1029.pdf\">Connecticut</a> and <a href=\"https://www.summitdaily.com/news/breckenridge-discusses-restaurant-plans-for-outdoor-dining-tents-rethinks-events/\">Colorado</a> have similar mandates.&#160;</p><p>State and local laws aside, however, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-fo-restaurant-tents-outdoor-seating-20201110-rwozzqatirdoxptus7oc2no3gu-story.html\">infectious disease experts say</a> this type of dining comes with clear risks that customers should take into account before dining in one of these structures.&#160;</p><p>Jaimie Meyer, an infectious disease physician at Yale Medicine and associate professor at Yale School of Medicine, told Business Insider that while she applauds businesses for thinking creatively about how to prolong outdoor dining, some are going too far and essentially creating an indoor space.</p><p>\"When you're making those outdoor spaces look a lot more like indoor spaces — so if they have, all of a sudden, three-and-a-half walls, or the air flow's not great, or there's lots of people still at a table, then you kind of get rid of all of the potential benefits of outside,\" Meyer said.</p><p>Meyer said the two keys to safe outdoor dining are the ability to physically distance and airflow. But structures like four-sided tents lack air circulation that restaurants have — businesses aren't installing ventilation systems in a temporary curbside hut, meaning dining in an enclosed space like that could be even riskier than sitting inside at a restaurant, Meyer said.&#160;</p><p>\"You don't want air to essentially be stagnant,\" Meyer said. \"That's especially true in the winter because when there's less humidity in the air the droplets can actually disperse farther.\"&#160;</p><p>Meyer suggested bars and restaurants add a fan if they're going to have an enclosed outdoor space, or just lift a tent flap or leave a window open — anything to keep air circulating throughout the structure.&#160;</p><p>Beyond the inherent risks associated with little air flow and close proximity to other people, Meyer warned that outdoor dining structures may give people a false sense of security. Since they're not technically inside the restaurant, diners may relax social distancing measures, move around without their masks on, or otherwise treat it as an outdoor space, even if, for all intents and purposes, it's more like being indoors.&#160;</p><p>In many parts of the country, especially in places that experience wintry weather like New York or Chicago, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/10/restaurants-get-creative-to-keep-outdoor-diners-warm.html\">restaurants have set up igloos and greenhouses</a> that allow customers to dine, essentially, in a bubble. While those individual tents carry the same risks — namely, no ventilation — Meyer said they're a better solution as long as you only dine with people in your household.&#160;</p><p>\"Some virus particles can be aerosolized and kind of hang in the air, and they like to stick to surfaces like tables and chairs and potentially the inside of this bubble,\" Meyer said. \"There need to be precautions in place for a little bit of downtime between customers and good cleaning and disinfecting practices in between in order to make that safe.\"&#160;</p><p>Regardless of the precautions restaurants are taking with tents, igloos, and huts, Meyer said it's possible outdoor dining could be shut down again soon anyway as cases continue to rise.</p><p>The US reported nearly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-us-sets-record-for-hospitalizations-new-cases-2020-11\">151,000 new COVID cases</a> on Thursday, and more than 67,000 people are currently hospitalized as a result of complications from COVID-19. The US has now seen more than 234,000 deaths since of the onset of the pandemic. It's difficult to measure which part of the country is currently the hardest hit by the virus — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/us/coronavirus-crisis-united-states.html\">as The New York Times notes</a>, several parts of the country could be considered the biggest hot spot depending on how you measure it.&#160;</p><p>\"We're, as a country, really headed in a bad direction,\" Meyer said.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/outdoor-dining-tent-safety-risks-explained-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/gf3IBMjyVwQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 14:40:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faeb8501c741f0019ac9a9d?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"60fa44050f53b56e5bd453f46ada4ff4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn38@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-23-159_c2acf63348a16c6b.webp","destWidth":2727,"destHeight":2040,"sourceBytes":340828,"destBytes":340828,"author":"ahartmans@businessinsider.com (Avery Hartmans)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5faeb8501c741f0019ac9a9d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn38@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-23-159_c2acf63348a16c6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn73@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-37-247_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-37-610_0b02a65bfaa1d10f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn83@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-31-512_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gf3IBMjyVwQ:HUSshg2CUmI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-30-375_a21bed5c7dc8ba49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/gf3IBMjyVwQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn41@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-36-722_12b9009997d78067.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374991842},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","title":"The pandemic was supposed to break relationships and drive a wave of divorces.

Some people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/parenting/breakups-divorces-relationships-coronavirus.html\">foretold the demise of relationships</a> and romance: would pandemic-induced financial stress and emotional turmoil lead to increased bickering, distance, and a divorce boom?</p><p>It's an interesting reflex to think that more time together might cause us more relationship problems. Certainly, being together 24 hours a day and absent our outside social support networks has led some couples to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/parenting/breakups-divorces-relationships-coronavirus.html\">break stale or toxic relationships</a>. In Washington, DC, some divorce law firms <a href=\"https://wtop.com/local/2020/10/number-of-divorce-cases-in-dc-area-surge-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/\">saw a 70% increase</a> in the volume of calls. Other families are in the process of \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/opinion/sunday/divorce-marriage-coronavirus.html\">restructuring</a>\" — not necessarily because the pandemic caused the demise of their relationship, but because it gave them the time and space to make changes that were a long time coming.&#160;</p><p>While some relationships will certainly end during the pandemic, the reality for most couples might be far less dramatic than we think.&#160;</p><h2>Time spent together might have been just what some people needed.</h2><p>According to a <a href=\"https://media.graphcms.com/Lenti2dQtaMEvOMHmHXA\">recent survey</a>&#160;conducted by my couples app company Paired, in collaboration with The Open University, many couples are seeing their relationships improve instead of deteriorate. We surveyed approximately 2,800 adults in a relationship in the US and the UK, and found that relationships were more likely to get better during the pandemic than worse in both countries.&#160;</p><p>Respondents said that they spent more quality time together than usual, gave each other more emotional support, engaged in hobbies together, and split household duties more equally than they had in the past.&#160;</p><p>In the face of apocalyptic situations, or what we perceive to be \"end times\", humans want to find someone to brave the storm with. As Galit Atlas, a psychotherapist and professor at New York University, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/style/cuffing-season.html\">points out</a>, \"there is a lot of anxiety about the future right now, about the second wave of Covid…[p]eople talking about civil war and conspiracy theories and fear about the future. I do think that makes people not want to be alone.\"</p><p>Enduring hardship can also draw couples closer together. Researchers at Monmouth University observed that <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_052120/\">in the face of adversity \"we turn to our partners,</a>\" who can be a support system. Those same researchers found that over half of couples in the United States said they would <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_052120/\">come out of the quarantine with a stronger relationship</a> than before.&#160;</p><h2>Newer relationships were either strengthened or fell apart, while older relationships stayed steady.&#160;</h2><p>Our data showed the pandemic had a polarizing effect on couples depending on the age of the partners and the length of the relationship. In other words, younger couples or those with shorter relationship lifespans were more likely to either strengthen or worsen their relationship during the pandemic, while older couples or those who had been together for a longer period of time were more likely to have a steady relationship quality.</p><p>One interpretation of this is that the challenges of the pandemic were more likely to 'make-or-break' newer relationships. For example, moving in together in an haphazard way or not being able to spend time together can either worsen a relationship or prompt people to make extra effort to make things work. Longer and more committed relationships may be more stable in the face of changes.&#160;</p><p>Even if relationships overall were more likely to improve, this doesn't mean that arguments and uncomfortable conversations haven't happened for couples. With unstable economic conditions, a contagious disease running rampant, and uncertainty over when this will all end, tensions can run high. But along with these strong feelings, other strong emotions can be accessed, too.</p><p>A big piece of growing closer together is unearthing feelings that have been suppressed, or discussing the taboo topics we generally skirt around. Dr. Terri Orbuch, professor at Oakland University and research scientist who wrote \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Steps-Take-Marriage-Great/dp/1632990563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445441399&sr=8-1&keywords=simple+steps+to+take+your+marriageour+marriage\">5 Simple Steps to Take Your Marriage From Good to Great</a>,\" found in her ongoing study of 373 couples for over 30 years that, \"When couples shared their anxieties, concerns and fears with each other in a constructive manner, rather than let them fester and grow, they were happier in their relationship over time.\"&#160;</p><p>We will always remember this era of our lives and will no doubt be changed for it. But that change can also be something that shifts the way we look at those we love and our lives together. Whether that means we stay together —or not — might be the one thing we can thank the pandemic for.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

your mic-drop moment. You start to explain your winning idea when your coworker interrupts the conversation, and takes your metaphorical mic from your hands. Now you know how Taylor Swift must have felt at the 2009 MTV Awards when Kanye West stole her thunder mid-speech.</p><p>In the heat of a meeting, anyone can get interrupted, but an abundance of research has shown that women are more frequently interrupted than men. In fact, a&#160;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/action/cookieAbsent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>&#160;found that men interrupted women 2.1 times over the course of a three-minute conversation and only interrupted men 1.8 times. Interestingly, women were also more likely to interrupt another woman than to interrupt a man.</p><p>Gender aside, when someone interrupts you, it implies that your statement isn't valuable — and when it comes time to get evaluated for a promotion, you want <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/make-a-great-impression-at-business-meetings-0518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">people to recognize you</a> for your good ideas — not your almost-good-idea-that-got-cut-off. Monster spoke to experts to find out how to politely (but firmly) get people to stop interrupting you.</p><h2><strong>Take ownership of your idea</strong></h2><p>If someone barges into your explanation of your very good idea, wait for the person to finish speaking, then finish your statement, says Kathy Caprino, founder of Connecticut-based career coaching firm, Ellia Communications. Then, in a factual (read: non-accusatory) way, mention that you're following up on your idea or opinion.</p><p>For example, when a coworker interrupts a conversation, she suggests saying, \"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to circle back and share the final piece of my idea, because it's important to the discussion.\"&#160;</p><p>\"The key is to establish your authority, confidence, and know-how on this topic and not to get derailed,\" Caprino said, \"but do it in a respectful, calm, and compelling way.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/8-ways-to-make-yourself-job-indispensable-post-covid-19-2020-5\">8 ways to make yourself indispensable at work during COVID-19, according to an executive coach</a></em></p><h2><strong>Use the amplification strategy</strong></h2><p>If you're dealing with a notorious interrupter, you can pair up with a colleague and use the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/13/white-house-women-are-now-in-the-room-where-it-happens/\">\"amplification\" strategy,</a>&#160;a tactic popular with female White House staffers, whereby a woman makes an important point and another woman emphasizes it and credits it accordingly.</p><p>Similarly, Baltimore-based career coach Rachel Andujar recommends developing a \"buddy system\" in advance. \"You and a colleague can stand up for each other's ideas to make sure that they are heard and are validated,\" she said. Now you're covertly claiming ownership and helping out a colleague. Win-win.</p><h2><strong>Speak confidently</strong></h2><p>Take time to think objectively about your delivery. Remember that word choice, tone, and cadence can all <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/7-words-that-make-you-sound-less-confident-in-emails-0916\">undermine your confidence</a>. Jill Jacinto, a millennial career expert at the career and lifestyle site WORKS, recommends paying attention to your volume, clarity, up-speak, and whether you are concise or verbose. (And please don't be the person who starts a statement with, \"This may be a bad idea, but...\" or, \"I could be wrong, but…\")</p><p>If you're worried the problem may not be&#160;<em>what</em> you say but rather how you say it, use a popular media-training technique.

By and large, though, the surprisingly close final vote tally broke down along social class: the wealthiest parts of the country overwhelmingly voted for Biden and the poorest overwhelmingly for Trump.&#160;</p><p>After an election run-up featuring polls projecting a clear lead, maybe even a landslide for Biden, the reveal was anything but a consensus, instead a deep divide in American views on how to move forward from 2020, perhaps in the American Dream itself.&#160;</p><p>The American Dream has taken on various meanings since the phrase first appeared in James Truslow Adams'&#160;\"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1180986-the-epic-of-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1180986-the-epic-of-america\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">The Epic of America</a>\" in 1931, but it typically means freedom of opportunity and the promise that anyone can be a success if they work hard enough. The election of 2020 proved as never before that the more and less economically&#160;successful regions of the US look at the concept differently.</p><p>Understanding these divergent views requires understanding how party votes mirror population density patterns, how America's elite class continues to pull away from the rest, and how large-scale patterns of wealth in America swung the 2020 election.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f984892861cb70019936ace?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Trump rally\" height=\"1252\" width=\"1669\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Trump cemented support among America&#39;s rural communities.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>The rural divide</strong></h2><p>Rural America has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/04/democrats-fail-persuade-rural-america-heartlands-us-election-2020-trump\">supported Trump since he took office</a>, praising him for cutting taxes, <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/11/02/icymi-president-trump-fighting-our-farmers-ranchers-and-rural\">tackling overregulation</a>, and pushing back against China's trade practices to protect American jobs.</p><p>This perception of Trump as a man of the working class is significant in America, where elections often boil down to geography. The 477 counties that Biden won comprise 70% of America's GDP,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/11/09/biden-voting-counties-equal-70-of-americas-economy-what-does-this-mean-for-the-nations-political-economic-divide/\">according to a Brookings report</a>, whereas the 2,497 counties that voted for Trump comprise 29%. This is a greater disparity than 2016, when Hillary Clinton counties comprised about 64% of GDP. (These stats reflect unofficial results from 96% of counties.)</p><p>Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director of Brookings' Metropolitan Program and one of the report's authors, told Business Insider that this result \"leaves us with two economic parties that really reside in different economic worlds talking past each other.\"&#160;</p><p>This economic divide has been sharpening since the 2000 election before accelerating in the past decade peaking in 2020, Muro added, leaving America with an unproductive state of affairs. He said he doesn't see the fundamental trends driving this intensified division changing anytime soon.</p><p>But there's another angle to this division that has to do with density.</p><p>Will Wilkinson, vice president of research at the the <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-density-divide-urbanization-polarization-and-populist-backlash/\">moderate-leaning think tank</a> Niskanen Center, who authored research on the correlation between population density and party vote share, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1324049645639708673\">tweeted the day after the election</a> that he was \"embarrassed\" he hadn't taken his own research \"seriously enough.\" In 2020, he didn't see Biden's slim victory in many states coming, but his 2019 paper almost predicted it.</p><p>Wilkinson told Business Insider that his research shows the densest part of a city or metro area is primarily Democratic, and this trend drops as you move&#160;out toward the country. The inner and outer suburbs then become split along party lines, with Republicans starting to take on the majority the farther out you drive as the population becomes less dense.</p><p>To be sure, Trump has many wealthy supporters and Biden has many working-class ones, but the 2020 election revealed that the rank-and-file voter in the wealthier part of the country is pro-Biden, and the reverse is true of Trump.&#160;</p><p>Wilkinson cited the example of a car dealership owner in a poorer, rural area, where \"there's kind of a sense of malaise,\" so despite making a decent living, the sense that things are \"kind of falling apart\" leads to a vote for Republicans, especially Trump, whose \"Make America Great Again\" slogan harkens back to that exact sense of reversing decline.&#160;</p><h2>Whither the American Dream?</h2><p>Trump's actual economic plan for his rural voters hasn't been as clear as his sloganeering, though.&#160;</p><p>Promises to boost rural America were central planks of his 2016 campaign, but not all came to fruition. In 2017, for instance, he and the Wisconsin GDP <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump\">made a deal with manufacturing company Foxconn</a> to revive manufacturing in the state's southeastern region, but the factory doesn't exist today. And while Trump has promised to revive the coal industry, coal production is declining at a faster rate than it did under Obama, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-promise-to-revive-coal-thwarted-by-falling-demand-cheaper-alternatives-11600269350\">reported The Wall Street Journal</a> in September.</p><p>Biden has offered a <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/joe-bidens-plan-to-build-back-better-for-american-workers/\">detailed economic plan</a>, targeted directly at improving opportunities for the working class in many ways. Trump hasn't been as specific, preferring instead to <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/economy/article/Trump-says-he-built-a-booming-economy-15674039.php\">tout the performance of the economy</a> until the pandemic hit American shores, although Trump's economy was largely similar to the one from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/charts-contrasting-trump-economy-obama-bush-administrations-republicans-democrats-2020-10\">Barack Obama's second term</a>.</p><p>As Muro points out, Trump's agenda didn't include a lot of specific proposals. \"If Trump promised something about reviving American factories and manufacturing and so on, I think it was for a stylistic appeal to an anti-system, a brash and resentful view of those big cities,\" he said. &#160;</p><p>Trump voters bought into this strategy, Wilkinson said, and thus didn't blame him for the pandemic-led downturn. \"How well you think the economy is performing depends on who is in power,\" he said. If a Democrat is in the White House, Democrats will think the economy is doing better than Republicans, and vice versa. This dynamic has worsened with the election, he said.</p><h2>America in the age of 'elite overproduction'</h2><p>An unorthodox social scientist has created a dark theory that may explain this divide between a party with a plan and another with a sort of anti-plan: \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-booklist-for-better-capitalism-2019-3\">elite overproduction</a>.\" The University of Connecticut's Peter Turchin, a \"cultural evolution scientist,\" coined this term, arising out of his use of data to chart how societies rise and decline.</p><p>At the stage America finds itself in now, Turchin <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheAtlantic+%28The+Atlantic+-+Master+Feed%29+Feed%29\">explained to The Atlantic's Graeme Wood in a recent article</a>, the growth of its elite class has exceeded the growth of jobs for members of that class. Turchin told Wood it's \"too late\" for America to correct this, likening its current trajectory to a ship sailing toward an iceberg.</p><p>The \"elites\" who voted for Biden by Turchin's definition — or residents of the dense America in Wilkinson's — seem to acknowledge that the their best bet for the future is betting on the economies of dense, rich places which may not have quite enough jobs to go around.&#160;Turchin defines the Trump administration as a \"counter-elite movement,\" which appeals to the less wealthy in society while seeking revenge on the traditional elite class.</p><p>Some argue that the polarization isn't about wealth or economics, but about culture. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democratic congresswoman who barely won re-election in 2020, argued to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/13/elissa-slotkin-braces-for-a-democratic-civil-war-436301\">Tim Alberta in Politico</a> that the defining divide is between half of the country with a conceited view of its own enlightenment, and another half that resents that attitude.</p><p>However, Slotkin also implicitly supported Wilkinson's density theory, saying the biggest difference she notices in politicians is between those who are in competitive districts and those who aren't — the most competitive districts are the ones that straddle the line between dense and rural.</p><p>Muro said economics, wealth, and culture shouldn't be discussed separately. \"It's very clear there are divisions in the economic base inflaming cultural or racial animosity. Economies really matter and shape identity and culture.\"</p><h2><strong>The unbridgeable gap</strong></h2><p>What's clear is that while Joe Biden may have won the 2020 election, the economic and political divide that separates the wealthy, dense America from the other one isn't going anywhere.&#160;</p><p>Joe Biden counties may account for around 70% of GDP and Trump counties only around 30%, but their popular vote totals represent 51% and 47% of the country, respectively. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-wins-general-election-against-donald-trump-2020-11\">More than 73 million</a> Americans voted for Trump, the second-highest total for any candidate ever, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-popular-vote-record-barack-obama-us-presidential-election-donald-trump/\">behind only Biden</a>'s total of more than 78 million.&#160;</p><p>The land of the wealthy sees a clear solution to what ails America, and the land of the left behind sees the opposite. How Joe Biden can tie together this maybe unbridgeable gap is likely to be the defining issue of his presidency — and a question for wealth and opportunity in the United States for much longer.</p><p><em>[This article has been updated with regard to when President Trump took office.]</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-2020-election-revealed-divide-in-american-dream-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nmJiDkaR8bw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 13:45:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fadb6284652d40019744228?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"642c515ad2e8ab4781adf91a1f15aecc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn41@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-14-374_83ba19d8ecd138fe.webp","destWidth":2500,"destHeight":1875,"sourceBytes":153290,"destBytes":153290,"author":"nlichtenberg@businessinsider.com (Nick Lichtenberg,Hillary Hoffower)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fadb6284652d40019744228?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn41@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-14-374_83ba19d8ecd138fe.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f984892861cb70019936ace?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-33-939_d2559fba1fbbce82.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn73@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-37-247_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn10@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-38-222_4c9da08b0f3b5b71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-27-993_ad47d6710efc9de9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn83@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-31-512_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nmJiDkaR8bw:iIY_8eIy02k:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn17@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-35-279_c4f1552f4eb425ec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nmJiDkaR8bw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-29-877_c9af42a6f19760eb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374991890},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:51","title":"Meet Carly Cooperman, the millennial CEO of one of NYC's top political consulting firms.

Schoen</a>, a huge name in the field who was striking out on his own.</p><p>In 2007, Schoen made Cooperman the first hire at his new firm, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200729005993/en/Schoen-Consulting-Rebrands-as-Schoen-Cooperman-Research-Appoints-Carly-Cooperman-as-CEO\">Schoen Cooperman Research</a>, and just this past July, the 35-year-old Cooperman was named CEO.</p><p>\"Carly Cooperman is a brilliant researcher, a sophisticated analyst of public opinion, and a natural choice to be the CEO of Schoen Cooperman Research,\" Schoen told Business Insider.</p><p>He said that she \"represents the best of the next generation of survey researchers — technically sophisticated, client-focused, and extremely well organized.\"&#160;</p><p>As for Cooperman, she recalled moments when she would show up to meetings, and in addition to being one of the few women in the room, she was also one of the youngest people to take a seat.&#160;</p><p>Here's how she worked her way up and landed big-fish clients along the way, from Mike Bloomberg to HBO.</p><h2>The first hire for a new firm, mentored by an industry legend</h2><p>When Cooperman met Schoen in 2007, he was coming off a long tenure at top consulting firm Penn, Schoen &#38; Berland, which he cofounded in 1977 with another famed political strategist, Mark Penn, who among other things, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-penn-microsofts-master-of-dark-political-arts-gets-a-boost-in-the-companys-new-reorg-2013-7\">coined the \"soccer mom\" term</a> in the Clinton administration of the 1990s.</p><p>Previous clients for Schoen included former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates and former US President Bill Clinton.&#160;</p><p>Schoen was referred to Cooperman by her consulting boss from her college days, who passed on her resume to Schoen at a book party.&#160;A few days later, Schoen called, offering a huge opportunity, but without certainty attached.</p><p>As Cooperman recounted, Schoen told her, \"I'm really not sure where this is going to look like, and I will offer you a six-month job, and just come work and you can learn the business and see what it is.\"</p><p>She decided to bet on herself. \"I just figured I was young and I should take a chance,\" she told Business Insider.</p><p>At the time, she says, it was just Doug and his assistant, making her the new firm's first official employee.</p><p>\"I loved the idea of taking numbers and data and hard science and using it to inform messaging and communication strategy,\" she said. \"It just hit home to me.\" She said she went on to hold essentially every job at the firm before being named CEO earlier this year.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa1c7061df1d50018218aee?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Doug Schoen\" height=\"2400\" width=\"3600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>(L-R) Jon Corzine, Doug Schoen and Mike Bloomberg attend the NYU Child Study Center Eighth Annual Child Advocacy Award Dinner at Cipriani on November 29, 2005 in New York City.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Patrick McMullan / Contributor / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Today, Schoen Cooperman has grown to a team of 10, and it doesn't just have political heavyweights under its wing — it also has big media players&#160;such as HBO, Vice, and Snap, in addition to Equinox, Walmart, and Major League Baseball.</p><p>But political initiatives remain a huge area where the firm makes its presence felt, often with longtime client Mike Bloomberg.</p><p>Schoen Cooperman played a big part in helping to uphold the ban on flavored e-cigarettes in San Francisco, a major Bloomberg initiative, and, also working with Bloomberg, helped the Democrats take back the House of Representatives in 2018. (Cooperman said her firm has worked with Bloomberg for the last 10 years, dating back to his tenure as mayor of New York City, while Schoen's consulting relationship with Bloomberg goes back two decades.)</p><blockquote class=\"pullquote\">21 of the 24 candidates that we supported eventually won; 15 of those candidates were women.</blockquote><p>In 2018, she recalled, Bloomberg wanted to do whatever he could to help the Democrats win control of the House. Her consulting firm helped him identify about 80 swing districts and narrowed down 24 that were worth targeting with different ads.&#160;</p><p>\"In New Jersey, we were talking about taxes, in California, we talked about climate issues. In Oklahoma, it was a Republican district, but voters were moved by pro-choice issues,\" she said. \"And 21 of the 24 candidates that we supported eventually won; 15 of those candidates were women.\"&#160;</p><p>Schoen Cooperman is still very involved with the former candidate, she said, now working with him on behalf of Democratic nominee Joe Biden on the swing states of Florida, Texas, and Ohio in the 2020 presidential election.&#160;</p><p>\"As Mike said, he's committed to helping whatever Democrat gets elected,\" Cooperman says. \"He felt like the most important thing is to defeat Donald Trump. And so that's what we're doing now to try — to help execute on that vision.\" &#160;</p><h2>Personal relationships are key to success</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa1c7c669331a0011bc719f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Plepler\" height=\"2544\" width=\"3823\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Richard Plepler was the CEO of HBO from 2012 to 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mike Coppola / Staff / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Personal relationships are a big aspect of Cooperman's success in the field, she said, since most of her clients come from word of mouth. Apple, for instance, was referred to Schoen Cooperman by Richard Plepler, the former CEO of HBO, with whom&#160;Schoen Cooperman had worked as the media giant sought to launch its streaming service to compete with Netflix.</p><p>A few years later, that work led to them helping Apple launch Apple Music to compete with Spotify.&#160;\"They were trying to enter a market where there was already Spotify and other music streaming services,\" she said. \"And they were like, 'Hey, how do we make this launch? How can we enter this space stronger? How do we attract people's attention? How do we pull them away from these already competing, and existing spaces?\"</p><p>Plepler also referred them to Snapchat and Vice for later work, Cooperman said.</p><p>Cooperman's ease with other people has been a hallmark of her time in consulting, according to her employees.</p><p>Sam Turer, a senior strategist at the firm, said Cooperman taught him about the importance of maintaining personal relationships, whether it's with clients or coworkers.</p><blockquote class=\"pullquote float_right\">The way she is able to take such a bird's eye view of everything we have going on, compartmentalize it, and make sure everything is running smoothly is incredibly impressive</blockquote><p>Another strategist, Saul Mangel, said Cooperman's friendliness has helped inspire the team to perform its best. \"There is obviously the hierarchical relationship of her as the CEO,\" he continued. \"But I know I can go to her informally and casually.\"</p><p>\"When she says something, it's less 'the boss says this' and more 'Carly says this,'\" Mangel continued. \"Because she's more experienced and educated on anything we do than we are.\"&#160;</p><h2>Attention to detail pays off</h2><p>Married to this friendliness is an attention to detail, according to both Cooperman and her employees.&#160;</p><p>\"Carly has preached that speed is fine,\" Mangel said. \"But she would rather get something from me that is maybe 30 minutes later, but [that] I have double and triple-checked.\" When Mangel first joined the firm in May 2019, he said he would focus on getting tasks done quickly, often missing out on the \"little things.\"&#160;</p><p>Turer shared a similar observation that Cooperman \"still gets in the weeds with the work, and that is something I believe is critically important for upper management.\"&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"The way she is able to take such a bird's eye view of everything we have going on, compartmentalize it, and make sure everything is running smoothly is incredibly impressive,\" he told Business Insider.</p><p>\"When the system is run by men that are making the calls and running things, it's almost like an echo chamber, '' she said. This attention to detail may come from another place: that Cooperman is the top-ranking woman at her firm in a field still dominated by men.&#160;</p><p>She recalls the moments when she would show up to meetings, and in addition to being one of the few women in the room, she was also one of the youngest people to take a seat.&#160;</p><p>But she said she has learned to handle that over the past 13 years, mostly by making sure to walk into each room prepared, full of confidence, and full of competence. \"Most of the people in the room are men,\" she said. \" There's this feeling of working 10 times harder to be able to prove yourself and to hold your own in a room full of men.\"&#160;</p><p>\"I know what I'm talking about and I know the material that I'm presenting,\" she continued. \"I walk in there knowing I have a better understanding of what we're about to share with the client than anyone else.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

how much risk they're willing to take on in order to hang out with loved ones.</p><p>To help with that assessment, researchers at Georgia Tech created <a href=\"https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/\">an interactive tool</a> that calculates the risk for you.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01000-9\">A study published Monday</a> describes the tool, which can tell you the likelihood that you'll encounter at least one person infected with COVID-19 at a gathering, depending on your location and the size of the group.&#160;</p><p>According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, indoor gatherings are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-urges-caution-for-thanksgiving-covid-family-and-friends-gatherings-2020-10\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\" data-uri=\"340437995c5943212cdd73964562f092\">driving the unprecedented coronavirus surge in the US</a>. So ideally, people should avoid close contact with those outside their households to lower their risk of getting the coronavirus.</p><p>But if you <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-clebrate-thanksgiving-holidays-safely-coronavirus-experts-2020-10\">are planning to see your friends and family this holiday season</a> anyway, the risk-assessment tool can offer a sense of just how big a risk you're taking. The numbers get updated in real time, so your risk may change from day to day.</p><p>\"It gives people a way of envisioning themselves in a situation and be able to decide whether to go to the event or not,\" Clio Andris, a professor of city planning at Georgia Tech and co-author of the new study, told Business Insider.</p><p>Say you are planning a dinner party with nine other guests on Friday. If you're in New York City, the tool shows that you'd have at least a 12% chance of sharing air with an infected person. But if the party is in Chicago with a group the same size, the risk jumps to more than 50%.&#160;</p><h2>Risk depends on the gathering size and your county</h2><p>To use <a href=\"https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/\">the tool</a>,&#160;first select how big your gathering is — between 10 and 5,000 people. Then you'll be prompted to hover your cursor over the US county where your gathering will take place.&#160;</p><p>The probability that an infected person will be present is shown on a scale from 0% to 100%. The data underpinning the math is updated everyday, Andris said, based on daily case numbers collected by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#states\">The New York Times</a>.</p><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faeddc2402d49001924ee11?format=jpeg\" alt=\"covid risk assessment tool\" height=\"491\" width=\"1199\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A screenshot of the COVID-19 risk assessment tool map from Georgia Tech.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><p>The tool shows how different the risk can be from county to county: The higher the number of cases per capita, the higher the risk. Risk also grows as groups get larger.</p><p>As of Friday, for instance, there's an 89% chance that an infected person will be at a 10-person gathering in Norton County, Kansas. Compare that to 11% for the same size party in Monroe County, New York.&#160;</p><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faeddc11c741f0019ac9bb4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"covid risk assessment tool\" height=\"640\" width=\"1033\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A screenshot of coronavirus risk in Norton County, Kansas on Friday.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><p>The tool also attempts to factor in the asymptomatic carriers that COVID-19 testing might be missing. According to Andris, the researchers introduced an element into their calculations called \"ascertainment bias,\" which is an estimate of the number of actual coronavirus cases per documented case. They based this estimate on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.4130\">July research</a> that compared the total number of people who tested positive to the total number of people with antibodies (which indicates they'd previously been infected) at 10 sites across the US.</p><p>The tool offers two \"ascertainment bias\" options: Users can have the tool assume that the actual number of coronavirus cases in the US is either five or 10 times higher than official tallies. That latter option is likely more accurate, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html\">an August report</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faeddc1402d49001924ee10?format=jpeg\" alt=\"covid risk assessment tool\" height=\"506\" width=\"904\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The COVID-19 risk assessment tool from Georgia Tech uses gathering size to calculate risk.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><p>A larger ascertainment bias also results in increased risk.</p><h2>A 'decision support system'</h2><p>What the tool cannot do, the study authors said, is tell a user the likelihood that they might get infected at a gathering.

Overall, people reduced purchases of high-contact goods and services. Even more strikingly, older individuals and people who are likely to have health problems decreased that type of spending much more than younger, healthier consumers.</p><p>\"Overall, we saw people act in a way that is consistent with the models of risk-taking behavior commonly used in economics,\" Rebelo said. \"And that's encouraging.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-small-retailers-prepare-holiday-season-supply-chain-inventory-2020-10\">How small retailers are handling supply chain disruptions and limited inventory as the holiday season approaches</a></em></p><section></section><h2>Spending in the time of COVID-19</h2><p>To examine these changes in consumer behavior, Rebelo teamed up with&#160;<a href=\"https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~yona/\">Martin Eichenbaum</a>, an economics professor at Northwestern University,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/pt-pt/pessoa/miguel-godinho-matos\">Miguel Godinho de Matos</a>&#160;at Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics,&#160;<a href=\"https://lisboa.academia.edu/FranciscoLima\">Francisco Lima</a>&#160;at Universidade de Lisboa, and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/en/fachbereich/vwl/trabandt/index.html\">Mathias Trabandt</a>&#160;at Freie Universitat Berlin. They studied consumer spending in Portugal from January 2018, well before the pandemic hit, to May 2020, after the first peak in global cases.</p><p>Beyond the fact that Portugal is Rebelo's home country, they chose to focus their study there because the country's statistical authority gave them access to a treasure trove of data: an anonymized monthly summary of electronic&#160;<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!HgFX25ct9fQM-lh73u9j70XDXqfdO0eeWED6EUJcnR-MwQKPj7XPoSvks8Og9Vd5ecIL-s8lIHjg6w$\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">value-added-tax (VAT)</a> receipts for purchases of goods and services. The data includes consumers' anonymized identifiers that proxy for fiscal numbers, which are similar to Social Security numbers in the US. These identifiers are integrated with individual characteristics, including age and annual income. The final sample includes anonymized data for close to 100 million transactions undertaken by 400,000 Portuguese consumers.\"</p><p>\"In Portugal, people have an incentive to put their fiscal number on the VAT receipt because they get some tax deductions and can be entered into lotteries,\" Rebelo said. \"Pretty much everybody knows their fiscal number by heart and gives it even when making small purchases like buying a sandwich.\"</p><p>Rebelo and collaborators focused on the purchase patterns of civil servants and retirees. This enabled them to control for the effects of COVID-related income fluctuations. \"We know that civil servants have stable jobs, so losing jobs wasn't an issue for them. It was obviously also not an issue for retirees,\" he explained.</p><p>The researchers examined how spending for high-contact goods and services, like food in restaurants, and for low-contact purchases, like legal and accounting services, changed for different age groups and for healthier and less-healthy people, after the pandemic started.</p><h2>Evidence of rationality</h2><p>As expected, the pandemic affected spending in ways that reduced the risk of getting infected with coronavirus.</p><p>For one, spending declined in general once COVID hit. \"In Portugal, as in much of the rest of the world, that first wave peaked in April, with the largest number of infections,\" Rebelo said. \"So that's when there was the highest risk of infection.\" In line with this timing, spending dropped across all age groups during April.</p><p>But the pattern of spending cuts differed by age. While older individuals cut spending significantly, younger people, who face a lower risk of dramatic health consequences, cut spending by much less. For example, in April, consumers age 20 to 49 cut their total expenditures by about 29%, while those in their 70s reduced spending by more than 50%. Strikingly, the response of consumers by age mirrors the probability of dying from COVID-19.</p><p>These patterns hold for the purchase of high- and low-contact items, as well: While spending fell for both categories, there was a greater drop in purchases of high-contact goods and services — which involved greater risk of infection — and that reduction was more pronounced for older individuals. In April, consumers in their 70s cut expenditures on high- and low-contact goods by 62% and 28%, respectively, while those under 49 decreased spending by 26% and 19%.</p><p>\"Older people were much more careful than younger people,\" Rebelo said. \"They reduced their consumption of high-contact items by much more.\"</p><p>The researchers also wanted to understand how spending changed for people with health conditions. They implemented this analysis by observing how much money people spent on pharmaceuticals. The idea is that those who spend more at the pharmacy are more likely to have health conditions. They then compared the overall spending of those in the top 10% of pharmaceutical spending with that of everyone else.</p><p>\"For every age group,\" Rebelo said, \"those likely to have health conditions cut their spending a lot more than those less likely to have health conditions.\" That was true for purchases overall — and especially for high-contact items.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-grocery-stores-embrace-dynamic-pricing-esl-compete-online-2020-9\">Experts say the pandemic might force the adoption of dynamic pricing as brick-and-mortar stores adapt online retailers' strategies to survive</a></em></p><section></section><h2>It starts at the top</h2><p>Overall, the results suggest a great deal of rationality in the way people responded to COVID, with those at greater risk taking larger measures to reduce their exposure to infection.</p><p>\"It's always easy to find examples of people who do not act rationally,\" Rebelo said. \"But here we see people acting to protect their self-interest.\"</p><p>However, he cautions that the behavior observed in Portugal may have been linked to how that country's leadership handled the early days of the pandemic.</p><p>\"Portugal had a coherent nationwide containment and communication strategy,\" Rebelo said. \"That strategy is likely to have helped people make sounder decisions.

She did, however, have the desire to make a change.</p><p>In Indian culture, jewelry holds great sentimental value and is something that is typically passed down for generations. And as a Silicon Valley native, Yarlagadda grew up close to one of the US' venture capital hotspots.</p><p>Her idea was a jewelry business that would also \"give women access to venture capital and opportunities beyond the capital.\" She told Business Insider, \"there's so much work to do.\" Yarlagadda's initial idea was to take the good financial margins from fine jewelry and then continuously <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shiffonco/?hl=en\">investing Shiffon's</a> profits back into female-owned businesses.&#160;</p><p>Yarlagadda had her own capital to work with, and she cofounded her <a href=\"https://www.shiffonco.com\">fine jewelry company, Shiffon</a>, with $25,000, in 2017. She drew from $5,000 of her own savings and $20,000 from a grant she had won in high school. (The grant originated out of a nonprofit she had founded, which made video tutorials to help students understand various educational concepts.)</p><p>\"Twenty-five thousand to me sounded like a lot of money, but now growing and seeing what other founders are able to do, I'm realizing it actually wasn't,\" she said. \"We had to be really resourceful in what we did.\"</p><p>Now 24 years old, Yarlagadda's business is thriving and recently helped her win the support of Michelle Obama and her stylist Meredith Koop, whose foundation When We All Vote has partnered with Shiffon to launch a line of jewelry right before the election.</p><h2>Shiffon rings have a symbolic meaning</h2><p>Shiffon's most famous product is the Duet Pink Ring.</p><p>It's a pinky ring, Yarlagadda, says, to represent the pinky promise that women will pay it forward to other women. The ring is also adjustable so that it can fit everyone, adding that at the time, she didn't know her own ring size and that making a ring in one size helped cut inventory costs.&#160;</p><p>Its spiral designs represent how the company aims to help women spiral upward.</p><p>The rings range from $155 for sterling silver to $695 for 18-karat gold, and those who buy the rings unlock a secret menu that gives them access to more Shiffon products.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"That was kind of an opportunity to customize and build products around like what our customers wanted in a way that wouldn't always be so public or take away from the focus that our business had on this one product,\" Yarlagadda said.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9b240d69331a0011bc62c3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Shiffon\" height=\"1559\" width=\"2079\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shiffon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Half of Shiffon's profits are given to the company's nonprofit organization, the Startup Girl Foundation, which then focuses on giving funding to female-owned businesses. They take equity in each company they invest in, with all returns going back to the foundation to then be used to invest again in more companies.&#160;</p><p>To date, Yarlagadda said, it has supported more than 11 startups, including the bra company Pepper, and the espadrille brand Sea Star Beachwear.</p><p>This kind of investment is sorely needed. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324743\">less than 2.2% of the $85 billion</a> given out in VC funding went to female founders. That number is even more dismal for women of color, Yarlagadda said, adding that she wants to help inspire female founders to help support each other in the funding sphere.&#160;</p><p>\"If we can create exponential growth and a chain reaction, it's going to help us reach equality in the venture capital and business ecosystem sooner,\" she said.</p><h2><strong>Mentorship is almost as important as capital</strong></h2><p>Mentorship has played a big part in Yarlagadda's career, and she said it's almost as important for young entrepreneurs to receive mentorship as to receive capital. This is one reason why Shiffon has a mentorship board which includes stylist Sarah Slutsky, Beyoncé's stylist Ty Hunter, and former Elle Editor-in-Chief Robbie Meyers.&#160;</p><p>\"So often in business and in life, having key advice from people who've been there before and people that you look up to can just really make a huge difference,\" Yarlagadda said.&#160;</p><p>Yarlagadda's own mentorship journey began in the early days of her business when she just started reaching out to people she looked up to, including Slutsky, who is best known for working with the likes of Emma Watson and Tory Burch.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9b257869331a0011bc62d0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Sarah Slutsky\" height=\"2676\" width=\"3569\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sarah Slutsky became a mentor to Yarlagadda.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Roy Rochlin / Contributor / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It was Slutsky who, in addition to providing mentorship, taught Yarlagadda about the Kimberley Process, a certification scheme which requires those who sign up to source conflict-free diamonds and helped her find ways to source her diamonds.&#160;</p><p>\"I loved her taste in jewelry. I loved her focus on sustainability as a business,\" Yarlagadda said. \"I just felt it's our duty to make sure that we're operating [the business] in a way that is really ethical and not causing more harm in the world.\"&#160;</p><p>Slutsky's client Emma Watson was one of the first to wear a Shiffon ring. Watson wore the piece in 2017 during a press tour for her movie \"The Circle.\" Then, Nicole Kidman wore a Shiffon ring at the Emmys that same year.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9b26b769331a0011bc62d6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nicole Kidman\" height=\"2788\" width=\"2358\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nicole Kidman wearing a Shiffon ring on her left pinky.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Photo by Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Since then, many high-profile names have worn Shiffon, including Serena Williams, Cynthia Erivo, and Shailene Woodley.&#160;</p><p>The biggest name, however, has been Michelle Obama, who wore the ring during her book tour in 2018.&#160;</p><p>Obama's stylist, Meredith Koop, became a big supporter of the brand, Yarlagadda said, and eventually became another mentor. Yarlagadda had reached out to Koop via her agent, and Koop told Business Insider that she was \"completely taken with her drive, openness, resourcefulness, and ingenuity.\"</p><p>Yarlagadda's relationship with Koop eventually led Shiffon to its latest endeavor: a partnership with the foundation When We All Vote, co-chaired by Michelle Obama, that seeks to increase voter participation.&#160;</p><h2>Koop started working at the foundation earlier this year as a creative advisor and thought Shiffon would make for a good collaboration</h2><p>The foundation had been doing merchandising drops leading up to the election, with Shiffon being part of the second and final merch drop right before the election.&#160;</p><p>\"We were looking for cool products and, also, cool stories of diverse brands, designers and founders,\" Koop told Business Insider. \"Shiffon was an obvious fit.\"</p><p>Together, Shiffon and When We All Vote released special edition hoop earrings with the words \"Vote\" engraved on them.

Not really in a political way, but just because he doesn't fit in with any of the other mascots — he's sort of an anti-mascot.\"</p><p>And that ties in to the marketing strategy behind Gritty.

In his initial rollout, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flyers-new-mascot-gritty-viral-2018-9\">he was met with a mixed reception</a> by the people of Philadelphia (and fascination and horror from Internet denizens).</p><p>His early social media presence — where Gritty's personality emerged, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrittyNHL/status/1044258341017587713\">including one tweet where he threatened the Pittsburgh Penguins</a> — \"saved the day.\"</p><p>\"I don't know if this is still true — it may not because of how big he's become — but the performer actually was writing most or handling most of his own social media,\" Allen said, \"which I think is really unique because normally in these situations, you'd have some corporate social media team running through everything.\"&#160;</p><p>It's an effort that paid off, as Gritty transformed from potentially creepy mascot to beloved absurdist icon.</p><p>His chaos is his draw, and has helped catapult him to international fame, <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2020/11/gritty-2020-presidential-election-icon.html\">with coverage in Palestinian and French media</a>. For instance, there's now a female Gritty — <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/gritty-grittney-riot-rogers-london-philadelphia-flyers-mascot-2020-election-trump/\">Grittney</a> — roaming the streets of London with pro-democracy messages.</p><p>\"None of these people, I'm sure, are Flyers fans; they're probably not even hockey fans,\" Allen said. \"And I think that's what really speaks to the success of Gritty for the Flyers is that their brand is now recognizable way beyond the sport.\"</p><p>Gritty and the Philadelphia Flyers did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faecda1402d49001924edaa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Allen and Gritty\" height=\"960\" width=\"960\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Brian Allen (left) and Gritty (right).\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.flylanddesigns.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Allen</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What's next for Gritty</h2><p>\"I think it would be cool to maybe see some supporting characters for Gritty.

So far in 2020, we <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/us/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html#:~:text=August%206%2C%202020%20%2D%20NOAA%20releases,including%20seven%20to%2011%20hurricanes\">have already experienced</a> 17 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes in the United States.&#160;</p><p>The fingerprints of climate change are all over the Western wildfires too. A century of increased planet warming has fueled the dry, hot winds in the Western US that now regularly turn forests into tinder at unprecedented rates. This year alone, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/us/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html#:~:text=August%206%2C%202020%20%2D%20NOAA%20releases,including%20seven%20to%2011%20hurricanes\">more than 4 million acres</a> have burned in uncontained forest fires in California, killing 31 people and creating \"climate refugees\" among the thousands of people who lost everything in these fires. In addition, not only did the wildfires <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-oregon-business-owners-on-the-existential-threat-of-wildfire-2020-9\">force many companies to close</a>, the acrid smoke from the fires blanketed cities and cast a haze from coast to coast.</p><p>There is no doubt the climate is changing and wreaking havoc on American livelihoods. The question then becomes, what type of course correction should the country take to avoid the worst impact of a changing climate?&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Changing the narrative</strong></h2><p>In an article published last year in the <a href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/changing_the_climate_by_leaving_climate_change_behind\">Stanford Social Innovation Review</a>, the authors found that more than a decade of investment in advocacy and marketing to raise awareness about climate change has not yet sufficiently galvanized political or public will in the US. \"The issue remains a political third rail even for people who believe we need to act now,\" the authors concluded.</p><p>Despite this finding, climate change advocacy has continued to focus on the imperative of a stable climate and the need to mitigate trends in rising temperatures. Scientists loudly proclaim we must act immediately to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, but they have largely failed to inspire widespread action in the US.&#160;</p><p>Scaring people and corporations to change behavior has, by and large, failed to build a rock-solid constituency that cuts across the political divide on this issue. Instead, the narrative should be changed to focus on the new jobs and economic growth that can result from a coordinated effort to address climate change.</p><h2><strong>\"It's the economy, stupid\"</strong></h2><p>This phrase was made famous by James Carville back in 1992 when he ran Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. As the story goes, Carville posted a sign around the campaign's headquarters with three phrases. \"<em>It's the economy, stupid</em>,\" was the most memorable and became the rallying cry for the campaign.&#160;</p><p>Ironically, that phrase is as relevant today as it was nearly three decades ago. And, while pre-election polls indicated <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/graphics/election-2020-issues-key-counties/\">US voters</a> were also considering COVID-19, racial concerns, and political leadership, economic concerns took precedence. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html\">exit polls</a> showed more voters were concerned about the economy than any other issue. Creating well-paying jobs will be the foundation from which the US will claw its way out of the pandemic economic hole we're in today.</p><h2><strong>Climate change will be </strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong> economic driver in the 21</strong><strong>st</strong><strong> Century</strong></h2><p>At the start of this decade, we are on the verge of the next economic era following the digital revolution of the last half century. This new era (let's call it the \"Climate Revolution\") will transform business and society through efforts to address climate change.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The Brookings Institution released <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/advancing-inclusion-through-clean-energy-jobs/\">a report</a> last year that found the \"transition to the clean energy economy will primarily involve 320 unique occupations spread across three major industrial sectors: Clean energy production, energy efficiency, and environmental management.\"&#160;</p><p>The report, titled \"The Hidden STEM Economy,\" states that \"staffing all these industries entails a broad assortment of occupations. Energy-related industries are typified by a need for skilled trades to help manufacture advanced products, execute large-scale construction projects, research and develop new technologies, and deliver other detailed STEM-related services.\"&#160;</p><p>Another Brookings report also found that \"businesses within these industries rely on an expansive suite of support services — including business, financial, and customer management — to compete. Likewise, government and nonprofit organizations rely on specially trained workers to execute their missions.\"</p><p>So, it becomes clear that transitioning to a clean energy economy has compounding economic benefits for everyone.&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>US businesses are driving this economy</strong></h2><p>While the current administration is not serious about addressing this issue, many US companies are adapting their business models to account for both the risks and opportunities a changing climate provides. <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/2020/05/18/uniting-business-and-governments-to-recover-better/\">Companies</a> are beginning to talk about commitments to achieve \"Net Zero Emissions\" and use <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/\">\"Science-Based Target Initiatives</a>\" to align their climate change commitments with what was agreed upon in the 2015 Paris UN Climate Change agreement. <a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1615174022876/apple-ford-mcdonalds-and-microsoft-among-this-summers-climate-leaders\">Companies</a> as diverse as Apple, Ford, Microsoft, Nike and McDonald's have already made bold public statements about their climate intentions.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Members of my organization, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development&#160; (WBCSD), are taking concrete steps to compete in this economic transition and are not waiting for the federal government to act.&#160;</p><p>Recently, WBCSD members approved <a href=\"https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/News-Insights/General/News/New-membership-criteria\">new conditions for membership</a> in the organization. Among them is a commitment to achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2050 and use science-informed methods to develop the path by which to achieve this goal.&#160;</p><p>More broadly, at a time when everyone talks about \"building back or forward better\", the new member commitments address the three interconnected challenges our society face — the climate emergency, nature loss, and inequality — and pave the way for business action.&#160;</p><p>In doing so, they are creating new, sustainable jobs, and, at the same time, helping to ensure all people can live well and within the boundaries of the planet for generations to come.</p><h2><strong>China and Europe are leading the way</strong></h2><p>While we still argue in the US over whether the climate is worsening and the degree to which humans play in making it worse, China and many <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/climate-change/\">European countries</a> have already been moving to transition their economies.&#160;</p><p>China has been especially aggressive of late to capture the climate market. President Xi Jinping recently announced China's plans to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02927-9\">carbon neutrality</a> by 2060, positioning China as a global leader.</p><p>China's main thrust focuses on the new jobs that will spring from its efforts to corral climate change. It will then sell the new technologies, products, and services innovated and made in China to other countries to avert climate disaster while fueling the Chinese economy.&#160;</p><p>We have learned from COVID-19 that America must be prepared for looming threats and have seen the consequences of \"too little, too late\" responsiveness or, worse, the outright ignorance of the science. In terms of the environment, we must act knowledgeably and swiftly to reduce emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. We must and will take the opportunity of the pandemic-induced economic pause to find a way to build back better.&#160;&#160;</p><p>In doing so, we too can create millions of new jobs, foster clean energy innovation in the US, increase our national security, and, most importantly, protect the health of our people, economy, and our future.&#160;</p><p>The private sector is calling on local, state, and federal governments to enact stronger and consistent climate policy to give them clarity and confidence to invest in the technologies and markets needed to avert climate disaster. Businesses cannot do it alone.&#160;</p><p>Politicians today should realize that Carville was right in 1992, and his phrase rings even truer today. Climate responsibility is all about \"the economy, stupid!\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-economy-clean-energy-us-economic-driver-election-polls-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=NTjQKw1E9qU:YXV218rv7hs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/NTjQKw1E9qU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 15:33:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fa43f121df1d50018219169?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"981c111fbc1efc080735fa0499459fa0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn23@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-04-378_a51cd141d3f7b9d6.webp","destWidth":4156,"destHeight":3117,"sourceBytes":517500,"destBytes":517500,"author":"insider@insider.com (William M.

Asian American businesses were some of the first hit, as revenue at Chinatown businesses across the country began trending down in January due to fear by customers of any link to what was first touted as the \"Chinese virus.\"</p><p>This was not made any better by politicians, including President Trump, repeatedly using the phrase. As months go by, some businesses have had to close shop while others changed course to remain in operation while riding out this period of uncertainty.</p><p>Asian American businesses are incredibly important for multiple reasons. For the Asian American community, they provide avenues to connect to their culture and purchase items that they can't find easily in regular shops. For others, they provide a glimpse into the rich cultures they represent.&#160;</p><p>The US Census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2016/07/asian-owned-businesses-nearing-two-million.html\">reported that</a> there are over 2 million Asian American-owned businesses servicing neighborhoods across the country. With 42% of them in \"Accommodation and Food Services\" and \"Retail\" industries, versus just 21% of all businesses, Asian American businesses have been hard hit.</p><p>A recent UCLA study found that between February to April of this year, about <a href=\"http://www.aasc.ucla.edu/resources/policyreports/COVID19_Employment_CNK-AASC_072020.pdf\">233,000 Asian American small businesses have closed</a>, and in May 2020 the Asian American jobless rate was 21%. The idea that Asian Americans and their businesses are some of the worst hit may be shocking to those who still believe in the Asian American model minority myth.</p><h2>The racism effect</h2><p>Anti-Asian rhetoric is adding insult to injury when it comes to businesses already trying to survive the effects of the pandemic. According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, hate incidents <a href=\"http://www.asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/stop-aapi-hate/\">have seen an upward trend</a> since the outbreak of the virus. In a recent report they've compiled over 2,500 incidents of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian rhetoric between March and August of this year. Many of these incidents have taken place in places of work and in public spaces, and includes multiple incidents of vandalism of Asian American businesses. The actual number of incidents that have occured is expected to be much larger, as those are just the ones that have been reported to the organization.</p><p>Pearl River Mart, an emporium of Asian goods in New York City, was impacted by COVID-19 early on and laid off most of their employees, many of whom have been working for them for decades.</p><p>It was difficult, but to stay in operation, they continued marketing their brand on social media and sending e-newsletters to customers. They also found a need in their community for face masks and PPEs for front-line workers, raised funds, and used their import business to obtain supplies from China and other Asian markets.</p><p>They now sell face masks online which supplements their revenue, as well as utilize their design, production, and distribution channels to create the Chinatown Collection — a merch collection bringing together beloved Chinatown businesses, creative artists, and neighborhood non-profits.</p><p>The shift to e-commerce from brick and mortar has been a lifesaver for Pearl River Mart. With consumers on lockdown, the only place they can shop was online. Big box retailers with robust purchasing systems have benefited from this turn, as many are considered \"essential\" companies because they sell food and household items necessary for everyday living.</p><p>Asian American snack food company Dang Foods is a small business supplier that's been selling its healthy snacks in grocery stores since 2011. Dang, founded by Vincent Kitirattragarn, started an e-commerce site in 2018. And while its products are currently selling in stores, they've seen a big shift in consumers shopping online for their coconut chips, Thai rice chips, and Keto-friendly bars.</p><p>Though young entrepreneurs such as Kitirattragarn have found ways to stay in operation during the pandemic, many businesses in Asian communities such as Chinatowns, Little Indias, and Koreatowns have shuttered. Because of this, the places where locals and visitors used to shop the stores for Asian goods and visit restaurants to dine with family and friends have also gone digital to reach customers, some using third-party services to help with deliveries and find distributors to sell their goods online.</p><p>Stories like these demonstrate the resiliency of small Asian American businesses. Still, small Asian American businesses and restaurants face numerous obstacles, such as language and cultural barriers, and the lack of a relationship with a financial institution. While some Asian language translations regarding federal financial aid for businesses were eventually made available on the US Small Business Administration website, they were not provided when these programs first launched.</p><p>For non-native English speakers, culturally appropriate translations would have eased some of the initial barriers to entry to navigating the process of applying, let alone receiving, this federal aid. The impacts of these structural barriers were widely documented throughout the summer and early fall as multiple reports showed that minority owned businesses have not been able to secure governmental assistance like the Paycheck Protection program to bolster them through this downturn.</p><p>We can all play a part to help these businesses. Using our power as consumers by continuing to support small and local Asian American businesses is key. These businesses add character to our neighborhoods, provide jobs for employees, and build local economies.

Still, in college, I pursued what I felt was a more practical degree. I earned a BA in sociology and began a career in social services, working with economically disadvantaged women and girls. Coming from an economically disadvantaged background myself, I worked on and off in the sex industry to afford my education.&#160;</p><p>I wrote about my experiences in the sex industry, and harbored ambitions to write a memoir. But even after earning an MFA in creative nonfiction from the New School, writing felt like a somewhat embarrassing — and expensive — hobby. I pursued a second master's degree, this time in childhood education, to qualify for a \"real\" job: teaching art and writing at a public elementary school in the South Bronx.&#160;</p><h2><strong>I would've never quit my full-time job — and given up the salary and benefits — had I not been forced to do so</strong></h2><p>In 2010, a reporter from the New York Post took an interest in a 900-word <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_803_b_707975\">essay</a> I wrote for the Huffington Post in which I talked candidly about a brief period in my life (in grad school) when I traded sex for cash. Some weeks after my essay ran, the tabloid plastered my picture on its cover under an intentionally shocking headline: \"Bronx Teacher Admits: I'm an Ex Hooker.\"</p><p>My employer at the time, the New York City Department of Education, immediately yanked me from the classroom and put me in reassignment, also known as the \"rubber room.\" After months of relentless negative press coverage, I resigned.</p><p>It was humiliating, but in retrospect, I'm better off for it. Here's how I turned the worst thing that's ever happened to me into a flourishing freelance career.</p><p><em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-recent-college-grads-make-6-figures-freelancing-2020-10\">How to make 6 figures as a freelancer right out of college, according to 3 recent grads bringing in over $100,000 a year</a></em></p><h2><strong>I let my loss wake me up</strong></h2><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oprah-winfrey-career-advice_l_5e304f78c5b6ce51a4ec1c56\">lecture</a> to Stanford Graduate School of Business students, Oprah Winfrey argued there is no such thing as failure; Instead, she says, the purpose of any failure or loss is to move you in another, better direction. As Oprah put it: \"The losses are there to wake you up.\"&#160;</p><p>While the gist of this has always been a guiding principle of mine, I had never lived through something so seismic as the loss of my teaching career.&#160;</p><p>For months, news of my reassignment was everywhere. CNN ran the story as \"breaking news.\" CBS published a slideshow of my Facebook photos. Even then-<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-called-for-removal-teacher-past-sex-work\">New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on the matter,</a> condemning my conduct and suggesting what I'd done was somehow criminal.&#160;</p><p>Beyond the public humiliation, there were practical matters to consider. Financially, I had no savings or family to fall back on. I was scared.</p><p>Initially, I applied for positions similar to the one I'd lost — teaching jobs, daycare centers, nannying, as well as work in social services. Interviews pretty much ended just as soon as my potential employer would ask, \"Why did you leave your last job?\" I seemed like no one wanted to associate themselves with a woman dubbed the \"hooker teacher.\"</p><p>In moments like these, there's a temptation to panic. Instead, as Oprah said: \"Get still and ask yourself, 'what is the next right move?'\"&#160;</p><p>My situation began to improve when I stopped applying for jobs I didn't really want anyway and surrendered to reality.</p><h2><strong>I turned to people I knew would have my back</strong></h2><p>When the whole situation first started, I sent SOS emails to nearly everyone I knew, asking for advice and assistance. I had a fair number of contacts from grad school and within the literary community. Many expressed outrage at what was happening to me, and wanted to help.</p><p>Rather than another plum salary position in a field not necessarily related to writing, I began cobbling together part-time gigs that would ultimately support my career as a writer.&#160;&#160;</p><p>I did data entry for $10 an hour at a prestigious literary journal. I scored a gig teaching memoir-writing, and then another. And I worked for free, teaching writing workshops to marginalized communities including drug users, survivors of sexual exploitation, and LGBTQ teens. I applied for grants, and eventually the volunteer work started to pay.&#160;&#160;</p><p>I also continued to write, pitch, and publish my writing as much as I could.</p><h2><strong>I turned my biggest liability into an asset&#160;</strong></h2><p>A decade later, I've written on a variety of topics: <a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/a-literary-festival-in-the-shadow-of-genocide\">a literary festival in Sri Lanka</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyxgaw/noura-al-jizawi-profile-syrian-female-prisoners\">Syrian activist who survived arbitrary detention</a>, and a <a href=\"https://nationswell.com/bicycle-deaths-new-york-nyc/\">memorial project to honor bicyclists killed in traffic accidents</a>, to name a few.&#160;</p><p>But initially, I had one story that people wanted to hear about and so <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2011/05/05/hooker_teacher_what_i_was_thinking/\">I sold it</a>. I sold it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/28/lost-job-teacher-call-girl\">again</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2013/07/we-pardon-spitzer-not-ex-sex-workers-like-me.html\">again</a>, and <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/dear-new-york-post-im-a-teacher-not-a-hooker-5934243\">again</a>, and <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/12/a-day-to-respectandunderstandsexworkers.html\">again</a>. In some ways, you might say that here, right now, I am selling it again. It's a fresh angle (humiliating scandal) on an evergreen topic (how to make it as a freelancer).&#160;</p><p>I learned about things like story angles and other aspects of craft from my editors. Sure, my MFA was an enriching experience, but I wouldn't say it prepared me at all for the business of freelancing. Instead, thanks to my provocative story, I had the chance to publish on high-profile platforms and work with amazing professionals who were extremely patient with me as an inexperienced writer. Because I had a story they wanted that only I could tell, editors were willing to teach me the ropes.&#160;</p><p>Besides the bit about brushing off failure, this is my number one word of advice to new writers: If you offer an editor a story that only you can tell, they will help you tell it.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/marketing-director-quit-job-freelance-50k-to-250k-email-template\">A marketing director making $50,000 quit her job and now makes five times more as a freelancer. Here's the email template she used to build a subscriber network of over 100,000 people.</a></em></p><h2><strong>I lowered my expenses&#160;</strong></h2><p>My first year as a freelance writer, I made less than $20,000. I lived on this, plus unemployment, plus credit cards. It was rough.&#160;</p><p>To lower my expenses, I moved back in with an on-again, off-again boyfriend. The apartment was in my name, and he eventually moved out, leaving me with a super cheap living situation. I saved money in other ways as well. Rather than taking the subway, I'd walk from one gig to the next. I washed my clothes by hand in the bathtub. I skipped meals. I don't recommend any of this to anyone. If you want to transition from full-time work to freelancing, have some savings, if you can. Otherwise, be prepared to make sacrifices.&#160;</p><h2><strong>I hustled harder than ever</strong></h2><p>When you think freelancer, you might picture Carrie Bradshaw scribbling down her most intimate thoughts on life and love, in between extravagant shopping trips and lunch dates with the girls. Especially in a slow economy, some people hear freelancer and think \"unemployed.\"</p><p>In truth, freelancing is hard work.</p><p>I pitch literally hundreds of story ideas each year. I sell maybe a dozen. In the beginning, most articles sold for $100- $200 a piece. I was single and child-free then, and so I worked all the time and was always available to respond to a news peg. Side gigs — more than writing — paid my bills. These days, my rate has gone up significantly — good thing too, because as a mom of two I've got a lot less time on my hands.&#160;</p><p>You can earn a decent income from writing alone if you have the time and ability to hustle, or once you have some experience. The year before I got married and became pregnant, I think I made around $60,000 — just under what I'd earned as a public school teacher. This year, I'll make about half that, in only a quarter of the time.&#160;</p><p>Over a decade later, I still miss public school teaching. I loved my profession and I sometimes wish I had a \"real\" job — and then I remember: I do.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

With volatility plummeting from recent highs and investors' risk appetites improving, several long plays stand to outperform as the US comes closer to distributing a vaccine, he added.</p><p>Here are the five strategies Kolanovic laid out to clients:&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-jeffrey-gundlach-likens-market-to-tech-bubble-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">'The most dangerous type of market': Billionaire Bond King Jeffrey Gundlach says stocks are entering the difficult final stages of their cycle — and warns the market will 'crack pretty hard' in the near future</a></em></p><h3>Pushing further into stocks</h3><p>A combination of moderate investor positioning, divided government, vaccine hopes, and rebounding profits creates \"one of the best backdrops\" for stocks in years, Kolanovic said in the Thursday note. JPMorgan expects the S&#38;P 500 to climb slightly higher to 3,600 by the end of the year and to 4,000 by early 2021.</p><p>As such, the top quant recommended investors turn increasingly overweight in stocks. The pivot can be funded by selling off bonds, he added.</p><p>The two run-off Senate races in Georgia present a significant risk to the trade, as a Democratic sweep would make it easier for a Biden administration to pass tax hikes and stricter regulations. Still, Kolanovic said the likelihood of such an outcome is small, and that it only poses short-term uncertainty.</p><h3>Equities abroad</h3><p>As beneficial as the divided-government election outcome can be for US stocks, emerging-markets equities will jump even higher, according to the firm. A weakening US dollar, reduced geopolitical risk, cheap emerging-markets valuations, and light positioning will all contribute to the group's outperformance, Kolanovic said.</p><p>The bank holds \"overweight\" ratings on Korean, Brazilian, and Russian stocks. Malaysian, Colombian, and Middle East-North African stocks hold an underweight rating.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-invest-in-2021-themes-driving-markets-goldman-sachs-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldman Sachs unveils the top 10 themes it expects to drive the markets in 2021 — and shares where to invest your money</a></em></p><h3>Shifting to cyclical</h3><p>Even though Monday saw a massive move from growth stocks to cyclical sectors, there's still room for the trade to gain. Kolanovic recommended investors brace for a sustained rotation into value and cyclical names as the market prepares for an end to the global health crisis.</p><p>\"The backdrop of a globally synchronized expansion, legislative gridlock, and positive vaccine news should mark a breakout point for value stocks,\" Kolanovic said, adding that momentum and growth names \"should lag\" through the rotation.</p><p>The quant guru pointed to \"unsustainably stretched\" growth-to-value correlation and continued crowding in momentum stocks for the call. A \"severe dislocation\" between the two market groups remains, leaving plenty of opportunity left for those who missed the recent rotation.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-strong-returns-low-prices-credit-suisse-2020-11?r=gr-sub\" data-analytics-position=\"1\" data-analytics-module=\"\">CREDIT SUISSE: Buy these 8 stocks now because they're set to benefit from a powerful combination of strong returns and low expectations</a></em></p><h3>Boost commodities, dump cash</h3><p>Cyclical commodities including energy, metals, and agricultural products that languished throughout the pandemic are set to rally alongside a broader economic rebound, Kolanovic said. Gold prices will sink as investors shift away from safe havens, he added.</p><p>\"Our Oil Strategists believe the pandemic, not the election, is the main driver for crude, as oil markets need to clear current imbalances before long-dated prices can rise, and US production is likely to fall next year under any administration,\" the strategist wrote.</p><p>To help finance the commodity trade, JPMorgan recommended going underweight in another safe-haven asset: government bonds. US yields, despite partially recovering through the week, still sit near record lows as investors stay put in the stable assets. Improving economic data and Pfizer's vaccine update lifted the bank's medium-term outlook, and a rotation to riskier assets can quickly drag on sovereign debt.</p><p>Holding cash through the rotation was also ill-advised, as the dollar is set to weaken and investors would be missing out on sizeable gains across several markets.</p><p>Still, shrinking bets on government debt shouldn't push investors from bonds altogether. JPMorgan reiterated its \"overweight\" rating for corporate credit as spreads exceed year-end targets.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-tips-for-success-william-danoff-shares-market-beating-guide-2020-11?r=gr-sub\" data-analytics-position=\"4\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Peter Lynch disciple William Danoff manages over $124 billion and has beaten the market for 30 years. He shares the 10 investment rules that ensured his success.</a></em></p><h3>'Dash for trash'</h3><p>That's not to say investors can't be choosy in the corporate debt space. Kolanovic reversed his \"underweight\" rating for high-yield debt, adding that a shift away from high-grade corporate credit leaves plenty of cash available to lift junk bonds.&#160;</p><p>\"The Pfizer vaccine news sparked a 'dash for trash' as investors grab issues from companies most affected by the pandemic, which have lagged in recent months,\" he wrote.</p><p>Drivers of the upcoming rally include under-positioning, dealer de-risking, and resolution of key risks. Vaccine-fueled optimism is just \"icing on the cake,\" the bank said. Continued support from the Federal Reserve also diminishes the risks typically associated with such bonds.</p><p>In Europe, the bank's strategists recommend positioning heavily for outperformance in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. Non-cyclicals will lag relative to the broader corporate credit market, they added.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-cathie-wood-ark-invest-shares-2-innovation-winners-2020-11\" data-analytics-position=\"5\" data-analytics-module=\"\">ARK CEO Cathie Wood is beating 98% of her peers this year.

It took them a year to raise funding, Brick told Business Insider, because they were very selective about who they decided to bring on. Current investors include Third Kind Venture Capital and Exor Seeds, model Karlie Kloss, and even Cam Newton, who discovered the brand at one of their pop-up shops in New York City.&#160;</p><p>\"We were looking to bring in people who deeply believe in the long-term value of the brand,\" Brick says. \"And we met really interesting people that gave us a perspective beyond our own industry.\"&#160;</p><h2><strong>As the pandemic continues, the brand pivots to home wear&#160;</strong></h2><p>Right now, about 15 people work full-time for the company, Brick said, including on their creative teams, product team, sales team, and on their supply chain. \"Everyone is doing a lot more than what they are supposed to do, for sure,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>About 80% of Apparis products are made in one factory in China, and Brick said they are \"conservative\" with inventory. They typically try to buy in small batches rather than big productions, to help prevent waste.&#160;</p><p>Having only one factory in China helped them during the pandemic, Brick said, because they weren't too impacted by the manufacturing and production shutdowns that affected many retailers throughout the world.</p><p>This was because by the time COVID hit Europe and the Americas in March, China was already getting better. Luckily, March is usually when the company begins production, and they were able to (cautiously) continue manufacturing their coats, Nouchi said.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f97865ef21803001222c1ee?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apparis Home\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apparis Home.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hot Thunderstorm Studio</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>So they took this time instead to focus on rebranding the company. They focused heavily on the social media strategy and decided to use excess fabric that was left over in their factory to launch a home collection label, which was released this month.</p><p>Nouchi said they decided to launch this new collection because they were anticipating that people would continue to spend more time at home and would be looking to purchase items such as candles and pajamas.&#160;</p><p>Indeed, luxury retailers <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/luxury-shopping-trends-during-pandemic-moda-operandi-report-2020-5\">Moda Operandi, Olivela, and The RealReal</a> both told Business Insider that they have seen an uptick in purchases for items such as home decor and casual wear such as sweatpants, as people have begun spending more time at home.</p><p>In the weeks after March 9, Moda Operandi said that searches for the word \"sweats\" rose 50% on their website, while The RealReal revealed in August that demand skyrocketed for items such as candles and pillows, increasing 90% and 216% from March to June, respectively.&#160;</p><p>\"We did a test launch in April and decided to extend the category and launch a much bigger collection for home in the fall,\" Nouchi said, adding that their home collection includes pajamas, eye masks, candles, headbands, and slippers.&#160;</p><p>\"We were able to reinvent ourselves,\" she continued. \"And innovate and be online and follow what the consumers are currently purchasing.\"&#160;</p><h2><strong>The brand has also recently released a collaboration with Juicy Couture&#160;</strong></h2><p>Fresh off its $3 million funding round and the launch of its home collection, the duo still found time to land a collaboration with '90s staple Juicy Couture, which was released on October 29th.&#160;</p><p>The partnership, according to Nouchi, happened quite simply. They were looking to do an outside-of-the-box collaboration and liked Juicy Couture's big name and nostalgia appeal, so they made an approach, and the brand loved it.&#160;</p><p>\"Basically what we decided to do was reinvent their tracksuits,\" Nouchi said. \"We took their iconic shapes, and we developed exclusivity for this collaboration, a very thin fur that is very soft.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9786ac4743a3001216bce2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apparis\" height=\"3000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Apparis Juicy Collection.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hot Thunderstorm Studio</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The collection, known as Faux Fur Fantasy, is made with Apparis' signature PlucheTM faux fur and vegan shearling fabric. It was modeled by Brenn and Jules Lorenzo, known as the Skate Kitchen Twins, part of an all-female skate crew called Skate Kitchen.&#160;</p><p>It's also the 25th anniversary of the Juicy tracksuit, an emblem of the '90s and early 2000s, which has been seen on everyone from Paris Hilton to Kim Kardashian.&#160;</p><p>Nouchi said the company, which previously collaborated with Diane von Furstenberg on jackets, plans to partner with more high-profile brands in the future. It would like to enter into more \"out-of-the-box\" kinds of partnerships that will continue to push the creativity of the brand.&#160;</p><p>\"It's all about being bold, daring to be different, and really aligning again with what we are trying to say,\" she continued. \"We want to make cruelty-free fashion, and we want to do it in a way that empowers women. That's just part of the DNA of Apparis.\"&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The film also includes shaky footage of the Black Stone, a sacred rock in the city of Mecca that Muslims circle during their pilgrimages. It <a href=\"https://opentextbc.ca/astronomyopenstax/chapter/meteorites-stones-from-heaven/\">might be a meteorite</a>, though researchers have not been allowed to study it.&#160;</p><p>\"We found footage shot by a Pilgrim on his cell phone,\" Herzog said of the footage shown. \"Like metal particles attracted by a magnet, everybody's converging and screaming in this hustle, and jockeying for position for touching or kissing it. It's just phenomenal, phenomenal.\"</p><p>Each scene in the film relates to the central premise: that wherever they've fallen, meteorites have shaped human political and religious life.&#160;</p><p>\"These are stones that are falling from the heavens,\" Oppenheimer told Business Insider. \"This is some clue that the gods are intervening in human affairs.\"</p><p>Of course, the documentary does not neglect Earth's most famous asteroid impact. About 66 million years ago, a giant space rock <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/asteroid-struck-perfect-angle-to-doom-dinosaurs-study-2020-5\">slammed into the Yucatán Peninsula</a> in modern-day Mexico with a force equivalent to millions of nuclear bombs. It triggered a mile-high tsunami, acidified the oceans, and released billions of tons of sulfur that blocked sunlight and cooled Earth. An estimated three quarters of all plant and animal species on Earth died as a result, including the dinosaurs. That mass extinction eventually paved the way for mammals to reign.&#160;</p><p>\"We probably wouldn't be here ourselves, Homo sapiens, as a species, were it not for this colossal impact,\" Oppenheimer says in the documentary.&#160;</p><p>The impact crater is located near Chicxulub Puerto, which Herzog describes in the film as \"a beach resort so godforsaken you want to cry.\"</p><h2>Tracking space rocks before they hit</h2><p>Asteroids at any time have the potential to impact the world's future, the new film reminds viewers.&#160;</p><p>In the documentary's second half, Herzog and Oppenheimer visit the Pan-STARRS Operational Center in Hawaii, where astronomers scan rows of computer monitors for signs of asteroids that might become meteorites by entering Earth's atmosphere.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faea9231e8d5000198135c7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fireball_Photo_0104\" height=\"2688\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Clive Oppenheimer with Mark Willman and Joanna Bulger at the Pan-STARRS Observatory, Haleakalā, Hawaii in &#34;Fireball: Visitors From Darker Worlds.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Apple TV&#43;</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Of the 25 million bits and chunks of space debris that become meteors, most burn up in the atmosphere.

The value of $15, however, varies depending on an area's cost of living.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-minimum-wage-rise-vote-amendment-15-tipped-employees-workers-2020-11\">Florida</a> voters went to the polls on November 3 and resoundingly backed a minimum wage of $15. Almost <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_2,_$15_Minimum_Wage_Initiative_(2020)\">61% of voters</a> supported the referendum, which will be phased in over the next few years until it reaches the full $15 per hour in 2026.</p><p>President-elect Joe Biden also <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/#\">supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15</a>. The last increase in the nationwide minimum was on July 24, 2009, increasing from $6.55 to $7.25 an hour.</p><p>Supporters of this higher minimum wage believe it will help people earn a living wage and get out of poverty. The Florida Policy Institute wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.floridapolicy.org/posts/statement-on-amendment-2-passage-and-state-policy-landscape\">press release</a> on Election Day that the $15 minimum wage in the state would \"reduce historical pay inequities experienced by women and people of color and increase the income of more than 1 in 4 Florida workers.\"</p><p>However, some are wary of what a minimum wage increase could mean for employment and costs to businesses. A <a href=\"https://frla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/200907_BAC_FL_EstimatingtheImpactofa15MinimumWageinFlorida.pdf\">study</a> by economists at Miami University and Trinity University in part, which the paper notes was \"prepared with support from Save Florida Jobs, Inc\", found that the state will lose 158,000 jobs by 2026 as a result of the minimum wage increase. The economists used a similar method to a <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410\">Congressional Budget Office</a> study that estimated a $15 federal minimum wage would help 1.3 million Americans get out of poverty but also would mean 1.3 million job cuts.</p><p>Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told Business Insider that some businesses might also be against a $15 minimum wage because of concerns of higher prices or lower profits. Baker said previous research shows that places that already raised the minimum wage \"substantially\" saw little job loss.</p><p>A raise in the minimum wage doesn't just affect those making this amount but can also boost those already earning slightly higher pay, according to Baker. This is because businesses will likely also have to raise pay for workers whose wages are a bit higher than the minimum.</p><p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-07/CBO-55410-MinimumWage2019.pdf\">CBO study</a> found a $15 minimum wage would could also mean an increase in pay for 10 million people who already earn slightly more than this hourly wage. <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2024-would-lift-pay-for-nearly-40-million-workers/\">David Cooper</a>, senior economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, noted that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would lift the pay of 40 million workers and help some people make enough to get out of poverty.</p><p>There is no clear answer whether a higher minimum wage has more benefits or consequences, with <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/restaurants/article246987592.html\">business anecdotes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-15-minimum-wage-election-economy-paychecks-low-workers-2020-10\">academic studies</a> highlighting different outcomes for businesses, workers, and families.</p><h2>The value of a $15 per hour minimum wage</h2><p>The value of $15 varies throughout the US because some places have a higher cost of living. For instance, Hawaii is the most expensive place to live, followed by New York and the District of Columbia.

David Perdue <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-race-david-perdue-vs-jon-ossoff-polls-fundraising-2020-8\">faces a stiff challenge</a> from Democrat Jon Ossoff. In the November election, Perdue led Ossoff by a 49.7% to 48% margin. However, under state law, a Senate candidate must receive at least 50% of the vote to win an election, which prompted the runoff.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kelly-loeffler-vs-doug-collins-georgia-senate-election-polls-fundraising-2020-8\">second Senate runoff</a> is the result of a November special election that featured appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Democrat Raphael Warnock, and a multitude of candidates from different political parties. Loeffler and Warnock were the top two vote-getters in the race, but since neither candidate received over 50% of the vote, they are both advancing to a separate runoff election.</p><p>Democrats currently have 48 Senate seats, compared to 50 seats for the GOP. If Democrats can win both Senate seats, the chamber would be split 50-50, but Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will have the ability to break tie votes, which would give the party majority control.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-wins-georgia-democratic-party-south-presidential-election-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KK8sNJmrxcU:Wi8WIukdTe8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KK8sNJmrxcU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 17:06:05 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fa18f5069331a0011bc6fdc?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4eee500dc8599146d6cd4d3e39de923f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn85@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-40-957_bc700eb76bd5dcf1.webp","destWidth":5333,"destHeight":4000,"sourceBytes":1874788,"destBytes":1874788,"author":"insider@insider.com (John L.

It's also still the only way customers can check out on Alibaba's retail sites, Taobao and Tmall.</p><p>More than 1 billion Chinese citizens use the company's services, rendering Ant a large aspect of China's financial system and \"critical to consumers every day,\" Matthew Schopfer, head of research at the investment firm Infusive Asset Management, told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>\"It's like imagining a combination of some of the most popular American apps, all strung together in a seamlessly integrated way but with finance tied to it,\" Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity firm The Patriarch Organization, told Business Insider.</p><p>There's a Venmo-like payment feature that lets you send money to people and a PayPal-style service for making online payments. It lets you store money in a checking account, buy and manage insurance, receive financing, get a credit card, and even hail a taxi. You can also use the app to pay the bill at restaurants and other participating businesses by simply scanning a QR code, a feat that has bolstered Alipay's widespread adoption in China.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faeb1191c741f0019ac9a61?format=jpeg\" alt=\"alipay app china ant\" height=\"1331\" width=\"1780\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Alipay (L) and Wechat (R) QR payment codes are displayed at a market in Shanghai on October 27, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Imagine it as a do-everything app that you can use to manage financial milestones from adolescence into retirement. Your parents could give you an allowance through the app, you could get your first credit card through it, buy a car, and pick auto insurance.</p><p>\"There's no Progressive or Geico,\" Capital CEO and cofounder Blair Silverberg told Business Insider. \"None of the 30-plus stops that you stopped at along the way of your financial life — you don't make any of those, it all happens through the app.\"</p><p>Hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens don't use what you would think of as a traditional financial service or even have a credit card, and Ant Group has met them more than halfway.</p><p>The online financial world as it currently stands can be \"a totally fragmented universe,\" Silverberg said. \"And if that were all in one place, like the button on your phone, that's kind of what Ant Financial has created.\"</p><p>Alipay also makes it easier for more people to obtain credit thanks to its algorithm, which can qualify people who wouldn't normally be qualified based upon traditional creditworthiness risk profile, Schiffer said. And consumers are going to gravitate toward services that can more easily provide them with financial opportunities without going through hoops.</p><p>\"The smart fintechs of the future, and Ant being one, will be proactive in how they look at not only democratizing credit profiles but also providing opportunities to funding,\" Schiffer said.&#160;</p><p>Alipay is not ingrained in American consumer culture as it is in China — Americans can't use Alipay without a Chinese bank account, and the Trump administration has reportedly floated a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tencent-ant-group-restricting-chinese-firms-2020-10\">ban</a> on the company as it continues to crack down on Chinese apps and services, like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-ban-injunction-court-hearing-after-election-day-donald-trump-2020-10\">TikTok</a>.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-jack-mas-ant-group-went-from-business-disrupter-to-chinese-tech-champion-11595335267?mod=business_lead_pos13\">The Wall Street Journal</a> has reported that Ant Group had always intended to skip over the New York Stock Exchange and only file to go public in Shanghai and Hong Kong. But US-China relations have grown increasingly strained in recent months, a fact that Schiffer said likely did play a role in Ant's decision.</p><p>\"I think they wanted to be careful to not become the enemy of regulators by flaunting the massive raise on US soil,\" Schiffer said.</p><p>But as Ant's IPO plans stand now, they may not resume for another six months in China. And even when they do, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happened-ant-group-ipo-jack-ma-alipay-2020-11\">Ant will likely not list as the fintech disruptor it was predicted to be</a>. Instead, the company will likely rely more heavily on conservative banking methodology to comply with China's new regulations on microlending.</p><p>\"The pure-play fintech is out the window — that's dead and buried,\" Schiffer said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-alipay-ant-group-fintech-app-china'>Business

Before November 3, the president constantly called for another stimulus package. At times, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bigger-stimulus-package-republicans-democrats-congress-amount-more-checks-2020-10\">Trump suggested</a> he could support a larger plan than the $2.4 trillion in further spending that Democrats wanted.</p><p>The White House was negotiating with Democrats on a relief plan but talks collapsed before the election. They haven't restarted, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-stimulus-trump-sits-out-pelosi-democrats-economy-2020-11\">now taking the lead</a> on another stimulus bill among Republicans while the White House takes a backseat.</p><p>The trajectory of a stimulus package has been fraught with obstacles over the past few months and Trump's comments were unlikely to break the stalemate on Capitol Hill, even with daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations surging to new highs in recent days. Both parties are pushing for dueling priorities, particularly on the cost of another rescue plan.</p><p>The GOP is pressing for a slimmer relief package similar to the $500 billion measure they unveiled in September and October, which Democrats blocked both times. It contained small business aid funding and public health funds, but it omitted stimulus checks and money for cities.&#160;</p><p>McConnell has argued the improving economy doesn't need a significant level of assistance, citing the falling unemployment rate. \"I don't think the current situation demands a multitrillion-dollar package,\" the Kentucky Republican said Tuesday.</p><p>It appears that another relief package <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-hit-rock-bottom-congress-deadlocked-on-coronavirus-relief-2020-11\">won't be passed</a> until after Biden takes office in January. The president-elect has <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/111220\">been in contact</a> with Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on the matter.</p><p>Democrats <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-stimulus-plan-congress-unemployment-economy-pass-vote-bill-2020-9\">have called for a large aid plan</a> that includes new federal unemployment benefits, a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks, aid to state and local governments as well as health funding among other initiatives.&#160;</p><p>\"One of the urgent things that need to be done is people need relief right now — right now: small businesses, people who are about to be evicted from their homes because they can't pay their mortgage, unemployment insurance,\" Biden said at a press conference on Tuesday.</p><p>Many economists and Federal Reserve officials are prodding Congress to pass a new relief bill as the recovery shows signs of slowing down. With virus cases spiking, some states are enacting new restrictions and ordering business closures to curb the pathogen's spread.</p><p>\"The main risk we see to that is clearly the further spread of disease here in the United States,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday. \"We've got new cases at a record level, we've seen a number of states begin to reimpose limited activity restrictions, and people may lose confidence that it is safe to go out.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The X5-sized SUV sports plenty of range, two motors with enough power to hit 62 mph in under five seconds, and some controversial styling features — like BMW's new and enlarged version of its classic kidney grille.&#160;</p><p>Although the iX is BMW's first purpose-built electric SUV, the brand's parent company, the BMW Group, has made headway on its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/promises-carmakers-have-made-about-their-future-electric-vehicles-2020-1#bmw-group-7\">goal</a> to offer 25 electric and hybrid vehicles by 2023.

They are my broker, brand, and company.</p><h2>My day-to-day schedule is flexible and varies constantly.</h2><p>I really never know what is going to come up — buyers and sellers always have new or last-minute requests. My hours are not consistent or normal: Some days I start as early as 8 a.m., and others I can be working up into the late hours of the night.</p><p>COVID-19 hasn't especially affected my routine. Now, I mainly just have more virtual instead of face-to-face meetings. I miss the in-person connection, but I try to look at it optimistically, in that I can get more meetings in during the week and have less travel time.</p><h2>I can work up to seven days a week, including on holidays.</h2><p>I try to plan one full day each week that I take for myself and family time, but sometimes that doesn't happen. A flexible schedule can be a perk, but it also can make it tricky to schedule a true vacation.</p><p>Typically, I have several Zoom meetings every week with fellow agents of Sotheby's where we get caught up on newly active, recently under contract, and sold inventory. I also have a marketing meeting with our in-house advertising agency to discuss strategy and company highlights, and training/continuing education with our in-house council to learn about current issues that are coming up in the market and to stay up to date on legal aspects.</p><p>My days are also filled with buyer meetings, listing appointments with new sellers, staging houses, selecting photos or videos for online listings, meeting inspectors and vendors for bids, scheduling appraisals, catching up with lenders and title companies, and connecting with my database of clients.</p><p>Real estate is not as easy as some people think, and I believe a good agent makes this career their primary focus.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa1c88569331a0011bc71a4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Summit Sotheby&#39;s International Realty\" height=\"2656\" width=\"3541\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A home in Park City that was built in 1913 that Story sold in October for nearly $1.7 million.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Summit Sotheby&#39;s International Realty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>When I first meet a potential buyer, I do my best to quickly nail down what their ideal ski home looks like.

No. This is a separation of power. Something very very important.

The 58-year old executive, impeccably-dressed, regularly works the lobby like a proud owner of a new home, eagerly introducing himself to some of the enterprise software giant's roughly 54,000 workers.</p>\n<p>Prophet is Salesforce's Chief Equality Officer, and his passion and trademark pizzazz are visible in everything his group does, from sophisticated Twitter campaigns to high-wattage events with celebrity guests like Janelle Monáe and Mila Kunis.</p>\n<p>The prominent emphasis on diversity is in character with the company's reputation as the tech industry's moral compass for social justice and progressive ideals. Marc Benioff, Salesforce's CEO and founder, pioneered the notion of donating 1% of the company's equity, 1% of its employees' time, and 1% of its product to philanthropic causes. He led tech's charge against Indiana's contentious \"bathroom bill.\" His latest book, \"Trailblazer,\" is a treatise on creating a fulfilling corporate culture.</p>\n<p>But behind the high-profile diversity push is an inconvenient truth: Four years after Prophet was hired by Benioff to launch the new group, Salesforce's <a href=\"https://equalitydata.herokuapp.com/\">employee diversity numbers have barely budged</a>. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/our-2020-annual-equality-update/\">Salesforce released its latest equality report</a>: The number of Black employees in Salesforce's US workforce is now 3.5%, compared to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/assets/pdf/datasheets/sustainability-report-fy1516.pdf\">2% in 2015</a>; The rate of improvement for Latinx representation is especially meager, inching up from 4% in 2015 to 4.5% in the company's latest report.</p>\n<p>People of color are underrepresented at the leadership level, as well, with Black representation clocking in just slightly above 2% for US execs at and above the VP level.</p>\n<p>Salesforce's mediocre diversity results are about the same as the rest of the tech industry, which is to say, abysmal. Google's 3.9% Black representation in its US workforce and Microsoft's 4.5% ratio are slightly above Salesforce, though both have much larger workforces, and Microsoft has been recruiting from historically black colleges since the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>Prophet admits that progress has been slower than he'd like.</p>\n<p>\"We would be the first to acknowledge that there is much more work to do, and there are places where we could have gone faster in hindsight,\" Prophet told Business Insider in an interview.</p>\n<p>While Prophet says the pieces are now in place for diversity to accelerate, the track record of the last four years begs the question of why even a company like Salesforce — with vast financial resources, a publicly supportive CEO and engineers with the smarts to tackle artificial intelligence — hasn't been able to move the needle more significantly when it comes to building a representative workforce.</p>\n<p>Business Insider spoke to 18 current and former Salesforce employees, as well as several diversity and inclusion experts, to see firsthand how tech's role-model company has tried to solve the industry's longstanding diversity problem and why it hasn't worked better.</p>\n<p>Without a playbook to turn to, Salesforce's Equality Office has had to learn a lot on the fly. Unlike some of Salesforce's previous equality achievements, such as spending millions to close its gender wage gap, the deep-rooted inequities in society that reach into corporate America are not so easily fixed.</p>\n<p>According to many of the people Business Insider spoke to, Salesforce's celebrated equality project is beset by fundamental flaws that have blunted its impact — and for some, even raised doubts about the $240 billion company's commitment to match fanfare with hard work.</p>\n<p>As a pioneer for progressive values, Salesforce's ability to recognize its shortcomings, and learn from them, is being watched closely inside and outside the company.</p>\n<h2><a

cities.</p><p>With a great circle distance of 8,287 nautical miles, the route is the longest in the world by mileage. It overtakes the recently relaunched <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/longest-flight-in-the-world-singapore-airlines-business-class-review-2018-10\">Singapore Airlines' non-stop route to nearby Newark, New Jersey</a> by a mere two nautical miles, although <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/singapore-airlines-new-worlds-longest-flight-to-nyc-2020-10\">the airline doesn't see it that way</a>.&#160;</p><p>Flight times for the route are scheduled at a whopping 18 hours and five minutes on the New York-bound leg, flight SQ24, and 18 hours and 40 minutes for the flight back to Singapore, flight SQ23. For this route, the airline chose the Airbus A350-900 XWB with three cabins including business, premium economy, and economy classes.</p><p>So yes, it's possible to fly nearly 19 hours in economy and in a middle seat, though most flying in the cabin will likely have entire rows to themselves.&#160;</p><p>The route comes at a peculiar time for international travel as Americans can't enter Singapore for tourism or business so carrying cargo will help the airline pay the bills for this flight. As soon as the world opens up again, however, the flights should be filled with eager passengers looking to explore the world again.&#160;</p><p>We toured the aircraft before its inaugural flight back to Singapore.
