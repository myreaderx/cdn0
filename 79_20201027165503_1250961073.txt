Lyra uncovers a sinister plot that sends her on a journey to find her father in hopes of foiling said plot.

As of right now, the RTX 3070 is the finest GPU in this price sector by a large margin. In 24 hours, that could change—perhaps drastically.</p>\n<p>Ahead of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1319375474485673984\">AMD's big October 28 event</a>, dedicated to its RDNA 2 GPU line, Nvidia gave us an RTX 3070 Founders Edition to test however we saw fit. This is the GPU Nvidia absolutely needed to reveal before AMD shows up in (expectedly) the same price and power range.</p>\n<p>Inside of an Nvidia-only bubble, this new GPU is a sensation. Pretty much every major RTX 2000-series card overshot with proprietary promises instead of offering brute force worth its inflated costs. Yet without AMD nipping at its heels, Nvidia's annoying strategy seemed to be the right call: the company established the RTX series' exclusive bonus processing cores as a major industry option without opposition, then got to wait a full year before competing with significant power jumps <em>and</em> delectable price cuts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1717030#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1717030&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 13:00:27 +0000","feedId":79,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_1167-980x550.jpg","linkMd5":"38fb5ccbb2d31a7cf7822c73d98d3f15","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-59-370_e644e95a1a9d9d4e.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":550,"sourceBytes":103305,"destBytes":44728,"author":"Sam Machkovech","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_1167-980x550.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-59-370_e644e95a1a9d9d4e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-55-01-415_4628e6073286ba43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=XibS01LO72Q:vgGLAdbsOo8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-55-01-177_bc0cb6eb11076aff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-155_df58448fa708f5b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn98@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-151_9eb9dbc2699477ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817638950},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","title":"Hulu brings back that irreverent magic with trailer for Animaniacs reboot","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716251","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"video\"><div class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"980\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNCDu4nmt8M?start=0&#38;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></div><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">Yakko, Wakko, and Dot are back in Hulu’s reboot of the classic <em>Animaniacs</em> cartoon. </p></div>\n<p>Readers of a certain age will have fond childhood memories of weekday afternoons spent in the company of the Warner siblings, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, the central figures of the hugely popular, Emmy-award winning animated series, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs\"><em>Animaniacs</em></a>. Now a whole new generation can appreciate their comic genius with Hulu's revival of the show, slated to debut next month.</p>\n<p>The premise of the original <em>Animaniacs</em> was that Yakko, Wakko, and Dot were characters from the 1930s who were locked way in a water tower on the Warner Bros. lot until they escaped in the 1990s. Now they exist to wreak havoc and have fun. The format borrowed heavily from sketch comedy, with each episode typically featuring three short mini-episodes centered on different characters, connected by bridging segments. Other regular characters included two genetically altered lab mice, Pinky and the Brain, who are always trying to take over the world; Ralph the Security Guard; Slappy Squirrel and her nephew, Skippy; Chicken Boo; Flavio and Marita, aka the Hip Hippos; studio psychiatrist Dr. Otto Scratchansniff and Hello Nurse (also a common catchphrase); and a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers.</p>\n<p>As appealing to adults as to kids, the show was smart, funny, irreverent, and even educational, especially with its playful songs listing the nations of the world, for instance, or all the US states and their capitals—set to the tune of \"Turkey in the Straw\"—or all the presidents set to the \"William Tell Overture.\" (My personal favorite was \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19d4T8LMBEo\">The Solar System Song,</a>\" complete with the obligatory joke about Uranus.) The writers were masters of parody, so much so that it became something of a badge of honor to be so featured.

You can look as long and hard at the console's box as you wish. As part of our console review agreement with Sony, we're not allowed to share photos of anything <em>inside</em> the box yet, but we are allowed to confirm that there is indeed a working PlayStation 5 console in there. (<a href=\"https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-console-makes-an-appearance-on-twitch-stream-could-be-cake-update-was-cake.280250/\">Not cake</a>.)</p>\n<p>But we really can't say anything else about its contents. Anything that resembles an \"impression\" is off limits at this point, so if your many questions haven't already been answered by a Sony promotional video or social media post, we can neither confirm nor deny. (Our box absolutely pales compared to one of Sony's lead hardware engineers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/sonys-official-ps5-teardown-shows-how-the-system-stand-actually-works/\">tearing an entire PlayStation 5 apart</a>.)

But while Sony has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/playstation-5s-dualsense-controller-two-toned-design-more-haptic-feedback/\">hyped up</a> the DualSense's fine-tuned haptic feedback and adaptive force triggers in recent months, the company has been largely silent on one of the controller's most subtly impactful features: the built-in speaker.</p>\n<h2>Listen to your hands</h2>\n<p>Sony clearly wanted us to notice this speaker when we received our PlayStation 5 hardware; we were told, both in email and over a video-call briefing, not to wear headphones when testing <em>Astro's Playroom</em> for the first time. This was confusing at first, since the game's tutorial doesn't even mention the built-in speaker while running through the controller's many features. But it doesn't take long to hear the thing in action, and it's much better than you might expect based on recent console history.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1717451#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1717451&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 12:00:01 +0000","feedId":79,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ASTROs-PLAYROOM_20201023132907-980x551.jpg","linkMd5":"1e2d490671d9608f3190a1a04f16ab24","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn63@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-59-616_adf92c12d4649a12.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":551,"sourceBytes":90169,"destBytes":67230,"author":"Kyle Orland","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ASTROs-PLAYROOM_20201023132907-980x551.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn63@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-59-616_adf92c12d4649a12.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-55-01-143_59eadf8a34203ca1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=9eo6B2rTFno:xWcX5GqY5lQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-196_546f700e9560a4c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-155_df58448fa708f5b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn98@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-151_9eb9dbc2699477ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817638958},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","title":"Amazon Luna is live, and it’s already out-streaming Google Stadia","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716043","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/luna-logo-listing-800x474.png\" alt=\"Amazon Luna is live, and it’s already out-streaming Google Stadia\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/luna-logo-listing.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"827\" data-width=\"1397\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Amazon)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Roughly one month ago, Amazon ended <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-game-streaming-service\">over a year of speculation</a> by announcing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/amazon-announces-streaming-gaming-service-luna-launching-next-month/\">the upcoming launch of Amazon Luna</a>, its own dedicated gaming-in-the-cloud service.

What if you took the competent-idiot Southern charm of <a href=\"https://justified.fandom.com/wiki/Boyd_Crowder\"><i>Justified</i>'s Boyd Crowder,</a> but, instead of an Appalachian criminal, made the character the unlikely pitchman for a beloved classic SUV, who oozes over-the-top marketable machismo <em>a la</em> the Marlboro Man? And... what if you can get <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324658/\">Walton Goggins</a> himself to play the S.O.B? To call that comedic premise excellent, well, \"It'd be like saying, 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter is just margarine...' which I guess it is,\" as one interviewee describes Bronco.</p>\n<p>In case the title alone doesn't explain the premise: sometime around the 1960s, Ford had a rugged SUV, called the Bronco, lined up for the masses. But it needed a way to sell this new contraption. The company decided it would enter a prototype of the vehicle in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_1000\">Baja 1000</a>, a famed off-road race. It needed someone tough enough to handle this beast of a vehicle and course, so it sought out whoever seemed to be the most rugged guy in the region—a rodeo champ named John Bronco. <em>John Bronco</em> chronicles the (to be clear, fictional) man's rise, fall, and disappearance before trying to figure out where the legendary ad icon is now.</p>\n<p>The team behind <em>John Bronco</em>—Director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2021516/?ref_=tt_ov_dr\">Jake Szymanski</a> (HBO's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOTIqkD9fPA\"><em>Tour de Pharmacy</em></a>) and producer <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9913794/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">Marc Gilbar</a>—started on the idea in 2019 but ultimately timed the project for maximum impact when they learned Ford had real-life plans to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/ford-brings-back-the-bronco-suv-with-a-dizzying-array-of-options/\">relaunch the iconic Bronco</a> late this summer. According to <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/10/15/21517283/making-of-john-bronco-hulu-mockumentary-walton-goggins\">The Ringer</a>, the team met directly with Ford and earned access to the company's marketing archives, which get mined thoroughly for aesthetic and pseudo-accuracy in the film. For instance: if you, too, were also born after the mid-1980s, maybe it'd be surprising to learn Doug Flutie had enough of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_Score\">Q score</a> to actually hawk cars for Ford in 1985 (though the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyPOAzjlBSo\">original ad</a> does not seem to end in tragedy).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1717036#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1717036&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 16:15:55 +0000","feedId":79,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU","linkMd5":"a65a007dc45fd9c33e365573ee1a5681","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-59-463_d55234cd9e47535c.webp","destWidth":66,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1009,"destBytes":340,"author":"Nathan Mattise","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-59-463_d55234cd9e47535c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=GCxmgiQfHZ8:V2n4qkgdiRo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn70@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-55-01-181_19f9841ccc8fc241.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-155_df58448fa708f5b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn98@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-151_9eb9dbc2699477ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817638958},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","title":"Clearing up which media apps will be available on PS5 at launch [Updated]","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716475","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5remote1-980x551.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The PS5 media remote.

They live among us, demons indistinguishable from real women, hell-bent on murdering children. The boy is matter-of-fact about this frightening reality, but also urgent—he is relaying the immediate threat of a global network of bloodthirsty child predators. It's an intimate, conspiratorial opener, drawing readers in by whispering the secret truths grown-ups usually don't want them to know: not only is the world not safe for the young, it's unfair, treacherous, and cruel.</p>\n<p>As the story progresses, the narrator recounts his fateful encounter with the wicked Grand High Witch—the big, bad boss of all the witches around the world—along with every witch in England, a run-in that shapes his life. While on vacation with his grandmother at a seaside resort, he stumbles into a hush-hush witch conference, where the Grand High Witch explains a plot to turn all the world's children into mice. (The witches disguise themselves as a society against cruelty towards children.) In classic Dahl fashion, there's a surfeit of jokes about bodily functions, an unkind depiction of a fat kid as a greedy idiot, and vividly drawn villains who speak in rhyme. The boy and his grandmother ultimately foil the witches' scheme, but the ending is more melancholic than happily-ever-after: the narrator is transformed into a mouse by the witches; even after outwitting them, he cannot change back. He takes his predicament in stride, comforted by the knowledge that he won't outlive the only person in the world who loves him, but still—it's a children's story where the hero is doomed to premature death. Dark! It's a macabre, gripping tale, one which has remained a perennial favorite for kids since its debut more than 35 years ago. <em>The Witches</em>, like Dahl's best work, taps into a wavelength that acknowledges the dark edges of childhood in a way that so much young adult literature does not: puerile and mean and honest. People who hate children think they smell like shit. Strangers with candy have bad intentions. Parents die. And sometimes kids do too.</p><div class=\"image shortcode-img right full\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\"></div>\n<p>The new adaptation of <em>The Witches</em>, out on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hbo-max-launch-streaming/\">HBO Max</a> this week, doesn't totally carry this brutal worldview forward. It begins with a monologue modeled after the book's opener. It's narrated over a slide show that even includes snippets of Dahl's original text (including \"Witches are REAL!\"). But even though many of the words are the same, the tone is quite different. The narrator begins by sputtering out a cough, then says, \"Alright, where were we?\" as though he's a substitute teacher trying to figure out which slide of the presentation he's on. He also sounds unmistakably like Chris Rock. Because he is voiced by Chris Rock. No knock to Rock, who has an excellent voice—his <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/11/08/a-look-back-at-those-great-lil-penny-commercials-with-chris-rock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/11/08/a-look-back-at-those-great-lil-penny-commercials-with-chris-rock\"}'>\"Lil' Penny\" commercials</a> should be playing on a loop in the Louvre—but his jocular, bemused timbre here conjures a much different atmosphere than the book's prologue. Instead of tugging viewers aside to offer a warning, it opens like a classroom lecture about something that happened long ago. It's the first of many signs that <em>this</em> version of <em>The Witches</em>, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a substantial departure in sensibility from its source material.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716842#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716842&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 12:30:36 +0000","feedId":79,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png","linkMd5":"525beb82936a336f2d450032e7e227a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn56@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-59-426_1e89d0174aeba083.webp","destWidth":218,"destHeight":58,"sourceBytes":6971,"destBytes":1742,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn56@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-59-426_1e89d0174aeba083.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-55-01-139_562ca94d67cd4b79.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=JF1nVMlEkoY:DCwcNj2u5m8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn79@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-55-01-172_01ea7eebecef37c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-155_df58448fa708f5b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn98@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-151_9eb9dbc2699477ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817638957},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","title":"How Indiana Jones, Rambo, and others ended up in 1980s Czechoslovak text-adventures","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716215","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Indiana-Jones-in-Wenceslas-Square-1989-1-800x457.png\" alt=\"The loading screen of the browser-friendly version of ‘Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square’ converted by Jaroslav Švelch and 8-bit veteran Martin Kouba.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Indiana-Jones-in-Wenceslas-Square-1989-1.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"674\" data-width=\"1180\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The loading screen of the browser-friendly version of <em>Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square</em>, converted by Jaroslav Švelch and 8-bit veteran Martin Kouba.

Instead, this Jones adventure takes place in a clandestine video game that was released anonymously, then copied from one audio cassette to another. In 1989, students and dissidents had flocked to the center of Prague to protest Communism, only to be beaten and arrested by the riot police—an incident that took place during the lead up to the country's historic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution\">Velvet Revolution</a>. These individuals could not fight back in real life, so they’d later use their computers to get a fictional revenge.

To celebrate its 30th anniversary, the game's first 8-bit adventure is getting the re-release treatment, either as a basic digital version or with a deluxe, physical collection of booklets, maps, and more.</p>\n<p>But there's a funny thing about <em>Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon &#38; The Blade of Light</em>. This 8-bit re-release has some emulation-like tweaks and perks, but this is otherwise not a remake. Up until now, its text-filled Famicom version never got an official translation and release for Western audiences. And unlike the rare cases where Nintendo produced, then shelved, a translated version of a Japanese game, this first Fire Emblem game was never advertised or teased to Western fans.</p>\n<p>In any other year, we might look at this delightful throwback to a classic, Japan-only Nintendo game and briefly give the whole thing a thumbs up. But 2020 has been a weird one for Nintendo, so I'm tempted to take a closer look and ask: is this a sign of more unearthed translations to come?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716469#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716469&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 16:55:52 +0000","feedId":79,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fire-emblem-special-980x561.png","linkMd5":"73ee506575af7daa0e775bee2a5d6b36","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-59-734_991194a83195aefc.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":561,"sourceBytes":696769,"destBytes":87514,"author":"Sam Machkovech","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fire-emblem-special-980x561.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-59-734_991194a83195aefc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn81@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-55-01-132_faeb77250a9e1c33.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=fCDIpZ5Nkb0:6jkzVc8bvLA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn20@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-350_79b1eef2bf4c4eb4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-155_df58448fa708f5b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn98@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-55-01-151_9eb9dbc2699477ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817638958},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:58","title":"Quibi streaming service shutting down after less than 1 year","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1716315","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/quibi-rip-listing-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"It's not a great tombstone, but... well, we'll just leave it at that.
