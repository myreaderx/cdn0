Little by little, more halted productions are resuming, even though the coronavirus has yet to go away. The second season of the Apple TV+ series <strong><em>For All Mankind</em> </strong>and Sony&#8217;s new take on <strong><em>Cinderella</em></strong> are the latest titles to get back to work, with <em>For All Mankind</em> shooting on the Sony lot and <em>Cinderella</em> filming outside of London.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-632136\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>For All Mankind Season 2</strong></h2>\n<p><em>For All Mankind</em>, the Apple TV+ alternate history series in which the space race never ended and Russia got to the moon before the United States, has resumed production, according to Deadline. The report states that the series only had two episodes let to shoot in season 2 when it had to halt in March. Now, filming on those two episodes will conclude on the Sony lot in Culver City.</p>\n<p>The show was written and created by <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>, <strong>Matt Wolpert</strong>, and <strong>Ben Nedivi</strong>, and features a cast that includes <strong>Joel Kinnaman</strong>, <strong>Michael Dorman</strong>, <strong>Wrenn Schmidt</strong>, <strong>Sarah Jones</strong>,<strong> Shantel VanSanten</strong>, and <strong>Jodi Balfour</strong>. No premiere date for season 2 has been announced yet.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cinderella</strong></h2>\n<p>Also resuming production: <em>Cinderella</em>, a new take on the classic tale, directed by <strong>Kay Cannon</strong>. <strong>Camila Cabello</strong> stars in the film, which will resume production outside of London. Per Deadline, filming will start &#8220;with some low-level shooting commencing this week as the production felt safe and organized enough to move ahead,&#8221; with plans to continue through the end of September.</p>\n<p>And in case you were worried, &#8220;robust safety protocols are in place,&#8221; including &#8220;widespread and extensive testing,&#8221; &#8220;safety training seminars,&#8221; and more. The cast also includes<strong> Minnie Driver</strong>, <strong>Nicholas Galitzine</strong>, <strong>Idina Menze</strong>l, and <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong>, all of whom are expected to be part of the resumed production. The film is currently set to open <strong>February 5, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/for-all-mankind-season-2-production/\">&#8216;For All Mankind&#8217; Season 2 and Sony&#8217;s &#8216;Cinderella&#8217; Join Growing List of Resumed Productions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/haP5TpOBJmo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 23:00:40 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/for-all-mankind-season-2-production-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"1c7e25c623d4418714de4eca286ca62c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn52@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-27-19-967_3622a328acf81e2d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/for-all-mankind-season-2-production-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn52@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-27-19-967_3622a328acf81e2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn17@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-10-714_0f5b3f73ddbc6f41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=haP5TpOBJmo:ICHyYgHApdc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn22@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-28-11-592_df4c0f27743bc1c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/haP5TpOBJmo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn9@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-474_3227e5a34c5638c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439509},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"‘Little Rock Nine’: Chadwick Boseman and Seth MacFarlane Executive Producing TV Series Based on Racial Integration in an Arkansas High School","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632156","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-632195 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Little-Rock-Nine-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Little Rock Nine\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Little-Rock-Nine.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Little-Rock-Nine-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>In 1957, 14-year-old Carlotta Walls became the youngest member of the Little Rock Nine, a group of Black students who made history by walking into the historically segregated all-white Central High School in Little Rock and taking classes in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Brown v Board of Education.</p>\n<p>Now actress/writer <strong>Eisa Davis </strong>is developing a TV series about that event called <em><strong>Little Rock Nine </strong></em>which is based on Walls&#8217; memoir, and she has the unlikely pairing of <strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong> (<em>Black Panther</em>) and <strong>Seth MacFarlane</strong> (<em>Family Guy</em>) lined up to executive produce.

An angry mob, aided by the Arkansas National Guard, originally prevented Carlotta and her fellow Black schoolmates from entering Central High School on the first day of school in early September of 1957. But a few weeks later, escorted by federal troops deployed by President Eisenhower, Carlotta and her classmates made history.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy. While federal troops escorted them to the building every day that year, the Little Rock Nine had to endure insults and abuse from their white schoolmates once they were inside the walls of the school. &#8220;I considered my tormentors to be ignorant people,&#8221; Carlotta told <a href=\"https://time.com/4948704/little-rock-nine-anniversary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time</a> in 2017. &#8220;They did not understand that I had a right to be at Central. They had no understanding of our history, Constitution or democracy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out <em>Nine From Little Rock</em>, a short film that writer/director Charles Guggenheim made in 1964, for more information.

Tisdale struggled with feeling different! Candace Parker broke her leg, I think? But they all were able to rise up and become the celebrities we know them as today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Stuff happens sometimes that you can&#8217;t control. When things that are bad happen, there&#8217;s good that can come of it,&#8221; Parker said in the trailer.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s the kind of vaguely inspiring but self-congratulatory programming that seems to be becoming the bread and butter of new streaming platforms in need of content. Apple TV+ launched the similarly glossy docuseries <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dear-trailer/\"><em>Dear&#8230;</em></a> but managed to score way bigger celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee, and Disney favorite Lin-Manuel Miranda. Perhaps Disney is hoping to appeal to a younger demographic with <em>Becoming</em>, especially with millennial stars like Ashley Tisdale and Adam Devine, and <em>Stranger Things</em> star Caleb McLaughlin, whose career — as I learned in this trailer — actually began on the stage in <em>The Lion King</em> Broadway show. But still, was Miranda busy that day?</p>\n<p><em>Becoming</em> is produced by ESPN Films, The SpringHill Company, Wheelhouse Entertainment’s Spoke Studios, and ITV America. LeBron James, Maverick Carter, Jamal Henderson and Philip Byron executive produce from The SpringHill Company; Brent Montgomery and Joe Weinstock executive produce for Spoke Studios; and Jordana Hochman and Rebecca Bruno executive produce for ITV America.</p>\n<p>All 10 episodes of <em>Becoming</em> will be available on Disney+ on <strong>September 18, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/becoming-trailer-disney/\">&#8216;Becoming&#8217; Trailer: Disney+ Docuseries Chronicles Lives of Celebrities and Athletes Like Ashley Tisdale, Adam Devine, Candace Parker</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Tc5FY_5BqRg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/becoming-1-700x359.jpg","linkMd5":"83975e09dc3647c3de2fc6fedf4c4836","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-27-19-827_75f35000384964bb.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":359,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/becoming-1-700x359.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-27-19-827_75f35000384964bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-10-604_445b711e6d31b257.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Tc5FY_5BqRg:0V0sDx2B2G8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-28-11-266_bbcd07388638e9e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Tc5FY_5BqRg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn74@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-28-11-108_b0104237a7b06d41.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439506},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"‘Departure’ Trailer: Christopher Plummer Hires Archie Panjabi to Search for a Missing Plane in Peacock Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632080","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-632086\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure-700x376.jpg\" alt=\"departure trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure-700x376.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure-360x193.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure-768x412.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Christopher Plummer</strong> loves a plain old mystery, having recently appeared in the Rian Johnson whoddunit <em>Knives Out</em>.

The first trailer for <em>Departure</em> makes a meal out of Plummer&#8217;s starring appearance, making sure to get that &#8220;Academy Award winner&#8221; title in big, bold letters in front of the actor&#8217;s name, which even appears in front of the show&#8217;s lead, Archie Panjabi <em>(The Good</em> Wife)<em>.</em> Plummer plays the mentor to Panjabi&#8217;s &#8220;brilliant&#8221; investigator Kendra Malley, who is hired to crack the case of a passenger plane that mysteriously vanished over the Atlantic Ocean. But when they find one lone survivor, the mystery only deepens and Kendra begins to discover a web of conspiracies.</p>\n<p><em>Departure</em> looks like a procedural meets twisty conspiracy thriller, but may feel like a bit of a creaky premise with the NBC sci-fi series <em>Manifest</em> treading similar ground, and <em>Lost</em> setting the standard for disappearing planes over 15 years ago. But with a short six-episode run and an international cast that includes <strong>Kris Holden-Reid</strong> (<em>Umbrella Academy</em>), <strong>Rebecca Liddiard</strong> (<em>Run This Town</em>), <strong>Tamara Duarte</strong> (<em>Longmire</em>), <strong>Mark Rendall</strong> (<em>Versailles</em>), <strong>Peter Mensah</strong> (<em>Midnight, Texas</em>), and <strong>Sasha Roiz</strong> (Suits), perhaps <em>Departure </em>can set itself apart.</p>\n<p><em>Departure</em> is produced in association with Starlings Television and Corus Entertainment, and produced by Shaftesbury (Canada) and Greenpoint Productions Ltd. The series actually aired last summer in the U.K., making <em>Departure</em> the latest international acquisition that Peacock has made to pad out its collection of original titles.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis to <em>Departure</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When passenger plane Flight 716 shockingly vanishes over the Atlantic Ocean, brilliant investigator Kendra Malley (Archie Panjabi, The Good Wife) is brought in – alongside her mentor Howard Lawson (Christopher Plummer, Knives Out) – to find the truth and stop it from happening again. Still reeling from the recent death of her husband and struggling to parent her troubled stepson, Kendra isn’t sure she’s up to the task — especially when the whole world is watching. At every turn, new discoveries only deepen the mystery surrounding the disaster, revealing a host of motives and suspects.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Departure</em> premieres on Peacock on <strong>September 17, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/departure-trailer/\">&#8216;Departure&#8217; Trailer: Christopher Plummer Hires Archie Panjabi to Search for a Missing Plane in Peacock Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/N46GfxrdLQg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 21:30:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure-700x376.jpg","linkMd5":"3500a363fc5a5ecee833d45f4b6955b8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-27-19-816_25c0f84f1a4c755f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":376,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/departure-700x376.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-27-19-816_25c0f84f1a4c755f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-28-10-934_8853cfc09430c911.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N46GfxrdLQg:Ykwxl5re6j4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/N46GfxrdLQg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn96@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-28-11-189_22f4e80dd20df130.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439505},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"‘Dead Ringers’ TV Series Will Star Rachel Weisz and Rachel Weisz","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632215","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-632230\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"dead ringers tv series\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Dead Ringers</em></strong>, the David Cronenberg movie about the downfall of a pair of morally ambiguous twin gynecologists, is getting a TV series remake over at Amazon. To keep things fresh, the gender of the lead characters will be flipped, with <strong>Rachel Weisz</strong> set to pull double-duty as the Mantle twins. Jeremy Irons played the twins in the film, and earned rave reviews in the process.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-632215\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Dead Ringers</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ZHbu3msmes?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/dead-ringers-series-amazon-rachel-weisz-alice-birch-1234738991/\">Variety</a> reports that Amazon has given a straight-to-series order for a <em>Dead Ringers</em> TV series, based on the 1988 David Cronenberg movie of the same name. Based loosely on the true story of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, <em>Dead Ringers</em> followed Elliot and Beverly Mantle, twin gynecologists (both played by Jeremy Irons) who live a highly unconventional life together. Elliot often has affairs with his patients, but when he grows bored with them, he usually pawns them off on Beverly, who then pretends to be Elliot, keeping the patients completely in the dark about the deception. Things grow complicated when Beverly falls in love with one of the patients, played by Geneviève Bujold. It&#8217;s one of Cronenberg&#8217;s best movies, and, in true Cronenberg fashion, it&#8217;s highly unusual and unique.</p>\n<p>The TV adaptation will change things up a bit, with Rachel Weisz playing the twins. Weisz actually came up with the idea for the series and brought it to Annapurna Television, and <em>Normal People</em> writer <strong>Alice Birch</strong> will write and executive produce. &#8220;I am so lucky to have such brilliant partners in Annapurna and Amazon Studios, and I’m thrilled to be collaborating with the exceptionally talented Alice Birch. I can’t wait to go on this journey with all of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Albert Cheng, COO and co-head of television for Amazon Studios, added: &#8220;As one of today’s most accomplished and versatile actresses, Rachel Weisz will captivate the Amazon Prime Video global audience with her take on these two ruthless, twisted characters. This update to ‘Dead Ringers’ explores the darker side of medicine, obsession, and the human condition, making it a compelling addition to our slate of Amazon Original series.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not anti-remake by nature, I tend to get a little nervous when people try to remake movies with such a distinct identity, and that&#8217;s certainly the case for <em>Dead Ringers</em>. That said, I&#8217;m intrigued by the idea of reversing the genders of the lead characters. Plus, Weisz is a fantastic performer, and I&#8217;m curious to see what she does with the roles.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dead-ringers-tv-series/\">&#8216;Dead Ringers&#8217; TV Series Will Star Rachel Weisz and Rachel Weisz</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ME8FNFtzJVA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 22:00:15 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"e98dab2d55c55d39d877a116c2fa956a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-27-19-702_3b13c1158519a0cd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dead-ringers-tv-series-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-27-19-702_3b13c1158519a0cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn21@2020_2/2020/08/19/11-28-10-727_5e91af95c70aada1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ME8FNFtzJVA:K0q4pVUWL0Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/19/11-28-11-080_c700a041aa9ec364.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ME8FNFtzJVA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn18@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-442_d8e8f7362a5740a8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439504},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"George Lucas Has Been “Very Complimentary” of ‘The Mandalorian’ So Far, Says Dave Filoni","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632182","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-622892 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs-700x323.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian\" width=\"700\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs-700x323.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs-360x166.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>George Lucas</strong> may have sold Lucasfilm to the Walt Disney Company and taken a step back from the creative side of <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong>, but his influence is still felt across all facets of the sci-fi universe. In the case of television, <strong>Dave Filoni</strong> brings a lot of the same perspective and storytelling style as George Lucas, almost as a shepherd of the spirit of <em>Star Wars</em>. It must be working too, because when it come to <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong>, the executive producer says Lucas has been &#8220;very complimentary&#8221; about the series.<span id=\"more-632182\"></span></p>\n<p>Dave Filoni stays in contact with George Lucas pretty regularly, almost like a mentor. Filoni says that he doesn&#8217;t get much feedback from those conversations, and instead says, &#8220;I like to get more knowledge. He&#8217;ll give me some reminders, especially before I shoot something, about how many setups I should try to get in a day, and I might rack his brain for certain things about how to cover a scene.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But even though Lucas hasn&#8217;t given any extensive reactions about the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, Filoni did say this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been very complimentary. I think he&#8217;s enjoyed the show, and he said once [that] now he gets to watch it as a fan and watch it as a viewer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then Filoni brought it back around to the idea that Filoni uses what he&#8217;s learned from Lucas to keep<em> Star Wars</em> firmly in the universe that Lucas created. Filoni added, &#8220;My job is to bring that knowledge forward and pass on what I&#8217;ve learned from him in every discipline to Jon and to the creative departments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to know more about how George Lucas also inadvertently influenced <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-envisioned-the-mandalorian-technology-nearly-a-decade-ago/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">head over here</a> for some insight into how forward-thinking the creator was when it came to using state-of-the-art technology to realize his sci-fi vision.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-reaction-to-the-mandalorian/\">George Lucas Has Been &#8220;Very Complimentary&#8221; of &#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217; So Far, Says Dave Filoni</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/IPT0eFJding\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 20:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs-700x323.jpg","linkMd5":"def91c2a0183c1e2ec420d6f0e0386bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-27-19-719_0f5ed163ea0ab256.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":323,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-jonfavreau-georgelucas-set-chairs-700x323.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-27-19-719_0f5ed163ea0ab256.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx28/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-10-993_daca5c168aeec083.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=IPT0eFJding:XTt3lCnRYVk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx9/cdn27@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-28-10-931_59c6b91885f7f38f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/IPT0eFJding":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-579_fc5fed6e0754f344.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439510},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"‘The Exorcist’ Reboot Reportedly Coming to Theaters in 2021","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632208","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-470260 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716-700x359.jpg\" alt=\"the exorcist reboot\" width=\"700\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716-700x359.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716-360x185.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716-768x394.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Pazuzu rides again!</p>\n<p>Buried at the end of a recent Deadline article comes the news that a reboot of William Friedkin&#8217;s 1973 horror classic <em><strong>The Exorcist</strong></em> is being developed for theatrical release in 2021 by the folks at Morgan Creek Productions. Hang on to your holy water as we try to parse through what&#8217;s going on here.<span id=\"more-632208\"></span></p>\n<p>This sentence was at the bottom of a Deadline article this afternoon, and it has sent a ripple of confusion through the horror community: &#8220;Current Morgan Creek projects include <em>Stay Tuned</em> at AMC, with a planned theatrical reboot of <em>The Exorcist</em> in the works for 2021.&#8221; Fox&#8217;s TV version of <em>The Exorcist</em> wrapped up its two season run back in 2017, but this is the first time we&#8217;re hearing about a feature film reboot, let alone one that might be ready for theatrical release as soon as next year.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Morgan Creek Productions <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ace-ventura-reboot/\">rebranded</a> into Morgan Creek Entertainment Group and began developing several of its library titles for reboots, sequels, or remakes. In 2015, the company explicitly promised they would never remake <em>The Exorcist</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For the record, we will never attempt to remake THE EXORCIST</p>\n<p>&#8212; Morgan Creek (@Morgan__Creek) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Morgan__Creek/status/648559660300152832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The project is not listed as one of the &#8220;in development&#8221; titles on the company&#8217;s IMDB Pro page.</p>\n<p>I reached out to Morgan Creek for confirmation about <em>The Exorcist</em> reboot, but I have yet to hear back. We&#8217;ve also directly reached out to William Friedkin, the director of the original film, to see if he&#8217;s heard anything about a potential reboot. Back in 2017, Morgan Creek Entertainment Group said that ideally, the company would get the blessings of their library titles&#8217; original creators before they move forward with new entries, so perhaps Friedkin is involved with this possible new version.</p>\n<p>The fact that this new movie is being billed as a &#8220;reboot&#8221; and not a remake implies that it will have a direct narrative connection to the original film. But Max von Sydow, the star of the original film, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/max-von-sydow-dead/\">died earlier this year</a>. Actors Jason Miller, Jack MacGowran, and Lee J. Cobb have also passed away, but Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair, who played the mother and daughter at the center of the story, are still active, so they could potentially be brought in to establish that connection. The<em> Exorcist</em> TV series ignored the events of the later four movies and served as a direct sequel to the 1973 original film.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll update this story if we hear anything concrete from the folks we&#8217;ve reached out to. In the meantime, here&#8217;s the trailer for the 1973 movie:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jyW5YXDcIGs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-exorcist-reboot/\">&#8216;The Exorcist&#8217; Reboot Reportedly Coming to Theaters in 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wkZ48lmj6G4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 21:11:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716-700x359.jpg","linkMd5":"7a74d5fcb085809b69fa2a265757b2eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-27-19-728_4139637ebac28393.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":359,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-exorcist-4-e1520386153716-700x359.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-27-19-728_4139637ebac28393.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn33@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-28-11-533_43970fc8f031dfad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wkZ48lmj6G4:31fivKgR3Us:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-650_ec3957dc85a89b4f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wkZ48lmj6G4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn2@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-329_ac76271e0ccf9877.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439507},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"Daniel Dae Kim and Randall Park Are Leading Amazon’s Asian-American Heist Film","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632165","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-632169\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim-700x350.jpg\" alt=\"asian american heist film\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim-700x350.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Dae Kim </strong>and<strong> Randall Park</strong> may have played romantic rivals to steal Ali Wong&#8217;s heart in <em>Always Be My Maybe</em>, but they&#8217;re teaming up to steal something of even more value in an Asian-American heist film for <strong>Amazon Studios.</strong> The Korean-American hunks are leading an a yet-untitled Asian-American heist film that will be penned by screenwriter Young Il Kim, who has worked on Showtime’s <em>Billions </em>and wrote the Black List script <em>Rodham</em><em>.</em> Amazon Studios outbid several studios and streamers for the pitch.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-632165\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline broke the news that Daniel Dae Kim and Randall Park have upgraded from stealing Ali Wong&#8217;s heart to stealing priceless treasure — as well as the hearts of audiences hungry for an Asian-American-led heist film. Kim and Park, both longtime friends and bearers of impressive cheekbones, are partnering up to star in an untilted Asian-American heist film penned by Young Il Kim which Kim described has shades of &#8221; <em>Ocean’s 11, The Full Monty</em> as well as <em>Better Luck Tomorrow.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Details are being kept under wraps, but Deadline reports that the story will follow a reunion of high school friends who come together in a nod to &#8220;classic, fun ensemble heist films.&#8221; The original story came from an idea by Kim, Park and 3AD’s Head of Development John Cheng. All three will serve as producers on the project. Park and Kim also intend to assemble a cast of primarily Asian-American actors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is an appetite to see this kind of a movie with an Asian American cast and that is a really promising sign of the times,&#8221; Kim said, following the heated bidding war for the project with several streamers and studios.</p>\n<p>The watershed success of <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> has certainly opened the door for Asian and Asian-American-led films, and Kim and Park — who have long been leading the march for representation on TV with their roles on <em>Lost</em> and <em>Fresh Off the Boat</em>, respectively — are finally seeing the fruits it all. The two of them starred in <em>Always Be My Maybe</em> as romantic interests for lead Ali Wong, who conceived of the Netflix movie with Park. Now Kim and Park are using their star power as two of the most recognizable Asian-American male leads in Hollywood right now, to make the kind of movie they&#8217;ve always wanted to see Asians in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We love heist movies,&#8221; Kim says. &#8220;We want to be inclusive and we feel like there’s a story here to be told. It’s super exciting… Randall and I have wanted to do something together for a while. This is just a great reason to bring together talented actors who have been friends for a really long time and really have fun on a project that, with any luck, will be able to make an impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now there&#8217;s a matter of recruiting the rest of the ensemble. John Cho? Henry Golding? The rest of the crazy chiseled cast of <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>? Maybe even get some Asian actresses in their, and stage an <em>Ocean&#8217;s 8 </em>crossover with Awkwafina. The possibilities are endless, and so, so exciting.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/daniel-dae-kim-randall-park-asian-american-heist-film/\">Daniel Dae Kim and Randall Park Are Leading Amazon&#8217;s Asian-American Heist Film</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/T0IoQdSy6MM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 23:30:56 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim-700x350.jpg","linkMd5":"c71ca62da9b8c30576763723b027064d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-27-19-717_a6de1e044c5e5714.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":350,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/randall-park-daniel-dae-kim-700x350.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-27-19-717_a6de1e044c5e5714.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-28-10-613_e1747857d63197e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T0IoQdSy6MM:hIH4_c4bNHc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-28-11-442_dc84f0b513910e72.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/T0IoQdSy6MM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn48@2020_2/2020/08/19/11-28-10-930_effd51dadfee4e27.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439508},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","title":"‘The Binge’ Trailer: It’s a Comedy Version of ‘The Purge’, But With Drugs Instead of Murder","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632131","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-632151 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Binge-trailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Binge trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Binge-trailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Binge-trailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>You probably know the premise of Blumhouse&#8217;s <em>The Purge</em> films even if you haven&#8217;t seen the movies: the United States is a peaceful country with no crime to speak of – but once a year, all crime (including murder) becomes legal for everyone. Now a new Hulu comedy film called <em><strong>The Binge</strong></em> is taking a similar idea, but swapping out crime for drugs and alcohol. Throw in a classic high school party subplot courtesy of <em>Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait</em>, toss in a dash of <strong>Vince Vaughn</strong>, and you&#8217;ve got a movie on your hands.

I have to admit I&#8217;m not fully sold on the comedy here – it feels like this film is aiming to be <em>Superbad</em> for the next generation, but its version of gross-out comedy (see: the cow scene) just feels like a low-rent imitator of those Apatow-era movies. Even something more recent, like <em>Good Boys</em>, managed to capture that mixture of heart and humor better than this film seems to – but the operative phrase there is &#8220;seems to,&#8221; because it&#8217;s not entirely fair to judge this based solely on its trailer. There have been several movies I&#8217;ve ended up loving after watching iffy-to-awful trailers, so fingers crossed this one turns out a little better than it looks here.</p>\n<p><strong>Skyler Gisondo</strong>, <strong>Dexter Darden</strong>, <strong>Eduardo Franco</strong>, <strong>Grace Van Dien</strong>, <strong>Tony Cavalero</strong>, <strong>Zainne Saleh</strong>, <strong>Marta Piekarz</strong>, <strong>Esteban Benito</strong>, <strong>Brittany Garms</strong>, <strong>Natalie Goldberg</strong>, and <strong>Affion Crockett</strong> join Vince Vaughn in this cast.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the movie&#8217;s official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the not so distant future all drinking and drugs have been made completely illegal by the government&#8230; except for one night a year. High school seniors, Griffin, Hags and Andrew make a pilgrimage to get to the best party in town where all their dreams will come true&#8230; Sure they will have to avoid their crazed principal (Vince Vaughn), violent siblings and the wild animals roaming the streets, but that’s all part of the fun! Their friendship will be tested, love live’s will be rattled and their brains completely scrambled.

Because, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re well aware, the coronavirus hasn&#8217;t gone anywhere. And there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any plan in place at the moment to deal with that.</p>\n<p>Instead, theater chains are just hoping for the best and assuming that social distancing and other precautions will keep everyone safe. But just how safe is it to return to the movies right now? According to a recent interview with two doctors who specialize in epidemiology, it&#8217;s not safe at all.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-632163\"></span></p>\n<p>Are you ready to go back to the movies? Scratch that – do you think it&#8217;s <em>safe</em> to go back to the movies? Because I&#8217;m sure many of us are more than ready to see something on the big screen again, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we <em>should</em>. <a href=\"https://film.avclub.com/please-don-t-go-to-a-movie-theater-it-s-just-about-th-1844756993?utm_campaign=The+A.V.+Club&#38;utm_content=1597765970&#38;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&#38;utm_source=facebook\">The AV Club</a> spoke with two experts: Dr. Anne W. Rimoin, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center For Global and Immigrant Health at the University Of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, physician and epidemiologist, who is also a former city health commissioner and host of the podcast <a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 iBExkf js_link\" href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/america-dissected/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-ga=\"[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://crooked.com/podcast-series/america-dissected/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]\"><em>America Dissected</em></a>, about the prospect of heading back to theaters. And both physicians made it abundantly clear that going to a movie theater anytime soon is a bad, bad idea.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From what we understand, the virus is transmitted through aerosolized droplets that come out of our mouths, oftentimes when we talk or when we laugh or when we sing,&#8221; said Dr. El-Sayed. &#8220;And so, being in a room for two hours with a bunch of folks who are laughing at a movie, and where air is not being circulated in an efficient way, and where you don’t know who has been in there before you, that’s really hazardous exposure. I just don’t think it’s worth it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dr. Rimoin added: &#8220;And if they’re selling concessions, people are gonna be taking off their masks and eating, and that’s tantamount to eating in a restaurant in a closed space — even worse, because you’re basically in a closed box. There aren’t even windows, there’s no ventilation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So <em>should</em> we be going back to the movies right now? &#8220;Short of renting out an entire theater, which is obviously not an option for most of us, there is no scenario in which going to a movie theater is a good idea,&#8221; said Dr. Rimoin. &#8220;If a movie theater is opening, they should close concessions and they need to have employees in the theaters with night-vision goggles to be able to really see people and make sure that nobody’s bringing in food and everyone is wearing masks at all times. That’s another reason movie theaters aren’t a good idea: You can’t control what everybody else is doing around you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Concessions are a huge part of how movie theaters make money, so there is probably zero chance in hell they&#8217;d want to shut them down. And most movie theaters can&#8217;t even be bothered to have good film projection or deal with rude and rowdy patrons, so I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re not going to want to break out some night-vision goggles to keep an eye on people.</p>\n<p>But if you <em>refuse</em> to accept this, and are dead-set on hitting up a theater,  Dr. El-Sayed says: &#8220;I’d tell people to wear a mask and keep it on the entire time. And do everything touchless: Buy your ticket online, have it on your phone, don’t let them touch your phone when they scan it. Don’t spend any time in the common spaces: Go straight to your theater, sit as far away from folks as you possibly can. I agree concessions should be closed, and they should be wiping down the entire theater in between every screening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the solution? Dr. Rimoin has praise for &#8220;drive-in theaters springing up all over the place&#8221; and &#8220;outdoor screenings,&#8221; while Dr. El-Sayd adds: &#8220;Outdoor movie theaters, or watching a movie in your car, those are great. But the safest thing is to stay home and watch it on Netflix. We have to remember that it’s not just our risks that we’re talking about. It’s about whether or not we are serving as a vessel to spread it to people who may not be as healthy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m incredibly frustrated with the industry right now. Studios and theaters had months to try to figure something out, and the best they&#8217;ve come up with is &#8220;We&#8217;re going to make people skip a seat.&#8221; Studios and theaters should be embracing the idea of pop-up drive-ins – hell, if Walmart can turn their parking lots into drive-ins, there&#8217;s no reason theater chains can&#8217;t try to do the same. Instead, theaters and studios seem content to toss the dice and hope for the best, and, based on the experts quoted above, that&#8217;s probably a terrible idea.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/returning-to-movie-theaters/\">Doctors Say You Should Probably Skip Returning to Movie Theaters Anytime Soon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qjqByjWud30\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 22:30:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returning-to-Movie-Theaters-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"d768731faac7f7d41b0756d1964ab977","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-27-19-882_6ce67f8376787818.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returning-to-Movie-Theaters-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-27-19-882_6ce67f8376787818.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx26/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/19/11-28-11-142_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/19/11-28-11-229_499da9392fdb2c3c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/19/11-28-11-557_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qjqByjWud30:ZjOnHuLkG6g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx35/cdn97@2020_6/2020/08/19/11-28-10-768_ec66dcc51c14c1cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qjqByjWud30":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/19/11-28-11-061_7bc820e14563f573.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597836439509}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 19:27:19","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 11:27:19 +0000","fetchMs":42,"handleMs":162,"totalMs":53659,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"54.83.133.132","hostName":"secure-citadel-84932.herokuapp.com","requestId":"c12dd262b7eb4d7780189b094982b3a7_21","bgimgsTotal":11,"bgimgsGithubTotal":11,"articlesImgsTotal":47,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":46},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 17:38:02","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn71@2020_1/2020/08/16/09-38-02-742_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
