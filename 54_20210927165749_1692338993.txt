How Marketers Can Navigate [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-productivity-shifts","description":"<p>2020 was a whirlwind year for managers.</p>  \n<p>For instance, among her own personal experiences learning how to work in a pandemic, my manager also needed to demonstrate empathy for employees who had stresses that interfered with their ability to work at their best.</p> \n<p>She adjusted deadlines, re-defined team goals, and created new standards for success that enabled her employees to perform well while also dealing with everything <em>else</em>&nbsp;they had on their plates — including childcare, health concerns, and, well, a global pandemic. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Amidst the stresses of 2020, you'd be hard pressed to find a manager who didn't make exceptions for her employees as they settled into this \"new normal\".</p> \n<p>But now, as we near the end of 2021, most of us have fully adjusted. I've ordered an at-home monitor and standing desk; my teammates and I regularly touch-base during our weekly Zoom meetings; and, in some respects, I'm more productive at home than I ever was in the office. (<em>\"Meet at the Smoothie Bar?\" \"Sure! Be there in five.\"</em>)</p> \n<p>Which leads me to question: Are employees more productive now than they were in 2020? And, if they're not, how can leaders respond to this potentially long-term shift in productivity levels?</p> \n<p>Here, we conducted a survey to determine whether employees have become more&nbsp;or less productive than they were in 2020. We also asked respondents whether their work environment impacts their productivity — plus, how managers can boost their team's productivity in the current landscape.</p> \n<p>Let's dive in.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5ab914ce-204e-40ef-acfe-d7bfec642e1a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: How to Be More Productive at Work [Free Guide + Templates]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5ab914ce-204e-40ef-acfe-d7bfec642e1a.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Are employees more of less productive in 2021 than they were in 2020?</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Are%20Employees%20More%20or%20Less%20Productive%20Than%20They%20Were%20in%202020%3F%20How%20Marketers%20Can%20Navigate%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-3.png?width=624&amp;height=416&amp;name=Are%20Employees%20More%20or%20Less%20Productive%20Than%20They%20Were%20in%202020%3F%20How%20Marketers%20Can%20Navigate%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\"></p> \n<p>For starters, roughly <strong>40% of our respondents say they have the same level of productivity in 2021</strong>&nbsp;as they did in 2020.</p> \n<p>This makes sense. Most of our workspaces haven't shifted too drastically since 2020. For instance, we had a whooping <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/12/09/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-has-and-hasnt-changed-the-way-americans-work/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630438713918000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WXGy63uBtTEHcchax3_sY\">71% of U.S. employees working from home</a> during the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 … but the number of full-time remote employees in the United States is still expected to <em>double</em>&nbsp;in 2021, as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-technology/permanently-remote-workers-seen-doubling-in-2021-due-to-pandemic-productivity-survey-idUSKBN2772P0\">reported by Enterprise Technology Research</a>.</p> \n<p>This means, now that employees have fully adjusted to their new remote lifestyle, it makes sense that we'll see similar productivity levels in 2021 that we saw in 2020.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <strong>one-fourth of our respondents feel even </strong><em><strong>more</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;productive in 2021</strong>&nbsp;than they did one year ago.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlene-strain-813a5a104/\">Charlene Strain</a>, HubSpot's Associate Marketing Manager for Global Co-Marketing Acquisition &amp; Partnerships, this shift to a more productive workplace makes sense.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Strain says, \"I believe employees are more productive than they were in 2020, since we have settled into a more cohesive routine in 2021 than we had in 2020.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>She adds, \"Whether that's figuring out a better work-life balance, taking a step back to think about what makes us happy at work, vocalizing wins and concerns, or bringing more of our authentic selves to the workplace — it has all contributed to an improved personal and team morale over the past year.\"</p> \n<p>In 2020, surveys found employees were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-technology/permanently-remote-workers-seen-doubling-in-2021-due-to-pandemic-productivity-survey-idUSKBN2772P0\">more productive when they worked remotely</a>&nbsp;than they'd been in the office … so it's impressive that some employees' have built upon that momentum to become even <em>more</em>&nbsp;productive this year than they were last.</p> \n<p>However, a combined <strong>24% of employees felt they were either much less productive</strong>&nbsp;than they'd been in 2020, or at least slightly less productive.</p> \n<p>So … While some employees are feeling better than ever, why are others' motivation dwindling?</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlamcook/\">Karla Cook</a>, Senior Manager of HubSpot's Blog Program, notes: \"There are a lot of valid reasons why employees might be feeling less productive and burnt out right now. We've had high expectations for things to simply 'return to normal' in 2021, but obviously that hasn't been the case for many of us.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Cook adds, \"I think we're all collectively realizing there isn't a switch we can flip on in our brains to go back to 'normal work mode', and that can cause some feelings of inadequate productivity.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Many of us expected the stresses and challenges outside of work to disappear with the new year. We likely expected to 'hit the ground running' in our roles, but as we've seen, it hasn't quite turned out like that — the old way of life, and work, doesn't seem to be returning anytime soon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All of that might result in unrealistic expectations to perform at pre-pandemic levels. As Cook puts it, \"There's pressure to return to a pre-pandemic level of work and way of life, or even go above and beyond that, and I think that's backfiring in a lot of cases and making a lot of people feel like they aren't doing enough.\"</p> \n<p>Perhaps the decrease in productivity also has to do with varying work preferences. For those who say they work more effectively from home — and who have an at-home setup conducive to remote work — it makes sense that they've reported increased productivity since the pandemic.</p> \n<p>But there are others, like myself, who thrive on office culture. These workers need the energetic buzz of people around them, as well as a separate space outside their apartments to truly dial into their work.</p> \n<p>It's worth noting that some employees might also not have the physical infrastructure to support a fully productive at-home office — perhaps, for instance, you have employees who need to work odd hours because they're taking care of children at home. Alternatively, maybe some of your employees have no choice but to work in distracting common spaces with other roommates.</p> \n<p>Data supports the notion that a work environment has a strong impact on productivity. As shown in the graph below, <strong>25% of workers report feeling more productive in a physical workspace</strong> than they do while working from home. This means <em>some</em> of your employees might be more productive than ever in 2021 — while others might still struggle to find their remote rhythm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Are%20Employees%20More%20or%20Less%20Productive%20Than%20They%20Were%20in%202020%3F%20How%20Marketers%20Can%20Navigate%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=624&amp;height=416&amp;name=Are%20Employees%20More%20or%20Less%20Productive%20Than%20They%20Were%20in%202020%3F%20How%20Marketers%20Can%20Navigate%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\"></p> \n<p>If you do manage a team that feels they're less productive now than they were in 2020, you're in luck.</p> \n<p>Here, I spoke with seven HubSpot Managers to learn why employees might be struggling to work in this current landscape, as well as tips for boosting productivity for 2022 and beyond.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How Managers Can Respond to Changing Productivity Levels</h2> \n<h3>1. Find daily or weekly activities your team can do together.</h3> \n<p>On the Blog team, we host <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games\">weekly ice breakers</a> during our team stand-up every Monday.</p> \n<p>There might be a similar activity you can conduct with your own team to promote relationship-building and give your employees a chance to have some fun.</p> \n<p>As Strain told me, \"To boost team productivity, especially remotely, I'd suggest having a daily and/or weekly 'question of the day' where each team member gets to ask a silly, fun, or more serious question via Slack or email. This helps the group get to know each other and take a break from the work day.\"</p> \n<p>Alternatively, consider creating a team playlist for your team when working remotely. Music can be a great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/music-productivity-working-from-home#:~:text=Your%20streaming%20service%20or%20record,become%20motivated%20and%20stay%20productive.\">promoter of productivity</a>, and it adds an element of camaraderie if you're able to get your whole team involved.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how%20to%20boost%20team%20productivity%20in%202022%20according%20to%20hubspot%20manager%20Charlene%20Strain.png?width=1104&amp;name=how%20to%20boost%20team%20productivity%20in%202022%20according%20to%20hubspot%20manager%20Charlene%20Strain.png\" alt=\"how to boost team productivity in 2022 according to hubspot manager Charlene Strain\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>\"Having a weekly playlist in terms of theme, artist, genre, or decade — which everyone contributes to or comments on while working — is a great way to boost team morale,\" Strain told me.</p> \n<p>She adds, \"Alternatively, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-team-outing-ideas\">weekly team activities</a>&nbsp;like two truths and a lie, maps of where we've traveled, etc. are also great opportunities for promoting productivity.\"</p> \n<p>This might seem counterintuitive — Like,<em>Wait, you want me to encourage my team to play games as a way of boosting productivity?&nbsp;</em>But, in reality, building a strong team culture is a critical component for increasing productivity, as it helps your employees feel more engaged at work and increases team morale.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Strain puts it, \"The more we get to know each other outside of work, the better team productivity is since we see each other as fully-fledged people with hobbies, worries, successes, and insecurities rather than just a name or face on the screen.\"</p> \n<h3>2. Paint a clear vision for your team's future.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/clint-fontanella-973271140\">Clint Fontanella</a>, a Marketing Manager on HubSpot's Blog team, argues that employees are <em>more</em>&nbsp;productive in 2021 than they were in 2020 based on <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/industry-data?category=total&amp;topic=ad-spend&amp;subTopic=&amp;drilldown=null\">HubSpot's industry benchmark data</a>.</p> \n<p>As he points out, \"Since early 2021, ad spend continues to increase, conversations have skyrocketed, web traffic remains high, and sales email and call volume continues to climb. To me, this means that sales teams are trying to play catch-up from last year and are aggressively reaching out to contacts via email, phone, and live chat to do so.\"</p> \n<p>\"Marketing teams,\" He adds, \"are also working hard to meet the sales team's demand by increasing their ad spend and capitalizing on rising web traffic to acquire new contacts. If we compare contact growth from 2020 to 2021, it's significantly higher than last year.\"</p> \n<p>So — amidst all that newfound demand, how do you spark optimal productivity? Fontanella says it comes down to painting a clear vision for your team's future.</p> \n<p>He told me, \"We've talked a lot about uncertainty this past year, but industries are slowly becoming more stable. Employees had to adapt to a new working world, and now that they've adjusted, you need to paint an attainable future for them to work towards rather than ambiguity and uncertainty.\"</p> \n<p>Fontanella encourages managers to \"set a team goal, explain how you'll achieve it, and keep employees updated as you reach new milestones along the way.\"</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Are%20Employees%20More%20or%20Less%20Productive%20Than%20They%20Were%20in%202020%3F%20How%20Marketers%20Can%20Navigate%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png?width=671&amp;name=Are%20Employees%20More%20or%20Less%20Productive%20Than%20They%20Were%20in%202020%3F%20How%20Marketers%20Can%20Navigate%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 671px;\" title=\"\" width=\"671\"></p> \n<h3>3. Foster both trust and boundaries.</h3> \n<p>It can be difficult, but a fully remote team requires an additional level of trust to operate effectively.</p> \n<p>If you're leading a team in an office space, it's easy enough to check-in on colleagues, monitor who's working (and when), and have daily in-person interactions to understand what each team member is working on.</p> \n<p>A lot of this disappears with remote work – and that's okay. Knowing when and where your employees work doesn't translate to knowing how <em>well </em>they work. As <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx\">HubSpot's Culture Code states</a>, \"Results matter more than the hours we work, [and] results matter more than where we produce them.\"</p> \n<p>To lead a productive remote team, then, trust and clear expectations are key.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>As Team Manager of Content Conversion <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlystec/\">Carly Williams</a> says, \"For me, keeping my remote team productive boils down to two things: trust and boundaries.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\"A lack of trust often leads to micromanagement, which can be really demotivating for employees. To avoid this, I stay out of the way by setting clear expectations and creating accountability.\"</p> \n<p>\"As for boundaries,\" Williams adds, \"I'm conscious of the fact that working hours becomes blurred in a remote environment. To avoid overworking and burnout, I lead by example and avoid sending late night emails or Slack messages. I also encourage my team to take a minimum of one mental health day a month (outside of regular vacation time) to step out of their work routines and recharge.\"</p> \n<p>If you can create trust and autonomy amongst your team, you'll likely see the outcomes you want. To do this, ensure your expectations are clear, and set healthy boundaries for your team by setting them for yourself.</p> \n<p>Additionally, consider creating team-accessible dashboards or a shared Google Doc so team members can report on their progress without requiring constant check-ins.</p> \n<h3>4. Focus less on productivity — and more on individual well-being.</h3> \n<p>While it can be tempting to pretend nothing has changed, ignoring the reality of our current lives is detrimental to your ability to effectively lead your team.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meg-prater-she-her-a2a7b571/\">Meg Prater</a>, HubSpot's Senior Manager of Content, told me — \"While the pandemic, at times, has seemed less bleak or more hopeful in 2021, the landscape has changed rapidly. Employees who are struggling to keep unvaccinated children safe while sending them back to school, experiencing mental burnout at 18+ months living in this new but unbalanced normal, and evaluating everyday decisions for risk, are <em>tired</em>.\"</p> \n<p>Prater adds, \"For a lot of us, not feeling like we're giving 100% at our jobs for sustained periods of time is demoralizing. Asking people, amongst all of that, to perform at a pre-pandemic level is exhausting.\"</p> \n<p>Fortunately, you shouldn't have to. Adjusting to this new normal requires <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/empathy-leadership\">empathy and learning how to manage human-to-human</a>.</p> \n<p>Rather than constantly focusing on output, consider how you might alter your approach to develop trust within your team and show employees you care about their well-being.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how%20to%20boost%20team%20productivity%20in%202022%20according%20to%20hubspot%20manager%20Meg%20Prater.png?width=1104&amp;name=how%20to%20boost%20team%20productivity%20in%202022%20according%20to%20hubspot%20manager%20Meg%20Prater.png\" alt=\"how to boost team productivity in 2022 according to hubspot manager Meg Prater\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<p>As Prater puts it, \"For managers, I think the weight of checking in with employees throughout 2020 and 2021, attempting to keep morale at a new normal level, and managing results can be really difficult and draining.\"</p> \n<p>She adds, \"I'd recommend focusing less on productivity, and focusing more on individual professional well-being. Meeting your team members where they are, giving them the individualized and evolving support they need, and making sure they're able to take time to recharge and care for themselves or their families, is the best, most responsible thing I can do for my employees and my company this year.\"</p> \n<p>To demonstrate your investment in your employees' professional well-being, ensure you're creating space for your direct reports to vocalize how they're feeling about their workload, or just how they're feeling in general.</p> \n<p>Understanding their challenges can help you ensure you're providing them with the support they need to do their jobs at optimal levels.</p> \n<h3>5. Bring your team together to share challenges and offer solutions.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eonta/\"><span>Matt Eonta</span></a>, HubSpot's Senior Manager of Project Management, believes the early pandemic days \"actually energized a lot of folks who were looking for a stable, known quantity to spend time on and pour themselves into. People often seek that in times of uncertainty.\"</p> \n<p>He adds, \"Coupled with a lot of collaborative, interactive, and culture-focused programming, work — and the desire to be productive and successful at it — drove a lot of people in 2020, even if their home environments and obligations weren't always conducive to that.\"</p> \n<p>During such a tumultuous and stressful time, checking work emails or diving into a project with colleagues likely fueled a sense of control that people weren't getting from the outside world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2021, however, we see that some employees' energy levels compared to 2020 are fading — fast. As Eonta puts it, \"Into 2021, it seems some folks are finding that unsustainable. This isn't the two week or two month work-from-home mandate some expected. We're on month 18, and sustaining that energy is difficult.\"</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are solutions to re-igniting some of the energy managers saw from their direct reports in 2020.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For his team, Eonta describes his commitment to investing in collaboration, storytelling, and shared experiences. \"At an individual level, nearly everyone gets energy from solving problems and helping others.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"When our team comes together and shares more of what they're working on, the problems they face, and solutions they're investing in — it really fosters some energetic, exciting, and uplifting conversations among the larger group.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Eonta adds, \"It also sets a bar for the team and builds connections we may not have known were there, especially given our inability to collocate.\"</p> \n<p>It's important to note: Sustaining a work-at-all-costs mentality isn't healthy, or even possible. So if your employees are simply re-calibrating back into their pre-pandemic selves when it comes to productivity, that might not be such a bad thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Set clear expectations.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Being a strong leader has always depended on setting and managing your employees expectations — and Karla Cook believes that has never been more true.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She told me, \"It's always important as a manager to set very clear expectations around individual and team performance with your employees, but in times where a lot is uncertain, it becomes even more critical.\"</p> \n<p>\"As a manager,\" Cook adds, \"you should be providing a lot of stability and structure around work, and checking in with your team regularly to make sure they understand what is needed from them, how they're doing, and how their contributions plug into the bigger-team picture.\"</p> \n<p>To create structure around expectations, perhaps you let your employees know in weekly 1:1s how they're performing in their roles, or highlight team performance against goals in a monthly email.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you discuss expectations — and how your employees are performing against those expectations — in regular performance reviews.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, to ensure optimal productivity, you want to be clear and specific when outlining the expectations you have for your team, and how it impacts the business at-large.</p> \n<h3>7. Acknowledge that productivity looks different for every individual.</h3> \n<p>I have a colleague who works non-stop from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. She sits at her desk as she eats her lunch, and keeps her phone in her purse to avoid distractions. Then, at abruptly 4 p.m. every day, she leaves to attend a workout class, grab dinner, and head home.</p> \n<p>On the other end, I have another colleague who logs on around 10 a.m. and works until 6 p.m., but he takes regular breaks for lunch, afternoon workouts, or brief morning walks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both of these colleagues are exceptionally productive and hardworking — but the ways in which they achieve productivity look vastly different.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As HubSpot's Marketing Blog Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lestraundra-a-82930413/\"><span>Lestraundra Alfred</span></a> told me, \"The past two years have been challenging for many people, and what we considered 'productive' pre-2020 just isn't relevant. I've learned 'productivity' is relative to the employee.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iLLVXuvxWTAB7N2xtEmm9696TzhNW-VlWCpiLdF7G9GdNPgY1RuMJnShHf6EdcN5u-fr_vHEF-zB23p0GYIxZ30RQ9tdOVmDxQy9PT8BTkML5iJAkJE3swkml_zs8L6CQBDEuMp5=s0\" width=\"665\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 665px;\"></p> \n<p>She adds, \"Everyone has a different style and workflow that changes depending on what they're working on, the social climate, and personal matters they may be going through.\"</p> \n<p>So … what's the solution here?</p> \n<p>Alfred says, \"Learning to support my team's productivity levels based on where they're at and how they work —&nbsp; not my definition of productivity — has helped build trust and accountability.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, as a manager, it's vital you trust your employees enough to give them the autonomy to choose where, when, and how they're most productive.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's critical you take the time to assess whether your team's productivity levels compared to 2020 are actually a real concern here.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, as Eonta pointed out, your team threw themselves into work in unsustainable ways in 2020 to avoid the harsh realities of a pandemic — and are simply re-calibrating back to a workflow that is more conducive to long-term professional and personal success.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternatively, maybe the pandemic put work-life balance into perspective for your employees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, it's vital you take the time as a leader to discover the root cause of your employees productivity levels if you feel they're performing below expectations, but keep in mind they're people, too — and 2021, just like 2020, was anything but normal.</p> \n<p>If you focus on building trust and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychological-safety-according-to-edmondson\">psychological safety</a> with your team, you'll be able to figure out long-term solutions to performance and productivity together.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3d8890a4-b446-496e-b60f-a8a7ee44ae85&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

People search Zillow, Apartments.com, Redfin, and local real estate websites.</p> \n<p>Additionally, people also turn to the internet when they want to value their home or learn more about the real estate market.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>All this to say that when it's time to generate leads in the real estate industry, posting online and creating a landing page is the first step.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll discuss how to create a landing page for real estate and review sample real estate landing pages to inspire your own.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5f39ea20-9313-42f4-b9c7-86b8b59e717a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Resource: Real Estate Strategy Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f39ea20-9313-42f4-b9c7-86b8b59e717a.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Choose the type of landing page you need.</h3> \n<p>Before you can get started, it's important to understand the different types of real estate landing pages.</p> \n<p>The three main types include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Home valuation:</strong> This type of landing page lets users type in their address and get a quick idea of how much their home is worth.</li> \n <li><strong>Buying/selling websites:</strong> These websites are where buyers and sellers go to place listings online, including Zillow or Redfin.</li> \n <li><strong>Free content:</strong> This landing page is usually targeted toward those who want to start working in the real estate industry <em>or</em> are in the beginning stages of buying/selling. You can place free content on a landing page to get leads to download the offer so when the time comes to buy or sell, they think of you.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Depending on the type of landing page you need, the process and design will be a little different.</p> \n<h3>2. Use a simple lead capture form and search function.</h3> \n<p>When creating a landing page for real estate, the goal is to gain leads through a lead capture form asking for information (whether it be a name, email, or phone number). The first step to doing this is to have simple search functionality that is front and center in your design for home buying/selling or home valuation.</p> \n<p>If you're creating a landing page for free content, you won't need a search function, but you will need a lead capture form that is simple and easy to use (this should also be a large part of your design that is easy to see).</p> \n<p>The simplicity of the search function or lead capture form will make your call to action (CTA) stand out and get people searching through your site.</p> \n<p>With Zillow, the home page has a simple search function so homebuyers can search for houses in a certain area. This keeps the site clean and it gets straight to the point -- no distractions.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"real estate landing pages: zillow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Create%20Landing%20Pages%20for%20Real%20Estate%20%5B+Examples%5D-3.png?width=624&amp;height=216&amp;name=How%20to%20Create%20Landing%20Pages%20for%20Real%20Estate%20%5B+Examples%5D-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"216\"></p> \n<h3>3. Always pay attention to curb appeal.</h3> \n<p>Everyone knows that curb appeal is important when it comes to buying or selling a home. The same holds true for your landing page. Use clear, crisp imagery that inspires home buyers to imagine their new life in the house you're selling. When this happens, buyers are more likely to convert.</p> \n<p>The visual design of your landing page is even more important than most landing pages. If people don't like the design of the landing page, they might not even like the house because they can't see past the poor web design.</p> \n<h3>4. Write honest copy.</h3> \n<p>The copy you write for each house should be honest. You'll want to include detailed information and use descriptive adjectives that will paint a picture for prospective buyers. But don't embellish.</p> \n<p>When people start visiting your house they'll see what's true and what isn't. If you aren't being honest in your copy, then people won't want to work with you because they can't trust you. You should use short copy that's punchy and to the point.</p> \n<p>Buying or selling a home is a major financial and life decision. Trust is of the utmost importance between you and your prospective leads.</p> \n<h3>5. Include testimonials.</h3> \n<p>Although most home buying efforts begin online, most people hire real estate agents through referrals. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.refermeiq.com/resources/real-estate-statistics-you-must-know/\">42% of sellers</a> who use real estate agents find these agents through referrals and <a href=\"https://www.refermeiq.com/resources/real-estate-statistics-you-must-know/\">82% of all real estate transactions</a> come from referrals. This means that customer testimonials and reviews are very important. On your landing page, include testimonials so visitors know they can trust you.</p> \n<p>It's a particularly good idea to place testimonials near your CTA, so it motivates people to click on your form.</p> \n<p>You can also place badges or awards on your landing pages to instill a sense of professionalism and credibility.</p> \n<h3>6. Highlight the benefits of your offer.</h3> \n<p>Depending on the type of landing page, you might need to highlight the benefit of your content offer. For example, if you have a home valuation calculator, it's important to write copy that emphasizes why this will give a seller more power in the process. Or if you're giving away a free checklist or ebook, explain how it helps people in the process of buying or selling.</p> \n<p>This is how you'll communicate your value with your leads, which will inspire them to convert.</p> \n<h3>7. Be personal.</h3> \n<p>The intent of your landing page is important. Your landing page will look different if it's a home valuation, buying/selling, or content offer page. The point of creating a landing page is to create a personal experience for those interested in certain offers.</p> \n<p>That's why landing pages are different from your everyday website. These pages keep customers focused on going down the path they want: searching for a home, getting in contact with an agent, etc.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the design of your landing page should be personalized to the experience of the viewer. This means that your page should be optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences. You might also have an app that will help your visitors come back anytime they're looking for a home.</p> \n<h2>Best Real Estate Landing Pages</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/what-is-my-home-worth\">Redfin Home Valuation Landing Page</a></h3> \n<p>Talk about a simple landing page. This is a no-fuss home valuation landing page that lets visitors get a real-time estimate of how much their home is worth.</p> \n<p>This landing page is a good example of being simple, using short, punchy text and engaging graphics to draw attention to the simple CTA of entering a home address.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"real estate landing pages: redfin\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Create%20Landing%20Pages%20for%20Real%20Estate%20%5B+Examples%5D.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20to%20Create%20Landing%20Pages%20for%20Real%20Estate%20%5B+Examples%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://hillrealtygrp.com/\">Hill Realty Group</a></h3> \n<p>This is a great example of a realty group's home search landing page.

Then, it includes a simple property search where you can include your location, bed and bath requirements, etc.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"real estate landing pages: hill realty group\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Create%20Landing%20Pages%20for%20Real%20Estate%20%5B+Examples%5D-2.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20to%20Create%20Landing%20Pages%20for%20Real%20Estate%20%5B+Examples%5D-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://www.localgirlguide.com/\">The H. Williams Group</a></h3> \n<p>This is a sample real estate landing page with a content offer. This realtor has a simple lead capture form enticing visitors to download her guide to Alexandria. This is a great content offer because people looking for a guide to the area are most likely going to move there and may contact her to be their realtor.</p> \n<p>Additionally, this page is great because all the focus is on the simple capture form.

Regardless of your goals, these are the essential elements that your subject line should possess:</p> \n<h3>1. Urgency</h3> \n<p>Creating a sense of urgency is an efficient way to get people to take action. You can create a similar effect in your subject lines strategically.</p> \n<p>By communicating a known start and end date to a special sale or promotion, viewers scrolling through their inbox will click to see what they can get in that window of time. This is also a good practice when done in a small series of emails counting down the window of opportunity — as long as you’re not flooding their inbox and coming off spammy.</p> \n<h3>2. Curiosity</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, subject lines work because of their ability to send the message, \"You will benefit from opening this email.\" But other times, it's good to maintain some sense of mystery — especially if it pique's the recipient's natural curiosity and interest. Because they require opening the email to get more information, they can result in, well, a higher open rate. But make sure the subject line, while enigmatic, still aligns with your brand. Too obscure, and it could end up being seen as spam.</p> \n<h3>3. Offers</h3> \n<p>Here's where that benefit of opening a given email comes in. At the end of the day, people love new things and experiences — especially when they’re free, or at least discounted. Open with that by including it in your subject line. Personally, I'm much more inclined to open my daily newsletters when there's an offer or allusion for \"free stuff\" directly mentioned in my inbox.</p> \n<h3>4. Personalization</h3> \n<p>No two email subscribers are the same — and, sometimes, that means the emails you send to them shouldn't be, either. At this point, marketers have never had more ways to learn about their subscribers' preferences, jobs, or general (dis)likes. So when you send them content, on occasion, make it catered toward the individual.</p> \n<h3>5. Relevance and Timeliness</h3> \n<p>When we subscribe to an email list, it's usually because we want to be kept informed, or at least learn more about a given topic (more on that later). Similar to piquing your audience's curiosity, crafting email subject lines that incorporate trending topics or timely headlines can help you establish your brand as an authority within your industry — and can compel people to click to read.</p> \n<h3>6. Name Recognition</h3> \n<p>Let's face it: We all have famous people who, at some point, we presently or previously have admired. And when you understand your audience's preferences and interests, you can pique their interest by including the names of these admired, recognizable individuals by including them in your content — and mentioning them in your email subject lines. But take heed: This tactic really only works when it aligns with your brand, product, or service. So keep it relevant, rather than just throwing out a name for the sake of recognition.</p> \n<h3>7. Cool Stories</h3> \n<p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, here's another place where curiosity comes into play. By front-loading your email subject line with a compelling allusion to a story — but can only be read if opened or clicked — your audience is likely to become intrigued, and want to learn more. Again, make sure the story is relevant to your brand. Otherwise, it might just confuse your readers and prevent them from opening the email.</p> \n<p>Now that you know the fundamentals, let’s dive into email subject line best practices.</p> \n<h2>Email Subject Line Best Practices</h2> \n<h3>1. Learn from successful email subject line examples.</h3> \n<p>Whenever we're scratching our heads wondering what to make our subject line, we often look to examples for inspiration. Seeing clever use of wordplay or emojis on one of our favorite newsletters can help us think of new ways to approach our subject line.</p> \n<p>To help you do the same, we've compiled a list of 100 email subject lines from real businesses. We hope you'll be just as inspired.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/email-subject-lines?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img alt=\"email subject lines examples\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-3.png?width=387&amp;name=20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"387\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 387px;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/email-subject-lines?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download the Free Email Subject Lines Examples Guide</a></p> \n<h3>2. Keep it short and sweet.</h3> \n<p>Email subject lines will get cut off if they're too long, particularly on mobile devices. And with up to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats?__hstc=200701681.08ac1cb1ea51df337b2af750beceb4f1.1631049039709.1631049039709.1631049039709.1&amp;__hssc=200701681.1.1631049039710&amp;__hsfp=988172843\">46% of email opens</a> taking place on mobile, we recommend using subject lines with fewer than 50 characters to make sure the people scanning your emails read the entire message.</p> \n<p>If you're struggling to keep your subject lines short, think about which words matter less and where you can remove a frivolous detail. For example, if you're sending an order confirmation, doesn't “Your order is being processed” look better than “Order #9435893458358 is being processed\"?</p> \n<p>The same goes for your regular emails: Don't waste your time including the word \"update\" or \"newsletter\" in the subject line. Some studies even suggest these words can decrease the message's open rate since it tells readers the email is associated with a series, and therefore they can catch the next one.</p> \n<h3>3. Use a familiar sender name.</h3> \n<p>That name recognition we mentioned earlier doesn't just apply to the famous — it applies to the familiar. When setting your sender name, be as human as you can. Olivia@yourcompany.com is both inviting and unintimidating to people when they open their inboxes.</p> \n<p>If you've already met your recipients from a previous conversation, use your own name as the sender's address — even if the email is technically coming from the company as a whole. The best impression you can make on your customers is that they're working with you, the individual — not the entire business.</p> \n<p>\"If the 'from' name doesn't sound like it's from someone you want to hear from, it doesn't matter what the subject line is,\" explains <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Copy Hacker</span>'s<a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-write-captivating-email-subject-lines\"> </a><a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-write-captivating-email-subject-lines\">Joanna Wiebe</a>. Ultimately, people are busy, and they simply don't bother with you if you don't sound like someone who would make for an easy (or at least friendly) conversation.</p> \n<h3>4. Avoid the 'no-reply' sender name.</h3> \n<p>Thanks to the amount of spam people get these days, most people hesitate to open emails from unfamiliar senders. And, even fewer people like talking to a robot. Think about when you call a company and can't get a hold of an actual person. It's frustrating, right? This goes for email, as well.</p> \n<p>Never use \"noreply@company.com.\" I repeat: <em>Never</em> use this email address. Not only does it make it look less personable, but it also stops people from adding your email to their address book.</p> \n<p>Instead, avoid using a generic email address and send the email from a real person. For instance,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31634/A-B-Testing-in-Action-3-Real-Life-Marketing-Experiments.aspx\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31634/A-B-Testing-in-Action-3-Real-Life-Marketing-Experiments.aspx\">we once found that</a> emails sent from \"Maggie Georgieva, HubSpot\" performed better in terms of opens and click-through rate than emails sent from just \"HubSpot.\" (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">HubSpot customers</span>: Learn how to personalize the \"From\" name and email address<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/how-do-i-personalize-the-from-name-and-address-in-an-email\"> </a><a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/how-do-i-personalize-the-from-name-and-address-in-an-email\">here</a>.)</p> \n<h3>5. Use personalization tokens.</h3> \n<p>Remember the personalization we mentioned earlier? Using personalization tokens — like name or location — in the subject line adds a feeling of rapport, especially when it's a name. Everyone loves the sound of their own name. Plus, it increases clickthrough rate: In fact, research has shown that emails that included the first name of the recipient in their subject line had<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/science-of-email-marketing-2014-report\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/science-of-email-marketing-2014-report\">higher click-through rates</a> than emails that did not.</p> \n<p>One example of how brands affix this information to subject lines is the dog-walking company, Wag! who does this with dog names. Here's one such email that a HubSpot writer received:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Email newsletter by Wag dog-walking service with pet name in the subject line\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-1.png?width=624&amp;name=20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>That's great personalization and great timing.</p> \n<p>Another personalization tactic that works is to tailor subject lines to the recipient's location — things like lists of their respective cities' best outdoor bars and restaurants.</p> \n<p>Just don't go overboard with the personalization here. That can be a little creepy. But little personalized touches show that you know more about your recipients than just their email address. However, if you can't (or don't want to) use personalization tokens in the subject line, use \"you\" or \"your\" so it still sounds like you're addressing them directly.</p> \n<h3>6. Segment your lists.</h3> \n<p>While email blasts that go out to your entire list might be relevant and helpful to some people, it won't be to others — and could cause confusion or frustration. Why is this restaurant sending me a list of the best local steakhouses when I'm a vegetarian? Why is this company sending me case studies when I just signed up for its email list yesterday?</p> \n<p>Personalize the experience using information from the actions your customers have already taken — from which forms they've filled out, to which industries they're in, to what their personal preferences are. In<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a>, you can personalize your recipients' experience using a little thing called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33083/27-Ways-to-Slice-Dice-Your-Email-List-for-Better-Segmentation.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">list segmentation</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Don't make false promises.</h3> \n<p>Your email subject line is making a promise to your reader about what you will deliver in your message. Make sure that you make good on that commitment — and do not try to get your email opened by making false promises. This will irk your audience, and they'll learn not to trust your subject lines, resulting in a lower open rate and a higher unsubscribe rate.</p> \n<h3>8. Do tell them what's inside.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of making promises, if your visitor has downloaded an offer and you're delivering it via email, it's a great idea to use a subject line that says something like, “Your new ebook inside!” or, “Your guide awaits!” This works better than a simple “thank you” in the subject line because it makes it clear that something is waiting inside the email.</p> \n<h3>9. Time it right.</h3> \n<p>Sending an email at the<em> right </em>time with the <em>right</em> subject line can make a huge difference in open and click-through rate. A prime example? When food publication Eater sends at 6:45 P.M. on a Wednesday evening that said, \"Where to Drink Beer Right Now\" — just in time for happy hour. Nailed it.</p> \n<p>Another favorite example is a classic email from Warby Parker with the subject line, \"Uh-oh, your prescription is expiring.\" It was sent two weeks before the recipient needed to renew his prescription. By sending an email at the right time, Warby Parker increased the chances of their email getting opened — and included a relevant call-to-action about getting a glasses upgrade, too.</p> \n<h3>10. Use concise language.</h3> \n<p>Keep in mind that people scan their inboxes very quickly — so the more clear and concise your subject line is, the better. It's usually a lot better to be concise than it is to use complex and flowery language — unless you're going for an elusive subject tone to entice your recipients.</p> \n<p>When you're going for a concise subject line, think about how your email will benefit your recipients. You'll want to make that benefit very clear. For example, \"Increase your open rates by 50% today” is more appealing than \"How to increase open rates.\"</p> \n<h3>11. Start with action-oriented verbs.</h3> \n<p>Subject lines are similar to calls-to-action, in that you want the language to inspire people to click. Subject lines that begin with action verbs tend to be a lot more enticing, and your emails could be drastically more clickable by adding a vibrant verb at the beginning.</p> \n<p>Actionable subject lines will inspire people to click on your email by instilling urgency and excitement. For example, in an email inviting people to a hockey legend dinner, the email subject line might read, “Dine with Bruins legend Bobby Orr,” rather than a more generic (and less actionable) “Local Boston Sports Legend Meal.\" The former email uses “Dine” to help the reader envision themselves at a dinner table.</p> \n<h3>12. Make people feel special.</h3> \n<p>The psychology of exclusivity is a powerful thing. When people feel like they're on the inside, it gives them a sense of belonging which builds loyalty and compels them to convert on your emails.</p> \n<p>The right phrasing can make your recipients feel special — and the effect can be magical. A few ideas for phrasing include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>\"For our beloved customers only\"</li> \n <li>\"An exclusive offer for you\"</li> \n <li>\"My gift to you\"</li> \n <li>\"You're invited!\"</li> \n <li>\"Private invite\"</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>13. Create a sense of importance.</h3> \n<p>There's a phrase that, for many of us, is reminiscent of classic infomercials: \"Act now!\"</p> \n<p>And while we wouldn't encourage using that exact language in your content, we do agree that communicating urgency and scarcity in an email subject line can help compel readers to click (or act) — when phrased creatively and strategically.</p> \n<p>But because you don't want to be known as \"the brand that cried wolf,\" use these subject lines sparingly, and try to limit them to when the occasion genuinely calls for immediate action.</p> \n<h3>14. Use numbers.</h3> \n<p>A lot of businesses send emails with vague statements in their subject lines — which is why using data and numbers is a great way to get your emails noticed, demonstrate a clear and straightforward message about your offer, and set the right expectations.</p> \n<p>Just like with blog titles, using numbers in your subject line is an effective email marketing best practice. You might use numbers to refer to the title of your listicle, the page length of an offer, a specific discount, or the numerical benefit of a particular resource you're providing — like \"Join more than 750 others at this event!\"</p> \n<h3>15. Pose a compelling question.</h3> \n<p>Asking a question in your subject line can also draw readers in — especially if you're asking a question you know is relevant to your recipients' buyer persona. This is just one way to pique that curiosity we mentioned earlier. For example, you might try the following: “Are you making these SEO mistakes?” or “Do you know what your website is doing wrong?\"</p> \n<p>Zillow once sent an email with the subject line, \"What Can You Afford?\" that linked to a website showing apartments for rent. A subject line like this is both encouraging and a touch competitive: While it gives hope that there are apartments out there that'll fit within your budget, it also pits your cash against what the market offers.</p> \n<p>Another example comes from DocuSign. It sent an email late in the lead nurturing process, with the subject line, \"What are your customers saying?\" The body of the email contained<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ultimate-case-study-creation-kit\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ultimate-case-study-creation-kit\">a bunch of case studies</a> that were meant to help the recipient move closer to actually purchasing DocuSign. This was a smart move: Folks who are further down the funnel are likely more receptive to hearing customer testimonials.</p> \n<h3>16. Don't be afraid to get punny.</h3> \n<p>Most people love a good pun. It's a great way to delight your recipients and spice up your emails. Some of the best punny email subject lines come from JetBlue, with subject lines like \"Land wander-ful low fares now!\"</p> \n<p>Quirky — a community-led invention platform — worded one of its email subject lines like this: \"Abra-cord-abra! Yeah, we said it.\" That second part is conversational and self-referential — and exactly what most people would say after making a really cheesy joke in real life.</p> \n<p>If you're the least bit punny, think about small ways you can slip them into your emails when it's appropriate. Just don't overdo it. And remember the rule: When in doubt, ask a coworker.</p> \n<h3>17. DON'T USE ALL CAPS or overuse exclamation points!!!</h3> \n<p>A subject line that says, “OPEN NOW AND RECEIVE A FREE TRIAL” or, \"50% off coupon today only!!!!!!!!\" isn't going to get your email opened. If anything, it'll probably get your email ignored.</p> \n<p>Why? People don't like to be yelled at, and using all caps and/or a lot of exclamation points can rub people the wrong way.</p> \n<p>Not only are these tactics disruptive, but they look spammy. So instead of using disruptive tactics like these to stand out in people's inboxes, try personalizing your emails, establishing relevance, and using catchy and delightful language.</p> \n<h3>18. Don't include a question and exclamation in the same subject line.</h3> \n<p>Here's a subject line that can automatically wind up in a recipient's spam folder: <em>\"Want a solution fast? Act now!\"</em></p> \n<p>The fast solution isn't the problem in the example above. It's also not “act now” — although those are known email marketing spam words. It's both phrases together. This is a classic email saboteur, and it comes in many forms. All you need is to ask and yell at the same time.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes webservers flag emails as spam if they contain both a question mark and an exclamation mark in the subject line. The example above is a common one. A good solution? Don't do that!</p> \n<p>Not only is this format overdone, but it's alienating to your audience. Open-ended questions are a show of ignorance; any good marketer knows their leads better than that.</p> \n<h3>19. Use engaging preview text.</h3> \n<p>While preview text isn't technically part of your subject line, it does appear right near the subject line — and it certainly deserves your attention.</p> \n<p>Preview text provides recipients with a peek at the content inside your email, which email clients like the iPhone Mail app, Gmail, and Outlook will display alongside the subject line. (The exact amount of text shown depends on the email client and user settings.)</p> \n<p><img alt=\"email preview text in inbox\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-2.png?width=624&amp;name=20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>When you don't set the preview text yourself, the email client will automatically pull from the body of your email. That can look messy depending on your email content, and it's also a wasted opportunity to engage your audience.

A/B test your subject lines.</h3> \n<p>Although these tips and best practices are a great place to start, what works best for some companies may not work as well for others. It's all about figuring out what works best for your specific audience. That's where <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing\">A/B testing</a> comes in.</p> \n<p>While it can be tempting to use your intuition to predict what subject line language will make people click on your emails, you should always A/B test your highest-stakes subject lines, and tweak the wording according to your results. What works best for your audience: Long or short subject lines? Including numbers or not including numbers? Questions or statements? (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">HubSpot customers</span>: Learn how to A/B test emails in HubSpot<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\"> </a><a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\">here</a>.)</p> \n<p>Now that we’ve gone through our best practices, let’s review the steps to creating good email subject lines.</p> \n<h2>How to Write Good Email Subject Lines</h2> \n<h3>Step 1: Identify the purpose of the email.</h3> \n<p>Why is the email being sent and how does that inform the subject line? Identify the true purpose or intention of the email and use that as the foundation to build upon when brainstorming your subject line idea.</p> \n<h3>Step 2: Determine the call to action.</h3> \n<p>What will make the user click on the email? A discount? Something free? Important information? What is enticing enough to make them want to see or learn more about your offer? Having a call to action with an incentive yet to be seen is tempting.</p> \n<h3>Step 3: Draft multiple subject lines.</h3> \n<p>Write similar subject lines that use varying words and tones. You want to have a few ideas to choose from, so you’re not stuck stewing over the same sentence for long.</p> \n<h3>Step 4: Get feedback.</h3> \n<p>Have colleagues review the subject lines to give their feedback on which they preferred. Having a second opinion can help you see it from a different perspective.</p> \n<h3>Step 5: Test your subject line.</h3> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, perform an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing\">A/B test</a> to see which subject line performs best. After you’ve conducted the test, take the most effective email subject line and use it in your upcoming email marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>Now that we’ve gone through the steps to create a good subject line, let’s examine some effective examples.</p> \n<h2>Examples of Catchy Email Subject Lines</h2> \n<p>To give you some added inspiration, here's a quick list of the most intriguing subject lines we've seen recently.</p> \n<h3>EF Tours: “👻 Trip or Treat!”</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"examples of catchy email subject lines: EF Tours\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Sep-13-2021-10-48-05-88-PM.png?width=636&amp;name=20%20Tips%20to%20Write%20Catchy%20Email%20Subject%20Lines%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Sep-13-2021-10-48-05-88-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"636\" style=\"width: 636px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This subject line from EF Tours has tasteful use of a quirky emoji, coupled with a sense of urgency from a time-bound sale.

Instead, becoming a startup is the moment when ideas begin to grow into something actionable, driven by a collection of intentional goals.</p> \n<p>And as all of us who have lived the startup life know — when you're a startup, more often than not your goal is simple: to survive.</p> \n<p>I like to think of being a startup as treading water. Succeeding as a startup requires constant motion to ensure you can find product-market-fit, drive early customer growth, and build a baseline product all at the same time. The moment you stop moving is the moment you lose traction.</p> \n<p>And this is all before you've even begun to scale.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there comes a point where you've treaded water long enough to reach your first lifeboat: Investments.</p> \n<p>That's where it gets exciting.</p> \n<p>As startups move from idea mode to scaleup mode, there are a number of signs I look for in order to determine if I'm going to invest. Of course, not every scaleup has to get every one of these signs right to be worthy of investment, but the more positive signals a scaleup has to offer, the higher the odds of long-term success for that organization.</p> \n<p>So, what <em>is</em>&nbsp;the secret sauce that these special startups have?</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=38d93e33-110d-4097-bb9f-3a38329eae3a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Access Free Resources to Help Your Company Scale\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/38d93e33-110d-4097-bb9f-3a38329eae3a.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">7 Signs that a Scaling Company is Worth the Investment</h2> \n<p>While scaling is a universal concept, the act of scaling efficiently rarely looks exactly the same for all companies.</p> \n<p>Instead, each scale-up encounters their own unique trials, speed bumps, and roadblocks on the path to sustainable growth. When I am looking for scaling companies to invest in, I always take into account the individual circumstances of each company in the context of their growth to see whether or not they have set themselves up for long-term success.</p> \n<p>As an investor, these are the core values I've seen that have proven to be present at companies with growth potential.</p> \n<h3>1. There's evidence of customer happiness.</h3> \n<p>The customer experience doesn't lie. In fact, it's become a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-sales-and-customer-experience-australia\">key part of GTM strategies</a>&nbsp;at companies like HubSpot, which are investing in Chief Customer Officers and finding more ways to serve the customer across the organization. That's all to say — the customer should be at the center of every decision.</p> \n<p>For evidence of customer happiness, take a look at the NPS (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-nps\">Net Promoter Score</a>) and other customer satisfaction scores of the company in question. If the results are in the green, you're looking at a scale-up that is already making a positive impact on their customers. If instead the results are in the red, investors take warning.</p> \n<p>Another way to determine customer happiness is to look for low or decreasing churn. A company's retention rates are the first sign that they are either a fan favorite, or a stepping stone that customers take on their way to a more prepared company.</p> \n<h3>2. The organization's primary roles have great people.</h3> \n<p>In the early years of a startup — when the primary focus is on the product — other roles like sales, marketing, and operations aren't typically fully staffed. However, this practice doesn't cut it when it comes to scaling.</p> \n<p>When you're a scale-up, these roles should be filled with amazing people. If not, there should at least be a plan in place to hire them.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>After all, the potential of a scale-up lies in the potential of the people who are dedicated to its growth.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Without staffing all of the necessary teams with top talent, you could be unknowingly stunting your company's growth. In the early days at HubSpot, Brian and I surrounded ourselves with people who were smarter than us, and invested in people we believed in. (Somehow they weren't all developers, like I requested … but I digress …). Those investments paid off, big time, and we're still surrounded by those people today.</p> \n<h3>3. Unit economics are stable and sustainable.</h3> \n<p>Of course, no one expects scale-ups to already come with an impressive ROI. A vanity metric or single data point isn't exactly enough to convince an investor that your scale-up is worth their time and money. Instead, what I look for is stability and sustainability.</p> \n<p>To be primed for viable growth, your customer lifetime value should be some multiple (usually 3+) of your customer acquisition cost. What this number will tell me is that your company is not only desirable by your customers, but that you already have what it takes to retain them and continue&nbsp;to gain value from them as they grow with you over time.</p> \n<p>Scalability and sustainability are two sides of the same coin. With the ability to establish sustainable <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/ecommerce/ecommerce-marketing-metric-youre-not-tracking\">unit economics</a>&nbsp;early on in your lifespan of startup-hood, you'll be primed to scale when the time comes.</p> \n<h3>4. The culture of the organization is well-articulated.</h3> \n<p>Company culture is not something that appears overnight. Instead, it's embedded in every decision your company makes and in the people who work at your organization. Every organization has their own specific company culture, but some are better at articulating theirs than others.</p> \n<p>Company culture encompasses your mission, vision, and values and is the mark of a company with what speaker and author <a href=\"https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/\">Angela Duckworth</a>&nbsp;has coined as \"grit.\" <a href=\"https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/\">Grit</a>&nbsp;is \"the power of passion and perseverance,\" which translates nicely to what makes startups successful — having a clearly defined passion, and the perseverance to achieve the long-term vision.</p> \n<p>Of course, to be effective, your company culture doesn't need to be composed in a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx\">slide deck with 128 slides</a>,&nbsp;but it <em>should</em> be written down. This way, when potential investors like myself take a look at your scale-up, we won't have to spend our time guessing the motives and shared vision that drives your organization. Instead, we will be able to see how your culture guides decision-making across your organization.</p> \n<p>It's a good idea to begin defining your culture sooner rather than later. Company culture provides a stable jumping-off point for most of your initiatives, including recruitment, retention, and alignment. The greater understanding you have of your culture, the more efficiently you'll be able to create a shared vision for your organization.</p> \n<p>If your company culture could use a tune-up, take a look at HubSpot's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-culture\">Ultimate Guide to Company Culture</a>.</p> \n<h3>5. There's a strong focus on creating customer value.</h3> \n<p>There's a reason why I'm so intent on investing in companies who keep a close eye on their customer value. By continuously integrating customer feedback and preferences into your scale-up, you'll be more prepared to <em>proactively</em>&nbsp;create customer value, as opposed to operating in a purely reactive state.</p> \n<p>The companies that succeed today are no longer those that just delight their customers sometimes, but rather those that consistently find ways to exceed expectations and create a personalized experience.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the best way to maintain a strong focus on creating customer value is to open up a line of dialogue between yourself and your customers. If you haven't yet, take this as a sign to begin establishing your means of gathering customer input.</p> \n<p>Start by asking yourself questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How is your team getting customer input and acting on it?</li> \n <li>Beyond customer support, who else is focused on the customer?</li> \n <li>Is there a customer success team?</li> \n <li>Have you defined the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/voice-of-the-customer\">voice of your customers</a>?</li> \n <li>How is your customer involved or represented in your business' decision-making?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. The company has a strong strategic planning process, and knows how to determine product priorities.</h3> \n<p>Remember what I said earlier about the importance of creating sustainable systems? The important thing isn't that the planning process works seamlessly and is already primed to scale.</p> \n<p>The emphasis is on the fact that there <em>is </em>a process and mechanism in place for making these decisions at all.</p> \n<p>Trust me: A disorganized planning and priority-setting process makes it impossible to scale.</p> \n<p>The process of scaling is all about proactively setting your company up for future successes. When you have a clearly defined planning process, you're communicating to any potential investors that you are looking to the future and priming to scale.</p> \n<p>As an aside, while you're evaluating your processes, take a look at your systems. Are they built for scaling organizations? Will it be easy to upgrade when you're ready?</p> \n<h3>7. The organization has an engaged workforce.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Last, but certainly not least, the final sign that a company is scaling sustainably and worth investing in is the satisfaction of their employees.</p> \n<p>An unhappy workforce is a red flag (for new hires and investors alike). Not only should a company have a process for regularly collecting employee feedback, but they should also have a proven record of responding to and acting on the results of the feedback they collect.</p> \n<p>A handful of disengaged or unsatisfied employees is typical, but a collection of them becomes a trend to be prevented at all costs. If you experience high turnover rates, you'll want to fix that quickly — it's impossible to scale without investing in the long-term growth and development of your employees.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we have an eNPS (employee NPS) survey that we conduct every quarter for all employees. This way, we are consistently in tune with their needs and preferences, so we can provide employees with the supportive work environment they deserve. We read and evaluate every comment and are constantly looking for ways to improve our employees' experience.</p> \n<p>To begin conducting comprehensive employee surveys of your own, here is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/enps\">Everything You Need to Know About eNPS</a>.</p> \n<p>And there you have it! The secret sauce I've noticed in startups with real potential to scale, and what they did to stand out.</p> \n<p>Whether I am actively looking for new companies to invest in or not, I always have my antenna up to notice exciting new scale-ups.

But what does this mean, and how do you know when you’re on the right track?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Funnel reporting is key to understanding the inner workings of your business. With a detailed funnel report, you can see where customers are at every stage of the sales process. The funnel report can show how many leads you are generating, what deals are being negotiated, what contracts are being finalized, and, ultimately, how many sales are going through.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0d883e85-c2e5-49bb-bef2-bfddb500d84b&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Free Download: Free Marketing Reporting Templates [Access Now]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0d883e85-c2e5-49bb-bef2-bfddb500d84b.png\"></a></p> \n<p>Knowing your funnel at all times can help ensure that funnel doesn’t dry up, leaving you without leads or consistent sales. So, let’s dive into what exactly funnel reporting is and how to create a funnel report.</p> \n<h2>What is funnel reporting?</h2> \n<p>Before you understand funnel reporting, you need to understand the funnel. The funnel is essential to mapping out the customers’ journey to purchasing, from brand awareness all the way through to a sale. Keeping a funnel full of ongoing leads is important to a thriving business.</p> \n<p>As such, a funnel report can give insight as to how a customer discovers your brand and what leads them to either flow through the funnel all the way to purchase or drop off somewhere along the way.</p> \n<p>The funnel report can determine how effective your marketing efforts are, the number of people coming into the funnel, and conversion rates. This report can also provide insight into ongoing lead generation and sales, so you can see just how many leads you are generating and how many are in the process of signing contracts or making purchases.</p> \n<h3>1. Awareness</h3> \n<p>As the customer first enters your funnel, it’ll be through awareness. There are many ways a potential customer can first hear about your brand, whether they hear about your product through word of mouth, see an ad on Instagram, or pass your billboard while driving to work.</p> \n<h3>2. Interest</h3> \n<p>Once the customer has found your brand, if they like what they see, they’ll likely start doing some digging. Reading reviews, checking out your FAQ section, and comparing you to competitors are all likely to happen in this stage.</p> \n<h3>3. Decision</h3> \n<p>Now, the potential customer will start really considering making a purchase. They might consult with a sales rep or ask for pricing quotes.</p> \n<h3>4. Action</h3> \n<p>As the customer moves through the funnel, they will use the information gathered from the previous steps to decide whether or not to make a purchase. That’s why investing in excellent branding, marketing, and customer service is so important, as they will each leave an impact throughout the funnel process and can ultimately be a make-it-or-break-it situation for potential clients.</p> \n<p>Ready to start reporting? Here’s how to create a funnel report. These reports can typically be generated through tools like Google Analytics. To make it easier, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/reporting-dashboards\"><span>consider Dashboard &amp; Reporting Software</span></a>, which will house all your analytics, reports, and dashboards in one easy-to-navigate space.</p> \n<h3>1. Input Data</h3> \n<p>First and foremost, you’ll need to input data, from the number of customers clicking on your website link to the number of sales that go through and everything in between. This is something that can be automated and pulled for you through Google Analytics or HubSpot. You’ll set the number of building blocks to differentiate the different stages as well.</p> \n<h3>2. Filter</h3> \n<p>Next, you can filter out data you don’t need. The platform you use to create your funnel report will offer basic and/or customizable filter options.</p> \n<h3>3. Organize into Groups</h3> \n<p>To better analyze the report, you can organize the funnel by different marketing methods or products being sold. For example, you might create a funnel breakdown that separates the types of marketing used.</p> \n<h3>4. Visualize</h3> \n<p>Now, the platform will display the funnel report based on your filters and breakdowns. You’ll be able to see how many people found your website, then compare it to say, how many people made an inquiry, signed up for your newsletter, and/or purchased your products or services.</p> \n<h3>5. Note Strengths and Weaknesses</h3> \n<p>With your funnel in front of you, note conversions. See where customers are dropping off and where they are coming from. Your funnel report might show a lot of people coming in from social, despite most of your efforts being on email marketing, where less people are converting into sales. Noting your observations can help you adjust your future marketing strategies.</p> \n<h3>1. Next-Step Conversions</h3> \n<p>One of the simpler funnel reports is for next-step conversions. This funnel report will show the conversion rates between steps. So if you have 500 people see your social media ad, and 100 click through to your website, the conversion for this step is 20%.</p> \n<h3>2. Cumulative Conversions</h3> \n<p>Similarly, cumulative conversion funnel reports will also visualize conversion, but they will compare each stage’s numbers to the starting stage. This is most helpful when making comparisons to competitors or previous funnel reports.</p> \n<h3>3. Trends</h3> \n<p>A funnel trend will visualize changes in conversion rates as time goes on, for better or for worse. This can help you note what marketing strategies work and which ones don’t over time.</p> \n<h3>4. Time to Convert</h3> \n<p>How long does it take for a potential customer to make a purchase from the awareness stage to the action stage? A time-to-convert funnel will show how long it takes a customer to make it through each stage of the funnel.</p> \n<h3>5. Frequency</h3> \n<p>A frequency funnel report can help you identify what stage is most successful in drawing in customers or where customers tend to drop off.</p> \n<h2>Use Funnel Reports to Improve Marketing Strategies</h2> \n<p>A funnel report is an invaluable tool to track the progression of potential clients to customers making purchases. Knowing how clients become aware of your brand and what leads to them ultimately abandoning or making a purchase can help you sharpen your marketing skills.</p> \n<p>A funnel report will allow you to visualize the weaker parts of your marketing strategies to improve them while also spotlighting successful — sometimes surprisingly-so — components of the funnel.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3cb695d9-7dc5-4e70-8523-1e330e6bd58a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\" marketing reporting templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3cb695d9-7dc5-4e70-8523-1e330e6bd58a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffunnel-reporting&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0d883e85-c2e5-49bb-bef2-bfddb500d84b.png","linkMd5":"24c7a50481dfbf1b17ece1f0193615ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn40@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-395_2824654e826e002c.webp","destWidth":476,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":5100,"destBytes":7214,"author":"Paige Bennett","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0d883e85-c2e5-49bb-bef2-bfddb500d84b.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn40@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-395_2824654e826e002c.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3cb695d9-7dc5-4e70-8523-1e330e6bd58a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn57@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-47-219_d6970030134c53c8.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffunnel-reporting&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn81@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-47-248_3464c017b3a71aa5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741229},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"15 Time Management Skills, According to HubSpot Marketing Managers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/time-management-tips-long-term-deadlines","description":"<p>It's late and you're working on a project that's due soon.</p>  \n<p>You feel overwhelmed by your tasks and aren't quite sure how you got here.

By following the tips below, written with cross-functional teams in mind, you can be on your way to getting back control of your time and working efficiently.</p> \n<h2>What can time management skills help a person do?</h2> \n<p>Time management is necessary for a successful personal and professional life.</p> \n<p>When you manage your time well, you can be more productive and efficient. You have a solid understanding of what each task requires and you can plan accordingly.</p> \n<p>It allows you to maximize your time and perform better.</p> \n<p>Managing your time well also helps you produce high-quality work. When we struggle with this skill, we often rush to complete our tasks and can easily feel overwhelmed.</p> \n<h3>1. Learn your pattern of productivity.</h3> \n<p>Everyone has a different productivity pattern.</p> \n<p>We've long separated people into two categories: Morning people and night people. However, there are many more facets to productivity.</p> \n<p>Perhaps you're more efficient during short sprints of focus, following the Pomodoro technique. Or you might prefer knocking out your top priorities in one stretch.</p> \n<p>Find out what makes you most productive and use that to your advantage. If you notice you're most productive in the early morning, use that time to cross your focus-heavy, high-priority tasks off your to-do list.</p> \n<p>Building your work schedule around your natural patterns will make it easier for you to focus and be more efficient in your workflow.</p> \n<h3>2. Prioritize your tasks.</h3> \n<p>Name a better feeling than crossing something off a to-do list.</p> \n<p>There's something about completing a task that fills you with a sense of accomplishment and builds momentum.</p> \n<p>My colleague and marketing manager for Channel Promotions at HubSpot, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferyurikim/\">Jennifer Kim</a>, calls written to-do lists her holy grail.</p> \n<p>\"At the beginning of each day, I like to take the time to manually write out what tasks I need to complete for the day,\" she says. \"It's key for me to write out tasks manually versus typing them out because I'm able to get a better sense of what tasks will take the most time and what I need to prioritize as well as mentally get myself in the headspace to take each one on.\"</p> \n<p>She then cross-references this list with her Google Calendar to plan out her day.</p> \n<p>Now that you have every task written out, how do you decide what to tackle first? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meg-prater-she-her-a2a7b571\">Meg Prater</a>, senior manager of the Marketing, Sales, and Service blogs at HubSpot, has some advice.</p> \n<p>\"I prioritize based on impact to the business. Is there a planning meeting with our VP? The prep work for that should probably come first in my week when I'm freshest,\" she says. \"When I prioritize based on impact, I end the day knowing that I handled the tasks that were most valuable to the business and our goals – it's my North Star.\"</p> \n<p>Ranking your tasks ensures that you tackle the most important work first and can keep you from feeling overwhelmed.</p> \n<h3>3. Track your activities.</h3> \n<p>One issue many people face when managing their time is correctly assessing how long a task will take to complete.</p> \n<p>It can be hard to stick to a schedule if you over- or underestimated certain tasks. The task that was supposed to take 30 minutes took two hours and that can throw off your entire day.</p> \n<p>To avoid this slippery slope, take a week to track your activities.</p> \n<p>Write down your most common tasks. For example, as a writer, my tasks include research, media creation, and sourcing, writing, editing, uploading. I also have administrative tasks to complete throughout the week.</p> \n<p>Use a time tracking app like <a href=\"https://toggl.com/\">Toggl</a> or <a href=\"https://clockify.me/\">Clockify</a> to figure out how you are spending your time.</p> \n<p>\"Timing myself helps me to concretely see where I'm spending my time. Where are the time sucks? Am I giving myself enough time to recharge between tasks?\" says Prater. \"This allows me to be more efficient with my time allocation, and set time boundaries for tasks I'm spending too much time on.\"</p> \n<p>Once you know exactly what each task requires, you can make an accurate schedule and make adjustments to create a more efficient process.</p> \n<h3>4. Make collaborating easier.</h3> \n<p>If you work on a cross-functional team or project, it's vital that you set up tools that will make it easier for you to work together.</p> \n<p>Senior Audience Growth Manager at HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamelabump\">Pamela Bump</a>, who often works with several teams, has a few recommendations.</p> \n<p>\"If you're in a role where you must do projects for different teams, like creating ad campaigns or email promotions, set up a form that cross-functional colleagues can fill out so your requests will all go to one place and can be reviewed at the same time.\"</p> \n<p>Consolidating your requests to one place makes it easier to review and ensures nothing gets lost somewhere.</p> \n<p>Bump adds that you should notify your cross-functional teams once you've launched the form and how you would like them to use it. You can inform them via email, Slack, or even an internal blog post that can be easily bookmarked or referenced.</p> \n<h3>5. Take regular breaks.</h3> \n<p>You've created your schedule for the day. You've been working since 8 a.m., it's now 1 p.m. and you can't seem to focus.</p> \n<p>Next thing you know, it's one hour later and nothing has been accomplished.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, we try to push through slumps when all we need is a break to decompress and get re-energized.</p> \n<p>Whether it's taking a walk, watching an hour of TV, or catching up with a colleague, it's important to take some time away from your work.</p> \n<h3>6. Be flexible.</h3> \n<p>Not every day will work out exactly as planned, and that's OK.</p> \n<p>Managing your time efficiently also means leaving some room for the unplanned. Perhaps, you planned on working on task A and that's not panning out.</p> \n<p>If that's the case, don't be afraid to swap it out with another task. As long as you keep the momentum going, you can still be successful.</p> \n<p>When Bump hits a roadblock in a task, she pivots.</p> \n<p>\"I look at my to-do list and see if there are any super-quick items I can tackle before getting started on the bigger item,\" she says. \"For example, if I pause to return an email or quickly schedule a piece of content to go live, I feel energized by knocking something off my to-do list and will be more motivated to work on the bigger task.\"</p> \n<p>Having structure is important, but leave room for tasks to move around.</p> \n<h3>7. Protect your time.</h3> \n<p>Protecting your time is one of the most important ways to manage your time well. It can look like saying no, delegating, and deprioritizing a task.</p> \n<p>Saying \"no\" at work always feels like a risk, like it's sending a signal that you're not a team player. But that couldn't be further from the truth.</p> \n<p>\"Not every ask that comes your way is a fire that needs immediate extinguishing. Many things in our professional lives can wait,\" Prater says. \"Prioritizing those asks as they come in, saying 'no' when an ask isn't in scope, and realizing when something is OK to wait until tomorrow to work on has been key for me.\"</p> \n<p>Prater adds that learning to delegate has been huge for her growth.</p> \n<p>\"I used to feel like I needed to control as much as possible in my sphere – to prove myself, or some nonsense like that,\" she says. \"Now, I trust the folks around me and view delegation as an opportunity for someone else to grow and develop. It frees up more of my time and has energized folks on my team with new skills.\"</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid to redirect your colleagues when your plate is already full and lean on your colleagues for help.</p> \n<h3>8. Use project management software.</h3> \n<p>Are you bad at managing your time or do you just not have the right tools to support your workflow?</p> \n<p>With project management software like <a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\">Jira</a>, and <a href=\"https://monday.com/\">Monday.com</a>, you can streamline your workflow and make cross-team collaboration that much easier.</p> \n<p>It can also be a valuable resource when you feel overwhelmed by your tasks.</p> \n<p>\"Asana has been a huge help in organizing out my tasks. My team has an ongoing sprint board where we write out our top 3-4 priorities for the week,\" Kim says. \"In the case that if I ever find myself overwhelmed with all that's going on, I can fall back to that sprint board and center myself on where I need to spend my time.\"</p> \n<p>The great thing about these tools is that they work well for individual and group projects.</p> \n<h3>9. Establish a routine and stick to it.</h3> \n<p>Imagine taking a different route to work every day. It would be hard to be consistent about when you'd arrive at work. I also imagine this constant change would create some unease and stress.</p> \n<p>Humans are creatures of habits and we crave consistency. At work, having a routine helps you maintain productivity.</p> \n<p>Whether you're going to the office every day or working from home, set a routine for your day. Be consistent about the time you wake up and your pre-work tasks.</p> \n<p>This process will help you get in the headspace to work once you're finally at your desk. If you find that your current routine has some kinks in it, try something different.</p> \n<h3>10. Lean on your team.</h3> \n<p>While you decide how you manage your time, you can also get support from your team.</p> \n<p>\"I really lean on my manager to talk through situations when I do feel that there's a lot going on,\" says Kim. \"It really helps to have her bigger picture perspective on what projects are most in line with my team's goals. We're also able to talk through whether there are areas that we can support each other's load.\"</p> \n<p>Your manager can help you prioritize your tasks in alignment with your team's broader goals. They can also help you protect your time when it comes to cross-functional projects.</p> \n<p>Bump encourages honesty with your colleagues and your manager about your bandwidth.</p> \n<p>\"When working with cross-functional teams, it can be easy to agree to too many tasks and not have time to complete them all,\" she says. \"If you foresee a time crunch, reach out to your colleagues or manager and see what can be moved or adjusted if needed due to your changing priorities.\"</p> \n<p>The work doesn't get done alone. So, make sure you're leaning on your team to help you manage your time and achieve your goals.</p> \n<h3>11. Stack your meetings.</h3> \n<p>Ever have meetings spread out throughout the day? Doing work in between those can seem impossible.</p> \n<p>It can feel like just when you're getting in your groove, you have to stop to jump into another meeting.</p> \n<p>\"I find that when my meetings are scattered throughout the day without any significant chunks of free time I can devote to my own tasks, I'm unable to focus and do what I need to do,\" says Kim.\"</p> \n<p>One way to prevent this is by stacking your meetings back-to-back, whenever possible. Have multiple one-on-ones this week? Try to knock them all out on the same day in a block of time.</p> \n<p>Kim says this tactic helps her get into focus mode.</p> \n<p>\"I'm able to do my best work when I can get into the right headspace – whether that's meeting mode or working mode – so this has been really effective for me.\"</p> \n<p>Bump suggests scheduling plan-oriented meetings on specific days of the week.</p> \n<p>\"This will leave you some wide-open time at the end of the week for larger projects like creating content or brainstorming new strategies,\" she says.</p> \n<h3>12. Limit distractions.</h3> \n<p>You're trying to get work done but your email inbox is pilling up and you keep getting pinged.</p> \n<p>Distractions like these make it impossible to focus on your tasks and manage your time well. Thankfully, many of these communication platforms offer features to limit your distractions.</p> \n<p>For instance, productivity software <a href=\"https://boomerangapp.com/\">Boomerang</a> offers a \"pause inbox\" feature that temporarily stops new emails from populating in your Gmail or Outlook account.</p> \n<p>You can also use the \"do not disturb\" feature on your messaging software to prevent notifications.</p> \n<p>You can also put a status like \"Heads down - slow to respond\" to let your colleagues know you may be unavailable for the next few hours.</p> \n<h3>13. Declutter your space.</h3> \n<p>Your space is a reflection of your mind.</p> \n<p>If your space is messy, it can make it harder to focus and manage your time effectively. It can also contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, make sure your work environment reflects the state you want to be in. Remove non-essentials from your desk, add affirmations like \"You can do it!\" and \"Breathe\" to motivate you throughout the day.</p> \n<p>You can even add essential oils to create a calming environment and play some soothing music in the background.</p> \n<h3>14. Take accountability.</h3> \n<p>You may be responsible for keeping track of your progress toward achieving your goal, and holding yourself accountable to the timelines and benchmarks you've established will help you stay motivated and positive at work.</p> \n<p>Personal accountability leads to increased feelings of workplace satisfaction, creativity, and innovation, and there are a few ways to promote that while working on your long-term project, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sharing progress toward goals with others</li> \n <li>Setting up a personal reward system for each benchmark you achieve on the path to project completion.</li> \n <li>Tracking your progress so you can visualize what portion of your project you've successfully completed.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>15. Review past performance.</h3> \n<p>Analyze and report on successes and challenges of projects for future goal-setting.</p> \n<p>Once you've successfully completed a long-term project, don't move on to the next one without first reflecting on your strategies for project management. What went well, and perhaps more importantly, what didn't?</p> \n<p>If your work is primarily comprised of long-term projects, you will need to continually refine and improve your approach to be as efficient as possible.</p> \n<p>Document your processes and share them with your team so they can learn from your triumphs and struggles for their projects as well.</p> \n<p>Managing your time is a learned skill that requires a lot of discipline and flexibility. It's also something that requires support from your team, as those interactions impact your ability to complete your tasks.</p> \n<p>While you may be an expert time manager tomorrow, following these tips will definitely help you improve your current process.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=57b789cd-3ca2-4d6b-b792-77e5b1163125&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Take me to Projects\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/57b789cd-3ca2-4d6b-b792-77e5b1163125.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftime-management-tips-long-term-deadlines&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Sep 2021 21:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png","linkMd5":"0bc80147828f64b4661ca9b8198f8325","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn48@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-331_e57995fecd8b2257.webp","destWidth":395,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4668,"destBytes":6412,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn48@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-331_e57995fecd8b2257.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/57b789cd-3ca2-4d6b-b792-77e5b1163125.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn61@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-45-394_9524aa96f1bc7dcb.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftime-management-tips-long-term-deadlines&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-46-848_fd2f043891f06515.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741262},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Podcast Advertising and Sponsorship","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-advertising-tips","description":"<p>According to research by <a href=\"https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>Podcast Insights</span></a>, there are more than 2 million active podcasts and counting.</p> \n<p>As a marketer for a small to mid-sized business, you might be interested in podcast sponsorship, but not know where to start.

These ads can be easily changed across a podcast’s entire catalog without making changes to the original audio file.</li> \n <li><strong>Programmatic Ad:</strong> pre-recorded advertisements that do not feature the original host of the podcast. Programmatic ads are typically deployed using dynamic insertion.</li> \n <li><strong>Pre-Roll Ad:</strong> an ad placed at the beginning of a podcast episode.</li> \n <li><strong>Mid-Roll Ad:</strong> an ad placed near the middle of a podcast episode.</li> \n <li><strong>Post-Roll Ad:</strong> an ad placed at the end of a podcast episode.</li> \n <li><strong>CTA:</strong> Call to action; unique URLs and discount codes are typically included in podcast CTAs to measure the performance of an ad’s effectiveness on a particular podcast.</li> \n <li><strong>Downloads:</strong> how many times a podcast episode has been downloaded from a podcast hosting site. The most common metric to determine the impressions/listens of a podcast.</li> \n <li><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.125rem;\">Live-Read Ad:</strong> an ad that is performed live during a podcast episode, as opposed to being scripted and edited or dynamically inserted into the episode.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that you're familiar with the necessary terminology, let's discuss how to find and sponsor podcasts.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>1. Consider podcast demographics.</h3> \n<p>While different types of TV shows might attract different audiences or demographics, the podcast demographics don't change drastically from show to show, according to HubSpot's former Podcast Manager Sam Balter.</p> \n<p>Balter explained that the podcast audience demographic, which is generally made up of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-hubspot-marketer\">\"affluent educated millennials\"</a> is a \"good audience for brands pretty much regardless of what show you’re on.\"</p> \n<p>Why is the podcast audience so good? Because of their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-hubspot-marketer\">age, income, and education level</a>, this particular group of people is old enough to make purchasing decisions and has enough income to make those purchases. Because many of them have jobs or are in higher education, these listeners might be interested in learning about a wide range of products or services that make daily life or work easier for them.</p> \n<p>According to Alanah Joseph, Senior Marketing Manager on the HubSpot Podcasts team, understanding the listener of the show is key to successful ad placements. She says:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>\"When reviewing the custom ad placements on HubSpot Podcast Network shows, we define success through more than one lens. We’re looking at the ad from the point of a listener. Does the ad feel like it’s an authentic part of the show? Is it enjoyable to listen to?</em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>From the lens of an advertiser, we’re measuring success by the size of the audience, specifically the number of downloads. Although there are other metrics we’d like to track and report, we’re limited in the data we can collect.\"</em></p> \n<p>Another great thing about podcast listeners is that they'll tune into podcast episodes for a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-hubspot-marketer\">longer amount of time</a> than they will to other content, like video. The podcast audience also enjoys long-form podcasts that are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-hubspot-marketer\">30 minutes or longer</a>. Since there's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-hubspot-marketer\">much less drop-off</a> on a podcast compared to other forms of content, like video, this means that ads could be placed towards the beginning or end of an episode and still have a good chance of being heard.</p> \n<h3>2. Understand standard podcast ad pricing.</h3> \n<p>The next question you might be asking is, \"How much will advertising on a podcast cost?\"</p> \n<p>If you're new to the podcast advertising world, you might not know how ads are usually prices. You might be worried that all podcast ads might have vastly different prices — or that podcasters will charge a lot for a poor ad slot.</p> \n<p>Podcast ad pricing might be more transparent than you think. According to Balter, podcasters and podcast networks commonly use the same formula to determine how much an ad in their podcasts will cost.</p> \n<p>If you want to get a ballpark idea of what ad slots for a specific show might cost before reaching out to a podcast team or network, plug the metrics you can find for that show's previous episodes into the formula shown below.</p> \n<p>As mentioned in the terminology section, CPM stands for \"cost per mille,\" or cost per 1,000 impressions.</p> \n<p>Balter says that the cost of a standard ad in a podcast usually costs between $10 and $50 with more popular podcasts also charging a premium.</p> \n<p>However, if you want to do a more intensive promotion — such as a full sponsored podcast episode — this cost may vary based on what the content will entail from the podcasters. For example, <a href=\"https://creative.gimletmedia.com/products/ads\">Gimlet</a>, a prominent podcast network that produces shows like <a href=\"https://creative.gimletmedia.com/shows/fortune-favors-the-bold\">Mastercard's \"Fortune Favors the Bold\"</a>, offers two tiers of advertising: audio ads and branded podcasts.</p> \n<h3>3. Look for podcasts that relate to your brand or industry.</h3> \n<p>Because the pool of podcasts is so large, there are plenty of opportunities to connect with niche audiences that relate to your specific industry.</p> \n<p>When an ad relates to the topic of a podcast series or episode, it might feel more natural to the listener. It's also strategically smart because listeners who are interested in this industry might identify with pain points that your service aims to solve.</p> \n<p>For example, if you place an ad about your B2B recruiting service on a podcast that discusses human resources, listeners who own or manage a B2B company, or human resources employees, might want to use your service to make their jobs easier.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://bullhorn.fm/thejoeroganexperience/posts\">Here's an example</a> outside of the B2B world. On an episode of \"<a href=\"https://bullhorn.fm/thejoeroganexperience/posts/puQcPrT-1241-sam-harris\">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>\", a general podcast that zones in on topics like technology, science, and entertainment, Joe Rogan reads a script that talks about how he uses ExpressVPN and Cash App in his daily life. Before going into detail about how he uses these products, he also notes that these companies sponsored the episode.</p> \n<p>In the ad, Rogan explains that he uses ExpressVPN to protect his internet data and personal information, while he uses Cash App to pay friends or make transactions on the go from his phone. If you can't listen to the podcast, here's a quick excerpt from the ad:</p> \n<p>\"With all the recent news about online security breaches, it's very hard not to worry about where your data goes. Making an online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk ... That's why I decided to take back my privacy using ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN has easy-to-use apps and runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phone tablet.\"</p> \n<p>Although Rogan notes that he's reading sponsored material before beginning the segment, the services he discusses relate to technology, handy apps, and internet security, which are topics that he has covered on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\". Additionally, these topics might be interesting to the millennial podcast audience which is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/\">highly tuned into smartphone and computer technology</a>.</p> \n<p>Lastly, because Rogan describes his own experiences with ExpressVPN, the segment feels less like an ad and more like a friendly recommendation. In fact, listeners who are fans of Rogan might trust that he has used the advertised product and that he had a good experience with it. If they think he's a credible recommendation source, they might choose or consider ExpressVPN when looking for a data security provider.</p> \n<p>After an example, you need a brief section that sums up what readers should get from the example. In this case, something like, \"One of the main selling points of advertising on a podcast is that listeners are already comfortable with the host. When the host reads your ad copy, there's already a level of trust between the host and the audience that wouldn't be there with alternative mediums like video or display ads. It's almost like a lightweight celebrity endorsement.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Use your competitors for inspiration.</h3> \n<p>As with any new marketing or advertising technique, a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitor-analysis-guide\">competitive analysis</a> can help you identify what similar companies are doing, as well as opportunities where you can get ahead of them.</p> \n<p>If you have a direct competitor who has advertised on various podcasts, see if those shows might fit your ad strategy as well. Similarly, if there are brands in your industry that provide non-competing services and use podcast advertising, try to identify shows that they advertise on.</p> \n<p>From there, you could either look into contacting these podcast producers or their networks or look for podcasts that have a similar level of success and discuss similar topics. While you shouldn't directly copy what your competitor is doing, a competitive analysis could still inspire you to develop an ad strategy or promotional content that improves upon that of similar brands.</p> \n<h3>5. Purchase multiple ads for small shows rather than one for big podcasts.</h3> \n<p>As you start researching podcasts, you might find a long list of shows that will align very well with your product or service. When that happens, do you invest in one expensive ad for the biggest show with the most promising numbers? Or, do you use that money for multiple ads on different podcast episodes?</p> \n<p>Balter says, \"It’s better to play an ad multiple times on a smaller show than try to a single ad on a big show.\"</p> \n<p>If major podcasts have a huge listenership and ad premiums, you'll have to pay much more for one or two ads that may or may not be memorable. While you might get great visibility, this could be a huge gamble. If the ads don't provide ROI, you'll lose ad dollars.</p> \n<p>That's why the safest strategy is to follow Balter's advice and choose frequency over sheer audience reach.</p> \n<p>Look at a number of smaller podcasts that still have engaging content and really relate to your product or business. Then invest a bit of your spend in each. If one or two don't pan out well but the others do, consider swapping the low-performing podcasts out with other shows or purchasing more ads on episodes of podcasts that are giving you revenue or brand awareness.</p> \n<h3>6. Advertise on multiple podcasts within the same network.</h3> \n<p>If you plan to invest in multiple podcasts — or multiple ads within a podcast episode — and find a network that produces multiple shows that align with your product, consider building a relationship with that network and putting your ad dollars there.</p> \n<p>In the podcast world, Balter explains that advertising on shows within the same network is called a \"pulsing\" strategy, adding that it's better than airing multiple ads on one podcast episode but still can have similar reach.</p> \n<p>\"Because people who listen to <a href=\"https://creative.gimletmedia.com/'\">Gimlet</a> shows are likely to listen to other Gimlet shows, you can get a solid number of impressions off of a few shows over a relatively short amount of time without inundating listeners with the same ad over and over again.\"</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a Hendrick's Gin ad that Gimlet has circulated on a number of its podcasts and displayed on its <a href=\"https://creative.gimletmedia.com/products/ads\">advertising page</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe style=\"border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 25px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://player.gimletmedia.com/4mszd7\" width=\"560\" height=\"130\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p> \n<p>The native ad begins by telling listeners that the episode they're listening to is sponsored by Hendrick's Gin. Then the ad's narrator goes on to discuss the flavors associated with the beverage and how people who drink it are looking to escape from their mundane life.</p> \n<p>This Hendrick's ad feels unique but it speaks to a wide variety of people that could be bored with their lives and doesn't note specific industries. The ad also doesn't specify the podcast it's on which makes it easy to place in many different ones.</p> \n<h3>7. Be vigilant of dishonest podcasters.</h3> \n<p>As you research various podcasts — especially those that are smaller, you might realize that it's easy to find numbers and success metrics for some, while others are less transparent. Because of this, you'll want to do some extra digging and properly vet the podcasts at the top of your list to make sure they're legitimate.</p> \n<p>Balter warns, \"Downloads are not algorithmically verified, therefore people sometimes make up how many downloads their show gets. So, if you’re sponsoring a less reputable podcast, make sure to get download numbers for a single episode.\"</p> \n<p>If you want to verify that the podcast is giving accurate numbers before reaching out to them, here are a few steps you can take.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Look at all the sites they post their podcasts on:</strong> If they post on a major site like SoundCloud or Spotify, you should be able to see general platform-provided view numbers to get an idea of how successful their podcast was.</li> \n <li><strong>Look for them on social media:</strong> While podcasters might not be airing episodes on social media, they might have a following or a few social accounts to spread awareness of the show. If they do, look at the follower count, likes, and visual signs of engagement on these pages. If you can find signs of social engagement and a following, this might be a sign that they have a legitimate audience.</li> \n <li><strong>Work with a credible network:</strong> Many credible networks might be transparent about podcast numbers to potential and current advertisers. Additionally, you can look at the success of the network's other shows as evidence that they're associated with engaging content.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you do finally talk to the podcast producers, get as much specific data as possible about views and impressions. If they have or have had advertisers in the past, you might want to ask them if their advertisers have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi\">seen an ROI</a>. If they can show proof that advertisers make more money than they spend on ad slots, this shows that ads on this podcast can be successful.</p> \n<h3>8. Consider purchasing back catalog space.</h3> \n<p>A back catalog is a collection of a podcast's previously recorded episodes. Back catalog podcast episodes might still be listened to, shared quite regularly by listeners, and up for grabs when it comes to ad space.</p> \n<p>Because back catalog episodes have already aired and don't seem like an obvious ad opportunity, Balter says this tactic is \"interesting and something a lot of people don’t consider.\"</p> \n<p>If you do decide to advertise in back catalog podcasts, zone specifically into evergreen episodes that will continue to remain relevant for a longer period of time.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're a marketer for an e-commerce home-shopping site, you could advertise in back catalog podcasts about DIY ideas or home decorating. This type of podcast won't age drastically over time and might be relevant to anyone listening to podcasts about those topics.</p> \n<p>While these podcasts might've already been promoted during their first launch, podcasters are often encouraged to <a href=\"https://blog.pacific-content.com/dont-forget-about-your-podcast-s-back-catalog-2269a9a6d722\">re-promote evergreen back catalog content</a>. Your brand could also share the podcast on your company's social channels for some added promotion.</p> \n<h3>9. Determine what type of promotion you'd like to run.</h3> \n<p>While some companies like to create standard native ads that exist as pre-roll or mid-roll within a podcast episode, other brands might pay the podcast producers to create sponsored content.</p> \n<p>Similarly, advertisers might want to script the ad and have the host read it, or have the host casually work product discussion into the podcast conversation, so it feels more natural. Some podcasts may only offer certain types of sponsorship options, but if you still want to consider the different types, here are a few with an example for each:</p> \n<p><strong>Native Ad:</strong></p> \n<p>A native ad is created by the brand for the podcast. With this common strategy, you'll create a short audio clip that discusses your product, service, or another promotion related to your brand. These usually run for 30 seconds or less and sound a lot like audio ads you'd hear on traditional radio stations. These ads usually air as pre-roll or mid-roll ads after a podcast host says something like, \"And now, a word from our sponsors.\"</p> \n<p>Below is an example of an ad for the Toyota RAV4. In the 30-second ad, a narrator describes all the unique features that make the car safe, reliable, and fast. Like the Hendrick's Gin ad noted above, the ad doesn't acknowledge a specific podcast so it can be shared on multiple different shows.</p> \n<p><iframe style=\"border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 25px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://player.gimletmedia.com/3vsoxb\" width=\"560\" height=\"130\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p> \n<p>If you're looking for inspiration for a quirkier native ad, check out <a href=\"https://www.geico.com/more/geico-community/commercials/radio/\">GEICO's list of ads</a>, which have been aired on both radio and podcasts.</p> \n<p><strong>Sponsored Content:</strong></p> \n<p>With sponsored content or branded podcasts, you pay the podcast production team to create interesting content about a topic related to your industry of the company.</p> \n<p>While the content might not discuss your product outright, the podcast hosts will note that your brand sponsored the podcast — and most likely include some information about your product or service.</p> \n<p>If the podcast is valuable and interesting to the listener, they might remember your brand and affiliate informative content with your company.</p> \n<p>One recent example was a mini-series called <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=2279044105516875&amp;_rdr\">\"The Sauce\"</a> in 2018. The podcast, sponsored by McDonald's — and created by Gizmodo and Onion Labs — investigated why people rioted over the removal of Szechuan Sauce from the McDonald's menu. While the podcast has since been removed from Apple podcasts, you can find a short preview for it on <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=2279044105516875&amp;_rdr\">Gizmodo's Facebook page</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Paid Interview:</strong></p> \n<p>This is a type of sponsored content where an expert from or affiliated with an advertising brand is interviewed in exchange for the sponsorship dollars. While this gives your company's experts an opportunity to spread brand awareness and show their expertise, it also allows the podcast to create interesting interview content about a topic related to its own mission.</p> \n<p>In the example below, Daymond John interviews a rep from ZipRecruiter, on the podcast, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pods/rise-and-grind-with-daymond-john\">\"Rise and Grind.\"</a> Because the podcast series regularly discussed business, entrepreneurship, and management, this ZipRecruiter-sponsored interview about hiring talent, still feels like a natural piece of content.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0qb9IXmFaztAKv2JuItqoK\" width=\"560\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>This paid interview tactic could also work for businesses in other industries as well. For example, if you're a marketer for a cookbook publisher, you could pay for a chef who created some of a new book's recipes to get interviewed on a podcast related to cooking, home-making, or DIY.</p> \n<p>In another example, if your company sells medical devices, you could pay for your CEO or an executive to be interviewed on a podcast that touches on medical news or technological advances.</p> \n<p>In either example, audiences who listen to those podcasts because they want to learn more about topics or products within their industry might hear the interviews, gain insight from the experts, and trust your brand more.</p> \n<p><strong>Product Placement:</strong></p> \n<p>This is a form of sponsored content where podcasters are paid to mention your product casually in the podcast's discussion.</p> \n<p>In a classic example, the \"My Brother, My Brother, and Me\" podcast aired an episode about Totinos which was sponsored by Totinos.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tDSE4yqfiBY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>While the hosts played games and had random discussions about life, as they've done in most of their episodes, they were chewing Totino's pizza rolls most of the time and made each game or featured piece of content center around the food product.</p> \n<p><strong>Direct Response Ads</strong></p> \n<p>This is a native ad that feels like a product placement where the host reads a short script written by the advertiser. The ad ends with the host telling listeners to do something, such as click a link or use a coupon code. Unlike the more traditional pre-roll or mid-roll native ad, the listener is still immersed in the experience of listening to the host.</p> \n<p>Although the host notes that their discussion is sponsored, it still might make the listener feel like they are getting a solid recommendation from the host.</p> \n<p>On Dax Shepard's podcast, \"The Armchair Expert,\" he includes at least one direct response ad in the middle of each episode. At the 65:00 mark of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7n3uTTJ9kFax5c2f5YdNiZ\">this episode</a>, Shepard reads a script that explains the benefits of using the meal-delivery service DoorDash. Then, he tells listeners to download DoorDash and use the code \"DAX\" to get $5 off of their first order:</p> \n<h3>10. Purchase ad spots online.</h3> \n<p>If you're just looking to purchase a standard ad slot and already have an audio clip, some tools allow you to purchase space and target ads to appear on multiple podcasts.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're just planning to target one or two simple native ads to millennials on Spotify, you might want to use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwif1OyOq9TkAhUCj8gKHVOUBL4YABADGgJxdQ&amp;sig=AOD64_1FprewWkVTwhPcCXxtfrZnWZDFhA&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiG6uOOq9TkAhXkQd8KHZLRCsIQ0Qx6BAgOEAE&amp;adurl=\">Spotify Ad Studio</a> to create and launch basic native ads on the music platform. If you want to launch to multiple host-read ads in a number of different podcasts, you could consider using a service like <a href=\"http://www.midroll.com/\">Midroll</a>, where you can submit ad information and purchase ad slots in a variety of different podcasts.</p> \n<h3>11. Or, reach out personally to podcasts you'd like to work with.</h3> \n<p>If you want to do something that requires more planning, like sponsored content, a paid interview, or preparing scripted product placements, you should make an in-person connection with podcasters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"<i>By being intentional when looking for creators, we can create a truly collaborative environment and allow creators to infuse their personality and voice into our ads,\" says Joseph.</i></p> \n<p>Once you've done your research and found a few podcasts you're interested in, reach out to begin discussing your advertising options. Send an email with a little bit about your brand and why you think you could work well with them as an advertiser. Be sure to also ask about their growth and key success metrics to confirm that they are as promising as you think.</p> \n<p>Need help reaching out to potential podcast hosts or networks you’d like to sponsor?

Avoid handing them a dry script to read verbatim. \"I've learned the more we allow our podcasters to participate in the creation of the ad, the better the ad will be,\" Joseph says.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>12. Monitor your progress.</h3> \n<p>Regardless of what type of promotion you purchase, you should be tracking your money spent compared to the money the advertisement earned. This will help you determine the ROI of your campaigns.</p> \n<p>If you're publishing promotions on multiple podcasts, this will be an important way to tell which might warrant more advertisements and which might require less to no ad spend.</p> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi\">this post on marketing ROI</a>, you can learn how to use a simple formula to calculate and find a few examples of how it can be used when strategizing in the real world.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Advertise on Podcasts</h2> \n<p>Ready to launch your advertising campaign on relevant podcasts? Here’s what you should consider.</p> \n<h3>1. Determine the type of ad you want to run.</h3> \n<p>As we reviewed above in the podcast terminology section, there are a few different types of podcast ads to consider. The right type of podcast ad for you will depend on your budget and the goals of your campaign.</p> \n<p>Host-read ads tend to cost more than programmatic ads, however, according to <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/host-read-podcast-ads-pack-a-brand-recall-punch/\"><span>Nielsen</span></a> host-read ads are more effective because hosts have already established trust and recognition with their audiences.</p> \n<h3>2. Select the best ad placement for your campaign.</h3> \n<p>Additionally, ad placement and length matter. Though the first few minutes of a podcast reaches the widest audience, pre-roll ads, or ads that play at the beginning of a podcast episode, tend to have a lower CPM rate because users can <a href=\"http://blog.bloomads.com/blog/mid-roll-vs-pre-roll-whats-the-best-place-for-a-podcast-ad\"><span>easily skip over the ad.</span></a></p> \n<p><span><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vieH4unZTOgMvoHiC2trtE3TEuJ5rT5GZszl-pdA6c5XiM-3JesIgT0JOPn_1obTq8baRqsPpO4nkSjyPrtXikAFpOWzweCA_ZrBfUycwe_2nKtzD9hjVpWT06Xd4NI7Cn1Dg0ZH=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"275\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Podcast Advertising\" /></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span><a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/untapped-potential-podcast-advertising/\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>On the other hand, mid-roll ad placements tend to have a higher CPM rate because listeners who reach the middle of an episode tend to be <a href=\"http://blog.bloomads.com/blog/mid-roll-vs-pre-roll-whats-the-best-place-for-a-podcast-ad\"><span>more engaged</span></a> and likely to follow a CTA. In terms of <a href=\"https://www.advertisecast.com/podcast-advertising-rates\"><span>length</span></a>, 30-second ad placements have an average CPM of $18, while 60-second ad placements have an average CPM of $25.</p> \n<h3>3. How to write a podcast ad.</h3> \n<p>Now that you know what type of ad you want to run and have determined the placement, it’s time to tackle the messaging. Whether you are doing host-read or programmatic ads, the on-air talent needs talking points from you to ensure the ad shares information that is relevant to your campaign.</p> \n<p>Here are the elements to include when writing a podcast ad script.</p> \n<h4>Hook the Listener</h4> \n<p>Begin with a bold or attention-grabbing statement to get the listener’s attention and reduce the likelihood of them fast-forwarding through the ad.</p> \n<h4>Personal Story</h4> \n<p>Once the audience is hooked on the ad, the on-air talent should introduce the product and share a quick personal story outlining why they enjoy the product. A simple way to do this is to mention what problem they were experiencing, how they were introduced to the product, and the positive results or solutions they experienced after using the product.</p> \n<h4>Call to Action</h4> \n<p>Close the ad by creating a clear call-to-action (CTA) for the listener. A popular CTA used in podcast advertising is special codes and unique URLs specifically for that show. These are easy for the audience to remember because they are typically related to the name of the podcast, and can be easily measured for KPI tracking.</p> \n<h3>4. How to create a podcast ad.</h3> \n<p>Once the script has been finalized, share it with the on-air talent so they can record the ad as a standalone mp3 file. During the post-production process, the ad should be placed in the episode audio file during the designated placement time. If using dynamic insertion technology, upload the mp3 file to the podcast hosting software so it can be automatically played during the episode.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Navigating Podcast Sponsorship</h2> \n<p>The podcast landscape is a pool of growing opportunities for marketers. And, if you're ready to start testing the sponsorship waters, be sure to keep these key tips in mind.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Find podcasts that align with your brand: </strong>People are listening to an episode to get informed about a specific topic. If your ad aligns well with it, they might be interested in learning more about your product.</li> \n <li><strong>Choose frequency over audience reach:</strong> It's less risky and more efficient to invest in multiple ads on smaller podcasts rather than just one or two ads on a major podcast.</li> \n <li><strong>Consider working with a network: </strong>Networks may provide more legitimate view numbers and have a variety of podcasts with similar audiences that you can air your ads on.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>With the right strategy in place, you can get your product in front of an engaged community of potential buyers through podcast advertising.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"advertising plan\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891.png\" /></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpodcast-advertising-tips&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08.png","linkMd5":"78f94ef28da60bda24baff18338bff2d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn19@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-42-530_91a8856cb36791e3.webp","destWidth":427,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":3972,"destBytes":6552,"author":"pbump@hubspot.com (Pamela Bump)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn19@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-42-530_91a8856cb36791e3.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zXqrfHa0vkLq1KpaWXM1R6T8diElJOdPhhSYYguyUvKBWpwqkZHNhe1aBx7WMovSnlCQJVIdIqqsiBVW8eXNdw5diD2b4t-esZMdMPy5KlFraXvZcPqJcnQZo2S1_BsiDUDeHp0Q=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn94@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-49-294_2d45e22e0f8ae81a.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vieH4unZTOgMvoHiC2trtE3TEuJ5rT5GZszl-pdA6c5XiM-3JesIgT0JOPn_1obTq8baRqsPpO4nkSjyPrtXikAFpOWzweCA_ZrBfUycwe_2nKtzD9hjVpWT06Xd4NI7Cn1Dg0ZH=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-44-762_71592ac9fd9d873b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-53-192_8e21eaa098288b31.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpodcast-advertising-tips&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn2@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-47-761_f248f63548ae00e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741232},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"278 Social Media Holidays for Your 2021 Content Calendar [+Template]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-holiday-calendar-2017","description":"<p>Do you celebrate International Cat Day, Pizza Day, or Talk Like a Pirate Day? </p> \n<p>There are a plethora of observance days worldwide during which marketers can share content relevant to their industries, get involved in a movement, or simply generate more awareness.

One of the ways we do this is by running A/B tests.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Download: A/B Testing Guide and Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>As a refresher, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing?_ga=2.32430716.331648612.1631219468-1271636242.1631219468\">A/B testing</a> is the process of splitting an audience to test a number of variations of a campaign and determining which performs better.</p> \n<p>But A/B testing isn't foolproof.</p> \n<p>In fact, it's a complicated process. You often have to rely on testing software to pull the data, and there's a high probability of receiving a false positive. If you're not careful, you could make incorrect assumptions about what makes people click.</p> \n<p>So how can you ensure your A/B test is operating correctly? This is where A/A testing comes in. Think of it as a test to the test.</p> \n<p>The idea behind an A/A test is that the experience is the same for each group, therefore the expected KPI (Key Performance Indicator) will also be the same for each group.</p> \n<p>For example, if 20% of group A fills out a form on a landing page, the expected result is that 20% of group B (who are interacting with an identical version of the landing page) will do the same.</p> \n<h2>Differences Between an A/A Test and an A/B Test</h2> \n<p>Performing an A/A test is similar to that of an A/B test; an audience is divided into two similarly sized groups, but instead of directing each group to different variations of content, each group interacts with identical versions of the same piece of content.</p> \n<p>Here’s another way to think about it: have you ever heard the idiom, \"Comparing apples to oranges\"? An A/B test does exactly that — compares two different variants of a piece of content to see which performs better. An A/A test compares an apple to, well, an identical apple.</p> \n<p>When running an A/B test, you program a testing tool to change or hide some part of the content. This is not necessary for an A/A test.</p> \n<p>An A/A test also requires a larger sample size than an A/B test to prove a significant bias. And, due to such a large sample size, these tests take much longer to complete.</p> \n<h2>How to Do A/A Testing</h2> \n<p>Exactly how you do an A/A will vary depending on the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-testing-tools?_ga=2.196476910.331648612.1631219468-1271636242.1631219468\">testing tool</a> you use. If you're a HubSpot Enterprise customer conducting an A/A or A/B test on an email, for example, HubSpot will automatically split traffic to your variations so that each variation receives a random sampling of visitors.</p> \n<p>Let's cover the steps to run an A/A test.</p> \n<h3>1. Create two identical versions of a piece of content — the control and the variant.</h3> \n<p>Once your content is created, identify two groups of the same sample size you would like to conduct the test with.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify your KPI.</h3> \n<p>A KPI is a measure of performance over a period of time. For example, your KPI could be the number of visitors who click on a call-to-action.</p> \n<h3>3. Using your testing tool, split your audience equally and randomly, and send one group to the control and the other group to the variant.</h3> \n<p>Run the test until the control and variation hit a determined number of visitors.</p> \n<h3>4. Track the KPI for both groups.</h3> \n<p>Because both groups are sent to identical pieces of content, they should behave the same. Therefore, the expected result will be inconclusive.</p> \n<h2>A/A Test Uses</h2> \n<p>A/A testing is primarily used when an organization implements a new A/B testing software or reconfigures a current one.</p> \n<p>You can run an A/A test to accomplish the following:</p> \n<h3>1. To check the accuracy of an A/B testing software.</h3> \n<p>The intended result of an A/A test is that the audience reacts similarly to the same piece of content.</p> \n<p>But what if they don't?</p> \n<p>Here's an example: Company XYZ is running an A/A test on a new landing page. Two groups are sent to two identical versions of the landing page (the control and the variant). Group A has a conversion rate of 8%, while Group B has a rate of 2%.</p> \n<p>In theory, the conversion rate should be identical. When there is no difference between the control and the variant, the expected result will be inconclusive. Yet, sometimes a \"winner\" is declared on two identical versions.</p> \n<p>When this happens, it is essential to evaluate the testing platform. The tool may have been misconfigured, or it could be ineffective.</p> \n<h3>2. To set a baseline conversion rate for future A/B tests.</h3> \n<p>Let's imagine that Company XYZ runs another A/A test on the landing page. This time, the results of Group A and Group B are identical — both groups achieve an 8% conversion rate.</p> \n<p>Therefore, 8% is the baseline conversion rate. With this in mind, the company can run future A/B tests with the goal of exceeding this rate.</p> \n<p>If, for example, the company runs an A/B test on a new version of the landing page and receives a conversion rate of 8.02%, the result is not statistically significant.</p> \n<h2>A/A Testing: Do You Really Need to Use It?</h2> \n<p>To run an A/A test, or not — that is the question. And the answer will depend on who you ask. There is no denying that A/A testing is a hotly debated topic.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most prevalent argument against A/A testing boils down to one factor: time.</p> \n<p>A/A testing takes a considerable amount of time to run. In fact, A/A tests typically require a much larger sample size than A/B tests. When testing two identical versions, you need a large sample size to prove a significant bias. Therefore, the test will take more time to complete, and this may eat into time spent running other valuable tests.</p> \n<p>However, it makes sense to run an A/A test in some cases, especially if you are uncertain about a new A/B testing software and want additional proof that it's both functional and accurate. A/A tests are a low-risk method to ensure your tests are set up properly.</p> \n<p>A/A testing can help you prepare for a successful AB testing program, provide data benchmarks, and identify any discrepancies in your data.</p> \n<p>Although A/A tests have utility, running such a test should be a relatively rare occurrence. While A/A test can run a \"health check\" on a new A/B tool or software, it may not be worth optimizing every minor alteration to your website or marketing campaign due to the considerable amount of time it takes to run.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=1fb2d19e-9ff9-40a7-947e-cc67e7d472cb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"The Ultimate A/B Testing Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1fb2d19e-9ff9-40a7-947e-cc67e7d472cb.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faa-test&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde.png","linkMd5":"33f3112aef03ff60f8202e9e6c9e863e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-636_1068aaa9a6acaf25.webp","destWidth":378,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":3884,"destBytes":5928,"author":"Erin Rodrigue","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-636_1068aaa9a6acaf25.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1fb2d19e-9ff9-40a7-947e-cc67e7d472cb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-48-465_39667621be686c34.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faa-test&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn45@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-43-942_a3547e31f9c48657.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741208},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"The Best Integrated Marketing Campaigns, According to HubSpot Marketers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-favorite-integrated-marketing-examples","description":"<p>Integrated marketing is any marketing campaign that uses multiple channels in execution. For example, you might see a popular new donut flavor in a commercial, then drive past the donut shop to see posters of the donut. And if you flip through Instagram once you get to your destination, you might see a GIF on your feed, displaying the donut.</p>  \n<p>This style of marketing is great for boosting leads and brand awareness. Using multiple sources to deliver the same campaign diversifies the audience that interacts with its content. In this post, let's look at some recent integrated marketing campaigns that delivered a great experience for customers and leads alike.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<h2>Best Integrated Marketing Campaigns</h2> \n<h3>1. Hyundai Elantra</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Channels:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Spotify, Website</span></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">A great example of an integrated marketing campaign comes from the 2021 Hyundai Elantra award-winning campaign.</span></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">To increase brand awareness among the younger, millennial demographic, Hyundai partnered with Spotify and musicians in LA, Miami, and NYC to give customers an insider's guide of the city.</span></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The city guides were made available to audiences everywhere through Spotify podcasts, where drivers could follow along from place to place by listening to the podcast.</span></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">These guides were audio, video, and even a microsite that housed itineraries and stop descriptions.</span></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">As an associate marketing manager at HubSpot, I think this is a great campaign that utilizes the right channels for the audience that Hyundai is trying to reach.</span></p> \n<h3>2. \"Fatima,\" the movie</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Channels:</span> Facebook Premiere, other social media channels</p> \n<p>In 2020, McKinney and Picturehouse teamed up <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">to launch a new film, Fatima, the historical drama of the Virgin Mary’s appearances to three children in Fátima, Portugal, over a hundred years ago.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">The companies developed social content to inspire, connect and elevate the film’s key themes. It was a social campaign that included more than 200 pieces of content reaching 14 million people.</span></p> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <p>But one month before the movie's release, the world and Fatima were put on pause due to COVID-19. To keep people interested and engagement up for another four months, the companies created “Together In Spirit,” a virtual pilgrimage transporting people to the Shrine at Fátima. The campaign videos got more than 27 million views.</p> \n  <p>At a time when everyone was isolated, the goal of the broadcast was to provide a message of hope, and in the process, it became the best-performing Facebook Premiere event in motion picture history.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>3. Hulu's HAHA Awards</h3> \n<p><strong>Channels</strong>: Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Website</p> \n<p>One of my favorite integrated marketing campaigns to come along is the launch of Hulu's HAHA Awards. HAHA is a clever acronym, standing for \"Hilarious Animated Hulu Awards,\" which I love.</p> \n<p>Initially, I saw the commercial during a regular ad break while watching — of course — Hulu:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dv9BUqiROY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Because there's no awards show for animated content, the team at Hulu decided to change that — and get fans involved. Fans can vote for the awards on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hulu/status/1280894695845974017\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://hulu.com/haha\">Hulu's website</a>.</p> \n<p>I appreciate that anyone with a Twitter account can participate in voting, regardless of if they are Hulu customers. Some of the categories are popular TV shows, like Archer and Bob Burgers, so the masses can vote. Additionally, people without a Twitter or Hulu account can vote, just by visiting the website.</p> \n<p>The tactic of using YouTube to introduce the campaign, as well as alternate methods of voting, makes this campaign a chance for Hulu to delight customers and earn more quality leads from social media.</p> \n<h3>4. Victoria Monet's \"Audience\"</h3> \n<p><strong>Channels:</strong> Instagram, Facebook, Billboards</p> \n<p>For the single, \"Experience,\" R&amp;B singers <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/victoriamonet/\">Victoria Monet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.khalidofficial.com/\">Khalid</a> collaborated with Spotify for a release campaign. The campaign included online and in-person marketing tactics and is the favorite campaign of HubSpot staff writer Jay Fuchs.</p> \n<p>In Canada, there was a billboard put up in Toronto, promoting the song's Spotify release. In response, Monet posted a picture on Instagram to share with her fans and promote the single:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FVictoriaMonet%2Fposts%2F3145924568836475&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=661&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"661\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>The use of online and in-person marketing methods makes this integrated campaign one that can be seen from anywhere. From the billboard in Canada to international Facebook and Instagram fans, the release of \"Experience\" was anticipated globally. In fact, in one month, the single became Monet's <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/63XBtGSEZINSyXylZxEUbv\">most popular song</a> on the streaming service.</p> \n<h3>5. Gillette, \"The Best Men Can Be\"</h3> \n<p><strong>Channels: </strong>Website, YouTube</p> \n<p>\"In 2019, Gillette launched its campaign, 'The Best Men Can Be'. The campaign included an <a href=\"https://t.sidekickopen79.com/s1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lM8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5X-FdSD1CN64k8yjQBdbMV1Xcyb5N-pjx103?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-4rCvX6W4hCVj23Fbt5SW4myB8V3QJdFtW3X-PC_4hnSjdW1VnjYP3M1XSvW4hLxWp3K6KcJn4fJgsx1V3&amp;si=7000000000560688&amp;pi=09f18490-1c40-4985-c598-cbf31cf36894\">inspiring video</a>, a <a href=\"https://t.sidekickopen79.com/s1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lM8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5X-FdSD1CN64k8yjQBdbMV1Xcyb5N-pjx103?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3P28cb3K9G6yW1JxwY51LwWgDW4hLTFJ3CcYkTW1LF6VG1Gyy3_W4fdhmr41n_sSf41n_n904&amp;si=7000000000560688&amp;pi=09f18490-1c40-4985-c598-cbf31cf36894\">landing page</a> that celebrates male advocates and leaders in the community, and a hashtag, #thebestmencanbe, to encourage user participation across social channels,\" says HubSpot Marketing Manager, Caroline Forsey.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/integrated%20campaigns-3.png\" alt=\"integrated marketing campaigns: gillette\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://gillette.com/en-us/about/the-best-men-can-be\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>\"The campaign, created in response to the #metoo movement, urged men to hold themselves to a higher standard,\" says Forsey. In the corresponding ad for the movement, viewers are shown hypothetical real-life instances of men stepping in to be themselves, and making positive change in their community. To heighten awareness of the movement, the landing page highlights real accounts of men upholding the hashtag Gillette created.</p> \n<p>\"While the campaign <a href=\"https://t.sidekickopen79.com/s1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lM8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5X-FdSD1CN64k8yjQBdbMV1Xcyb5N-pjx103?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3_R5ZJW3K9F8z3P7-dJW3XtNr93_rhg1W3ZY6x-4fGvkrW3K9FJ11GyZbyW45LLHw41n_L3w3ZY7qp48-2&amp;si=7000000000560688&amp;pi=09f18490-1c40-4985-c598-cbf31cf36894\">received some backlash</a> from both stakeholders and consumers, I think it was worth the price because it redefined the shaving brand as a relevant, values-oriented brand. For me personally, I shared the ad with all my male friends and family members, and it sparked a discussion — which, really, is what marketing is all about,\" Forsey commented.</p> \n<p>Gillette's tactic of getting their customers involved proved to be successful in the moment and long-term. Discussions, like the one Forsey had with men in her life, were happening nationwide. In fact, my university class had one about the campaign. This integrated campaign, boosted by real accounts, was proven to be not only successful but valuable.</p> \n<h3>6. REI, #RecreateResponsibly</h3> \n<p><strong>Channels:</strong> Website, Instagram</p> \n<p>Outdoor activity is at the core of REI's products. <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/\">REI</a> sells camping essentials, such as tents, clothes, and insulated containers.

The partnerships and REI's content share an educational message and an interactive component — making this campaign diverse and engaging.</p> \n<h3>7. Melt Cosmetics, \"She's in Parties\"</h3> \n<p><strong>Channels: </strong>Website, Instagram, Facebook</p> \n<p>\"She's in Parties\" is the name of an eyeshadow palette from Melt Cosmetics. Says staff writer Rebecca Riserbato, \"The purple palette sparked a hashtag of the same name on Instagram. On the <a href=\"https://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/shes-in-parties-stack\">landing page</a> for the collection, there's a section dedicated to Instagram posts with the hashtag.\"</p> \n<p>The campaign inspired a purple theme, which took over the company's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MeltCosmetics\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meltcosmetics/\">Instagram</a> accounts. Along with this social media content, influencers who were sent the palette began to upload their reviews on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIT5xKwMoYs\">YouTube</a>.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMeltCosmetics%2Fphotos%2Fa.517812678276981%2F3269799933078228%2F&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=627&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"627\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>For this launch, a variety of social tactics were used.

This tactic brings awareness to a social cause, a respected organization, and enhances a celebration.</p> \n<h3>9. The New York Times, \"The Truth Is Hard\"</h3> \n<p><strong>Channels:</strong> Commercial, Facebook, Billboard</p> \n<p>In early 2018, the newspaper <em>The New York Times</em> was struggling. With dwindling subscriptions and dwindling trust in the news from the general public, the team behind the famous publication had to <a href=\"https://droga5.com/work/new-york-times/\">figure out how to build widespread trust</a>.</p> \n<p>That's where \"The Truth Is Hard\" came in — it was a campaign designed to offer transparency. \"I think the best advertising not only gets you to pause and pay attention at the moment but also encourages the viewer to take action and learn more after the fact,\" says Alicia Collins, senior brand manager.</p> \n<p>\"<em>The New York Times'</em> 'The Truth Is Hard' campaign does that. It tells a clear and impactful story, and demonstrates the value and importance of journalism right away.\"</p> \n<p>Following a tribute to journalism at the <a href=\"https://droga5.com/work/new-york-times/\">2018 Oscars</a>, the campaign began.

The multiple channels used by the news source to restore their image to the public worked and made this integrated campaign a win.</p> \n<h2>Get Started With Integrated Marketing Campaigns</h2> \n<p>Integrated marketing campaigns can help increase brand awareness, generate leads, and delight your customers.

One of the main questions has been,<em> \"How are advertisers handling the mobile tracking changes?\"</em></p> \n<p>Earlier this year, we talked about how this change <em>could</em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/apple-ios-release-and-privacy-change\"> impact advertisers</a>, but now, we want to follow up. Have any new strategies evolved? What have advertisers been doing to reach their target audiences?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In this post, we'll discuss how advertisers have navigated the iOS 14 mobile tracking changes and give you a few tips on how to have continued success with social media and online advertising.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing in 2021 Report\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>Wait, what happened with the iOS 14 update?</h2> \n<p>To summarize, at the beginning of 2021 Apple released a new update that would impact the way that advertisers reach their audience. With the iOS 14 update users needed to opt-in, or give permission, to an app to track their activity outside of the platform.</p> \n<p>So, why were advertisers and marketers concerned? Well, a lot of ad campaigns target audiences based on their behavior online. If an app can't track that information, ads will become less personalized, and in turn, could be less effective.</p> \n<p>The concern for marketers was that they wouldn't be able to deliver their ads to people based on certain activities, like if they'd visited their website, for example. This meant that ads would likely have smaller audience sizes and less accurate reporting.</p> \n<p>Additionally, with this update advertisers are only allowed to use up to eight conversion events from a single website domain. This means if you run a campaign and track several different conversion types (like Lead, Landing Page Views, Purchase) you'll now be capped at eight at any given time.</p> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering, <em>\"What have advertisers been doing?\"</em> Let's discuss it below.</p> \n<h2>How Advertisers are Navigating the iOS 14 Mobile Tracking Changes</h2> \n<p>While the iOS 14 update has made advertisers jump through some more hoops in setting up their ad campaigns (getting domain verification and aggregated event management), the update ultimately hasn't been the death of retargeting or Facebook ads.</p> \n<p>Of course, there have been changes. So far, it looks like <a href=\"https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/\">more than 90%</a> of users are opting out of data tracking. This is more than industry experts were predicting.</p> \n<p>So, what have advertisers been doing?</p> \n<h3>1. Diversifying ad spend.</h3> \n<p>The main story of how advertisers are navigating the latest iOS tracking update is diversifying ad spend.</p> \n<p>This means companies have shifted some ad spend that was previously allocated to Facebook to other platforms like Google because of the remarketing features and the ability to target users based on search intent.</p> \n<h3>2. Reporting Facebook success with Google Analytics.</h3> \n<p>While some money is still being used to advertise on Facebook, there are different ways of reporting.</p> \n<p>Companies have begun using UTM parameters on their site's URLs to generate data tracked by Facebook to Google Analytics. This means you can use Google Analytics to track some of the activity on your Facebook ad campaigns.</p> \n<h3>3. Using owned data for lookalike audiences and retargeting.</h3> \n<p>Strategies such as using lookalike audiences or retargeting an email list have continued to drive results. With privacy updates becoming a norm for the big tech companies, marketers will need to begin focusing on owned data to inform their campaigns.</p> \n<p>With your owned data (such as an email list), you can target lookalike audiences <em>or</em> retarget those very people.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, you can still use the old method of retargeting campaigns because not all of your audience is on iOS devices.

Using other Facebook advertising options.</h3> \n<p>Besides these new ways of approaching ad campaigns, some advertisers are investing in other ways to reach audiences on Facebook.</p> \n<p>For example, you can use the messaging objective to create a lead-generating chatbot on Facebook Messenger. There are options to retarget users who reach out to you on messenger and start conversations with new leads who click on an ad of yours.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Facebook has another strategy that advertisers have explored: the Facebook lead ads (in-app lead form).</p> \n<p>While using your own landing pages is definitely the preferred method, in a cookieless world, using lead forms on Facebook can help you generate leads and capture first-party data.</p> \n<p>The iOS 14 mobile tracking changes have made Facebook ads less effective, but there are still ways for advertisers to target their audience and generate leads on the platform.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-advertisers-are-navigating-ios-14&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png","linkMd5":"d418d5e22221498a47fcb785524b9eca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-42-284_88b93bfb7be7b212.webp","destWidth":442,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5404,"destBytes":7216,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-42-284_88b93bfb7be7b212.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn53@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-44-178_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-advertisers-are-navigating-ios-14&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn98@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-48-659_7bc11e06f9062f97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741208},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"What is Data as a Service (DaaS)?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-as-a-service","description":"<p><em>\"The Cloud.\"</em></p> \n<p>It's a concept that has grown wildly within the past 20-40 years as technology evolves. But if you're like me, you might not know what it really means.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The cloud refers to how and where data is stored and where it isn't. It allows software and services to run on the internet, instead of only locally on one device, because the data is stored remotely across a variety of different servers.</p> \n<p>With this technology, companies have begun storing data online and modernizing their infrastructure, data management, storage, and analytics.</p> \n<p>While data management, analytics, and integration can sound like intimidating topics (especially to those of us that aren't mathematically inclined), it's so important for analyzing, strategizing, and increasing reliability in data for your marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>In this post, let's review what data as a service (DaaS) means and look at some DaaS companies to understand it better.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=78dd9e0f-e514-4c88-835a-a8bbff930a4c&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: 2021 State of RevOps [Free Report]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/78dd9e0f-e514-4c88-835a-a8bbff930a4c.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>DaaS companies focus on helping customers use their data in the most strategic, efficient way. Additionally, they help customers store their data and have impeccable search functions to make creating data reports easier.</p> \n<p>As we continue to get more data and insights into what works and doesn't, data-driven decision-making is becoming more and more popular among businesses.</p> \n<p>DaaS is similar to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/saas\">software as a service (SaaS)</a>, which are companies that offer software online and via the cloud, instead of needing to download or install a program. There's also <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/iaas-paas-saas\">IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service)</a>.</p> \n<p>Any \"as a service\" company is using the cloud to manage business resources. And while SaaS is a popular term that many people know, not as many people are familiar with DaaS. This is partially because data continues to get more advanced, with more storage capabilities and better analytics as the cloud evolves.</p> \n<p>DaaS companies usually are priced based on the amount of data storage that a business wants to purchase. Data is measured using the megabyte model.</p> \n<p>When businesses have an excess of data and aren't sure how to maintain it, DaaS is a popular solution. By using DaaS software, companies can immediately store and manage their data and will have greater flexibility when it comes to scaling up.</p> \n<p>By now, you might be wondering, <em>\"What are the benefits of using a DaaS platform?\"</em></p> \n<p>Well, one of the main advantages of using a DaaS platform instead of storing data physically on-site is automated maintenance. The DaaS provider will automatically manage data and keep the tools and services up-to-date.</p> \n<p>Additionally, DaaS is more cost-effective and will lead to more agile decision-making and faster innovation. This is because data will be the center of the business and used for strategic decision-making and data management.</p> \n<p>With a data-driven culture, an organization will be able to innovate and grow at high rates because its ideas and initiatives are informed by trustworthy data.</p> \n<p>For example, a company can use a cloud-based DaaS solution to manage compliance and scaling requirements, making it easier to adjust operations to fluctuating demands.</p> \n<p>So, what does this look like in action? And what are some examples of a DaaS company? Let's dive in below.</p> \n<h2>Data as a Service (DaaS) Companies</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com\">Snowflake</a></h3> \n<p>Snowflake is a DaaS company that provides data warehousing, data lake, data sharing, and data exchange capabilities. This was one of the first modern DaaS companies to provide data as a service products. With this platform, your company can store and analyze both structured and semi-structured data for business insights.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.sap.com/products/hana/cloud.html\">SAP Hana</a></h3> \n<p>SAP Hana is a high-performance in-memory database that provides advanced analytics on multimodel data, on-premise, and in the cloud. With this platform, you can build data solutions with modern architectures and gain business-ready insights in real-time.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/social-data-insight-cloud/csdsr/getting-started-daas.html\">Oracle DaaS</a></h3> \n<p>Oracle DaaS is a subscription-based marketing intelligence platform that leverages Oracle's acquisitions of Datalogix and BlueKai. Oracle DaaS for Marketing provides anonymous multi-channel data for marketers, and Oracle DaaS for Social provides social and enterprise data.</p> \n<p>As technology continues to evolve, managing, storing, and analyzing data will become increasingly important. And while it might seem confusing, DaaS companies can help simplify this process and make it easier to understand.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0da38821-2804-4d25-a136-7fc424550e22&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0da38821-2804-4d25-a136-7fc424550e22.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdata-as-a-service&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/78dd9e0f-e514-4c88-835a-a8bbff930a4c.png","linkMd5":"b4d88a8d2e4f83fc93fd4bb1b1d4f880","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-42-268_fee56ea57e83a38b.webp","destWidth":459,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5771,"destBytes":7582,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/78dd9e0f-e514-4c88-835a-a8bbff930a4c.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-42-268_fee56ea57e83a38b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0da38821-2804-4d25-a136-7fc424550e22.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn62@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-49-160_2c5a41873b11ba2d.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdata-as-a-service&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-45-767_9dc606e28ff40364.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741212},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"What Are Interpersonal Skills? + 5 Ways to Develop Them","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/interpersonal-skills","description":"<p>To succeed at our jobs, we often ended a wide range of skills, from simply communicating to in-depth product knowledge.</p> \n<p>Soft skills, like communication, fall into the category of interpersonal skills, and they are typically expected of everyone, regardless of the position you apply for.

For example, suppose you sense tension at work. You may pick up on this and use active listening to get to the root of the problem and then use effective communication to come to a resolution.</p> \n<h4>Why are interpersonal skills important?</h4> \n<p>Many career paths come with consistent interaction with people, whether coworkers or teammates, so it’s crucial to know how to interact with everyone. Without them, it would be challenging to perform as expected.</p> \n<p>Given this, employers look for people with strong interpersonal skills because it means they can work well with others and communicate in a way that drives business success. In some jobs, like customer service, strong interpersonal skills are critical.</p> \n<p>Most critically, interpersonal skills help us interact with others in a respectable manner. Even if you’re a software engineer who spends most of your time on the computer, you still need to interact with your teammates and sometimes explain technical details to those who may not have the same know-how, which requires good communication.</p> \n<p>There tends to be some confusion about interpersonal skills vs intrapersonal skills, so we’ll explain the difference below.</p> \n<h3>Intrapersonal vs. Interpersonal Skills</h3> \n<p>A few letters make up the difference between intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, but they are different. Specifically, interpersonal skills are how you speak to yourself in your mind, and interpersonal skills are involved in conversations with other people.</p> \n<p>However, both relate to each other through emotional intelligence. Having strong self-awareness (intrapersonal) can help you become better with interpersonal skills, as you’ll be able to manage your emotions, regardless of the situation, and respond accordingly. &nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Types of Interpersonal Skills</h2> \n<p>There are various types of interpersonal skills, and many complement each other. Below we’ll list common interpersonal skills and give examples of what they look like in action.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/communication-skills-sales?_ga=2.105815683.1496526183.1629501918-252241795.1629501918\">Communication</a></strong>&nbsp;— The way you communicate clearly and effectively with others.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/conflict-resolution-skills?_ga=2.105815683.1496526183.1629501918-252241795.1629501918\">Conflict management</a></strong>&nbsp;— How you deal with troubling business situations as they arise, whether mediating an issue between colleagues or seeking solutions for a personal matter. Regardless of your level of seniority, conflict management is an essential skill.</li> \n <li><strong>Empathy</strong>&nbsp;— Empathy is the most important interpersonal skill, as you need to have empathy, understanding, and care for those around you and that you work with daily.</li> \n <li><strong>Leadership</strong>&nbsp;— Involves being able to motivate and encourage others, regardless of whether you’re in a leadership role, and being able to step up to the plate in scenarios where a leader is needed.</li> \n <li><strong>Listening</strong>&nbsp;— Strongly relates to communication and empathy; you need to listen to your coworkers, so they feel comfortable, listened to, and valued.</li> \n <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>&nbsp;— As an employee, it is crucial to be able to get along with others and work as a team to get the job done.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Examples of Interpersonal Skills</h3> \n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 1216.5px;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr style=\"height: 125.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 125px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Type of interpersonal skill</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 125px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Example of interpersonal skill in action</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 209.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 209px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Communication</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 209px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Non-verbal communication and body language, public speaking, verbal communication, written communication, ability to develop rapport</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 125.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 125px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Conflict management</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 125px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>&nbsp;Problem-solving, active listening, mediating</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 181.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 181px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Empathy</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 181px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Being caring, compassionate, diplomatic, kind, practicing active listening, being understanding, developing rapport</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 209.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 209px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Leadership</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 209px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Encouragement, management, mentoring, motivation, dependability, consulting, constructive criticism, diplomacy, flexibility</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 181.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 181px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Listening</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 181px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Active-listening, curiosity, ability to focus and show that you’re focused, and listening to those who are speaking</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 181.312px;\"> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 260px; height: 181px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Collaborate</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 334px; height: 181px;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Ability to see both sides, make people feel respected and valued, work in teams, and understand team dynamics</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<h2>How to Develop Interpersonal Skills</h2> \n<p>Interpersonal skills are essential, regardless of the role you’re in. Here are some tips for developing your interpersonal skills and improving upon the ones you already have.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Leverage available resources.</p> \n<p>Look for online courses or books from experts that explain the importance of interpersonal skills and give tips on developing them based on their own experiences.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Identify areas for improvement.</p> \n<p>Identifying areas for improvement can help develop your skills.</p> \n<p>You can ask for feedback from people who work with you daily and hear about areas that they think could use improvement. If you work in customer-facing roles, you can monitor your NPS scores or customer feedback surveys to get a sense of where they feel you fall short.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Ask for feedback, and learn from it.</p> \n<p>One of the best ways to get a sense of your skill level is to ask for feedback on your current performance from people that interact with you every day, like colleagues, mentors, or bosses.</p> \n<p>For example, maybe you work in teams on a day-to-day basis, and one of your colleagues says that sometimes they don’t feel heard by you. You can learn from their assessment and make an effort to practice active listening.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Practice your skills.</p> \n<p>As with most skills, one of the best ways to develop them is by practicing them. Put yourself in situations where these skills will be required of you, like stepping up during team meetings and assuming leadership roles. As mentioned above, you can then ask for feedback from peers and learn what went right and what needs more work.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Recognize that there is no “end” to developing your skills.</p> \n<p>Although your desire may be to be perfect, there is no way to be perfect. Everyone is always learning on the go and developing their skills, especially since role requirements can vary.</p> \n<p>For example, working in customer service may require you to focus more on problem-solving and empathy, while assuming a role as a manager may require you to spend more time collaborating and conflict management. Recognize that there is always room for growth and development and, as long as you are aware of this, you’ll develop the skills you need to succeed.</p> \n<h2>Interpersonal Skills on a Resume</h2> \n<p>It’s important to emphasize your interpersonal skills on a resume, as many employers look for them. Sometimes interpersonal skills are referred to as soft skills instead of technical skills like having product knowledge.</p> \n<p>The most important thing to do is to identify the skills you have that match the job description of the new role, so you can explicitly demonstrate how they’ll help you succeed.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve identified these skills, you have three options for displaying them:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A simple bulleted list of skills,</li> \n <li>A bulleted list of your job accomplishments and the interpersonal skills you have that have helped you achieve this success,</li> \n <li>In a summary of your experience at the top of your resume.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As mentioned above, there is no finish line for developing your interpersonal skills. Those you need for each job will likely change depending on your industry, and it is always important to continuously be learning. However, leverage the tips on this list, put yourself in situations where you’ll need to practice your skills, and you’ll find yourself succeeding in your roles, regardless of whether you’re just starting out or are a seasoned executive.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finterpersonal-skills&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"346c227b49869f31d230def0cdb721f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn74@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-49-176_5d7cf3090735f322.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finterpersonal-skills&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn81@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-46-925_b53a5d9f7c7b8835.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741265},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"How Google's Head of Startups LATAM Helps Brands Globalize Their Business [+Tips for Marketers]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-head-of-startups-on-global-marketing","description":"<p>Nike.

It's why you hear about the Whopper in Spain, or spot Nike Jordan's on the streets of Indonesia.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, global marketing isn't just for big corporations anymore — nowadays, technology has significantly shrunken the 'cost per entry' when it comes to developing an international brand.</p> \n<p>With social media and search engines closing the information gap between countries, I'm willing to bet some international consumers have already stumbled across your business' website.</p> \n<p>But the question remains: <em>How can you properly market and sell to international audiences?

Start with an understanding of your global user.</h3> \n<p>When developing a global brand, you want to start by identifying the most important factor: To <em>whom</em> are you marketing?</p> \n<p>Your user(s) might vary in preferences or lifestyle from country to country, but their challenges — and how your product can meet those challenges — will remain consistent cross-globally.</p> \n<p>In other words, how your product can help a user in the U.S. likely mirrors how your product can help a user in Europe or Asia.</p> \n<p>As Barrence points out, \"What is always a good first solution is to start understanding who your user is, and who your user is <em>everywhere</em>, you know?\"</p> \n<p>Barrence adds, \"I think that startups begin building a product with a specific user in-mind — and startups operate on this idea of serving on a match need, or serving some particular challenge that hasn't been sold yet. And I think the beauty of technology is that you can basically serve the entire world at this point.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/andre%20quote%20on%20how%20to%20globalize%20your%20marketing%20efforts.png?width=1518&amp;name=andre%20quote%20on%20how%20to%20globalize%20your%20marketing%20efforts.png\" alt=\"andre quote on how to globalize your marketing efforts\" width=\"1518\" style=\"width: 1518px;\"></p> \n<p>At this stage, using highly effective analytics tools is key to ensuring you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/target-audience\">understand your global target persona</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you'll want to use data to determine which region(s) seem most interested in your products or services. This information will help you select a few countries for which you want to create a targeted, localized marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>2. Figure out which stories appeal to different audiences globally.</h3> \n<p>While your product might serve the same needs across the globe, the stories you tell to highlight your product's key benefits will vary significantly.</p> \n<p>As Barrence puts it, \"Once you've formed a hypothesis on who your user is and why they're searching for your product, you'll want to build a marketing strategy that is locally relevant, because the worst experience is when you're trying to solve for a local need of yours, and for something you're facing in your own country — but the product that you're searching for is built for a different experience entirely.\"</p> \n<p>This is where it's vital to build credibility in local regions.</p> \n<p>Credibility, Barrence adds, is a critical component that is oftentimes forgotten in the hustle of scaling a startup. Startups are often driven by performance — such as traffic, or user acquisition — and building a brand is usually an afterthought.</p> \n<p>This is a mistake, particularly when globalizing your business.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Startups are great at a performance mindset,\" Barrence says, \"but each time you're attempting to reach new markets, you want to make sure you're building a brand, as well.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Barrence adds, \"Once you test a few ways to position your brand in a local market, you'll want to start developing a more robust strategy for acquiring those users or creating stronger relationships with them.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Pay attention to local flavors when taking your product to the market.</h3> \n<p>There are a few key factors Barrence encourages every startup to take into consideration before expanding into new, international markets.</p> \n<p>First, it's critical your marketing team understands how to position your product in a new regional space.</p> \n<p>As Barrence told me, \"It's very hard for a startup to easily take a position in the [Latin American] market, for instance, because startups in LATAM already understand the user, and they know how to communicate with them and position themselves in the market … So ignoring the local flavors in how you take your product to the market is a big mistake.\"</p> \n<div style=\"\"> \n <img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/cpGF7jQdhyvY3xfm7jfffc.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; width: 1200px; height: auto;\" alt=\"andre interview answer\"> \n</div> \n<p>While he acknowledges this doesn't have to be perfect, Barrence does tell me the bare minimum requirements when marketing to new international audiences includes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Designing a localized version of your product — including language, user interface, and experience.</li> \n <li>Translating your materials into the local language, and using more relevant, local examples or references in your marketing messages.</li> \n <li>Offering support in the local language so users can access help easily when they have questions.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you don't have the time or resources to follow the above tips, you might want to reconsider whether it's a good idea to globalize — since without these fundamentals, your users will have a poor user experience and your brand value will suffer.</p> \n<p>Which leads me to my next point …</p> \n<h3>4. Know when globalizing <em>isn't </em>a good idea for your business.</h3> \n<p>There are plenty of startups and small businesses that likely have untapped potential in markets outside of their native countries … but there are still others who should focus their efforts locally, at least for the time being.</p> \n<p>So — how do you know which category your business falls into?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Barrence says it comes down to whether or not you have a strong foundation. As he puts it, \"One big mistake startups make are scaling prematurely; and the second big mistake is ignoring the signs that you haven't found <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/product-market-fit\">product-market fit</a>.\"</p> \n<p>If you try scaling prematurely, he warns, you risk compromising your existing user's experience and the health of your entire company. So it's better to be cautious here.</p> \n<p>He continues, \"I think testing the waters and making sure you know how to navigate not only the market, but also how to navigate your product and operations <em>within</em> that market, is key.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Barrence advises, \"Not having enough strong evidence for product-market fit is the potential dark side of globalizing your marketing efforts … [If that's the case], you should focus on building a successful business within your own country first.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As the world becomes increasingly connected, you'll want to dive deeper into your analytics to determine whether there is already a demand for your product or service outside of the U.S. — and, if there is, how you can address that demand with fresh, localized content or even revamp your marketing messages to ensure they're global-first.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the decision to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/global-marketing-and-international-business?_ga=2.118001358.692019943.1631738903-259665295.1631738903\">globalize your marketing efforts </a>isn't an easy one, but it could have big pay-offs in the long run. Among other benefits, globalizing your marketing materials expands your consumer-base and provides you with more opportunities to reach — and sell — to more customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8f18bb1a-03d7-4fb9-afca-66ac4ccebf6d&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"scaling showcase\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8f18bb1a-03d7-4fb9-afca-66ac4ccebf6d.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgoogle-head-of-startups-on-global-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/38d93e33-110d-4097-bb9f-3a38329eae3a.png","linkMd5":"04a6a6422d108050b1ed64cdc671e303","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-288_38a6c8c73a912088.webp","destWidth":470,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5393,"destBytes":7366,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/38d93e33-110d-4097-bb9f-3a38329eae3a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-288_38a6c8c73a912088.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/andre%20quote%20on%20how%20to%20globalize%20your%20marketing%20efforts.png?width=1518&name=andre%20quote%20on%20how%20to%20globalize%20your%20marketing%20efforts.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn15@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-45-843_c5a46ff5b3a4110e.webp","https://play.vidyard.com/cpGF7jQdhyvY3xfm7jfffc.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn56@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-48-275_6617db3435b3e687.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8f18bb1a-03d7-4fb9-afca-66ac4ccebf6d.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn12@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-48-049_dcf7aaf8330e44ab.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgoogle-head-of-startups-on-global-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn78@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-46-843_ddeec09542db6f77.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741229},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"Hard Skills vs Soft Skills: What's The Difference, and How to Improve Both","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hard-skills-soft-skills","description":"<p>I first heard about \"hard skills\" and \"soft skills\" in high school.</p> \n<p>Hard skills seemed to be the ones that everyone wanted, and soft skills were just personality traits that were nice to have.</p> \n<p>This worried me, as I saw myself as more of a people person than an academic.</p> \n<p>But, as I transitioned into college and the workplace, I found that soft skills are just as important, if not <em>more</em>&nbsp;important, than hard skills. While technical knowledge can get you a first-round interview, how you interact with others in an interview and in collaborative projects can seal the deal.</p> \n<p>Here, let's dive into the difference between soft and hard skills — plus, how you can include both on your resume to stand out to potential employers.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Click here to download leadership lessons from HubSpot founder, Dharmesh  Shah [Free Guide].\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png\"></a></p> \n<h2><strong>Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills</strong></h2> \n<p>According to an article by HubSpot, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/soft-skills\">soft skills</a>&nbsp;are a combination&nbsp;of people skills, social skills, communication skills, emotional intelligence, and personality traits that make it easy to get along and work harmoniously with other people.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, hard skills are specific, technical abilities required to do a job, and are usually acquired through education and experience. It’s helpful to look at these in comparison to each other, especially when building a resume.</p> \n<h2><strong>Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills on a Resume</strong></h2> \n<p>However tempting it may be to mass-distribute your resume when applying for jobs, resumes are not one-size-fits-all. Today’s diverse workplace means that different roles require tailored sets of skills.</p> \n<p>The \"skills\" section is an excellent place for customization because it highlights how well you fit into a role, as well as what makes you unique as a candidate. To figure out which skills to list, start with the job description of the position for which you're applying in the \"desired skills\" or \"requirements\" section. Hunt for keywords a company is looking for, such as \"project management,\" \"fluent in Mandarin,\" or \"proficient in HTML/CSS.\"</p> \n<p>For soft skills in particular, a tip is to look at the company website to get a feel for the culture/tone of the company and find out which qualities are most valued in employees. Specifically, if the company has \"Careers,\" \"Mission,\" or \"About\" sections, these are great places to start.</p> \n<p>As an aspiring HubSpot intern, one scan of the \"Careers\" section of the website led me to notice that the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/careers\">\"HEART\" culture code</a>&nbsp;was featured prominently. I knew it would likely be mentioned in the interview, which is why I listed soft skills like \"empathetic team player\" on my resume.</p> \n<p>Feeling under-qualified for your dream job? Thankfully, both hard skills and soft skills can be improved over time. In addition to traditional methods such as classes and on-the-job training, taking online courses is an accessible way to improve both hard and soft skills. There are also certification courses, such as <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-marketing?_ga=2.103615232.1442053283.1629658219-1614773588.1622572836&amp;_gac=1.61409886.1628174368.CjwKCAjwmK6IBhBqEiwAocMc8nmfJ6zC_RpH5vRJBa4W1OOTIBWeqEOVa_o9jf9GCzF59J36NX8oEhoCimYQAvD_BwE\">Content Marketing</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6?__hstc=20629287.f531b6964a389a3b70ee1e9e57e5e963.1622572840403.1629904264998.1629909521561.50&amp;__hssc=20629287.3.1629909521561&amp;__hsfp=4043529008\">Google Analytics</a>, that not only provide training but also tangible evidence of skills for employers.</p> \n<p>If you need help identifying and developing your soft skills, a personality or strengths finder tests like <a href=\"https://high5test.com/strengthsfinder-free/\">this one </a>can help.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hard%20skills%20versus%20soft%20skills.png?width=1200&amp;name=hard%20skills%20versus%20soft%20skills.png\" alt=\"hard skills versus soft skills\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<h2><strong>Examples of Soft Skills</strong></h2> \n<h3><strong>Empathy</strong></h3> \n<p>One of the key components of an emotionally intelligent employee/leader is empathy. If you can understand your coworkers and clients, you are better able to collaborate with them and build authentic relationships.</p> \n<p>One way to practice empathy is to be an active listener: Hold space for whatever others are going through and try to understand their perspectives.</p> \n<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3> \n<p>Going hand in hand with empathy, being able to communicate with people from diverse backgrounds is key in the workplace. In addition, with Slack, email, Zoom calls, and in-person meetings, an effective employee must know how to communicate clearly across various platforms.</p> \n<h3><strong>Adaptability</strong></h3> \n<p>In our ever-changing workplace, having flexibility and a positive attitude toward change is of utmost importance. Make sure to have concrete examples of your adaptability to bring up in a cover letter or interview.</p> \n<p>As someone applying for a remote position at HubSpot, I made sure to highlight my previous remote work experiences. I also discussed my time in both the advertising and automotive industries to showcase my adaptability.</p> \n<h2><strong>Examples of Hard Skills</strong></h2> \n<h3><strong>Bilingual/multilingual ability</strong></h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/08/03/globalization-future-covid-global-500-companies-supply-chains/\">Fortune</a>, globalization in this post-pandemic era is being \"radically transformed.\" As a result, knowing different languages can give you a major advantage in the job market.</p> \n<p>In addition to English, <a href=\"https://blog.rosettastone.com/8-top-languages-to-learn-for-international-business/\">Mandarin, German, and Spanish</a>&nbsp;are the top languages desired for international business. If you haven’t spoken a foreign language since senior year of high school, an app like <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\">DuoLingo</a>&nbsp;is a fun and straightforward way to help you brush up.</p> \n<h3><strong>SEO Marketing</strong></h3> \n<p>For all companies with an online presence, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), plays a huge part in attracting and retaining customers. Resources like <a href=\"https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo#\">The Beginner’s Guide to SEO</a>&nbsp;from Moz (an SEO tools and software company) are a great way to start.</p> \n<h3><strong>Data Analytics</strong></h3> \n<p>Data analytics is the process of obtaining insights from raw data in order to observe trends and draw conclusions. The best method for mastering this skill is through \"learning by doing\" — and the great news is, many of the top data analytics tools are free.</p> \n<p>You can start with trusty old Excel/Google Sheets and learn commands through video tutorials.

But if you don't post your content at the right time, most of them will never see it.So how do you figure out the optimal post time for your specific audience? The best way to find an ideal posting time is by testing the timing of your posts to see which post time generates the most audience engagement.</p> \n<p>If you lack the resources or time to conduct your own tests, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a>, a social media management platform with over 20,000 customers, has you covered. In 2020, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/#how\">their team analyzed</a> customer data to see what time and day their social media posts generated the most engagement.

Our social media strategies have to reflect this new way of life in order for our businesses to meet their goals.</p> \n<p>The chart below shows the global engagement on Instagram by the time of day and day of the week. Note: The time is in CDT. That means you wouldn't post at 11 AM for every timezone individually — 11 AM CDT works just fine across posts published for a global audience.</p> \n<p>Need a visual to strategize around?

We've summarized the key findings from their report into a quick cheatsheet that you can reference later.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Best Time to Post to Instagram Cheatsheet</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Time to Post on Instagram Cheat sheet\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-3.png?width=400&amp;name=When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<p>The day of the week on which you post can change how much engagement you get during that same time.</p> \n<p>Why? Think about the little differences in your daily mood and routine — the ones you might not realize you have — and how they affect your behavior. The same goes for everyone following your Instagram account.</p> \n<p>As much as we don't like to admit it, many of us check our social media first thing in the morning to catch up on the night before. Then, it's time for a lunch break scroll. Finally, we take one last look at what our friends and favorite brands are up to before bed. It makes sense that the heaviest engagement hours align with the way our audiences live their lives.</p> \n<p>Here's another look at the best times to post on Instagram each day as well as some additional insights from<a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/#how\"> Sprout Social</a>:</p> \n<h2>Best Time to Post on Instagram Each Day</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 11 AM - 12 PM CDT - Consider that most of your followers are taking a lunch break around this time and will be more likely to scroll through Instagram to catch up on the latest from their friends, favorite brands, and influencers. During these time periods, share content that is easy to engage with and share.</li> \n <li>Tuesday, 11 AM - 2 PM CDT - Similar to the above, lunch breaks are common around these hours. However, the longer timeframe can be a fitting opportunity to share long-form content like IG TV videos or even go live on Instagram.</li> \n <li>Thursday, 11 AM CDT - For these shorter lunch breaks on Thursdays, try posting Instagram stories with engagement boosters like polls, questions, and quizzes to get quick responses that users will come back to read later on.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When scheduling posts for Instagram, the same hours may not work for each day. Consider both the day of the week and the industry you're in (we'll talk about the latter in just a minute).</p> \n<p>Pro Tip: Post to Instagram between 7 AM and 10:30 AM CDT from Monday to Friday. You'll get the most consistent engagement that way because your content will have time to pick up views and shares leading into the peak engagement hours around 11 AM CDT.</p> \n<h2>Best Time to Post on Instagram by Industry</h2> \n<p>The general data above about optimal post timing is a great starting point for growing an engaged Instagram audience. But if you want to get more granular, here are the best times to post on Instagram if your organization is in the technology, restaurant, education, healthcare, and non-profit industries, according to Sprout Social's research.</p> \n<h3>Best Times to Post on Instagram for Technology Companies</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best time to post on instagram for tech companies\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-2.png?width=650&amp;name=When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Best Time: Monday 10:00 AM - 10:00 PM CDT</li> \n <li>Most Consistent Engagement: Monday - Friday, 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM CDT</li> \n <li>Best Day: Monday</li> \n <li>Worst Day: Sunday</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Best Times to Post on Instagram for Restaurants</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best time to post on instagram for restaraunts\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-1.png?width=650&amp;name=When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Best Time: Monday 9 AM - 1 PM</li> \n <li>Most Consistent Engagement: Monday 9 AM - 1 PM</li> \n <li>Best Day: Monday</li> \n <li>Worst Day: Saturday</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Best Times to Post on Instagram for Educational Organizations</h3> \n<img alt=\"Best time to post on instagram for education\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-Sep-10-2021-07-13-32-07-PM.png?width=650&amp;name=When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-Sep-10-2021-07-13-32-07-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"> \n<ul> \n <li>Best Times: Friday 4:00 AM - 5:00 AM, Thursday 2:00 PM CDT</li> \n <li>Most Consistent Engagement: Friday 4:00 AM - 1:00 PM CDT</li> \n <li>Best Day: Friday</li> \n <li>Worst Day: Sunday</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Best Times to Post on Instagram for Healthcare Companies</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best time to post on instagram for healthcare\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-4.png?width=650&amp;name=When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-4.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Best Times: Tuesday 8 AM - 12 PM, 5 PM - 8 PM</li> \n <li>Most Consistent Engagement: Sunday, 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM CDT</li> \n <li>Best Day: Monday, Tuesday</li> \n <li>Worst Day: Saturday</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Best Times to Post on Instagram for Nonprofit Organizations</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-Sep-10-2021-07-13-31-83-PM.png?width=650&amp;name=When%20Is%20the%20Best%20Time%20to%20Post%20on%20Instagram%20in%202021%3F%20%5BCheat%20Sheet%5D-Sep-10-2021-07-13-31-83-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Best Time: Wednesday 10 AM - 6 PM CDT</li> \n <li>Most Consistent Engagement: Monday to Friday from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM CDT</li> \n <li>Best Day: Wednesday</li> \n <li>Worst Day: Sunday</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Boost Instagram Engagement on Your Schedule</h2> \n<p>Organic Instagram engagement and a scheduled posting schedule go hand in hand.

Read on to discover what it is, the features it offers, and how it may affect global social media marketing. &nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"New Data: Instagram Engagement Report [2021 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What is Instagram Lite?</h2> \n<p>Instagram Lite is an <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.lite&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Android app</a>&nbsp;that is significantly smaller in size (2MB vs. 30-80MB+) than the original Instagram app, so users with differing cellular and internet connection can still benefit from what it has to offer without experiencing a lagging app or differing user experience.</p> \n<p>The goal was to create a more accessible app for emerging markets. Tzach Hadar, Director of Product Management at Facebook Tel Aviv, <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/bringing-instagram-lite-to-170-countries/\">says</a>&nbsp;“Our teams build these lightweight versions of our apps for people with low connectivity or limited data plans because our basic premise is to leave no one behind.” As such, Instagram Lite still contains many of the valued features within the original app:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Photo and video sharing</li> \n <li>Stories, stickers, and gifs</li> \n <li>Explore page and recommendation algorithms</li> \n <li>Messaging/DMs (groups supported)</li> \n <li>Reels and Reels tab</li> \n <li>Dark mode</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As it is a less-heavy load on devices, features that require significant data or connection have been left out, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Animations when switching between Stories</li> \n <li>Story filters and AR filters</li> \n <li>Swipe-to-type controls</li> \n <li>Going Live</li> \n <li>Shopping and Product tabs</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The app is able to save such significant space on devices by running off of code saved to the cloud rather than on the phone. Kelly Hendrickson, Social Media Marketing Manager at HubSpot, says “What excited me most about Instagram Lite is that it makes the platform more accessible. It requires less space on a phone as well as less data, making it easier to run. This is key in emerging markets.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Lite%20q1.png?width=487&amp;name=Instagram%20Lite%20q1.png\" alt=\"benefits of instagram lite\" width=\"487\" style=\"width: 487px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>Where is Instagram Lite available?</h3> \n<p>Instagram Lite is currently available in 170 countries, with India being the largest country of access. Worldwide release is set to happen soon.</p> \n<h3>What is the Instagram Lite UX like?</h3> \n<p>The most significant difference between the Instagram Lite UX is the quality of content on the app, and a lack of graphics and animations that need data to load. While images aren’t grainy or pixelated, they may not be HD in order to ensure that users can load content without experiencing any lagging. A prime example is that when navigating between two different Stories, the animation that is present in the original app is missing.</p> \n<p>Other than that, the Instagram Lite UX is not much different from the original Instagram app. For instance, users have the same profile tab (as shown in the image below) with their profile photo, follower and following count, an image feed, and a Reels tab for those who create them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20lite%20profile%20tab.jpg?width=307&amp;name=instagram%20lite%20profile%20tab.jpg\" alt=\"instagram lite profile tab ux example\" width=\"307\" style=\"width: 307px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/bringing-instagram-lite-to-170-countries/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The home tab, where your Instagram Feed is displayed, is the same as well, with the stories carousel in the top portion of the screen, the heart icon showing likes and interactions, and the messaging arrow button.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/stories%20carousel%20in%20instagram%20lite%20feed.jpg?width=388&amp;name=stories%20carousel%20in%20instagram%20lite%20feed.jpg\" alt=\"instagram lite feed ux example\" width=\"388\" style=\"width: 388px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/bringing-instagram-lite-to-170-countries/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>If you want to share a post on Instagram Lite, the post button is in the navigation footer instead of above the Stories carousel.</p> \n<h2>Will Instagram Lite impact global social media marketing?</h2> \n<p>When Instagram Lite becomes available globally, it will require marketers to pivot from typical Instagram marketing strategies. As it currently doesn’t support ads, marketers will have to focus on engagement and building an audience rather than using shoppable tools to drive sales. Hendrickson says, “Part of pulling back features, though, is the removal of advertising. This reminds us how vital Instagram is for brand awareness. When someone can no longer purchase from within the platform, you have the opportunity to influence their decisions down the road by becoming a valuable account for them to follow.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20lite%20q2.png?width=489&amp;name=instagram%20lite%20q2.png\" alt=\"how instagram lite will affect international marketing\" width=\"489\" style=\"width: 489px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>In addition, marketers will need to be mindful of the quality of photos and videos they upload, as the app is meant to save space and require minimal data usage. Instead, your Instagram Lite strategy may focus on high-quality copy and influencer partnerships in new countries as a means of attracting audience attention, driving engagement, and converting users to paying customers via links to website landing pages.</p> \n<p>Marketers will also need to create content able to be understood by those in different markets and relevant to their interests.</p> \n<p>Before Instagram Lite becomes available in your country, take the time to research emerging markets that already have access to the app, learn more about their interests and pain points, and begin creating a strategy that will help you show them the value you can provide.</p> \n<p>Then, when the app becomes available, you’ll be ready to leverage the information you learned to begin posting on the app.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"instagram statistics\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finstagram-lite&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png","linkMd5":"56e6bde3dd41df66d2922b7a184b680e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-42-516_7e54748a32aeb250.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5752,"destBytes":7844,"author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-42-516_7e54748a32aeb250.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Lite%20q1.png?width=487&name=Instagram%20Lite%20q1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-44-003_f20e97babb24c4b1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20lite%20profile%20tab.jpg?width=307&name=instagram%20lite%20profile%20tab.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn46@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-45-755_e4ab3dba8fdb70b4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/stories%20carousel%20in%20instagram%20lite%20feed.jpg?width=388&name=stories%20carousel%20in%20instagram%20lite%20feed.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn77@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-48-825_9268a3f4087d1c55.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20lite%20q2.png?width=489&name=instagram%20lite%20q2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn70@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-47-698_d48651b65d38daf7.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn58@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-44-186_a4245cc995397db3.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finstagram-lite&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741220},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"How One HubSpotter Created a Framework to Reduce Meeting Fatigue","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meeting-framework-reduce-fatigue","description":"<p><em>This post is a part of Made @ HubSpot, an internal thought leadership series through which we extract lessons from experiments conducted by our very own HubSpotters.</em></p> \n<p>A few months ago, I came to a startling realization: My job is meetings.</p> \n<p>Maybe you can relate. From morning to night, I spend my time jumping from Zoom call to Zoom call. I race to grab a snack in the two minutes I'm afforded in-between calls, and I'm mentally exhausted by the end of the day. It's a struggle to decompress before spending time with friends and family.</p> \n<p>And, equally challenging, the amount of meetings I have takes away from my ability to get my work done.</p> \n<p>I'm Chris Saly — an Engineering Lead at HubSpot.</p> \n<p>As an engineer, my day job was code. Sure, we needed meetings to discuss things and stay updated as a team, but the main mechanism and value of my job was the quality and reliability of the code I produced.</p> \n<p>Now, the primary value of my job is talking to others. Whether it's as a mentor, being involved in tactical decisions, or helping set a strategic vision, most of these goals are communicated through meetings.</p> \n<p>However, there are some very real consequences to my role as an EL. Among other things, my meeting-heavy life was taking its toll on my mental health, relationships, and workplace productivity.</p> \n<p>I knew something had to change. Here, I'll show you how I incorporated a framework into my calendar planning to reduce meetings, and take back control of my time.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5d5a32a5-6232-4c92-8e70-1bc1a712a6af&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Meeting Agenda Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d5a32a5-6232-4c92-8e70-1bc1a712a6af.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2><strong>My Job is Meetings</strong></h2> \n<p>As an engineering lead, I manage the 12 engineers in my group and provide a strategic vision for the pillar in collaboration with my project management, business system analysts, and design peers.</p> \n<p>We build internal tools and systems that support the HubSpot Sales, Success, Support, Marketing, and Operations teams to do their jobs day-to-day.</p> \n<p>As a result, in additional to the typical duties of an EL at HubSpot, there is also a healthy dose of stakeholder management thrown in, as well.</p> \n<p>The nature of my role means that meetings cover a wide range of topics. I might go from one meeting talking about the three year vision for HubSpot's Sales team, to a systems design discussion on something we're building right now, to a mentoring conversation with a Tech Lead and then into a critsit retrospective.</p> \n<p>What I've realized is that my job is now meetings.</p> \n<h3>What prompted this?</h3> \n<p>I noticed a a number of days over the last several months where despite finishing work at 5 or 6, closing the laptop and entirely disconnecting from work, I was still amped up and my brain was in 'work mode' at 9 PM.</p> \n<p>I was struggling to decompress. And considering <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/15/2210768/0/en/Nearly-Half-of-Professionals-Experience-Zoom-Fatigue-and-Burnout-from-Online-Meetings.html\">nearly half of professionals report a high degree of exhaustion</a> after numerous daily video calls, I'm willing to bet most of you understand this frustration.</p> \n<p>My calendar on Oct 28th last year is a fair example of what a typical day would look like before Christmas:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Start my day with a 1-1 with a Tech Lead to discuss mentorship and team health.</li> \n <li>Followed by a conversation across multiple product groups on the technical feasibility of a specific suggestion for a 2021 compass item.</li> \n <li>Then a kickoff meeting for our pillar that is partially selling the vision and partially a social chat.</li> \n <li>After a quick break we're onto an in-depth technical overview of a system we need to start using as engineers.</li> \n <li>Capping off the day with a meeting with ELs+Director in Flywheel that, depending on the day, might cover people management, technical visioning, or our groups strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings.png?width=528&amp;height=601&amp;name=My%20job%20is%20meetings.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"528\" height=\"601\"></p> \n<h3>So … What's The Problem?</h3> \n<p>While I was feeling overwhelmed, I didn't really understand <em>why</em>, so I took a couple of steps to figure out where things were going wrong.</p> \n<p>First, I made a table of all of my meetings, categorized by their purpose, and calculated the amount of time I spent on them on a weekly basis (see below for more details on this)</p> \n<p>I also did some soul-searching to see how I was feeling about my meetings. Whether there were days I dreaded, or days I really enjoyed, and tried to get in touch with why I felt that way.</p> \n<p>This gave me a couple of realizations. First, I realized the ratio of time spent on supporting teams that report to me, working with peers, and staying abreast of things happening in the company felt right to me.</p> \n<p>However, the sheer volume of meetings had crept up on me. Over the course of the previous six months, my group had <em>doubled</em>&nbsp;in size and meetings had passed a threshold without me noticing.</p> \n<p>I also realized my meeting load on a weekly basis varied depending on when all my recurring meetings happened to fall.</p> \n<p>And, perhaps most challenging of all, I realized there were no themes or focus to my meeting days. One meeting might be deep in the weeds, and the next would be a 30,000 foot view. Changing contexts throughout the day like that is hard, and takes unnecessary mental energy.</p> \n<p>Plus, as I'm sure most can relate, the pandemic made my life outside of work Zoom-heavy, as well, with remote birthdays and happy hours. All of which is to say: I was tired of all the screen time.</p> \n<p>When I thought about how this all affected me, I came up with the following list:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>I sometimes end the day not being able to turn of my brain and spend time with family &amp; friends.</li> \n <li>It's a mentally taxing thing to change contexts all day long time and it has an outsized effect on how much energy I have for myself at the end of the day.</li> \n <li>I often feel like I'm running in place trying to take notes, digest information, grab a snack, and use the bathroom as I go from one meeting to the next.</li> \n <li>I struggle to make time for things like AMAs, All Hands, Science Fair, Tech Talk &amp; Hub Talks. After Christmas I had a 12 week tech talk backlog because I just didn't have the time or capacity to watch them.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If this list resonates with you, don't despair and keep reading. Fortunately, I came up with a solution to my meetings-heavy job.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">A New Framework for Meetings</h2> \n<p>If my job is meetings, I needed a <em>framework</em>&nbsp;for those meetings to live in — which included boundaries and rules to keep my sanity, as the old ad-hoc approach clearly wasn't cutting it any more.</p> \n<p>First, here are the <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">boundaries I set in regards to my mental health</span>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>No more than 90 minutes of meetings in one go:</strong>&nbsp;There's only so long I can pay attention and go without a bathroom break.</li> \n <li><strong>Scheduled 15/30 minute breaks before and after any 60 minute block:</strong>&nbsp;I book these in as 'meeting gap' meetings on my calendar to stop people booking over them.</li> \n <li><strong>No more than 2.5 hours of meetings in the periods before or after lunch:</strong>&nbsp;If I go beyond this I can't decompress in the evenings.</li> \n <li><strong>Hard stop of meetings at 5 PM:</strong>&nbsp;I need at least 15 mins to wrap up my thoughts for the day, send a few slacks and take notes for tomorrow. Trying to send a message at 6pm when hangry isn't a good idea.</li> \n <li><strong>Friday has no meetings, and certainly no meetings after 3 PM on Friday:</strong>&nbsp;I use Friday as a catchup and focus day so keeping it free of meetings is key to that. I also need time to wind down from the week and if I'm leaving stuff undone it really affects my weekend</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Obviously, these aren't set in stone, and I'm willing to make exceptions to these if there is a genuine need e.g. If there's a critsit or a big business impact.</p> \n<p>But for regular day-to-day meetings, I've found there are very few meetings that can't wait a couple of days. I've also realized meetings rarely need to be more than 90 minutes.</p> \n<p>If I need exceptions to these boundaries more than once or twice a month, my spidey sense starts tingling.</p> \n<p>Once I set those mental health boundaries, I took it a step further by creating a table to organize my meetings and discover patterns.</p> \n<p>First, I put all my meetings into a spreadsheet, tagged each with some relevant tags, and used that as my basis for both analyzing and changing my meeting schedule. It allowed me to play with meeting cadences, and see how it would affect the overall picture.</p> \n<p>It also gave me a some data I could analyze to answer the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How much time was I spending with teams in my pillar versus my peers and the pillar structure versus the larger Revenue Product Group?</li> \n <li>How much time on broader company alignment like tech talk, AMA, science fair, company talks, etc?</li> \n <li>Was I over-indexing on supporting any particular group and did the overall balance feel right?</li> \n <li>Were there any low priority meetings that were too frequent?</li> \n <li>Was the meeting volume per week roughly the same? And is that what I wanted?</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings-1.png?width=624&amp;height=316&amp;name=My%20job%20is%20meetings-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"316\"></p> \n<p>Let's dive into some of the features of this table now.</p> \n<h3>1. Color Coding</h3> \n<p>I've been color coding my calendar for over a year now and it's been really useful, but it's been ad hoc and I often forget or change what the colors mean without thinking about it. This time I wrote it down to keep myself honest, and so I can refer back to it if I need to.</p> \n<p>Color coding my calendar makes it easy to see at a glance what my day and week looks like. If there are too many yellows or reds (meaning medium or high priority) on my calendar I know I need to reschedule or skip some meetings. If I have a day that looks like a rainbow, that probably means I'll be changing contexts all the time and should try to move things. If I have a solid block of color with no grey in it, I have no 'me time' and will be fried by the end of the day. Any of these things are enough to get my spidey senses tingly.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9323423?hl=en\">Here's how to change colors in Google calendar</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Meeting Frequency</h3> \n<p>My meetings had a jumble of recurrences that had grown organically and could be on any schedule, which led to a pretty messy and inconsistent calendar. To help make things clearer and more regular I've categorized them into buckets with default recurrences:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Weekly</strong>: High value, high impact. Things that require regular and high volume communication e.g. Direct reports/mentorship, an active project that is close to going live.</li> \n <li><strong>Twice a Month</strong>: Things that require ongoing close alignment e.g. same level peers and high stakes projects.</li> \n <li><strong>Monthly</strong>: Important topics that don't change all that rapidly e.g. skip-level 1-1s, project updates.</li> \n <li><strong>Every two months</strong>: Just keeping in touch e.g social and connection keeping, interesting projects but doesn't need active involvement.</li> \n <li><strong>Quarterly</strong>: Alignment and planning e.g. product group meetings, OKRs, etc.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Using this rubric has a few benefits:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>It made me think about the purpose of meetings and decide what the appropriate cadence is</li> \n <li>It gave me a common benchmark to compare meetings so I have comparably valuable meetings on similar cadences</li> \n <li>With most meetings now happening once or twice a month, I can often pair similar meetings on the same day which means less context switching.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. 'Week in Month' Meetings</h3> \n<p>Before I started this my recurring meetings were generally on an 'every X week' basis — as in all of my meetings recurred every 2, 3, 4 weeks.</p> \n<p>The change I've made here is to move all meetings to a 'week in month' basis. This means that instead of meeting with someone every four weeks, I'll meet with them every 3rd Thursday, or instead of every two weeks, it's every 2nd and 4th Tuesday.</p> \n<p>This approach has a number of benefits:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>It combines with 'meeting frequency' above to allow me to theme days and weeks so I'm not changing contexts all the time</li> \n <li>It gives a certain cadence to the month e.g. it's the middle of the month so I know I'm talking to team X this week</li> \n <li>There are 12 months in the year but 13 blocks of 4 weeks, so it inherently slightly decreases the number of meetings</li> \n <li>It frees up the 29th, 30th &amp; 31st as mostly meeting-free days</li> \n <li>Aspects of our business and lives often run on a monthly cadence and tying meetings to that same cadence can be a really useful tool. (Examples of this might include Irish public Holidays, which typically fall on the first Friday of the month and people often take the Thursday or Monday to make it a long weekend; performance reviews and ACR often happen at the beginning of the month; and sales have end-of-month targets, which leads to more pressure on the systems in the last few days of the month.)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All of this color coordination and categorization is well and good — but I'm betting you're thinking, <em>Well … did it work? </em></p> \n<p>Let's dive into results now.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">So ... Is It Working?</h2> \n<p>I've been making these changes since the beginning of the year and I've had great results so far.</p> \n<p>My mental health has improved and I have more time and energy for myself each day after work. I've drastically decreased the amount of days that I struggle to decompress when the work day is done.</p> \n<p>I've caught up on all the tech talks and I'm following up on action items from meetings more reliably and quickly. I also have more time to get non-meeting work done, and generally feel much more productive.</p> \n<p><strong>This was a fairly typical way for my calendar to look before:</strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings-3.png?width=624&amp;name=My%20job%20is%20meetings-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p><strong>And this is a typical week now:</strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings-2.png?width=624&amp;height=280&amp;name=My%20job%20is%20meetings-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"280\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, what worked for me might not work for you.</p> \n<p>But I encourage anyone who feels overwhelmed by their schedule to take the time to proactively assess and diagnose for redundancies, wasted time, or time that could be better spent re-charging. Simply taking the time to analyze my calendar enabled me to create a more efficient schedule that worked for <em>me. </em></p> \n<p>So maybe that's really the lesson here: Figure out how your job can work for you, not the other way around. Each person is unique with specific preferences, and if you don't fight for your calendar to look the way you need it to … who will? &nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=fc7ec4be-ccae-4854-ac92-35e53f69a4b5&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"meeting agenda template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/fc7ec4be-ccae-4854-ac92-35e53f69a4b5.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmeeting-framework-reduce-fatigue&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d5a32a5-6232-4c92-8e70-1bc1a712a6af.png","linkMd5":"e2966b4beb4575fd47143d323537df3b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-42-510_e04dc189aa5955e5.webp","destWidth":420,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4896,"destBytes":6586,"author":"Chris Saly","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d5a32a5-6232-4c92-8e70-1bc1a712a6af.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-42-510_e04dc189aa5955e5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings.png?width=528&height=601&name=My%20job%20is%20meetings.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn80@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-45-998_2ecb17d0cd19b9aa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings-1.png?width=624&height=316&name=My%20job%20is%20meetings-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn70@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-44-094_e09bd3469bd1f625.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings-3.png?width=624&name=My%20job%20is%20meetings-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn10@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-47-796_2ac6d4c36054cef2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/My%20job%20is%20meetings-2.png?width=624&height=280&name=My%20job%20is%20meetings-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn73@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-45-213_65ac7db48e2703e7.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/fc7ec4be-ccae-4854-ac92-35e53f69a4b5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn5@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-48-748_81c87ea5bdd83d60.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmeeting-framework-reduce-fatigue&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn70@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-44-916_2015a698fda7e219.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741237},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"11 of the Best A/B Testing Tools for 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-testing-tools","description":"<p>In the marketing industry, we treat experts like they’re village elders, soaking up every tip and trick they have to offer so we can implement them into our own work, desperately hoping for similar results.</p> \n<p>But, when you really think about it, marketing is always changing and experts often don’t have visibility into your unique context.</p> \n<p>This naturally begs the question: what should you do when you can’t find a solution to one of your problems on the internet?

How then, do you make the job easier (and more lucrative) for your salespeople?</p> \n<p>Predictive Lead Scoring can take the guesswork out of following up on leads. Let’s take a look at what it is and how it could help your business grow.</p> \n<h2>What is predictive lead scoring?</h2> \n<p>Before we define predictive lead scoring, it’s important to understand traditional lead scoring and its limitations.</p> \n<p>Businesses have struggled with prioritizing lead follow-up for decades. In many cases, salespeople are left to their own devices, using their best judgment to decide who gets contacted first. Marketers and salespeople use data such as demographic info (age, marital status, industry, role), to rank potential customers as to how likely they are to buy. Those who rank high on this scale are contacted first, while others are contacted last, or if time doesn’t permit, not contacted at all.</p> \n<p>The problem with this subjective process is that it’s … subjective. Salespeople are forced to rely on “gut feelings” and factor in their own historical experience to make this decision. Neither of these proves to be consistently accurate causing quality leads to slip through the cracks as they chase prospects unlikely to buy.</p> \n<p>Predictive lead scoring is machine learning that takes this theory one step further by using predictive modeling algorithms to analyze data from past customers and current prospects to predict future outcomes. Put another way, predictive lead scoring has the ability to create an “ideal customer” profile based on past buying behavior, and then identify which current prospects best fit that profile. It removes the possibility for human error or bias and instead relies on hard data to make its predictions.</p> \n<h2>The Benefits of Predictive Lead Scoring</h2> \n<p>If your marketing and sales teams have been struggling with identifying top leads and are unable to follow up with everyone that enters your database, predictive lead scoring may be exactly what your company needs. With a multitude of benefits, it’s like hiring another department to assist in new customer acquisition.</p> \n<p>The benefits of predictive lead scoring include:</p> \n<h3>1. Create Harmony Between Marketing and Sales</h3> \n<p>When there are so many leads coming in but not many sales being closed, these two departments may turn on one another. The marketing department doesn’t understand how they're providing a large number of leads that Sales can’t close. And the sales department believes that quantity is more important than quality, and they aren’t getting any <em>good</em> leads.</p> \n<p>Incorporating predictive lead scoring will help these two departments work together and produce more.</p> \n<h3>2. Save Time</h3> \n<p>An automated lead scoring system means that your marketing and sales teams no longer have to waste time vetting potential customers. Their time can be better spent bringing in more leads and following up on the right ones.</p> \n<h3>3. Remove Human Error</h3> \n<p>No matter how good (and quick) your employees are at reviewing potential customers, there will always be an inherent bias. People can’t approach a situation without drawing on memories of the past. No matter how objective they attempt to be, this bias will creep into every decision they make. Using a computer algorithm to make these decisions removes the possibility of human error or judgment.</p> \n<h3>4. Lightning-Fast Results</h3> \n<p>While it takes a little bit of time to set up, once predictive lead scoring is up and running, you’ll receive results considerably faster than you would if a person were doing the work. You receive high-quality, data-driven leads before a human employee could even get their coffee.</p> \n<h3>5. See Continual Improvement</h3> \n<p>As you close and service more customers, you’ll collect more data. The more data you have, the better predictive lead scoring works and the more data points you’ll have to work with.</p> \n<p>Predictive lead scoring is ready to work for you and make your marketing and sales teams more efficient.</p> \n<h2>How to Incorporate Predictive Lead Scoring in Your Business</h2> \n<p>Now that you understand predictive lead scoring and how it can revolutionize your business, how do you get started?</p> \n<p>HubSpot offers <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/lead-scoring?_ga=2.83103062.194752775.1625243417-947895004.1625243417\">Predictive Lead Scoring software</a> that integrates with your Enterprise CRM, providing machine learning that reviews thousands of data points across your contact base to identify your best leads.</p> \n<p>These data points are drawn from analytics (website and email behavior), firmographic information about the contact’s company and their relationship within HubSpot, and interactions that have been logged in the CRM.</p> \n<p>To use this feature:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Click the Settings icon in the main navigation bar of your HubSpot account.</li> \n <li>From the left sidebar menu, navigate to CRM &gt; Properties.</li> \n <li>Search in the <em>Contact Information</em> property group for<em> Likelihood to close</em> and <em>Contact priority.</em></li> \n</ol> \n<p><em>Likelihood to close</em> is a score that represents the probability of a contact closing as a customer within the next 90 days. It used standard contact properties and behavior to predict this. If the score or probability value is 22, that means there is a 22% chance of closing as a customer in the next 90 days.</p> \n<p><em>Contact priority</em> uses the<em> Likelihood to close</em> score to filter segments of your best and worst leads.</p> \n<p>As you accumulate more data, the system will improve itself, providing even better predictions and guiding you towards the most important leads. Because the program requires data to do its job, you will not begin seeing values for <em>Contact priority </em>until you have reached 100 contacts.</p> \n<p>If you want to see your organization grow and your team members flourish, predictive lead scoring is essential. Imagine what your business will look like in five, 10, or 15 years when the system you use to attract and acquire new customers is fully optimized.</p> \n<p>Give your marketing and sales teams a leg up on the competition and try predictive lead scoring today.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a9acb744-e030-4d0d-b01c-dda53a491663&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"How to Calculate Your Lead Goal\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a9acb744-e030-4d0d-b01c-dda53a491663.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftraditional-predictive-lead-scoring&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Sep 2021 21:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a071fb96-a9b0-4f90-aa1d-5c25c8136252.png","linkMd5":"d7d0a1ef93289b6943dac79917dba03b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn80@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-42-285_64c71326517e4187.webp","destWidth":544,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6269,"destBytes":8730,"author":"Sheryl Green","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a071fb96-a9b0-4f90-aa1d-5c25c8136252.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn80@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-42-285_64c71326517e4187.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a9acb744-e030-4d0d-b01c-dda53a491663.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn10@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-45-077_10b93f457b54b8ff.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftraditional-predictive-lead-scoring&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-43-911_50f373ffe82f2773.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741242},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"Cloud Integration: 6 Best Cloud Integration Platforms & Tools","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cloud-integration","description":"<p>Cloud-based applications make it possible for marketing teams to connect with customers, conduct critical research, and make data-driven decisions that can help boost ROI.</p>  \n<p>The challenge?

In this post, we’ll cover what cloud integration is and the best tools you can use to break down departmental silos.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=fd1d8911-635d-4be6-8755-5ab6a332b129&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download&nbsp;Now: Free&nbsp;Marketing Reporting Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/fd1d8911-635d-4be6-8755-5ab6a332b129.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Cloud Integration: When and How</h2> \n<p>As noted by research firm <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-21-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021\">Gartner</a>, the software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions market is on track to reach more than $122 billion in 2021, fueled in large part by the demand for agile and flexible applications that let teams work anywhere, anytime.</p> \n<p>The more applications your business uses everyday, the more complicated your IT environment becomes. As a result, it’s often worth deploying cloud integration platforms as soon as possible — companies can get familiar with key features and functions before application volumes begin to scale up exponentially.</p> \n<p>Integration itself can be handled in-house by deploying infrastructure and services that support cloud connections, but this approach is time-consuming and costly, even for large enterprises. Cloud integration platforms, meanwhile, are designed to streamline this connective process and reduce the amount of lead time required for deployment.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of Cloud Integration</h2> \n<p>Deploying cloud integration platforms provides several benefits for businesses, including:</p> \n<h3>Improved Collaboration</h3> \n<p>Silos are problematic for small businesses — if marketing teams are using one set of applications and data, while product development, production and HR teams are using another, the results can range from mismatched business objectives that limit ROI to duplicated work that reduces total efficiency.</p> \n<p>Cloud integration platforms offer a way to connect disparate applications and departments, making it possible for teams to leverage and collaborate on the same data in real-time.</p> \n<h3>Increased Visibility</h3> \n<p>Companies also benefit from increased visibility when using cloud integration platforms. By unifying application environments under a single solution, IT teams can easily see what’s happening, when, and why. As a result, companies are better prepared to deal with application conflicts or team requirements as they arise, rather than after the fact.</p> \n<h3>Enhanced Cost Control</h3> \n<p>Cloud applications left unchecked and unmonitored come with significant costs over time, especially if they’re continually collecting or using data. Cloud integration makes it possible for businesses to see what’s running on their network and evaluate how often applications are used, allowing them to better manage and monitor overall technology costs.</p> \n<h2>Potential Pitfalls of Cloud Integration</h2> \n<p>Generally speaking, cloud integration platforms streamline the deployment, use, and monitoring of cloud-based applications. The evolution of this market vertical means that substantive challenges are few and far between, but there is a potential pitfall that businesses must address: Choosing the right platform.</p> \n<p>With a host of options now available and each offering a different mix of features and functions, it’s easy to get bogged down in the details. The result? Businesses may end up selecting a platform that performs adequately rather than exceptionally given their specific mix of applications, services, and staff needs.</p> \n<p>Need some help finding your best fit?

It sounds 'woo-woo' but stay with me here. It's a philosophy that means we can attract into our lives whatever we're focusing on. More simply put, positive thoughts will naturally bring positivity your way.</p> \n<p>Organic marketing works similarly. The goal is to <em>naturally</em> attract your audience to your brand or business. But how do you do that?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In this post, we'll go over what organic marketing is and how it's different from paid forms of marketing.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>The main goal of organic marketing is to increase brand awareness and build a connection with your audience, whether through educational or entertaining content. Of course, as a business, you'll need multiple ways to attract leads and convert users. Organic marketing is just one way to do that (paid marketing is another, which we'll dive into below).</p> \n<p>With organic marketing, you can attract visitors to your site, who will hopefully convert to paid customers eventually. The goal is to keep your business top of mind when it comes time for a consumer to make purchasing decisions.</p> \n<p>Additionally, organic marketing impacts your paid marketing efforts because if someone organically comes across your website, you can retarget them later with paid ads (on social media, search engines, etc.).</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the goal of organic marketing is to drive traffic to your site. While you'll use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organic-vs-paid-social-media\">social media channels</a>, the best place to spend your time with organic marketing is SEO. In fact, SEO drives <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">1000%+ more traffic</a> than organic social media.</p> \n<p>To measure the effectiveness of your organic marketing efforts, you'll look at which content is driving the most traffic to your site, leads generated from those campaigns, and which channels drive the highest amount of high converting traffic to your site.</p> \n<h2>Organic Marketing Examples</h2> \n<p>Before we dive into the differences between organic and paid marketing, let's look at some examples of organic marketing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Unpaid social media posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, Tik Tok, etc.</li> \n <li>Blog posts (this very post you're reading is an organic marketing effort)</li> \n <li>Guest posts</li> \n <li>User-generated content</li> \n <li>Email newsletters</li> \n <li>SEO</li> \n <li>Online PR and link generation</li> \n <li>YouTube</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, let's learn a little bit more about inorganic, or paid marketing.</p> \n<p>Inorganic marketing strategies include paid search ads, paid social media ads, sponsored posts, display ads, video ads on YouTube, etc. With paid media, you can micro-target your ideal audience and reach people who might never have heard of your business otherwise.</p> \n<p>While organic marketing is more like word-of-mouth marketing, paid marketing is similar to sales-focused marketing. The goals for the two are very different. One is to attract audiences and increase brand awareness and the other is to convert audiences on a specific campaign.</p> \n<p>You'll measure the success of paid marketing through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend\">return on ad spend (ROAS)</a>, driving impressions, achieving high conversion rates, etc.</p> \n<p>Now that we know more about the differences between organic and inorganic/paid marketing, let's dive into how to build an organic marketing strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Analyze your current traffic habits.</h3> \n<p>To build an organic marketing strategy, you should analyze your audience's current traffic habits on your site and then compare them to your ideal audience.</p> \n<p>First, it's important to know where you get the most organic traffic currently. Is it from your YouTube channel, blog posts, or email newsletters?</p> \n<p>Then, think about how your ideal audience usually discovers a business like yours. Do they rely on industry publications, social media, or review sites?</p> \n<p>It's important to understand what type of organic traffic that your target audience is consuming so that you can create that content. Additionally, you need to understand what organic traffic is already working for your business so you can continue creating that content.</p> \n<p>Organic marketing only works when you truly understand your audience and what they want to see.</p> \n<h3>2. Create content.</h3> \n<p>Once you know which channels you want to focus on and where your target audience spends their time online, then it's time to start creating content. However, before you can just create content, you need to brainstorm the types of content assets you want to create and build a list of several ideas.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you want to focus on blogging, do your keyword research and competitor analysis, and then build a list of keywords you can create posts around. Then, you can start creating content.</p> \n<p>However, if you want to focus on creating case studies or research, you'll have to do first-hand research, and then decide how you'll publish your findings.</p> \n<p>Before you can create content, you'll need to know which platforms and channels you want to focus on.</p> \n<h3>3. Optimize your content.</h3> \n<p>If you were to ask what makes organic content work, the answer would be SEO. You'll want to optimize all your content so that it will show up on search engines and social media platforms. For example, the strategies might be similar, but you'll optimize your blog content, video descriptions on YouTube, and social media posts.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy\">optimize this content</a>, usually, the strategies involve incorporating keywords into your content, having a great design, and using metadata to let search engines know what your content is about.</p> \n<h3>4. Evaluate and improve.</h3> \n<p>Lastly, the key to any organic marketing strategy is to evaluate and iterate. You can use tools, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/seo\">HubSpot's SEO marketing software</a> to plan your SEO strategy, optimize your content, and measure real return on investment.</p> \n<p>This type of software will help you measure and keep track of your KPIs so you can see what's working and what isn't.</p> \n<p>Organic marketing is all about bringing people to you, instead of reaching out to people via paid methods. With organic marketing, you'll create several types of content to keep people engaged and interested in your brand.

LinkedIn data from the past year shows a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/why-skills-based-hiring-starts-with-job-descriptions\"><span>20% increase in managers</span></a> who don't have a traditional four-year degree. This trend highlights the push toward skills-based hiring, which prioritizes a person's capabilities over their credentials.</p> \n<p>Hiring for skill rather than a degree is a good step forward for all, and it's wise to leverage your strengths when going after a new role or promotion. That's why you want to make sure you have the right technical skills for your career path to stay competitive and advance in your career.</p> \n<p>Let's walk through all you need to know about technical skills and which ones you should look to develop as a marketer.</p> \n<h2>What are technical skills?</h2> \n<p>Often known as <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/hard-skills-for-a-resume\"><span>hard skills</span></a>, technical skills are easily defined and measured competencies you gain through training or education. They allow you to complete a job-specific task and often vary from one industry to another.</p> \n<p>While technical skills are typically required for engineers, business analysts, mathematicians, and scientists, more industries than ever need employees with technical knowledge. In fact, Gartner found that 58% of the <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-03-gartner-hr-research-finds-fifty-eight-percent-of-the-workforce-will-need-new-skill-sets-to-do-their-jobs-successfully\"><span>workforce needs new skills</span></a> to successfully do their jobs. This is largely due to the digital transformation and massive increase in data, which requires people who can use technology to interpret data and take action to drive a company forward.</p> \n<p>Before scrambling into a data analysis course, it's important to realize that there are dozens of technical skills that don't require you to become part marketer, part computer scientist. Let's take a look at the different types of skills so you know which are right for you.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #434343;\">Types of Technical Skills</span></h3> \n<p>With rapidly advancing technology, nearly every role requires some sort of technical skill. Here are several types you may come across in the marketing world.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lDtZpD1aZFsWHuLRxxKGgy69ShfwenwENaoCkkiVJ0qm3c_Wt0JnhF4041IMwem7tpzCoKHFHWdk4EEUeiggV72-eGflgmeOlt_0BP94kUyu3wR1_LHSJpRDJ_tIDVzyPDNmQ_s8=s0\" width=\"556\" height=\"368\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thebalancecareers.com/marketing-skills-list-2062431\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<p>While the skills associated with creativity, negotiation, stress management, communication, and public speaking are usually considered \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/soft-skills\"><span>soft skills</span></a>,\" categories like technology and analytical thinking involve technical skills.</p> \n<p>Similar to technical skills, soft skills are learned through experience or education. These skills are harder to measure, but you'll need them to communicate with your team, negotiate a project deadline, come up with creative ideas, and prioritize your workload.</p> \n<p>For example, a project manager may have a positive attitude and excellent time management skills (both soft skills), but understanding the ins and outs of the company's CMS system (a technical skill) is crucial for timely deliverables and successful projects.</p> \n<p>Here's an overview of the types of technical skills needed for different marketing roles.</p> \n<h4>Digital Media and Design</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Graphic design software (Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere)</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Content management systems (CMS)</li> \n <li>Image and file management</li> \n <li>Content curation</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Project Management</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Project management software (such as Asana, Trello, or ClickUp)</li> \n <li>Budget planning</li> \n <li>Risk management</li> \n <li>Project planning</li> \n <li>Content management systems (CMS)</li> \n <li>Task management</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Marketing and Content Creation</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Data analysis</li> \n <li>Campaign management</li> \n <li>Budgeting</li> \n <li>Content management systems (CMS)</li> \n <li>Interviewing</li> \n <li>Vendor management</li> \n <li>Pitching</li> \n <li>Copywriting</li> \n <li>Editing</li> \n <li>Researching and reporting</li> \n <li>SEO/SEM</li> \n <li>Digital ad management</li> \n <li>Social media marketing</li> \n <li>Content strategy</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Technical Skills in the Workplace</h2> \n<p>Now that you know what type of technical skills apply to your field, how do you know which to develop? To understand which skills are most important for the future, LinkedIn performed a study to find the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/learning-and-development/most-in-demand-skills-2020\"><span>most in-demand skills</span></a>—several of which apply to marketers.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xwOvNDNV7Nh9NNeECA-m7aC0GmJjK8WDMr8JTvqDIN-BjKd6R52MNlhuoeqF8vyh7pI7Vlc-CUzMDX_6R-pKZURSZZsuX5Tg-SvrjfwaWi-L0vtjzp1JAPa508R0P5y_AxHZLLle=s0\" width=\"407\" height=\"601\" alt=\"Skills Companies Need Most\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/learning-and-development/most-in-demand-skills-2020\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<p>Technical skills like analytical reasoning, affiliate marketing, and business analysis are essential to succeeding as a marketer. But you'll need more than those to build a thriving career. To understand the skills you need in the workplace, start by looking at job descriptions for positions you want now — and in the future.</p> \n<p>Hiring managers often create a list of \"required\" and \"recommended\" skills they want candidates to have. Required skills are often the technical skills you need to perform the job well after you're hired, while recommended skills are capabilities the company is willing to help you develop through training.</p> \n<p>Once you've scoured job descriptions and created a list of technical skills employers look for, it's also smart to talk with your manager about the skills you need to advance your career. They should be able to point you in the right direction for your individual development.</p> \n<p>If you work for a supportive company, your manager may offer resources to help you work toward those skills. This could include stipends for books, courses, certifications, or schooling. Or it could mean putting you on projects that give you hands-on experience, like managing the budget for a social campaign or designing the visuals for the weekly email newsletter.</p> \n<p>Technical skills in marketing vary by role, so it's important to do your research and consider your career path before asking your manager for help. If they don't know which direction you want to go, they won't be able to provide the specific skills you'll need to get there.</p> \n<p>Look at the examples below to highlight the skills you already have and learn more about which ones you may need.</p> \n<h3>Examples of Technical Skills in the Workplace</h3> \n<h4>Digital Media and Design</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Graphic and web design (Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere)</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>UX/UI research and design</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Database management</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Animation</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Interactive media management</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Usability testing</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Photography</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Content management systems (Notion, Asana, Monday, Trello, WordPress, Squarespace, Wix)</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>HTML, CSS, Java, or other coding languages</li> \n <li>Data visualization</li> \n <li>Video and audio production</li> \n <li>Typography</li> \n <li>Wireframing</li> \n <li>Prototyping</li> \n <li>Color theory</li> \n <li>User modeling</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Project Management</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Microsoft Office</li> \n <li>Google Suite</li> \n <li>Content management systems (CMS)</li> \n <li>Project management software</li> \n <li>Budget planning</li> \n <li>Risk management</li> \n <li>Project planning</li> \n <li>Task management</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Marketing</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Campaign management</li> \n <li>Managing budgets</li> \n <li>Search engine optimization (SEO)</li> \n <li>Search engine marketing (SEM)</li> \n <li>Content management systems (CMS)</li> \n <li>Vendor management</li> \n <li>Social media management</li> \n <li>Ad targeting</li> \n <li>Content strategy</li> \n <li>Brand positioning and strategy</li> \n <li>Paid media management</li> \n <li>A/B testing</li> \n <li>Digital strategy</li> \n <li>Email marketing</li> \n <li>Web analytics</li> \n <li>Automation software</li> \n <li>Conversion rate optimization</li> \n <li>Omnichannel strategy</li> \n <li>Event planning</li> \n <li>Product management</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Content Creation</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Copywriting</li> \n <li>Technical writing</li> \n <li>Editing</li> \n <li>Pitching</li> \n <li>Researching and reporting</li> \n <li>UX copywriting</li> \n <li>SEO/SEM knowledge</li> \n <li>Content strategy and management</li> \n <li>Social media</li> \n <li>Email marketing</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Analytics</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Data analysis</li> \n <li>Demographics reporting</li> \n <li>Digital media testing</li> \n <li>Google Analytics</li> \n <li>Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint</li> \n <li>MATLAB</li> \n <li>Python</li> \n <li>SQL and NoSQL</li> \n <li>Identifying key performance indicators</li> \n <li>Setting metrics benchmarks</li> \n <li>Linear algebra and calculus</li> \n <li>Data visualization</li> \n <li>Data cleaning</li> \n <li>Working with APIs</li> \n <li>Tagging</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Technical Skills to Put on a Resume</h2> \n<p>After scanning the above lists, you may have more technical skills than you realized. So which should make it on your resume?</p> \n<p>You want to highlight the skills you already have, or can easily develop, that are most relevant to the position. Aim for a list of 10-20 skills with a mix of both soft and technical skills. Pay attention to the skills listed in the \"required\" section of a job description because listing those on your resume will make you a more competitive candidate.</p> \n<p>If you have a unique technical skill for your field that an employer is looking for (say, you're a Social Media Manager and an Adobe InDesign whiz), bump it to the top of your skill list to make your resume stand out.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, certain skills are more in-demand than others. Here are the <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/in-demand-skills/\"><span>top 20 skills</span></a> you should consider adding to your resume (if you have them), according to Indeed.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Cloud computing</li> \n <li>Artificial intelligence</li> \n <li>Sales leadership</li> \n <li>Analysis</li> \n <li>Translation</li> \n <li>Mobile app development</li> \n <li>People management</li> \n <li>Video production</li> \n <li>Audio production</li> \n <li>UX design</li> \n <li>SEO/SEM marketing</li> \n <li>Blockchain</li> \n <li>Industrial design</li> \n <li>Creativity</li> \n <li>Collaboration</li> \n <li>Adaptability</li> \n <li>Time management</li> \n <li>Persuasion</li> \n <li>Digital journalism</li> \n <li>Animation</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Of course, you don't want to oversell your capabilities. Make sure you actually have every skill listed on your resume. If a future employer catches you in a lie, that will be the end of your opportunity for landing the job — and it could tarnish your reputation for future roles as well.</p> \n<h2>Importance of Technical Skills</h2> \n<p>Marketing, especially digital marketing, revolves around data. The <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/818754/global-marketing-data-market-size/\"><span>global marketing data market</span></a> is projected to grow to $52.3 billion in 2021, with nearly 62% of senior industry experts using a data-sharing solution to support their teams' <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1206485/data-sharing-solutions-marketing-usa/\"><span>marketing and advertising</span></a> efforts.</p> \n<p>Marketers use data to connect with audiences, create innovative campaigns, convert people to customers, and keep buyers coming back. But leveraging data requires certain skills.</p> \n<p>Having the sought-after technical skills lets you excel at your job and makes you a more competitive candidate for future roles. The more skills you have, the more opportunities you have to take on senior-level positions and earn a higher salary.</p> \n<p>Consider the difference between the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics national wage estimates for Marketing Specialists versus Marketing Managers. Marketing Managers, who have considerably more experience and technical skills, make an estimated $80,500 more per year than Marketing Specialists.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U6aStaJtqo1hc12MzAxChmKXHdQUJLoh33-vINnNqPfvEaObWp8xJXFPumAcZ6E-XnTNorauUAnzGAkd3kjp1CN8RW9C6ozngEUjiYxtv91a9rqi-Yo546AzF40vxFgHuXU-2Q35=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"132\" alt=\"National Estimates for Marketing Research Analysts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes131161.htm\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/X1jsGz8joqIwvEnOdi5nWfH0VL28NP4CdudNL7H2w7U9j7ZLjhtzV3nU3URJf1-A6klwN8_QlPCJ5aK_Ws4amB8zcFC362-Cx3SgmGV059jNioE7eVT36AMeeUZefBRno_lg_rCy=s0\" width=\"465\" height=\"134\" alt=\"National estimates for Marketing Managers\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes112021.htm\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<p>The correlation between income and technical skills is also consistent with other industries. In 2021, the largest <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1198202/average-salary-premium-by-tech-job-skill-area/\"><span>average salary premium</span></a> in the North American technology industry was estimated to be nearly $24,969 for IT automation expertise, followed by AI and machine learning with $14,175, and fintech with $13,799.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, learning technical skills is one way to boost your income. But it's not all you need for long-term career success.</p> \n<h3>Soft Skills vs. Technical Skills</h3> \n<p>Creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence are common soft skills, which are just as important as technical skills for landing a job and growing your career.</p> \n<p>Whether you're a social media specialist or a digital media analyst, you'll need certain soft skills to complement your technical knowledge and get the job done. Each marketing role has its own requirements, so do the same research that you did for the technical skills. If you get stuck, consider if you have any of the following in-demand soft skills.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Ability to meet deadlines</li> \n <li>Decision making</li> \n <li>Handling criticism</li> \n <li>Attention to detail</li> \n <li>Critical thinking</li> \n <li>Teamwork</li> \n <li>Time management</li> \n <li>Multitasking</li> \n <li>Organizational skills</li> \n <li>Prioritizing</li> \n <li>Problem-solving</li> \n <li>Working independently</li> \n <li>Working remotely</li> \n <li>Collaboration</li> \n <li>Persuasion</li> \n <li>Adaptability</li> \n <li>Emotional intelligence</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Technical Skills Over Time</h2> \n<p>Mastering the technical skills you need as a marketer is never done. Technology evolves, algorithms change, and new social media platforms pop up often.</p> \n<p>To stay on top of your game, you have to keep your technical skills sharp. Use them as frequently as possible, and pick up new skills when needed. I've witnessed many situations where a junior marketing hire teaches a seasoned pro a thing or two about developing a social media strategy or how to reach a certain audience.</p> \n<p>Honing your technical skills is a life-long process. So never assume you're safe to kick back and do well at your job without learning anything new. And when you do pick up a new skill or enhance a skill that you have, add it to your resume and LinkedIn profile.</p> \n<p>Because for any role, employers want candidates who have the skills they need to do their job effectively and drive company growth.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftechnical-skills&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"539e77abd4171705d730250959948a83","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"Katrina Kirsch","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lDtZpD1aZFsWHuLRxxKGgy69ShfwenwENaoCkkiVJ0qm3c_Wt0JnhF4041IMwem7tpzCoKHFHWdk4EEUeiggV72-eGflgmeOlt_0BP94kUyu3wR1_LHSJpRDJ_tIDVzyPDNmQ_s8=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn21@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-46-243_bcf4778229b836af.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xwOvNDNV7Nh9NNeECA-m7aC0GmJjK8WDMr8JTvqDIN-BjKd6R52MNlhuoeqF8vyh7pI7Vlc-CUzMDX_6R-pKZURSZZsuX5Tg-SvrjfwaWi-L0vtjzp1JAPa508R0P5y_AxHZLLle=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-44-399_6ed2c605f982242a.webp","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U6aStaJtqo1hc12MzAxChmKXHdQUJLoh33-vINnNqPfvEaObWp8xJXFPumAcZ6E-XnTNorauUAnzGAkd3kjp1CN8RW9C6ozngEUjiYxtv91a9rqi-Yo546AzF40vxFgHuXU-2Q35=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn26@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-45-517_f7ab1751849d8258.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/X1jsGz8joqIwvEnOdi5nWfH0VL28NP4CdudNL7H2w7U9j7ZLjhtzV3nU3URJf1-A6klwN8_QlPCJ5aK_Ws4amB8zcFC362-Cx3SgmGV059jNioE7eVT36AMeeUZefBRno_lg_rCy=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn63@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-44-051_6331f20d7ad67f61.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-47-520_15a22acbc5258093.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftechnical-skills&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-46-166_2c8f365eb8419ad8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741257},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"What is Expert Power and How Can You Develop It?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/expert-power","description":"<p>Have you heard the expression that it takes <a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/05/is-it-true-that-10000-hours-of-practice-will/\">10,000 hours of deliberate practice</a> to make you an expert?</p> \n<p>That's approximately 417 days if you were practicing 24 hours a day.

Many times those who have expert power are in positions of leadership, however, this doesn't always have to be the case.</p> \n<p>Expert power is situational and anyone can have it in different areas. As a millennial, growing up with technology, I'm often perceived as an expert in social media. After talking to me and hearing me discuss my love of reality TV, I'm usually given expert power in pop culture as well.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if I was talking to my uncle, who is in a high leadership position in finance, I would have no expert power in that scenario. Expert power can switch dynamics depending on the subject matter.</p> \n<p>When you have expert power at work, you'll stand out in your career, rise the ranks to leadership, and display confidence in your area of expertise because of your high skill level.</p> \n<p>With expert power, you'll be trusted with high-pressure decisions and you'll feel more confident in your ability to make those decisions because of your expertise. Now, let's discuss the benefits of having expert power.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of Expert Power</h2> \n<h3>1. Streamlined business decisions.</h3> \n<p>With expert power comes the ability to make more informed, streamlined decisions for your company. The longer you do something, and the more you focus on your education in that area, the better decisions you'll make, and the more confident you'll be in those decisions.</p> \n<p>For example, when I was first getting started in writing, my process wasn't refined or streamlined. It took me much longer to complete writing tasks. Now that I've been a writer for over 10 years, I can write much quicker, and make better decisions in my writing. I know when I'm researching what to include and what not to include. That confidence and ability come with time, continuously working with my mentors and managers on my skills, and getting consistent feedback.</p> \n<p>When you have expert power in a certain area, your decisions are more streamlined, quicker, confident, and efficient.</p> \n<h3>2. Opportunity for career advancement.</h3> \n<p>One of the main benefits of expert power in the workplace is the ability to advance your career (hopefully at an accelerated pace). When you're getting started in your career, a great thing to do is spend a lot of time learning and developing your expertise.</p> \n<p>Once it becomes clear that you're focused on a certain area and developing certain skills, you'll have perceived expert power and be able to advance your career. Personally, I've been able to achieve promotions and advance my career because of my expert power in writing.</p> \n<h3>3. Developed leadership skills.</h3> \n<p>Besides gaining confidence and being able to further your career, you'll also be developing your leadership skills, which will be a huge benefit to your career. While I might not have expert power in something like engineering, I'm confident in my ability to lead a team of writers, because I've worked on enough teams and been doing this for a certain amount of time.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to note that just because you're an expert in a certain field doesn't mean you'll necessarily be a good leader. That's why it's important to continue developing expert power and leadership skills. Let's dive into how to do that below.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Deliberate practice.</h3> \n<p>Becoming an expert in your field doesn't mean that you can just show up and achieve expertise through osmosis. You have to be deliberately practicing and studying. This means that the first step to developing expert power is to practice, practice, practice. Whether it's a tactical skill like construction or a conceptual skill like business strategy, you need to immerse yourself in the world. This means you might have to work an entry-level job to gain real-world experience in your industry.</p> \n<h3>2. Work with mentors and leaders.</h3> \n<p>The best way to continue developing your expert power is to work with mentors and leaders from who you can learn. Having a mentor means soaking up their knowledge, asking them for tips and advice, discussing what's going well in your career and what isn't going well, and then just listening. Expertise comes from experience and you can benefit from listening to the stories of other people's experiences. Additionally, you'll gain leadership skills by studying how your mentors lead others.</p> \n<h3>3. Volunteer your expertise.</h3> \n<p>Whatever level of expertise you have, don't be afraid to share it. If you work in a corporate setting and are a developing business leader, share your experiences and what you've learned when your team is discussing strategy. Don't be afraid to enter those conversations. Not only will people begin to realize that you're an expert in a certain area, but you'll also learn a lot from other people's feedback.</p> \n<h3>4. Never stop being a student in your industry.</h3> \n<p>To be an expert in something you also have to be a student in that industry. If you stop being a student, then your expertise will expire. You should read books, stay up to date with the news and trends in your field, and volunteer for projects at your workplace so you can soak up knowledge. That's how you'll truly develop expert power and maintain it.</p> \n<h3>5. Keep your credibility.</h3> \n<p>You'll only have expert power if you have credibility in your field. Maintaining your ethics and reliability is of vast importance because expert power only comes to those who can be trusted to make strategic business decisions on an ongoing basis. If your expertise is haphazard you won't have perceived power from those around you.</p> \n<h3>6. Work in a fast-paced environment.</h3> \n<p>A great way to develop expert power is to work in a fast-paced environment and learn to make strategic, decisive choices quickly. This means keeping yourself cool, calm, and collected in the face of a critical situation. With this experience, you'll develop excellent expert power and leadership skills.</p> \n<h3>7. Lead with HEART.</h3> \n<p>At HubSpot, our culture is defined by having <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx\">HEART</a> -- Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, Transparent. We have a culture of amazing, growth-minded people whose values include using good judgment and solving for the customer. These traits will help you develop expert power because you'll be remarkable in your industry, but also humble enough to adapt and listen to those who have expert power in areas that you don't.</p> \n<h3>8. Be solution-oriented.</h3> \n<p>Something I'm always trying to develop as an aspiring business leader is to be solution-oriented. When you come to your manager with a problem, have a few solutions ready as well. This will help you develop your expert power because you'll get immediate feedback from your manager on your solutions. They'll be able to tell you from their experience if those solutions will work, and then you'll level up your expertise with every problem you face.</p> \n<p>Expert power is something that is hugely important for aspiring business leaders because it's this power that gives you the ability to lead with confidence and humility. With those two things, you'll be successful in whatever industry you choose.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fexpert-power&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"afea222b43ffc0de76539d6d706a08d9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Expert%20Power%20and%20How%20Can%20You%20Develop%20It%3F.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn44@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-46-010_e007dfbf744fb9d9.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-47-520_15a22acbc5258093.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fexpert-power&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-48-102_b04d2123618499cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741209},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"12 Gantt Chart Examples You'll Want to Copy","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gantt-chart-example","description":"<p>Gantt charts.

A milestone for a blog launch might be, “<em>Blog post draft due on 5/30.</em>”</li> \n <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> There are specific things that need to be completed along the way of your project. In our blog post example, a task might be, <em>“Edit blog post.</em>”</li> \n <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> Tasks on your Gantt chart will be related to each other, for example, the editor won’t be able to complete her task of editing the blog post until the writer has met their milestone and submitted their draft on 5/30. These are dependencies and should be noted in your chart.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Benefits of Using a Gantt Chart</h3> \n<p>The main goal of a Gantt chart is to track the timeline and completion of a project. It’s beneficial for project managers who need to keep team momentum on campaigns with many moving parts, like product launches or marketing events. Here are some additional benefits of using Gantt charts:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Visual tracking gives an overarching view of projects and their timelines, helping DRIs understand progress and assign responsibility accordingly.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Clear project timelines aid with resource planning, as you'll know which tasks require which tools and exactly when DRIs will need those tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Visual understanding of which project elements rely on each other for completion so PMs can inform responsible individuals of high-priority tasks.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Increased transparency, as all involved parties are aware of expectations and how individual progress impacts team progress.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can create Gantt charts in Excel, PowerPoint, Google Sheets, and more, and this tracking method can be used in a variety of industries, from marketing to construction, and even design.</p> \n<p>So, what does that look like? Let’s dive in with some beautiful Gantt chart examples, below. Prepare to geek out.</p> \n<h2>Gantt Chart Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. Gantt Chart in Excel</h3> \n<p>Creating Gantt charts in Excel is a common practice and one you’ll likely come across in your work. Excel doesn’t have a predefined Gantt chart, but the “Stacked Bar” feature is your friend, once more, allowing you to show project progression. Here’s an example of an Excel Gantt chart. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/gantt-chart?_ga=2.166289723.446548473.1631200910-262426828.1631200910\">Download it free, here</a>. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/gantt-chart?hubs_post-cta=image&amp;_ga=2.234565596.356920229.1631199556-177774985.1631199556\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-gantt-chart-template.jpg?width=1615&amp;name=excel-gantt-chart-template.jpg\" alt=\"gantt chart excel template\" width=\"1615\" style=\"width: 1615px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/gantt-chart?_ga=2.131376650.446548473.1631200910-262426828.1631200910\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>And here’s a helpful “how-to” video for the excel-challenged among us &lt;raises hand&gt;.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GskOcaOyW6U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>2. Gantt Chart in PowerPoint</h3> \n<p>Want to include a Gantt chart in your next PowerPoint Presentation? Use this PowerPoint example as your guide. PowerPoint doesn’t have a built-in Gantt feature, but you can build and edit a chart inside of the platform using their “Stacked Bar” feature.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/powerpoint-gantt-chart-example.jpg?width=808&amp;name=powerpoint-gantt-chart-example.jpg\" alt=\"gantt chart powerpoint template example\" width=\"808\" style=\"width: 808px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.officetimeline.com/make-gantt-chart/powerpoint\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<h3>How to Make a Gantt Chart in PowerPoint</h3> \n<p>When using the above template to make a Gantt chart in PowerPoint, consider these pro tips:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Leverage the task bars to your advantage and adjust their length in accordance with your plan. This template is also flexible, so you can shorten or increase the length of tasks if things come up during your project execution process.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Make unique color-codes for each specific task so you can place a corresponding milestone image when completed so you can monitor your progress and immediately understand what color means what.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Gantt Chart in Word</h3> \n<p>What’s that? You’re not familiar with Microsoft’s “Stacked Bar” feature yet? Well, if you’re getting friendly with Gantt charts, you’ll be using this go-to feature quite a bit.</p> \n<p>If you’re creating a Gantt chart in Microsoft Word, you’ll stack bars once more.

Companies want to hire for these skills because it shows a candidate's ability to think logically and use data to inform decision-making. In fact, Indeed found the <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/in-demand-skills\"><span>most in-demand skills</span></a> for employers — and several analytical skills top the list.</p> \n<p>That's why it's important to know how analytical skills apply to your career and what you can do to develop these skills over time.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, being able to understand problems and provide solutions is essential to a long, successful career. It means you can take a critical lens to the details of a problem to fully understand it. This helps you notice trends, understand the steps needed to take action, and offer novel solutions. But that doesn't mean you have to throw creativity out the door. Using analytical skills to problem solve can look like a structured, methodical approach or a more creative one.</p> \n<p>We'll explore the various types of analytical skills later on, but first, let's look at how analytical skills differ from critical thinking skills.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RrP4jhDZJdEEZlbR2WO1rM6q8xW_ont2GKkr0EJqI-yFJFxcTTQg8pm0XglaGpVNcFKlRbdKerzVJZFfCHIbms1QhJsdbZPadCfaU1584fU4OJb2kXUzJnPVTxCjQEAG4UGct6eI=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"413\" alt=\"5 Types of Analytical Skills\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.thebalancecareers.com/analytical-skills-list-2063729\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<h3>Analytical Skills vs. Critical Thinking</h3> \n<p>A person who uses logic to find patterns, brainstorm, analyze data, and make decisions based on that information has analytical skills. One of the skills required to do that is critical thinking.</p> \n<p>In other words, critical thinking is just one of many skills you need to be an analytical thinker.</p> \n<p>You probably use critical thinking more often than you imagine, like when you:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Question whether a piece of information is a fact or an opinion.</li> \n <li>Break problems down to understand the reasoning behind them.</li> \n <li>Draw conclusions from data, rather than a gut feeling.</li> \n <li>Make intentional, rational, and goal-oriented decisions.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Marketers who have strong critical thinking skills make reasonable, logical judgments and think through every decision. They provide facts and logical arguments to back their choices, which leads to smart decisions and improves company success.</p> \n<p>While each role has its own analytical skill requirements, there are several that will benefit any marketer throughout their career.</p> \n<h2>Example of Analytical Skills</h2> \n<p>If you're looking for a marketing role that leans towards analytics, such as a market research analyst position, it's best to develop analytical skills specific to that position and your desired industry. Analytical skills are soft skills, so you'll also want to develop hard role-specific <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-skills\"><span>technical skills</span></a>.</p> \n<p>For an analyst, that means mastering technical skills like Google Analytics and statistical software, while also having analytical skills such as creating data collection methods and presenting findings to senior leadership.</p> \n<p>But across the board, all marketers can benefit from developing these in-demand analytical skills.</p> \n<h3>1. Critical Thinking</h3> \n<p>Any position across all levels of a company can benefit from critical thinking skills. It's the ability to question an idea or examine why a problem exists. This can lead you to tackle issues others thought impossible and understand whether resolving a problem is worth the time, money, and effort. Critical thinking can take many forms in marketing, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Decision-making</li> \n <li>Content and brand auditing</li> \n <li>Prioritization</li> \n <li>Troubleshooting</li> \n <li>Case analysis</li> \n <li>Correlation</li> \n <li>Data interpretation</li> \n <li>Judgment</li> \n <li>Market research analysis</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Data Analysis</h3> \n<p>Neil Hoyne, Chief Measurement Strategist at Google, once said, \"The companies that are going to win are the ones who are using data, not guessing.\"</p> \n<p>Interpreting data is more than collecting and reading information — it's making sense of what's before you by connecting patterns and recognizing trends. Strong data analysis skills allow you to pull insights from a large volume of data, which you can share with key decision-makers. This skill can show up in marketing role requirements in a few common ways.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>ROI analysis</li> \n <li>SWOT analysis</li> \n <li>Data visualization</li> \n <li>Pattern recognition</li> \n <li>Process analysis</li> \n <li>Industry and market research</li> \n <li>Presentation skills</li> \n <li>Measuring customer satisfaction</li> \n <li>Marketing analytics</li> \n <li>Customer segmentation strategies</li> \n <li>Predictive analysis</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Creative Thinking</h3> \n<p>I once had a manager who was known for saying, \"The first answer isn't the answer.\" She knew the role creativity played in problem-solving and pushed our team to view a possible solution from all angles. Marketers with this analytical skill work to find out-of-the-box solutions and patterns that others brush past. And if you need any more convincing, 'creativity' ranks on Indeed’s top 20 list of most in-demand skills for today's workforce. At work, creative skills involve:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Brainstorming</li> \n <li>Collaboration</li> \n <li>Adaptability</li> \n <li>Budgeting</li> \n <li>Search engine optimization (SEO)</li> \n <li>Strategic planning</li> \n <li>Organizational restructuring</li> \n <li>Predictive modeling</li> \n <li>Campaign development</li> \n <li>Branding</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Communication</h3> \n<p>Employers consistently rank communication as a must-have skill — and for good reason. Being able to explain your idea for a project or give feedback is essential as a marketing professional.</p> \n<p>Communicating clearly helps you keep everyone on the same page when rolling out a campaign or diffuse a problem with a deadline when it (inevitably) arises. Strong communication skills needed in marketing include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Written and verbal communication</li> \n <li>Body language</li> \n <li>Interpersonal skills</li> \n <li>Active listening</li> \n <li>Conducting presentations</li> \n <li>Reporting</li> \n <li>Confidence and clarity of expression</li> \n <li>Sharing feedback</li> \n <li>Responsiveness</li> \n <li>Delegating responsibilities</li> \n <li>Respect and empathy</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Problem-solving</h3> \n<p>Deciding how to respond to a harsh customer comment on social media. Distributing an advertising budget. Prioritizing which roles to hire for as a growing team.</p> \n<p>All of these situations require analytical problem-solving skills, and all will pop up through a marketing career. Here are the problem-solving skills every marketer can benefit from developing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Research</li> \n <li>Data collection</li> \n <li>Prioritization</li> \n <li>Checking for accuracy</li> \n <li>Risk-taking</li> \n <li>Attention to detail</li> \n <li>Dependability</li> \n <li>Team-building</li> \n <li>Logic and reasoning</li> \n <li>Organization</li> \n <li>Crisis management</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Collaboration</h3> \n<p>Good collaboration skills can improve your working relationships, help you accomplish tasks on time, and reach your short- and long-term goals.</p> \n<p>And nearly every marketing team has to collaborate with sales, product, business development, and creative teams to get anything done, knowing how to create synergy with your colleagues will make work smoother and more enjoyable.</p> \n<p>The most common collaboration skills for marketers today are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Persuasion</li> \n <li>Adaptability</li> \n <li>Time management</li> \n <li>Responsiveness</li> \n <li>Negotiation</li> \n <li>Giving and receiving feedback</li> \n <li>Emotional intelligence</li> \n <li>Open-mindedness</li> \n <li>Process improvement</li> \n <li>Adapting to change</li> \n <li>Networking</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How to Improve Analytical Skills</h2> \n<p>Developing analytical skills takes time and effort. Unlike technical skills that have a structured approach to follow, analytical skills are more difficult to define and develop. There's a process to learn how to use Google Analytics for SEO, but the steps to become an effective communicator are more fuzzy and undefined.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, analytical skills can be honed. Here how you can go about boosting your skills and contributing to your company's productivity and success.</p> \n<h3>Take courses, certifications, or on the job training.</h3> \n<p>Infinite resources exist both in-person and online that can help you improve your analytical skills. Universities and online companies like <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\"><span>Coursera</span></a> offer online schooling, <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\"><span>HubSpot Academy</span></a> offers free certification courses, and many companies provide stipends for continuing education.</p> \n<p>Start by identifying which skills you want to improve and do research to find the resources that are right for your skill set and budget.</p> \n<h3>Find a mentor.</h3> \n<p>You likely know someone who is an excellent negotiator or always crafts the perfect email. Noticing how these people approach a situation and problem solve can help you hone your skills. Take notes, save examples, and apply their process to your work.</p> \n<p>To take it a step further, ask them to chat over coffee or a phone call to discuss how they developed their skill. They can likely point you in the right direction or provide guidance on what you need to do to excel at the skill.</p> \n<h3>Try practice problems.</h3> \n<p>Role-playing is incredibly effective when working to improve analytical skills. Instead of simply reading a case study about an innovative digital media campaign, find a tool to help you develop your brainstorming skills.</p> \n<p>Depending on the skill, you can find a practice book or an online resource to walk you through various mental models and scenarios. Work on an idea, and then present it to a trusted colleague or mentor to get feedback.</p> \n<h3>Play games to improve your analytical skills.</h3> \n<p>Spending hours on your phone playing Sudoku has more benefits than the personal satisfaction of beating your top score. Games that test your mental agility and memorization can improve your ability to think logically and challenge norms. While game trends are constantly changing, there are several classics that have withstood the test of time.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Sudoku</li> \n <li>Jigsaw puzzles</li> \n <li>Board games (i.e. Scrabble, Settlers of Catan, Splendor, Pictionary, and Bananagrams)</li> \n <li>Computer or mobile games (i.e. Lumosity, Elevate, and Peak)</li> \n <li>Chess</li> \n <li>Crossword puzzles</li> \n</ol> \n<h2>Analytical Skills for Your Resume</h2> \n<p>Once you gain or improve your analytical skills, make sure to update your resume to reflect those strengths. Your resume should include a list of 10 to 20 skills, with a mix of both hard and soft skills. Note at least five to 10 analytical skills so potential employers know you have the knowledge to get your job done.</p> \n<p>When choosing which skills to highlight, look to the job requirements section. A role may involve managing the company's social media accounts, but this typically includes collaborating with multiple teams to get the content and analytics you need to do that successfully. Showcasing a blend of technical and analytical skills is what makes you a competitive candidate.</p> \n<p>As your career develops, you'll likely need to keep your analytical skills sharp. Be proactive by practicing and paying attention to people who have the skills you want to acquire, and you'll be on your way to solving complex problems with ease.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fanalytical-skills&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"abcdc5f6ad85e163ba78cf7198fb7d6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"Katrina Kirsch","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RrP4jhDZJdEEZlbR2WO1rM6q8xW_ont2GKkr0EJqI-yFJFxcTTQg8pm0XglaGpVNcFKlRbdKerzVJZFfCHIbms1QhJsdbZPadCfaU1584fU4OJb2kXUzJnPVTxCjQEAG4UGct6eI=s0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn60@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-46-537_9dd2031b6b8033f0.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f7685cd-6442-4846-afea-a28dcbad007c.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-47-520_15a22acbc5258093.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fanalytical-skills&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-45-914_16ff3a56c14bd7f8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741252},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"The Death of the Third-Party Cookie: What Marketers Need to Know About Google's 2022 Phase-Out","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/third-party-cookie-phase-out","description":"<p>What do marketers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye8mB6VsUHw\">Sesame Street</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye8mB6VsUHw\"> monsters</a> have in common?

In a recent survey. GetApp, which provided HubSpot with exclusive data, discovered that:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>41% of marketers believe their biggest challenge will be their inability to track the right data.</li> \n <li>44% of marketers predict a need to increase their spending by 5% to 25% in order to reach the same goals as 2021.</li> \n <li>23% of marketing experts plan on investing in email marketing software due to Google’s new policy.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Below, I'll note a brief history of how the third-party cookie phase-out, and Google's pivots for tracking security, came to be. Then I'll highlight a few things marketers should keep in mind as we get closer to 2022.</p> \n<h2>A Brief History of the Third-Party Cookie Phase-Out</h2> \n<p>While you might be seeing this news for the first time, we've been following it since 2020 and just recently updated this post to reflect Google's most recent statements.</p> \n<p>In February of last year, a Google blog post <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\">announced the phaseout</a> ang gave initial reasoning for the pivot. Like the statement noted in the intro, Google similarly explained that this move was being done to protect users asking for more privacy.</p> \n<p>\"Users are demanding greater privacy--including transparency, choice, and control over how their data is used--and it’s clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands,\" the post wrote.</p> \n<p>Although Firefox and Safari had already phased out the third-party cookie, <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\">Google's post</a> said that its changes will happen over the course of two years as the tech company works with advertisers to ensure that this pivot doesn't destroy the online advertising business.</p> \n<p>\"Some browsers have reacted to these concerns by blocking third-party cookies, but we believe this has unintended consequences that can negatively impact both users and the web ecosystem,\" the <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\">blog post notes</a>. \"By undermining the business model of many ad-supported websites, blunt approaches to cookies encourage the use of opaque techniques such as fingerprinting (an invasive workaround to replace cookies), which can actually reduce user privacy and control. We believe that we as a community can, and must, do better.\"</p> \n<p>Although Chrome isn't the first browser to phase out the third-party cookie, it's the biggest. In late 2019, Google Chrome made up <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/268299/most-popular-internet-browsers/\">more than 56% of the web browser market</a>. Chrome also accounts for <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/software/best-web-browsers-3635255/\">more than half of all global web traffic</a>.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Death%20of%20the%20Third%20Party%20Cookie%20What%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Know-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Most used website browsers.\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/268299/most-popular-internet-browsers/\">Statista</a></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Safari and Firefox, which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/in-defense-of-tracking-cookies\">have blocked third-party cookies since 2013</a>, come in a distant second and third place, respectively.</p> \n<p>Because Chrome, Safari, and Firefox will all no longer support this type of data tracking by 2022, publications like Digiday are calling Google's phase-out the <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-planning-end-third-party-cookie/\">\"death of the third-party cookie.\"</a></p> \n<h2>What happens next?</h2> \n<p>As with any major shift involving privacy, data, and advertising, business experts and publications have been frantically buzzing about how the phase out and Google's rejection of ad-tracking will change the way we do business online.</p> \n<p>But, do we really need to panic?</p> \n<p>The truth is, Google Chrome's privacy efforts could heavily impact some areas of the marketing and advertising space, while other tactics will still stay pretty much the same.</p> \n<p>However, if you're an advertiser or a marketer who's thrived on third-party data or individual data for pinpointed online audience targeting strategies, you might be worried about how you'll navigate this pivot.</p> \n<p>Although some big changes might be underway, new alternatives are also emerging. To help you prepare for a world without third-party cookies, here are four things you should keep in mind about the latest cookie phase-out.</p> \n<h2>5 Things to Know About Google's Cookie Phase-Out and Privacy Pivots</h2> \n<h3>1. Google isn't banning all cookies.</h3> \n<p>If you're thinking that all your cookie-fueled marketing strategies will soon be rendered obsolete, take a breath.</p> \n<p>So far, Google says it's only planning to phase out the third-party cookie on its browsers. However, first-party cookies that track basic data about your own website's visitors are still safe.</p> \n<p>In fact, in Google's 2021 announcement, the tech giant called first-party relationships \"<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/\">vital</a>.\" So, ultimately, any first-party data you gain from your website's visitors on all browsers will still remain in-tact.</p> \n<p>Still not sure about the difference between first-party and third-party cookies? Here's a quick breakdown.</p> \n<h4>First-Party Cookies</h4> \n<p>A first-party cookie is<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/what-is-cookie-tracking\"> a code that gets generated and stored on your website visitor's computer</a> by default when they visit your site. This cookie is often used for user experience as it is responsible for remembering passwords, basic data about the visitor, and other preferences.</p> \n<p>With a first-party cookie, you can learn about what a user did while visiting your website, see how often they visit it, and gain other basic analytics that can help you develop or automate an effective marketing strategy around them. However, you can't see data related to your visitor's behavior on other websites that aren't affiliated with your domain.</p> \n<p>Ever wonder how Amazon always remembers <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/what-is-cookie-tracking\">your login information, the language you speak, the items in your cart</a>, and other key things that make your user experience so smooth? This is because Amazon uses first-party cookies to remember these basic details.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if you're a marketer running a website on a CMS, you'll have access to analytics dashboards that track first-party cookie data. For example, you'll usually be able to see basic analytics, such as the number of web sessions on a page, the number of pages people click on during a visit, basic browser types, geographical demographics, or even referring websites where visitors clicked a link to your site's URL. However, this data doesn't inform you of everything your visitors do online.</p> \n<h4>Third-Party Cookies</h4> \n<p>Third-party cookies are tracking codes that are placed on a web visitor's computer after being generated by another website other than your own. When a web visitor visits your site and others, the third-party cookie tracks this information and sends it to the third-party who created the cookie -- which might be an advertiser.</p> \n<p>If you're an advertiser, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/in-defense-of-tracking-cookies\">third-party cookie data</a> allows you to learn about your web visitor's overall online behaviors, such as websites they frequently visit, purchases, and interests that they've shown on various websites. With this detailed data, you can build robust visitor profiles. With all of this data, you can then create a retargeting list that can be used to send ads to your past visitors or people with similar web profiles.</p> \n<p>Want to visualize how third-party cookie data might work? Say you research a particular smart TV on Amazon. Then, you go to another site later in the day and see an ad Amazon advertisement for the same exact product. If you aren't on an Amazon-owned site, it's very possible that this advertisement was triggered by third-party cookie data.</p> \n<p>While first-party cookies are accepted automatically, visitors must be informed that they are accepting a third-party cookie due to the amount of data that companies can retain from them.</p> \n<p>The bottom line? If you're just aiming to track your website's visitors' behaviors, preferences, and basic demographics only while they're on your website, you probably won't be deeply impacted by this change.</p> \n<p>However, if you're a marketer that relies on robust data for online advertising, pop-up ads, or a pinpointed audience-targeting strategy, you'll need to continue to follow the news around this phase-out, and consider alternative first-party strategies, as the phase-out nears.</p> \n<h3>2. Many marketers saw the cookie phase-out coming.</h3> \n<p>While the <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-planning-end-third-party-cookie/\">\"death of the third-party cookie\"</a> might seem shocking, it certainly wasn't a surprise.</p> \n<p>Recently, governments around the world have been investigating and cracking down on data privacy issues. <span>For example, in an October 2019 shakeup,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/?__hstc=45788219.ea89173da3bc307159a4e87e0707993a.1619541388289.1619541388289.1619541388289.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1619541388289&amp;__hsfp=1437041088&amp;_ga=2.117846601.1334902982.1619541387-1894650829.1619541387\">Europe's highest court</a><span> ruled that users in the EU must actively consent to all analytics cookies when they log on to a website. If not, the website can’t drop analytics or web tracking cookies on the user’s browser.</span>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/?__hstc=45788219.ea89173da3bc307159a4e87e0707993a.1619541388289.1619541388289.1619541388289.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1619541388289&amp;__hsfp=1437041088&amp;_ga=2.117846601.1334902982.1619541387-1894650829.1619541387\">GDPR ruling</a><span>&nbsp;means that websites can no longer rely on implicit opt-in (meaning, a website displays a cookie banner but the user continues to browser. Websites must not capture opt-in consent before any analytics or web tracking cookies are placed on a browser.</span></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Death%20of%20the%20Third%20Party%20Cookie%20What%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Know.png?width=600&amp;name=The%20Death%20of%20the%20Third%20Party%20Cookie%20What%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Know.png\" alt=\"A banner that asks users for permission to use cookies.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If your website only catered to local or domestic users outside of the affected countries, you might not have been impacted. However, international websites took a major reporting hit as numbers from Google Analytics -- which relies on cookies -- started to appear inaccurately low.</p> \n<p>For international brands that relied on Google Analytics, this was a scary reminder that data-driven brands are vulnerable to software-related issues. It also showed us how governance and privacy regulations could dramatically impact our strategies.</p> \n<p>Earlier, in August, Google announced it was developing a \"Privacy Sandbox.\" Although Google didn't have a product created when they announced the move, a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/\">blog post</a> explained that the tool that could allow marketers to continue to publish and circulate ads to the right audiences without having the same amount of user data.</p> \n<p>\"We’ve started sharing our preliminary ideas for a Privacy Sandbox -- a secure environment for personalization that also protects user privacy,\" wrote Justin Schuh, Director of Chrome Engineering, <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/\">in the Google blog post</a>. \"Some ideas include new approaches to ensure that ads continue to be relevant for users, but user data shared with websites and advertisers would be minimized by anonymously aggregating user information, and keeping much more user information on-device only. Our goal is to create a set of standards that is more consistent with users’ expectations of privacy.\"</p> \n<p>In a January 2020 <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-googles-privacy-sandbox/\">interview with Digiday</a>, Amit Kotecha, a marketing director at data management platform provider Permutive, explained the key features of the proposed Sandbox:</p> \n<p>“The most significant item in the Privacy Sandbox is Google’s proposal to move all user data into the [Chrome] browser where it will be stored and processed,” said <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-googles-privacy-sandbox/\">Kotecha</a>. “This means that data stays on the user’s device and is privacy compliant. This is now table stakes and the gold standard for privacy.”</p> \n<p>Between the Privacy Sandbox and GDPR rulings that impacted data tracking, it's become apparent to marketers that the third-party cookie was at risk of governance or other tech company changeups that could render it obsolete. This was so apparent that <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-planning-end-third-party-cookie/\">advertising software firms and publishers</a> were already contemplating alternative solutions before the official news of Google's cookie phase-out broke.</p> \n<p>At this point, data management firms, like Permutive, are looking at creating alternative tools for advertisers that <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-planning-end-third-party-cookie/\">more heavily leverage first-party cookies</a> and lump visitor profiles into more anonymous \"segments\" similar to what <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-planning-end-third-party-cookie/\">Google's Privacy Sandbox is predicted to do</a>.</p> \n<h3>3. Marketers aren't just concerned about data.</h3> \n<p>While the elimination of third-party cookies on Chrome will be inconvenient to some, marketers are also concerned about Google's reasoning behind the phase-out.</p> \n<p>Without Chrome-based third-party cookie data, you'll still be able to leverage and target Google Ads, which will be powered by Google Chrome's first-party cookies and the <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-googles-privacy-sandbox/\">Privacy Sandbox tools</a>. However, some ad software and platforms that require third-party data will take a huge hit without support from Chrome.</p> \n<p>\"This move, while good for consumer privacy (in theory) is likely going to hurt most of the third-party ad platforms that utilize these cookies to generate revenue,\" says <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/matthew-howells-barby\">Matthew <i>Howells-</i>Barby</a>, HubSpot's Director of Acquisition.</p> \n<p>\"The big question behind all of this for me is what's motivating Google to phase third-party cookies out? Is it to improve privacy for the end-user or is it to gain a further grip on the ad market by forcing the adoption of Chrome's own first-party cookie, which would likely result in many of those dollars being previously spent on third-party platforms to move in Google's bottom line.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/matthew-howells-barby\"><i>Howells-</i>Barby</a> isn't the only marketer to voice these concerns. In fact, in a joint statement, the Association of National Advertising and the American Association of Advertising Agencies called the tech giant out for disrupting healthy competition in the advertising space.</p> \n<p>\"Google’s decision to block third-party cookies in Chrome could have major competitive impacts for digital businesses, consumer services, and technological innovation,\" the statement said. \"It would threaten to substantially disrupt much of the infrastructure of today’s Internet without providing any viable alternative, and it may choke off the economic oxygen from advertising that startups and emerging companies need to survive.\"</p> \n<p>Later in the statement, the two advertising groups urged Google to push back the third-party cookie \"moratorium\" until effective and meaningful opportunities were made available to advertisers.</p> \n<h3>4. Google won't stop tracking people entirely.</h3> \n<p>While Google will not invest in tech that tracks people at an individual level, it will still be investing in alternatives. Along with Google's Privacy Sandbox development, the company has already seen successful advertising results from <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/\">FloC</a>, a technology that tracks groups of people rather than individuals.</p> \n<p><span>\"Our&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/\">latest tests of FLoC</a><span>&nbsp;show one way to effectively take third-party cookies out of the advertising equation and instead hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests,\" Google's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/\">recent announcement</a> explained. </span></p> \n<p><span>\"Chrome intends to make FLoC-based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next release this month, and we expect to begin testing FLoC-based cohorts with advertisers in Google Ads in Q2. Chrome also will offer the </span><a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/privacy-sandbox-in-2021.html\">first iteration of new user controls</a><span> in April and will expand on these controls in future releases, as more proposals reach the origin trial stage, and they receive more feedback from end users and the industry,\" <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/\">the post</a> added.</span></p> \n<h3>5. This move still opens the door for innovation in advertising</h3> \n<p>While things look grim for one type of cookie, this might not be a bad thing for skilled and adaptable brands.</p> \n<p>Although this move does cause concern, Google and other browsers have still taken a stand for user privacy. As privacy laws continue to arise, this might be a great opportunity to look at other less-vulnerable advertising alternatives just incase another governance renders one of your marketing tactics or processes as obsolete.</p> \n<p>Why? As a marketer with an innovative mindset, you should always be asking yourself questions like, \"Are we too reliant on this technology?\" or \"What happens if and when our strategy gets regulated?\" Innovative marketers will be able to come up with more clever alternatives and ads that identify with the masses -- aside from just hyper-targeted content or annoying pop-ups.</p> \n<p>Another area that could be innovated is the way we leverage and use data. As noted above, data management platforms <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-googles-privacy-sandbox/\">are now looking to create alternative tools</a> that help advertisers track data in a way that makes the most out of the third-party cookie. While these options might be different from your third-party cookie solutions or require some new strategizing, they would still allow you to target and learn about relevant audiences without getting intrusive.</p> \n<h2>How to Prepare for Google's Third-Party Phase-Out</h2> \n<p>Don't panic. At this point, marketers, advertisers, and data engineers alike <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-googles-privacy-sandbox/\">are actively looking for solutions</a> to determine what will happen next. And, because the third-party cookie was already weakened by Safari and Firefox ad blocking, it likely wasn't the strongest advertising tool anymore anyway.</p> \n<p>Right now, the best thing to do as a marketer is to continue to stay up-to-date with news related to third-party cookies and other data privacy moves that could impact your business.</p> \n<p>If your advertising strategies rely on third-party data, start considering alternatives now. As you continue to follow the news related to the phase-out, you should also vet any software or solutions that can help you better transition away from this type of cookie.</p> \n<p>For example, although marketers are wary of Google's move, the tech giant's Privacy Sandbox and could still serve as valuable alternatives for ad targeting. You could also consider strategies or software that can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/first-party-data\">better help you leverage first-party data</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you could also revitalize older strategies, like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/contextual-targeting\">contextual advertising</a>. While third-party data allowed you to place ads directly in front of people who matched certain user profiles, contextual advertising allows you to circulate PPC ads on websites that rank for similar keywords as your ad. This way, if you're selling sports apparel, your PPC ad could show up on sports-oriented websites.</p> \n<p>Lastly, to make your brand as safe as possible from future governance or monopoly-related policies, brainstorm even more basic strategies that you can still use to reach your audiences even without cookies, hyper-targeted ads, or mass amounts of data. This will allow you to be less vulnerable to technology, even when you can benefit from the latest tracking software.</p> \n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>This blog post is not legal advice for your company to use in complying with EU data privacy laws like the GDPR.

You can't do that just by saying last month's activities were \"great\" — because \"great\" doesn't pay the bills.</p> \n<p>If you can prove that your marketing activities actually made an impact on your business, you'll have many more opportunities at your disposal. More budget to play with, potential hires to bring on board, and more ideas to put in action. Sounds like every marketer's dream, right?</p> \n<p>So how do you go about first, finding the right metrics to use, and second, proving your marketing's ROI to your boss?

But let’s go ahead and break down how it’s done in Excel for you with and without an existing sales trend.</p> \n<h2>How to Calculate ROI in Excel</h2> \n<p>Inputting formulas into Excel is a quick and easy way to solve any equation, and calculating return on investment can be done in a matter of seconds. For an equation without a pre-existing sales trend, the simple ROI equation can be plugged in with ease in Excel as follows: (Sales Growth - Marketing Cost)/Marketing Cost</p> \n<p>When you have the amount of sales growth collected and the amount it cost to market collected, plug in the variables into their own rows or columns. When completed, select a free cell to type in the formula using your data.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Excel calculation of simple ROI formula\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Calculate%20ROI%20in%20Marketing%20%5BFree%20Excel%20Templates%5D.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20to%20Calculate%20ROI%20in%20Marketing%20%5BFree%20Excel%20Templates%5D.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>With these steps completed, press “ENTER” and you’ll have your ROI calculated.

Plug in this variable along with the original factors and input them using this ROI equation: (Sales Growth - Average Organic Sales Growth - Marketing Cost)/Marketing Cost</p> \n<p><img alt=\"ROI formula for marketing in Excel\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Calculate%20ROI%20in%20Marketing%20%5BFree%20Excel%20Templates%5D-Aug-10-2021-05-05-23-25-PM.png?width=618&amp;height=248&amp;name=How%20to%20Calculate%20ROI%20in%20Marketing%20%5BFree%20Excel%20Templates%5D-Aug-10-2021-05-05-23-25-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"248\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>To compute the percentage, press “ENTER” and you’ll have a more precise ROI to base your marketing decisions on for the future.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Completed calculation of ROI for marketing in Excel\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Calculate%20ROI%20in%20Marketing%20%5BFree%20Excel%20Templates%5D-1.png?width=616&amp;height=254&amp;name=How%20to%20Calculate%20ROI%20in%20Marketing%20%5BFree%20Excel%20Templates%5D-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"254\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Now that we’ve reviewed a couple of examples, let’s walk through how to use your data and how a HubSpot resource can make your marketing reporting a piece of cake.</p> \n<h2>Which Metrics Should You Track?</h2> \n<p>First things first — which metrics should you be paying attention to in the first place?

most viewed Instagram Stories</a> are from businesses? Customers want to see what businesses are posting about on \"Stories,\" however, as you probably know, those are only viewable for 24 hours.</p> \n<p>But what if your audience wants to save those Stories and come back to them later (whether for a link or to reference something)? This is why Instagram added the \"Highlights\" feature several years ago.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>With this tool, brands can save Stories so that customers can look at them whenever they want, indefinitely.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll walk you through how to make an Instagram Story Highlight, and then dive into expert tips on how to use the feature to engage your audience.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5e999bfc-f8b2-4ab7-96a8-c1467f450ca2&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Click here to access a month's worth of Instagram tips &amp; free templates.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5e999bfc-f8b2-4ab7-96a8-c1467f450ca2.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Tap on the plus sign from your profile.</h3> \n<p>The first step in creating an Instagram Highlight is to tap on the plus sign in the top right corner of the screen when you're on your profile.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Instagram Story Highlights\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Instagram%20Story%20Highlights%20%5B+Engage%20Your%20Audience%5D-3.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<h3>2. Select Story Highlight</h3> \n<p>Then, you'll want to select \"Story Highlight.\"</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Instagram Story Highlights\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Instagram%20Story%20Highlights%20%5B+Engage%20Your%20Audience%5D.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<h3>3. Choose the Story you want to add.</h3> \n<p>At this point, it's time to choose what Stories you want to save to your highlight. You can choose one or several. Then, hit \"Next.\"</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Instagram Story Highlights\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Instagram%20Story%20Highlights%20%5B+Engage%20Your%20Audience%5D-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<h3>4. Pick a cover photo and add a name for your highlight.</h3> \n<p>Lastly, you'll choose a cover photo and then add a name for your highlight. Then, click \"Add.\" To add more Stories over time, you can tap and hold the highlight and then select \"Edit Highlight.\"</p> \n<p>As time goes on and you want to reorder or archive your Instagram Story highlights, you can select \"Edit Highlight\" and then choose the Story you want to delete. Then, you can click on \"Edit Highlight,\" go to your Instagram Story archives and select the post again. This will now add that post again, making it at the front of your highlights thread.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Instagram Story Highlights\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Instagram%20Story%20Highlights%20%5B+Engage%20Your%20Audience%5D-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>Once you've gone through these steps, your Instagram Story highlight will be visible on your profile. But, you might be wondering what picture you should use for your highlight cover/icon. Let's dive in below.</p> \n<h2>Instagram Story Highlights Cover</h2> \n<p>The last step of adding a highlight is selecting a name and image/icon. Visually, the best thing to do is create icons that are matching. For example, the HubSpot Academy Instagram account uses similar icons for its highlights.</p> \n<p>As you can see, the icons follow a certain format, are visually appealing, and match the theme of the rest of the feed.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"instagram story highlights icons\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Instagram%20Story%20Highlights%20%5B+Engage%20Your%20Audience%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>Before you create your highlights in the app, it's important to choose the name and design the icons that you want.</p> \n<p>As you're designing the icons, you'll use square dimensions. It's actually very similar in size to the profile picture size. Make sure your icons have an aspect ratio of 1:1 and use dimensions like 2000 x 2000 pixels.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to make an Instagram Story highlight, you might be wondering what the best practices are. Let's review some of the best ways you can use this feature to engage with your audience.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Promote your products.</h3> \n<p>With Instagram highlights, you can promote your best-selling products. Perhaps you design an icon to look like your product, and then name it your product name. In that highlight, you can show reviews for specific products, photos, features, benefits, and more.</p> \n<p>Jenni Kim, a marketing manager at HubSpot, says, \"Brainstorm your highlights into the topics most relevant to what your audience is looking for to give an overview of what your social brand offers! The highlights act as a compilation or mini archive for your past stories, so it's a perfect way to showcase your past content in a way that's useful to your audience as they learn more about your brand.\"</p> \n<p>This is a great way to engage your audience on Instagram and increase the chances that your followers will purchase from you.</p> \n<h3>2. Add blog posts.</h3> \n<p>The best way to engage with your audience through highlights is to post engaging content that your followers want to come back to.</p> \n<p>For instance, you can add blog post links and save the most recent and relevant content on the highlight. This will help give your audience an easy place to access your top blog posts, even if they're reading the posts after you've already promoted them on social media.</p> \n<h3>3. Show interviews.</h3> \n<p>Another great way to engage with your audience through highlights is to post interviews with your employees, leadership, or customers. Or, if you post interview content on your blogs, you can film those interviews and save them to your interviews highlight. This will showcase your series and help you educate your audience.</p> \n<p>Interview content is typically very engaging because it's interesting while being informative. It gives a behind-the-scenes look at how others do what they do.</p> \n<h3>4. Reveal behind-the-scenes footage.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of behind the scenes, one of the best types of content to post on highlights is BTS footage. Whether you're an individual brand or a company, showing the behind-the-scenes footage is a fun way for customers to see how you do what you do. You can showcase behind-the-scenes footage of product production or of a photoshoot ad campaign.</p> \n<p>This type of footage is engaging and helps your audience connect with your brand. By saving this footage on your highlights, you'll extend the engagement and hopefully develop interested and long-term viewers who keep coming back for more.</p> \n<h3>5. Include events.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to promoting events, saving information on your Instagram highlights is a great way to make sure customers and followers have all the information they need at their fingertips.</p> \n<p>This helps engage the people who are attending your event (because they'll want to come back to this highlight for information) and promote the event to those who haven't heard of it (if people are looking at your profile, they'll see that you're having an event).</p> \n<h3>6. Save links.</h3> \n<p>Of course one of the top ways to get followers to purchase products from you on social media is to add links to your social media pages. If you're an influencer or company, you can save these most asked-for links to a highlight. This makes it easy for users to find a product from you and purchase it.</p> \n<h3>7. Showcase your culture.</h3> \n<p>Instagram highlights can be used to showcase fun, exciting video footage that reveals what your company culture is like. Perhaps you have someone on your culture team take videos of morale-boosting events.</p> \n<p>Or maybe you start a takeover series like HubSpot has on our HubSpot Life Instagram account. With this highlight, we engage our audience every day with a different employee takeover. This employee will basically post a \"day in the life\" on Stories that day and you can save those to your highlights for whenever people are researching what your company culture is like.</p> \n<h3>8. Answer FAQs.</h3> \n<p>When users have questions, they go to social media. A great way to engage those customers is to have a FAQ highlight where you discuss any/all the top questions that users ask.</p> \n<h3>9. Incorporate reviews and testimonials.</h3> \n<p>We all know that people purchase products that have great reviews and testimonials. In fact, it's one of the top elements that impact purchasing decisions. That's why it's a good idea to engage those users who are researching your product by looking at social media with a \"Reviews and Testimonials\" highlight.</p> \n<h3>10. Give tips/tricks.</h3> \n<p>Educating your audience is one of the best ways to provide value on social media. Save your tips and tricks to a highlight to continue educating and engaging with your audience on Instagram.</p> \n<h3>11. Display sales and discounts.</h3> \n<p>How do you get the word out about current sales and discounts? One way to do this is through Instagram story highlights. You can save all this information on a highlight so that customers know they can always check this highlight before making a purchase. Again, this keeps users coming back to your profile and engaging with your content.</p> \n<h3>12.

Or perhaps you’ve been in your role for a while and feel stuck, stagnant.</p> \n<p>The imposter syndrome sets in and you’re not sure how to succeed in this role.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Click here to download leadership lessons from HubSpot founder, Dharmesh  Shah [Free Guide].\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png\"></a></p> \n<p>Management skills aren’t innate, they’re learned over time so the work is never fully done. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/people-manager-skills\">Succeeding as a manager</a> is a fluid dance that requires a willingness to learn.</p> \n<p>If you’ve already identified areas of improvement, this article will offer actionable tips. If you have no idea where to start, you will learn the top management skills every people manager needs and the ways to refine the ones you already have.</p> \n<h3>Types of Management Skills</h3> \n<p>There are three facets of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/leadership-skills\">management skills that every leader will need </a>to succeed in their role.</p> \n<p>The first is interpersonal skills. How are you with people?</p> \n<p>Are you able to build relationships with leaders, peers, and direct reports? Would they describe you as trustworthy and reliable?</p> \n<p>To be a great manager, you have to hone the skills to navigate conversations within – and outside of – your team. On a personal level, interpersonal skills will allow you to empathize, celebrate and motivate those around you.</p> \n<p>The next facet of management is the strategic facet. As a leader, you’ll be tasked with identifying roadblocks, problem-solving and developing strategies to improve efficiency. This can be anything from helping your team improve its workflow to providing an innovative way to reach customers.</p> \n<p>As for the technical piece, think of this as the foundational piece. It includes software knowledge, the ability to operate certain machinery, expertise in equipment used at your company.</p> \n<p>To be a great manager, you should aim to be strong in all three management areas. Start by ranking yourself in each area and identify which one(s) you should focus on improving.</p> \n<p>Read the following section on what steps to tackle next.</p> \n<h3>Developing Management Skills</h3> \n<p>So you’ve identified some management areas you want to want on. So how do you actually develop them? There are three main ways:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Training </strong>– This is the first thing you should do once you know what you want to work on. Ideally, your company offers internal <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-business-leadership-advice\">training to help leaders</a> like you improve their skills. You can also seek out training programs online and reach out to your business network.</li> \n <li><strong>Mentorship </strong>– A mentor is a valuable asset to have when learning how to model new behaviors and skills. With a mentor by your side, you can discover new ways to do things, get feedback on your process, and brainstorm ideas.</li> \n <li><strong>Experience </strong>– Nothing beats experience. While getting training and a mentor is great, going through your own experiences is the best way to learn. While it isn’t always the easiest route, as you can hit roadblocks and make mistakes, you’ll likely face unique situations that will prepare you well for the future.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Top People Management Skills Every Leader Needs</h2> \n<p>As a people manager, you have to be multi-faceted – able to support your team, colleagues, and leaders all at once.</p> \n<p>Here are the top skills you’ll need to succeed:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Communicator</li> \n <li>Motivator</li> \n <li>Able to take accountability</li> \n <li>Business-minded and strategic</li> \n <li>Problem-solver and decision-maker</li> \n <li>Organized and willing to delegate</li> \n <li>Trustworthy and reliable</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your team will look to you for guidance and support, your peers will look to you for collaboration and your leaders will look to you for strategic thinking and an innovative spirit.</p> \n<h3>1. Get to know your team.</h3> \n<p>In an ideal world, you would use the same approach to manage your team. In reality, everyone operates differently and requires a different <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/leadership-styles\">management style.</a></p> \n<p>To know what works best for your team, you have to get to know them. You’ll find that each person varies in how they communicate, receive feedback, want recognition, address conflicts, and more.</p> \n<p>So, how do you get to know them?</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Have weekly 1-on-1s.</li> \n <li>Conduct personality assessments and surveys.</li> \n <li>Have non-work activities on a regular basis, like a weekly watercooler or a monthly game night.</li> \n <li>Ask them about themselves, like \"What are your goals for the next 6 months?\", \"How do you prefer to be recognized?\".</li> \n <li>Host team-building activities.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you understand which approach to take, you’ll build a stronger relationship with your team and be equipped to handle any roadblocks down the line.</p> \n<h3>2. Be empathetic.</h3> \n<p>Now more than ever, employees want empathetic managers and leaders.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.businessolver.com/resources/state-of-workplace-empathy\">2021 State of Workplace Empathy Study,</a> administered by software company Businessolver, revealed that only 1 in 4 employees believed empathy in their organizations was \"sufficient.\"</p> \n<p>The same study revealed that while the majority of CEOs recognize the positive impact an empathetic culture has on business, 68% still fear they’ll be less respected if they show empathy.</p> \n<p>The same study \"84% of CEOs and 70% of employees believe empathy drives better business outcomes\" however 68% of CEOs say they fear they will be less respected if they show empathy in the workplace, up 31 points from last year.\"</p> \n<p>However, one study suggests that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://cclinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/empathyintheworkplace.pdf?webSyncID=4a998c41-e01a-03e6-d06a-66a59a1b7e93&amp;sessionGUID=62c8eba1-9359-822c-e5c4-45c3ada36d9e\">2020 Empathy in the Workplace study</a> by the Center for Creative Leadership, leaders see managers who show more empathy to their direct reports as better performers than those who show less or little empathy.</p> \n<p>How do you show empathy? Here are a few ways:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Get training on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychological-safety-according-to-edmondson\">cultivating psychological safety at the workplace</a>.</li> \n <li>Practice active listening.</li> \n <li>Go behind the words and focus on their meaning or intent.</li> \n <li>Validate your team’s feelings and concerns.</li> \n <li>Offer resources.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Build trust.</h3> \n<p>Trust is a core pillar of any workplace environment.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Harvard Business Review reported that employees who work in a culture of trust are more productive and have higher energy levels. High-trust organizations also have better employee retention rates.</p> \n<p>The key thing to remember here is that trust is a two-way street. Employees must trust their managers to support and guide them. However, managers must also instill trust in their team.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, you’re left with a micromanager who’s unwilling to delegate and empower their team.</p> \n<p>Building trust takes time, but here are some tactics you can start using today:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Be transparent</strong> about the reasons behind your decisions, address mistakes and setbacks, be clear about your goals and vision.</li> \n <li><strong>Follow-up </strong>on conversations you’ve had with your team. It will show that you listen and take action.</li> \n <li><strong>Make yourself available</strong> to your team, whether it’s by having an open-door policy, setting office hours, having regular 1-on-1s.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Uplift and celebrate your team.</h3> \n<p>When I spoke to 5 HubSpot managers on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/be-a-good-manager\">their management journey,</a> they shared one common belief: A key part of their role involved taking a backseat to allow their team to step into the spotlight.</p> \n<p>This can take many forms. One way to uplift your team is by identifying high-visibility opportunities. For instance, your direct report suggested using the audio and video content platform <a href=\"https://www.casted.us/\">Casted</a> for an upcoming project.</p> \n<p>Instead of relaying the message to the DRI, you could find a way for your direct report to collaborate on the project.</p> \n<p>Start by checking in with your team to understand their goals and from there, you can find opportunities that will help them meet their objectives.</p> \n<p>Another way to uplift your team is by recognizing their performance.</p> \n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that not everyone likes recognition the same way.</p> \n<p>Some employees may like public recognition while others prefer private, quieter celebrations. This goes back to knowing your team and understanding how they operate.</p> \n<h3>5. Learn how to manage your time.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/time-management-tips-long-term-deadlines\">Time management</a> is a skill you should master, whether you’re a team lead or an individual contributor.</p> \n<p>As a manager, it’s particularly important because you’re responsible for more than just your work. As such, you’ll need to organize your time in a way that factors in your tasks as well as time to support your team.</p> \n<h3>6. Cultivate self-awareness.</h3> \n<p>Do you know what your strengths and weaknesses are?</p> \n<p>Some of us never think about them outside of job interviews, but it’s important to check in with yourself on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>This self-assessment will allow you to identify areas of improvement and seek out resources to be a better manager for your team.</p> \n<h3>7. Lean on your peers and mentors<span style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 14px;\">.</span></h3> \n<p>You’ve done everything you can on your end to become a better manager. That’s great – now lean on those around you.</p> \n<p>Your peers can offer insight into their strategies and thought processes to help you on your own. A mentor will have a breadth of knowledge and experience that you can learn from to grow as a manager.</p> \n<p>In fact, one <a href=\"http://surveymonkey.com/curiosity/cnbc-workplace-happiness-index-july-2019/\">2019 CNBC/Survey Monkey survey</a> found that employees are more likely to be satisfied with their job when they have a mentor than those who don’t.</p> \n<p>We naturally tend to stay in our comfort zone and seek out information that validates our current beliefs and biases. By seeking out guidance from others, you widen your lens and gain an opportunity to do things differently.</p> \n<p>Improving your management skills won’t happen overnight. However, if you stay in tune with your team’s needs and maintain a willingness to learn, you’re well on your way.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmanagement-skills&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"0271f7c787609458ee397a0a39560ad6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-42-278_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn74@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-49-176_5d7cf3090735f322.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmanagement-skills&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn57@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-45-554_b42214572906e93e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741256},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"LinkedIn vs. Facebook: Which Is Best for Your Business?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-vs-facebook","description":"<p>The slew of social media channels available today can paralyze even the savviest business owners.</p> \n<p><em>Where do you start?

This leaves us with this question: Which one should <em>you</em> focus your efforts on?</p> \n<p>We’ll cover the pros and cons of each platform below.</p> \n<h2>LinkedIn vs. Facebook for Business</h2> \n<p>Let's recap quickly.</p> \n<p>At its core, LinkedIn is a professional network that was initially created as a corporate recruitment platform. Now, it <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-content-marketing?_ga=2.257431054.449608931.1631435253-542225752.1631435253\">boasts many features</a> similar to traditional social media sites, including status updates, blogging capabilities, and private messages.</p> \n<p>It’s also the<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">most effective platform</a> when it comes to delivering content and securing audience engagement.</p> \n<p>Facebook, on the other hand, was specifically designed as a place for people to share and communicate. The \"sharing\" element is its most prominent selling point, but there are still plenty of other features that allow businesses to effectively reach their audiences.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-ways-to-drive-product-discovery-and-purchases\">one survey by Facebook</a> found that 74% of American consumers use the platform to discover new products and brands.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn and Facebook both have the Groups feature that allows you to connect with other like-minded people, and they both have powerful ad setups.</p> \n<p>So with similar features, what <em>are </em>the key differences between the two? We’ll cover those here.</p> \n<h3>Numbers-wise, Facebook wins hands down.</h3> \n<p>Facebook has an astounding<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">2.8 </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">billion monthly </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">active users (MAU) across the world</a>, which makes <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/194471/number-of-linkedin-users-usa/\">LinkedIn's 64.7 million MAU</a> seem small in comparison.</p> \n<p>On both platforms, the biggest age group is 25- to 34-year-olds, according to 2021 data from Statista. However, Facebook has a wider range of users with roughly 10% falling below 18 years old or above 64 years old.</p> \n<p>This is because LinkedIn caters mostly to professionals looking to network whereas Facebook hosts the everyday consumer.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">2020 State of Marketing Report</a> by HubSpot revealed that marketers see the highest return on investment from Facebook, with LinkedIn being the 4th highest out of 8 platforms.</p> \n<h3>LinkedIn is a stronger B2B platform.</h3> \n<p>As mentioned before, LinkedIn is a go-to spot for business-driven individuals. As such, it’s a great platform for business-to-business brands.</p> \n<p>Here’s a breakdown of why:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>It’s easy to identify key decision-makers (and reach them in ads).</li> \n <li>Social selling is embedded into the platform.</li> \n <li>It’s easier to network as the platform was built specifically for that purpose.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/linkedin-holds-third-of-all-us-b2b-digital-display-ad-revenue?trk=lms-blog-librand\">eMarketer reported</a> that LinkedIn occupies the largest share of B2B display ad spending at 32%. But we’ll talk more about ads in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-vs-facebook#ads\">this section</a>.</p> \n<p>Facebook may work better for brands that want to reach consumers directly. In addition, you gain access to ten times more prospects and have a great place to generate brand awareness and engagement. So, while Facebook leads in numbers, LinkedIn takes the win when it comes to generating tangible leads.</p> \n<h3>Thought leadership happens more organically on LinkedIn.</h3> \n<p>Thought leadership is one way brands are gaining credibility as well as visibility. According to a <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/2020-thought-leadership-report/\">2020 Thought Leadership Report by Survey Monkey</a>, 66% of marketers consider it a top priority within their marketing team.</p> \n<p>A thought leader’s role is to educate, encourage conversation and drive action. The same study shows that thought leadership programs help with lead generation and brand awareness efforts by increasing website traffic, media mentions, subscribers, and more.</p> \n<p>When it comes to thought leadership articles, LinkedIn has a leg up. The platform is already designed for business conversations. As such, brands can have more success with thought leadership content compared to Facebook.</p> \n<p>So, here’s a quick recap:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Facebook pros: </strong>Large user base, proven ROI</li> \n <li><strong>Facebook cons: </strong>Isn’t the best for B2B marketing</li> \n <li><strong>LinkedIn pros: </strong>Business-driven platform, social selling and networking tools, great opportunities for thought leadership</li> \n <li><strong>LinkedIn cons: </strong>Smaller user base</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that we've taken a general look at the two platforms, let's take a more detailed look at some of the key features they have for businesses.</p> \n<h2>LinkedIn Groups vs. Facebook Groups</h2> \n<p>The Groups feature on both<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164/linkedin-groups-membership-overview?lang=en\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164/linkedin-groups-membership-overview?lang=en\">LinkedIn</a> and<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/265435626889287\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/265435626889287\">Facebook</a> gives businesses the chance to mingle and connect with prospects and other like-minded businesses.</p> \n<p>However, it's critical to keep in mind people's motives when they're on different sites. When users are engaging with others in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4710/5-tips-for-creating-promoting-and-managing-a-linkedin-group.aspx\">LinkedIn Groups</a>, there's a high chance they're in a work-related mindset in some capacity.</p> \n<p>In Facebook Groups, on the other hand, people are more likely to share their personal opinions on everything – from lifestyle and food to politics and hobbies.</p> \n<p>So, when determining which Groups feature is best for you, think about the audience you're targeting.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you're targeting general consumers with an interest in cooking because you're selling the latest food blender, Facebook Groups is probably the way to go.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>However, if you're selling a high-priced service for top-tier management personnel, LinkedIn Groups might be a better bet.</p> \n<p>Finally, let's touch on the ads aspect of both platforms.</p> \n<p>In terms of variety, both platforms have reached pretty equal footing.</p> \n<p>While Facebook has boasted a diverse range of ad types for years (we're talking canvas, carousel, video, dynamic, and lead ads just to name a few), LinkedIn now also offers several ad formats, including video, carousel, lead, dynamic, and Sponsored InMail ads.</p> \n<p>Each offers a user-friendly ad manager. This means that you can start organizing your creative assets on a content marketing platform like <a href=\"https://www.casted.us/solution/platform\">Casted</a>, then build your ad in just a few steps on either LinkedIn or Facebook.</p> \n<p>Targeting-wise, if you think Facebook has the <em>capability</em> of reaching more people, you're right. However, this doesn't mean that LinkedIn doesn't have powerful targeting capabilities.</p> \n<p>Both platforms are centered around user input and serve up ads and content relevant to the information their members give them.</p> \n<p>On both Facebook and LinkedIn, you can target users based on job title, household income, company, location, and age on both platforms. Where Facebook has the upper hand is that you can dig a little deeper on Facebook, targeting users depending on their life milestones, behavior, and other personalized information.</p> \n<p>In addition, both platforms allow brands to use source audiences to reach consumers who are similar to their current audience. Facebook calls it \"Lookalike Audience\" while LinkedIn has named it \"Audience Expansion.\"</p> \n<p>Lastly, it's important to consider the cost.</p> \n<p>Typically, you get more for your money on Facebook. <a href=\"https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/facebook-ads-vs-linkedin-ads/\">According to WebFX</a>, the average cost-per-click for a LinkedIn ad is a whopping $5.26, compared to just $0.97 with Facebook.</p> \n<p>However, a higher cost doesn’t necessarily translate to a higher return on ad spend (ROAS).</p> \n<h2>Who Wins? You Decide</h2> \n<p>While LinkedIn and Facebook do share common features, it's clear their purpose and audiences are quite different.</p> \n<p>Which one you decide to use depends entirely on what industry you're in, who you're trying to reach, and your marketing goals.</p> \n<p>It’s also important to note that you don’t necessarily have to choose. Perhaps you use LinkedIn for a targeted lead generation campaign, while you use Facebook to increase brand awareness and engage with your customers.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in August 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3798b15e-747c-485c-9978-e2892c7e9811&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"social media content calendar\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3798b15e-747c-485c-9978-e2892c7e9811.png\" /></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flinkedin-vs-facebook&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5effd942-8317-40c2-86c5-7af4169660ea.png","linkMd5":"8d871ea0ded450648a0e94b552a1ef1d","destWidth":393,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":3692,"destBytes":6052,"author":"Ryan Gould","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5effd942-8317-40c2-86c5-7af4169660ea.png":null,"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3798b15e-747c-485c-9978-e2892c7e9811.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-44-001_dfeb7fad21cab804.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flinkedin-vs-facebook&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn54@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-46-411_18a25a2639483d61.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741252},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"10 Real Estate Social Media Marketing Strategies That'll Bring in New Business","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5911/social-media-dos-and-don-ts-for-realtors.aspx","description":"<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <p><em>The following is a guest post by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leslie-mann-4b681717/\">Leslie Mann</a>, a real estate agent with <a href=\"http://www.gibsonsothebysrealty.com/eng\">Gibson Sotheby's International Realty</a> of Weston, MA.</em></p> \n <p>Buying or selling a home is an important financial (and emotional) decision.

Promote the town, not just the house.</h4> \n<p>Homebuyers want to know the good, bad, and ugly of each town to which they're considering a move. Yet, most real estate blogs simply give buyers basic demographic statistics and perhaps some flowery language about the area. Instead, use your social media channels to provide potential clients a far richer understanding of the markets you serve, letting them know the pros and cons of each neighborhood.</p> \n<p>Many cities have a \"@CityOf ...\" Twitter handle, which you can mention directly in your own tweets. Use these handles to promote properties you have listed in that city. City accounts on Twitter tend to be receptive to these shout-outs and might retweet you — increasing your post's reach to <em>their</em> followers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/?ref=sem_smb&amp;utm_source=GOOGLE&amp;utm_medium=fbsmbsem&amp;utm_campaign=Instagram_LP_Phase_2_Alpha&amp;kenid=eb821d0b-6091-4287-96a2-35bfd4a838c0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjcy56b3t3AIVB56fCh1sCAVEEAAYASAAEgLSNPD_BwE\">Instagram Business accounts</a> are also prime real estate (no pun intended) for you to post beautiful photos of the town in which your properties are listed.</p> \n<h4>2. Be yourself.</h4> \n<p>I've heard of many realtors who pay a ghost writer to write their marketing copy, yet this approach has its shortcomings. The copy simply doesn't ring true; it fails to give clients a sense of who you really are. Studies show that consumers want to make a personal connection with those whom they do business with, and there's no shortcut to writing your own authentic social media content that resembles who you are as a real estate agency.</p> \n<p>Let your personality shine through across each social network you're on. It's a great way to open a dialogue with a client before they ever pick up the phone.</p> \n<h4>3. Educate your buyers.</h4> \n<p>Some of the most trying days as a real estate agent prove to be great lessons we can share with our clients. Talking about common real estate pitfalls makes your buyers smarter, giving them a smoother browsing experience and qualifying them to work with you.</p> \n<p>Social media is the perfect outlet for this. If you have a blog, consider writing articles about home-buying tips, and use social media to promote them. Perhaps you can tweet a \"Real Estate Fact of the Day,\" hashtagging #realestate while you're at it.</p> \n<h4>4. Chat with your followers.</h4> \n<p>Home buyers today expect instant responses to their questions, but where they ask those questions has changed.</p> \n<p>Home buyers are calling real estate agents much less than they used to with questions about a property or neighborhood. They're going online, using <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/10/getting-things-done-with-the-help-of-your-friends/\">Facebook's Recommendations feature</a>, and tweeting at real estate offices on Twitter. Be ready for this outreach, answer them, and use these questions as an opportunity to start dialogue with followers who might be in the early stages of the buying process.</p> \n<h4>5. Respond to comments, good and bad.</h4> \n<p>Respond promptly and courteously to engage readers who post comments on your social media sites. One caveat: Don't feel compelled to respond to those who post abusive comments. Social media does lure its share of online bullies, and not every remark aimed at your is worth your breath.</p> \n<p>Resist the temptation to get into battle with your harshest critics, and acknowledge those who praise your service. A lot of people who reach out to you are simply looking for more information about a listing -- or a listing they might've thought was still available, but has been sold or rented. Absorb their frustration and use their comment as an opportunity to pivot their interest to other properties.</p> \n<h3>Practices That Agents Should Avoid</h3> \n<h4>6. Shouting about your home listings</h4> \n<p>It's fine to let people know about the homes you're marketing, but don't make the house itself the primary topic of your conversation. Think about common questions home buyers and sellers ask you, and turn these into posts. Provide valuable content and you'll keep people coming back.</p> \n<h4>7. Forgetting video</h4> \n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.47226663.1495790357.1629647959-1194139283.1629647959\">8 billion</a> daily video views on Facebook.</p> \n<p>It's tempting to skip the expense of shooting and editing a video, but online video is an important element of home marketing. Think about it: Home buyers are visual buyers, and if done well, a video creates an emotional connection with them that they might not have from just a photo-based listing.</p> \n<p>YouTube videos also improve your website's ranking in search engines like Google -- a common place where home buyers and renters start their search for a new home.</p> \n<h4>8. Assuming you're only connecting with first-time buyers</h4> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-16-2021.pdf\">recent PDF by the National Association of Realtors (NAR)</a>, 24% of home buyers in America are 41-50 years old or younger. About 22% of them are <em>first-time</em> buyers. If you think you're just talking to first-time home buyers on social media, think again.</p> \n<p>If you think you think you're just talking to first-time home buyers on social media, think again.</p> \n<p>Social networks like Facebook are great places to engage \"fans\" and learn what they're looking for from their agent, but keep in mind they're not all new to the buying process. Have content suited for all levels of home-buying experience ready to serve up to your fans and followers -- you never know whom you'll be connecting with.</p> \n<h4>9. Talking to yourself</h4> \n<p>A post, link, photo, or tweet on your profile might look nice to <em>you</em>, but it means very little if it doesn't resonate with the people who are following your page.</p> \n<p>Social media is more about listening than about talking. Pay attention to what people are saying about you and your brand. Solicit and gather feedback through informal polls or via free survey services like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">Survey Monkey</a><a href=\"http://www.tweetbeep.com/\">&nbsp;</a>or <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=d\"> Google Forms</a>.&nbsp;This will ensure each and every piece of content you share on social media reflects the interests of your customers.</p> \n<h4>10. Ignoring your existing clients</h4> \n<p>Invite your previous buyers and sellers to join you on social media. That way, your sites becomes richer communities of shared experiences and objective advice from those who recently completed the home buying/selling journey.</p> \n<h2>Using Social Media for Real Estate</h2> \n<p>It may not seem like the right channel to use for your industry, but using social media for real estate has various benefits. Most significantly, there are more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/\">3.78 billion</a> social media users globally, and the average person spends close to <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/social-media-users\">2 ½</a> hours using social media every single day. So, statistically speaking, your audience is already on social media — why not meet them where they already are?</p> \n<p>Second, social media also offers targeted advertising options tailored to audiences in specific locations — isn’t that just what realtors look for?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lastly, having a social media presence helps you build brand awareness and generate trust with your audience. They may not be ready to make a purchase yet or even reach out to begin a conversion, but if they see you’re consistently active on your platforms, or they come across one of your advertisements, they may make a mental note of what you offer and come back to you when they’re prepared to begin their process.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>COVID-19 has also impacted the real estate market, just as it has for other industries, so leveraging social media will help you stay up-to-date with current trends.</p> \n<h3>Social Media House-Buying Trends from COVID-19</h3> \n<p>While social media has always been a tool for realtors to leverage, COVID-19 has brought it center stage.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of the biggest changes is the rise of virtual showings. Some agencies reserved virtual viewings for specific circumstances or luxury homes, but it has now become a common practice: “We used to keep our virtual tours for our luxury homes, but we’ve found it adds to the home buying experience for our clients,” <a href=\"https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/evolution-of-home-showings-during-covid-19\">says Lisa Alexander</a>, president of Del-Co Realty.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As health and safety restrictions are lifted, virtual showings are likely here to stay as buyers have realized a significant benefit from them: reduced costs. Buyers searching for new homes in locations they’re not in can save time and money on travel costs until they’re sure about their options.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The length of the searching process is also lowered, as buyers can view multiple homes in a short period via online video or virtual tour, as opposed to waiting weeks for an open house or for there to be a space for them during a showing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Given its relevance, let’s go over the various ways to leverage different social media platforms to share real estate content.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Real Estate Social Media Content</h2> \n<p>Realtors can benefit from using many of the same platforms that most businesses can benefit from — Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Let’s discuss how you can use them, and then go over content ideas to share on each platform.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Facebook for Realtors</h3> \n<p>Facebook is an excellent tool for real estate professionals. It offers various high-quality options: targeted ads for local listings, Facebook messenger for conversations with clients, and the ability to share multiple forms of multimedia: images, videos, and even live video.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Instagram for Realtors</h3> \n<p>On Instagram, Realtors can create a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-for-business-guide?_ga=2.72536211.1495790357.1629647959-1194139283.1629647959\">business account</a> and include contact CTA buttons so those who land on your profile can send you a message on the platform, an email about a property image they saw that intrigued them, or other personalized options.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The platform is great for sharing high-quality image content, and the image below is an example of a new property announcement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/annunce%20recently%20listed%20real%20estate%20properties%20on%20instagram.jpg?width=543&amp;name=annunce%20recently%20listed%20real%20estate%20properties%20on%20instagram.jpg\" alt=\"realtor social media example instagram post announcing new listing\" width=\"543\" style=\"width: 543px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>TikTok for Realtors</h3> \n<p>TikTok is an emerging platform for all industries, but it can be extremely beneficial for realtors, especially considering that the audience favors <a href=\"https://medium.com/clyde-group/gen-z-is-all-about-authenticity-59d863b0bdcf\">behind-the-scenes type content</a>, which is exactly what house walkthroughs are (the video below is an example).</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto; max-height: 811px;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@smartcityhtx/video/6985547722610756870\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\">  \n   <a title=\"@smartcityhtx\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@smartcityhtx\">@smartcityhtx</a> \n   <p>Can anyone guess what this floor plan goes for before specials?👇 <a title=\"houstonapartments\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/houstonapartments\">#houstonapartments</a> <a title=\"midtownhouston\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/midtownhouston\">#midtownhouston</a> <a title=\"houstonmidtown\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/houstonmidtown\">#houstonmidtown</a> <a title=\"apartmentliving\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/apartmentliving\">#apartmentliving</a> <a title=\"houston\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/houston\">#houston</a></p> \n   <a title=\"♬ original sound - smartcityhtx\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6985547600460073734\">♬ original sound - smartcityhtx</a>  \n  </blockquote> \n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In addition, TikTok users don’t expect content to be high-quality or professional-grade, which is even better for realtors that can just use a phone camera on-site to take a video. Below we’ll go over additional content ideas to post on social media.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Real Estate Social Media Ideas</h2> \n<p><strong>Going live for open house and virtual showings.</strong></p> \n<p>Realtors can do this on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, and a benefit to going live is that the videos can be saved and later shared to your profile, acting as an additional form of content.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Answering audience questions.&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p>All social media platforms are a great place to answer audience questions, as you can engage with your audience and develop a rapport that leads to a working relationship. The TikTok below is an example of a realtor answering an audience question about financing a home.&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto; max-height: 811px;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mickeywrightrealtor/video/6987474860771380485\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\">  \n   <a title=\"@mickeywrightrealtor\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mickeywrightrealtor\">@mickeywrightrealtor</a> \n   <p>Down Payment for a $350,000 house! <a title=\"tiktokrealtor\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokrealtor\">#tiktokrealtor</a> <a title=\"smallbusinessowner\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/smallbusinessowner\">#smallbusinessowner</a> <a title=\"downpayment\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/downpayment\">#downpayment</a> <a title=\"firsttimehomebuyer\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/firsttimehomebuyer\">#firsttimehomebuyer</a> <a title=\"realestate\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/realestate\">#realestate</a></p> \n   <a title=\"♬ original sound - JoceM\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6928337222290770694\">♬ original sound - JoceM</a>  \n  </blockquote> \n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another benefit to answering questions publicly is that it’s <em>public</em>, and everyone can see your responses. This can help interested buyers approach you with qualified, further-down-the-funnel questions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Share customer testimonials and success stories.</strong></p> \n<p>All platforms are a great place to share <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/testimonial-request-template?_ga=2.155768635.1495790357.1629647959-1194139283.1629647959\">customer testimonials</a>, helping you use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-stats?_ga=2.155768635.1495790357.1629647959-1194139283.1629647959\">user-generated content</a> to establish legitimacy and credibility with your audience.

The more information we have about our audience, the more we’re able to make effective marketing moves.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In addition, having the numbers to back up the implementation of a marketing strategy is almost as important as the strategy itself. One of the ways to get this data is through social media testing, where you figure out what campaigns resonate most with your audience and help you meet your marketing goals.</p>  \n<p>In this post, learn how you can run a social media test to help you meet your marketing goals and discover high-quality tools that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Download: A/B Testing Guide and Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>For instance, you might run a social test to learn if video campaigns are worth investing in on Facebook, so you create a post that measures impressions of an ad with and without a video attached. After the campaign, the interactions with your post will tell you if a video is a worthwhile investment for your brand, which makes this process so important.</p> \n<h3>The Benefits of Social Testing</h3> \n<p>Social media testing is important because it provides data-driven insights about your social media marketing activities. It allows you to analyze how different variables, like photo and video, affect performance.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, social media tests provide data about how audience behavior can influence the structure of your campaigns. You’ll get a picture of what is successful for your brand, and you can create campaigns that you know will work. Instead of researching countless industry benchmarks, you’ll have concrete data specific to your business that comes from testing results.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are multiple types of social media tests you can run for your business, and we’ll discuss them next.</p> \n<h2>Types of Social Tests</h2> \n<p>Let's say you want to know how copy affects an international audience on LinkedIn. Or, that you want evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages?_ga=2.2260019.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\">landing page</a> performing better with a different image. Maybe you're trying to identify if changing the tone of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-good-instagram-caption\">Instagram captions</a> will lead to more audience engagement.</p> \n<p>All of these scenarios are prime for social tests. They point out a problem that can be answered with data. This data would give insight about audiences interactions with brands on social media.</p> \n<p>After identifying the goal, it’s time to pick the type of test. Let's go through the different types and when you might use them.</p> \n<h3>A/B Test</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing?_ga=2.2260019.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>A/B tests</span></a> are likely the most common form of social testing. They look at a variable between two content types, measure the outlined goal, and provide results. So, consider running an A/B test if you want to test a single, small variable that may alter audience behavior.</p> \n<p>For example, run an A/B test if you want to test out different CTA buttons on a Facebook ad or experiment with a post's copy with/without emojis. The image below is an example of what an A/B test can look like.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a_b%20testing-2.jpg?width=1386&amp;name=a_b%20testing-2.jpg\" alt=\"social a/b testing set-up layout example\" width=\"1386\" style=\"width: 1386px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing?_ga=2.2260019.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\"><em><span>Image Source</span></em></a></p> \n<h3>Split Test</h3> \n<p>Split tests are often confused with A/B tests. In essence, they do the same thing: test two content types based on a goal. The difference is that a split test is more general than an A/B test; they're used to determine big changes, and the two variants are often entirely different.</p> \n<p>Use split testing if you want to know which layout of your Facebook Business page performs better. You can also run split tests to determine A/B test factors. For example, you can run a split test to determine which ad video cut you will use for a Sponsored Tweet, then A/B test different sections of the winning cut. The image below is an example of what a split test could look like on a business website.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/split-testing.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=split-testing.jpeg\" alt=\"split social testing example set up\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-ads-split-testing-101/\"><em>Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n<h3>Multivariable Test</h3> \n<p>Multivariable tests work differently than the two previously mentioned types, as they work with multiple variables instead of one or two. You can run a multivariable test to determine which of four ads works best. Alternatively, you can run one to assess the different makings of a post, like images vs. copy vs. captions.</p> \n<p>Run a multivariate test if you want to see the results of more than two different elements. For example, compare the caption, image, and CTA of a LinkedIn post to see what audiences are responding to, or look at three versions of a GIF to learn how audiences react to them. The image below is an example of a what a multivariate test set up could look like.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/multivariate%20testing.png?width=630&amp;name=multivariate%20testing.png\" alt=\"social multivariate testing example\" width=\"630\" style=\"width: 630px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.comarch.com/trade-and-services/loyalty-marketing/blog/adapting-to-changing-consumer-behaviors-with-a-b-and-multivariate-testing/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>When you've picked out your social test experiment, make sure you're imploring best practices so the results are helpful.</p> \n<h2>Social Testing Best Practices</h2> \n<p>Social media testing can be extremely helpful — if you're executing them correctly. Otherwise, your test could be inaccurate, immeasurable, and ultimately, a waste of time.</p> \n<p>The good news is that social tests aren't hard to create or run. The bad news is that if you aren't prepared to run one, your results won't be usable. Make sure that when you design your test, you follow these best practices:</p> \n<h3>1. Have one specific goal.</h3> \n<p>When your social test has one identifiable goal, everything else falls into place: variables, unit of measurement and time frame. To illustrate this, let's say your goal is to improve international engagement with your next Facebook ad.</p> \n<p>With that goal decided, you can create the variables, so you decide to run an A/B test to determine which copy earns the most impressions. You estimate that because your impression ads usually run for a month, half that time would give measurable results.</p> \n<p>You also know the direction of the ad, so <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template?_ga=2.6424497.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\"><span>your focused goal</span></a> makes it easier to know what to look for during analysis. Impressions, for example, would be the metric to look at for the Facebook ad mentioned earlier.</p> \n<h3>2. Know who your audiences are.</h3> \n<p>If you decide to conduct a social test, your data will reflect the behaviors of a specific target market and how they engage with your messaging.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Social testing is a great way to learn about the social media behavior of an audience segment. If you had little to no information about how your millennial audience would react to a new Instagram Story Ad, running a test would give you a data-driven answer.</p> \n<p>Without knowing your audience, your data wouldn't apply to a defined set of your target market. You’d have insight, but it would be unclear how results relate to your different <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-segment-and-nurture-your-customers-with-hubspot?_ga=2.12210103.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\"><span>audience segments</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. Take note of your current performance.</h3> \n<p>Before you run the test, know how your current campaign is running or note previous results. Then, at the end of your experiment, you can compare results and make informed decisions. The previous report will give the background information and context needed to analyze the social test findings.</p> \n<p>Even if your marketing goals for your social test are different than previous campaigns, it's still a good idea to refer to them for context. For instance, you may be testing for conversions rather than retargeting, but having an idea of what audiences prefer helps you structure your campaign.</p> \n<h3>4. Monitor your test periodically.</h3> \n<p>Don't leave your test as soon as it begins — monitor it so you can adjust accordingly. A test that's running for a month, for example, should be checked regularly for performance benchmarks.</p> \n<p>If you use social test software or tools on social media channels, the report starts aggregating when your test starts. So, when you check-in, look at how you're tracking for your #1 goal. Additionally, take note of what other metrics you see and how they're performing.</p> \n<p>You might find, for instance, that your conversion rate is low. You can monitor conversions for the duration of the test or make a minor tweak to try to improve performance. For the subsequent check-ins, you'll have an additional metric to take into account.</p> \n<p>When the test concludes, you'll have the knowledge from previous checks to round out your perception of the completed report. Along with your intended goal, identify supporting metrics to understand how they work together.</p> \n<h3>5. Make your test timely.</h3> \n<p>How long should you run your test? Long enough to get the answer to your hypothesis. That doesn't tell you much, though, so let's add to that.</p> \n<p>Ideally, your test should run for at least seven days. A week is enough time for your social testing software to compile a basis of data. It won't be as concrete as a more extended test, but it's a starting point.</p> \n<p>After seven days, look at your performance and decide if you've gathered enough data to answer your hypothesis. If not, run the test for a few more days. Then, based on the nature of your campaign, fix the time frame to fit your business and your audience — but make sure you give yourself enough room for an actionable report.</p> \n<p>Picking a test duration period ensures you won't be wasting money and time. Instead of having a test run for too long or too little, figure out your time frame and budget during the planning process.</p> \n<p>So, with these best practices in mind, you're almost ready to run a successful social test. Before you get going, though, let's talk about where — and how — to do that.</p> \n<h2>Where can I run a social test?</h2> \n<p>There's a couple of avenues to explore when choosing where to run a social network test. If you're running a test specifically for social media, the channel you're using might have testing tools in their business software.</p> \n<p>Running social tests on the corresponding media platforms is helpful because you don't have to track different channels during the test. Additionally, you won't have to worry about misconstrued data a third party might provide.</p> \n<p>You can also run a social test using a CRM, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/?_ga=2.107030401.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>HubSpot</span></a>. CRMs are a great choice if you want to test functions outside of social media — landing pages, emails, or other marketing activities. First, though, let's talk about social media offerings.</p> \n<h3>Facebook Social Testing</h3> \n<p>Facebook offers tools to run A/B and multivariate tests for ads. You can access these tests via <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager\">Ad Manager</a>. Ad Manager tells you which ads (or ad tests) are running and their status. When you click on a certain test, details and metrics open.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing.png\" alt=\"Facebook A/B testing\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Multivariate tests on Facebook are similar, except they can be found in the Experiments section of your <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\">Facebook Business</a> account. Though the social tests are located in different places, the process for setting them up is largely the same.</p> \n<p>Social testing on Facebook is intuitive, especially if you're used to running Facebook Ads. After clicking \"Create Ad,\" you'll be taken through a series of prompts to create, set metrics, and pick an audience. When you fill in the details, you publish it, and wait for the results.</p> \n<p>Start small if you're getting the hang of things. Its features are customizable, so the choice is yours in terms of time frame, audience, copy, testing options, and metrics. As your familiarity grows, tests can be scaled.</p> \n<p>As an example, after running a social test on Facebook, bone broth brand Kettle &amp; Fire found a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/kettle-and-fire\">14 point increase in brand awareness</a>. The marketing team wanted to raise online sales with a video campaign, and wanted to find out which video length was favored by customers.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-3.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Kettle &amp; Fire Facebook social media A/B Test example\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/kettle-and-fire\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In a little less than a month, a 1.5 lift in purchasing consideration and sales conversions from the short video led to the answer. A Facebook test saved the team ad spend and informed them about their audience's Facebook preferences.</p> \n<p>Facebook delivers social testing results in a downloadable report. The software determines the winner based on the metric(s) you chose when creating the test. For information about running a Facebook social testing, check out this post about testing on the platform.</p> \n<h3>Twitter Social Testing</h3> \n<p>Social testing on Twitter leads to creating tweets audiences will interact with and enjoy. You'll identify how they use the platform and know how to cater to their needs. Twitter's testing tools are best fit for creative, targeting, and brand awareness campaigns.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-Jun-29-2020-09-51-43-58-PM.png\" alt=\"A Twitter A/B social media test example\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/kettle-and-fire\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Twitter lets you social test Ads in an A/B format. To do this, after publishing the ad, go back into <a href=\"https://ads.twitter.com/\">Ads</a>, duplicate it, make the change, and publish the new variable. Track performance from the Tweet Activity Dashboard and campaign dashboard.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Note that there's no way to set an official test using Twitter, so you'll have to analyze the data yourself. For instance, if you want to see if your new brand voice is taking flight, you'll probably want to look at the amount of clicks and impressions your Ad earned.</p> \n<h3>LinkedIn Social Testing</h3> \n<p>If you're not used to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-advertising-campaigns?_ga=2.254609416.1220074992.1593395332-940436819.1565181751\">LinkedIn Ads</a>, there's several different types. They're sorted based on campaign goal, like Conversion, or type of ad, like Carousel, Text, or Sponsored. It's a great idea to test LinkedIn Ads for promoting — your brand, event, or job listing.</p> \n<p>Dynamic Ads, which show up on the ride side of a user's main feed are highly personalized. Under Dynamic Ads, there's several versions: Follower, Job, Content, and Spotlight. These versions specify what the goal of your ad is — so if you want to let audiences know your company is hiring, you would run a Dynamic Job Ad.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-2.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If you wanted to make a similar Dynamic Job Ad on LinkedIn, you can run a test to see if your listing ad is compelling to job seekers. You'll have the option to test image layouts, such as the company photo, copy, and central images, if applicable.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn's marketing team uses social testing for content and event promotion, as well as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide?_ga=2.254609416.1220074992.1593395332-940436819.1565181751\">account-based marketing</a>. They ran a test for a webinar Dynamic Ad to gauge if audiences preferred an image of the speaker or the company's logo. According to one of LinkedIn's senior marketing managers, Cassandra Clark, results included a <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/marketing-solutions/products/pdfs/LinkedIn-IG-DynamicAds-Final.pdf\">326% lift in click-through rate</a> in the ad with the speaker.</p> \n<p>To access ad results, check your Conversion Tracking dashboard, which will show you page and audience activity from your ads. While LinkedIn doesn't have a formal testing feature, they do have an option for you to duplicate and tweak a portion of an ad, like Twitter.</p> \n<h3>CRM Social Testing</h3> \n<p>If you're not running a test on a social media channel, using a CRM is another worthwhile option. With a CRM, you can set up tests for website content, like landing pages.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In HubSpot, you can run social tests for web pages simply by accessing your dashboard and going to one of your web pages. Click the \"Actions\" hyperlink next to one of your pages, and you'll find the option to \"Run a test.\"</p> \n<p>HubSpot lets you run an A/B or multivariate (Adaptive) test. As you're creating your test, you'll have the option to look at testing tips, like figuring out what to test. Since HubSpot has a drag-and-drop editor, and tons of modules to choose from, you'll have plenty of options. In the past, I've run tests for CTA buttons, images, headline copy, body text, and landing page layout through social media.</p> \n<p>It's commonplace for CRMs to have tools for running social testing. Some offer a niche version of social testing; for instance, <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">MailChimp's</a> are for emails. When you decide to use a CRM for testing, do some research to determine which one will offer you the tools you need to succeed.</p> \n<p>But, if you don't know where to begin looking for software that offers social testing, here's a list of tools for your benefit.</p> \n<h3>1. HubSpot</h3> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/marketing?term=annual&amp;edition=starter&amp;_ga=2.81920533.2001540731.1628802809-620318951.1628802809\">Free plan, or $800 for Marketing Hub Professional</a></p> \n<p>With HubSpot's CRM, you can run A/B and multivariate tests.

From the analytics dashboard, you'll be able to see how many days your test has been running. When you're ready for the test to be complete, you'll have to end it manually.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Inspectlet</h3> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.inspectlet.com/plans\">Free, or $39-$499/mo.</a></p> \n<p>Inspectlet was created just for testing.

Inspectlet lets you track views, page elements, unique visitors, and custom events.</p> \n<p>When you access your performance report, you'll get the metrics based on the goals you set. This can be anything from tracking clicks, user engagement, custom events, or URL views. Basically, anything that you can track with the software can be measured.</p> \n<p>Now, you have a couple of options separate from social media sites that you can social test with. With this in mind, you're ready to run the test.</p> \n<p>Think back to the example in the beginning of the post. Knowing all you do about social testing now, you're fully equipped to run a video engagement experiment of your own. Will it be on a social channel or with testing software?</p> \n<p>One of the many great things about social testing is how creative they can be — you can social test just about any piece of content, and social media sites are starting to make that process easy. Testing your social ads ensures you're providing the most value to your customers, and now, you can.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=1fb2d19e-9ff9-40a7-947e-cc67e7d472cb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"The Ultimate A/B Testing Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1fb2d19e-9ff9-40a7-947e-cc67e7d472cb.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsocial-testing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Sep 2021 17:15:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde.png","linkMd5":"4d964a98797ebdb08beb4fac2bedd48a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-636_1068aaa9a6acaf25.webp","destWidth":378,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":3884,"destBytes":5928,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5d42eade-1de3-4ff1-adba-6b1521e6cbde.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-636_1068aaa9a6acaf25.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a_b%20testing-2.jpg?width=1386&name=a_b%20testing-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn30@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-45-380_296fbc7f5d29f8db.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/split-testing.jpeg?width=1200&name=split-testing.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-46-165_a79d4326d3dd3aac.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/multivariate%20testing.png?width=630&name=multivariate%20testing.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn64@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-48-501_d1e5ed3578a4b3c6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn90@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-48-196_e00701b59bed08fd.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-3.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-Jun-29-2020-09-51-43-58-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn14@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-45-187_568443d111357815.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-47-964_9962706f824b5134.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-Jun-29-2020-09-51-44-13-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn70@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-44-051_42e27dbd2b1a1f6d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-Jun-29-2020-09-51-43-91-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn74@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-47-693_b62224a0ff25fd86.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn78@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-56-50-680_2a691c7530b09207.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Social%20Testing-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn46@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-47-663_ca2259a232a5668a.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1fb2d19e-9ff9-40a7-947e-cc67e7d472cb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-48-465_39667621be686c34.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsocial-testing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn4@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-45-716_ac6ac27ed464e379.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741267},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"Online Advertising: Everything You Need to Know in 2021","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/online-advertising","description":"<p>Have you ever double-tapped an image on Instagram, reacted to a video on Facebook, or clicked a search result in Google, only to realize afterward that it was actually an ad?</p>  \n<p>Maybe you never realized it was an ad at all — you just thought it was a cute picture of a dog.</p> \n<p>More than ever, ads can be contextual, relevant, targeted, and helpful in ways they never could before.

Think about who you’re trying to reach when you start. Ask yourself “What target demographic am I advertising to?” and “How can I place my product or service offering in front of my target?”.</p> \n<p>The answer is to see where your target demographic spends the most time online. Research their most frequented social media channels and most searched keywords. You can take this information and translate it to organic and paid marketing.</p> \n<p>Not all online advertising has to cost money, people can find your business organically through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing</a>. Making a business page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or even TikTok can capture people’s interest through engaging posts and content.</p> \n<p>Now if you want to use pay-per-click (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">PPC</a>) marketing, most social media offers business pages the ability to pay a fee to promote posts/ads within the interface. Or if you are looking to advertise on a search engine for targeted keywords, <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/home/#!/\">Google Ads</a> or <a href=\"https://sixads.net/\">sixads</a> can guide you through the process of payment and execution.</p> \n<p>There are three key ways that digital advertising can help you improve the performance of your organic marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>With digital ads, organic performance can benefit from:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>An increase in brand awareness by displaying your content to individuals within and outside of your networks.</li> \n <li>A better understanding of your audiences by leveraging the targeting and analytics of the ads platforms.</li> \n <li>The creation of higher-performing content by understanding what ad content helps you achieve your business goals and what doesn't.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The goal of any ads strategy should be to get a positive return on your investment, which comes down to whether you're getting more revenue out of the ad campaign than the cost you're putting in.</p> \n<p>How can you determine what your ad spend should be to get the most return on your investment? To start answering that question, we'll need to understand the bidding system used by the ad networks.</p> \n<p>A bid is the maximum amount of money you're willing to pay for the desired action on your ad. If it sounds like an auction, that's because it is an auction. Ad networks have a limited amount of ad space, and to determine whether or not your ads are shown to your target audience, they run an auction to see how much each advertiser is willing to pay for ad space.</p> \n<p>Just like in an auction, the highest bidder wins. Let's say you bid $10 for a click on your ad, and the next highest bidder only pays $5 for a click.</p> \n<p>Each ad network will only make you pay the lowest amount possible to win the bid. In this example, you might be willing to pay $10, but in reality, you'll only have to pay $5.01 to win the bid. Winning this \"auction,\" in addition to the overall quality of your ads, will determine how your ads are displayed on the different ad networks.</p> \n<p>Here's another example of how the ad auction works from<a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\">WordStream</a>.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Image showing how online advertising auctions work.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021.png?width=624&amp;name=Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>At this point, you might be thinking, \"Okay, I get how the auction system works. But how do I figure out how much I should actually spend to see a return on my investment?\"</p> \n<p>My advice is to work backward from your revenue to determine what your maximum bid should be.</p> \n<p>Use this equation:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">Lifetime Value (LTV) x Average Lead-to-Customer Rate x Average Conversion Rate</p> \n<p>Your LTV is how much a customer is worth to you throughout their relationship with your business. The average lead-to-customer rate is the rate at which your leads become paying customers. And your conversion rate is the rate at which new contacts convert on your content offers by filling out a form.</p> \n<p>Combined, these metrics show you how much you should spend on your paid ads to break even.</p> \n<p>Let's say that you want to use digital ads to promote your new content offer. You're going to need to know what your maximum ad spend should be to see a positive return on your investment. Assume that you know the following about your business:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Lifetime value: $500</li> \n <li>Average lead-to-customer rate: 10%</li> \n <li>Average conversion rate: 20%</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Plug these numbers into the equation above to determine what your maximum ad spend should be: $500 x 0.10 x 0.20 = $10. This means that you can spend a maximum of $10 per click on your ad to break even. Your goal should be to spend less than $10 to see a positive return on your investment.</p> \n<h2>Types of Online Advertising</h2> \n<p>Now that we know more about how to advertise online, let's dive into the various types of online advertising.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Social Media Advertising</h3> \n<p>Every month, there are nearly<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">2.5 billion</a> active users on Facebook,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/\">1 billion</a> on Instagram, and<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/\">330 million</a> on Twitter worldwide.</p> \n<p>Whether it's to chat with friends, stay connected to people across the globe, or for business and networking purposes, consumers are on social media for a multitude of reasons — and marketers know it. Because of the sheer number of active users on these platforms, advertising spend invested in social media channels is at an all-time high. Social media advertising across the world is projected to exceed<a href=\"https://marketingland.com/social-media-ad-spend-to-surpass-print-for-first-time-268998\"> </a><a href=\"https://marketingland.com/social-media-ad-spend-to-surpass-print-for-first-time-268998\">$8.5 billion</a> this year.</p> \n<p>Advertising on social media comes with many advantages. You can:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Reach very specific target audiences with the help of targeting features and different audiences across all of the social media platforms.</li> \n <li>Leverage a variety of ad formats to advertise in a way that aligns with your business goals.</li> \n <li>Invest in the specific advertising efforts that drive leads and sales for your business.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let's take a look at eight popular social media networks, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok. We'll cover the audiences and ad types available on each one.</p> \n<h4>1. Facebook</h4> \n<p>Facebook is the most widely used social media network. Almost<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">2.5 billion people around the world use Facebook</a>. That's more than 30% of the<a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\">world's population</a>.</p> \n<p>With so many people using Facebook, you're almost guaranteed to be able to reach an audience that's relevant to any type of business. That's where one of the most powerful features of advertising on Facebook comes in: audience targeting. The targeting capabilities on Facebook are unmatched by any other social media network.</p> \n<p>There are<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\">three types of audiences</a> that you can target on Facebook:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li><strong>Core audiences</strong>: An audience based on criteria like age, interests, and geography.</li> \n <li><strong>Custom audiences</strong>: Get back in touch with people who have previously engaged with your business.</li> \n <li><strong>Lookalike audiences</strong>: Reach new people whose interests are similar to those of your best customers.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Facebook's advanced targeting can be used to target your ads to the most relevant audience — and even tap into new audiences you'd otherwise never reach with organic content alone.</p> \n<p>Advertising on Facebook includes a range of ad types, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Photo ads</li> \n <li>Video ads</li> \n <li>Story ads</li> \n <li>Lead ads</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Photo ads are great for sharing collections of image content. Video ads are great for product explainer videos and branding. Story ads allow you to use a combination of photo and short-form video content. If you want to learn more about the different ad types, here's a great course from HubSpot Academy all about<a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/facebook-advertising-training\"> </a><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/facebook-advertising-training\">Facebook Advertising</a>.</p> \n<p>Personally, my favorite way to advertise on Facebook is with lead ads because they give you the best of both worlds: sharing visual content and generating leads all at the same time. Facebook Lead Ads allow you to capture lead information without directing people out of the Facebook platform.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"social media online advertising: facebook jasper's market\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-46-13-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-46-13-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>No matter your business' size or industry, you can use lead ads to find potential customers who are likely interested in your products or services. With lead ads, you provide a helpful piece of content that encourages viewers to sign up for a newsletter, receive a price estimate, or request additional business information. In return, when the viewer fills out the form, the business receives a new lead.</p> \n<p>Another way to advertise on Facebook is through Facebook Messenger.</p> \n<p>Facebook Messenger is a separate messaging app that comes with its own advertising opportunities. Facebook Messenger is the<a href=\"https://www.messengerpeople.com/global-messenger-usage-statistics/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.messengerpeople.com/global-messenger-usage-statistics/\">go-to messaging app</a> in countries including the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Other messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat are the more popular choice in countries throughout South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"most used social media platform facebook\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-47-27-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-47-27-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://datareportal.com/social-media-users\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Across the world,<a href=\"https://messengernews.fb.com/2019/04/30/messenger-at-f8-2019-over-20b-messages-exchanged-between-people-and-businesses-every-month/\"> </a><a href=\"https://messengernews.fb.com/2019/04/30/messenger-at-f8-2019-over-20b-messages-exchanged-between-people-and-businesses-every-month/\">20 billion messages</a> are exchanged between people and businesses every month on Facebook Messenger. Ads play a big part in initiating conversations on Facebook Messenger.</p> \n<p>There are a few different ways you can use<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/messenger-ads\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/messenger-ads\">Facebook Messenger</a> as part of your advertising strategy.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Facebook Messenger call-to-action in ads</strong>: Start conversations with ads on Facebook that include a call-to-action to send a message.</li> \n <li><strong>Facebook Messenger Story Ads</strong>: Run story ads on Messenger Stories.</li> \n <li><strong>Facebook Messenger Ads</strong>: Use messenger ads to deliver content directly into users' Facebook Messenger chats.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All of these ad types come together to encourage your audience to kick off conversations with your business. They can be used to get in contact with a sales team, request more information on a product, or even share other content like blog posts or ebooks.</p> \n<p>My favorite way to advertise on Facebook Messenger is retargeting. Retargeting ads in Facebook Messenger are a great way to start targeted conversations and send personalized offers and content.</p> \n<p>Sponsored messages allow you to advertise to people who have already interacted with your business in Messenger. This is a great way to re-engage your audience in a personalized way.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"social media online advertising: facebook messenger\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-3.png\" title=\"\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/messenger-ads\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h4>2. Instagram</h4> \n<p>You can also advertise on Instagram through the Facebook Ads Manager.

LinkedIn</h4> \n<p>The LinkedIn platform has over<a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#statistics\"> </a><a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#statistics\">660 million monthly active members</a> worldwide. Users on the platform are largely made up of working professionals which makes LinkedIn a great place for B2B (business-to-business) advertising. LinkedIn is the go-to platform for working professionals, which provides B2B advertisers a large audience pool to reach.</p> \n<p>Plus, the advantage of advertising on LinkedIn is its unique<a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads\"> </a><a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads\">targeting capabilities</a>. On LinkedIn, you'll have access to unique targeting criteria that isn't available on other platforms.</p> \n<p>You can target users on LinkedIn by unique demographics, including job title, job function, and industry. Maybe you only want to advertise to potential customers at the director level who work in customer service within the recruiting industry. LinkedIn's targeting capabilities make that possible.</p> \n<p>Plus, with the option to include lead gen forms in your LinkedIn ads, LinkedIn can be a lead generation machine. This will allow you to not only reach a very specific audience but drive leads without directing them outside of the LinkedIn platform.</p> \n<p>The most interesting ad type of LinkedIn is Message Ads. Message Ads allow you to send direct messages to your prospects to spark immediate action.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8QK_sVCSdTe1QBzsQWfYqQ9jVOf8MfkZ8l-6ZrAnDrV6dxo10uINCAsYnOx5uQf0X3nhHIIxmqdrJV0O1YkFZdkzT_TkbHw8JtmuxAchAiXX4kfojgQNdhy6TLUXLJKNrXnPcg5_=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"359\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"social media online advertising: linkedin\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/message-ads\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>How to use LinkedIn Message Ads:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Deliver a targeted message with a single CTA.</li> \n <li>Drive stronger engagement and response than traditional emails.</li> \n <li>Measure the impact of your messages.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>But a word of warning: Don't send too many Message Ads to the same people or it will come off like spam. And, make sure the messages sound authentic – if you were writing a LinkedIn message to a friend, what would you write in it?</p> \n<p>If your Message Ads are too stiff, they'll come off as spammy, too. Remember: This channel is a one-to-one conversation. Direct messages are sacred spaces – if you're going to advertise there, you need to be extra careful about taking the time to make your Message Ads feel personal and relevant to your end-users. Make sure you're delivering value to them in a way that feels authentic.</p> \n<h4>4. Twitter</h4> \n<p>Digital advertising is less common on Twitter because organic reach is still a significant driver of a brand's performance on Twitter. This is very unique to Twitter – but even so, ads can still deliver strong results depending on what your goals are. Twitter has over<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/\">330 million monthly users</a> globally. The majority of users are<a href=\"https://thevab.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://thevab.com/\">between 35–65 years old</a>.</p> \n<p>Advertisers have discovered a few niches that have high engagement on Twitter: B2B and e-commerce. Many<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/259382/social-media-platforms-used-by-b2b-and-b2c-marketers-worldwide/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/259382/social-media-platforms-used-by-b2b-and-b2c-marketers-worldwide/\">B2B companies</a> are using Twitter as a digital marketing tool, and Twitter users are known to<a href=\"https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you\"> </a><a href=\"https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you\">spend a lot of money online</a>. This makes advertising specifically to these audiences a great strategy.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6w2hzU06NqZRZ6PMuKMLylyEl7MTb8bxxTCCZVwUlaLgd7Jzx5ALbe21KJZsJn7X_omBPRmthxcTb-79dwtDT9pYQox_G96ES-8YOpji0dchZKpOOVp1qRIM1u1sZPoOI2LATkn8=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"580\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"social media online advertising: twitter\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/solutions/twitter-ads.html\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Twitter breaks down its ads into five goals:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Awareness: Promote your tweets and maximize your reach.</li> \n <li>Tweet engagement: Promote your tweets and get more retweets, likes, and replies.</li> \n <li>Follows: Promote your account and grow your Twitter following.</li> \n <li>Website clicks: Promote your website and get more traffic.</li> \n <li>App downloads: Promote your app and get more downloads.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All of these can work together to help you grow your audience on the platform and convert users into customers.</p> \n<h4>5. Pinterest</h4> \n<p>Pinterest is a unique social media platform with<a href=\"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/300million\"> </a><a href=\"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/300million\">300 million users</a> who are highly engaged and predominantly female. Some people say that Pinterest is the only platform where users actually want to see ads from brands they love because Pinterest is all about visuals.</p> \n<p>How to advertise on Pinterest in<a href=\"https://ads.pinterest.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://ads.pinterest.com/\">four steps</a>:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>Pick a pin: Promote your best pins so they appear in the most relevant places.</li> \n <li>Decide who sees it: Set up targeting so the right people see your ads.</li> \n <li>Pay for results: Choose to pay for engagement or visits to your site.</li> \n <li>Track what's working: Once your campaign starts, see how it's doing and make changes.</li> \n</ol> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WGEfa-40hhGyZme-oIhjSTwn_6dv9wjAhcKGoNIG0ntBDpPdt9iA6ujB9OtBsq8ZM_CNaqDtSczpoKW8eqfKW5w0LeaA20E_MRkt2GLUFaKbbAPgarNV9HdZkuCUEChgMlJCkmkB=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"391\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"social media online advertising: pinterest\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://ads.pinterest.com/\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Pinterest is great for businesses relying on photography to sell their products and who have a female target buyer persona.</p> \n<h4>6. YouTube</h4> \n<p>YouTube is the second largest search engine, second only to Google, with over<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/press/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/press/\">2 billion</a> monthly active users. Ads on YouTube appear before and during other YouTube videos or as a stand-alone promoted video that's displayed after performing a search.</p> \n<p>Since you can target demographic information and interests, you can serve your videos to specific relevant audiences already watching videos from similar brands or on related topics.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aX4xlgL5qg85jH-iYvm5dipkIPkUWMf_lElAYLUTGuc1nXC8rhi676ThzYu3G58jKl-idbbef4oYARBosOfBYQ-7NH2UBfyIeHiYd_HPXfaCO9cgN8-_2pBLStgNQevK4wMuwuTQ=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"639\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"social media online advertising: youtube\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/ads/\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h4>7. Snapchat</h4> \n<p>Snapchat's<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/\">218 million</a> users are predominantly made up of people between the<a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/\">ages of 18–24</a>.</p> \n<p>Snapchat offers a few ad types, including story ads, sponsored tiles in Snapchat Discover, and augmented reality (AR) lenses.</p> \n<p>Snapchat's ad types feel pretty similar to the advertising options on Instagram. What really makes Snapchat unique is the augmented reality lenses. AR lenses are sponsored by a business to create interactive moments that users can use and share with their friends. It might be hard to believe, but in this example from Dominos that pizza isn't really there — that's the AR lens at work.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"social media online advertising: snapchat\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-45-68-PM.png\" title=\"\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/lenses?utm_source=GoogleSEM&amp;utm_medium=PAIDB2B&amp;utm_campaign=G_Search_NB_DSA_Updated-AllPages&amp;utm_term=US&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-rq924S76AIVaYVaBR1xRgmfEAAYASAAEgITNvD_BwE\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h4>8. Tiktok</h4> \n<p>One of the newer — and most popular — players in the social media advertising world is TikTok. TikTok is all about creating short, creative, and oftentimes funny videos. TikTok has exploded in the past few years and has reached<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/short-video-apps-like-douyin-tiktok-are-dominating-chinese-screens.html\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/short-video-apps-like-douyin-tiktok-are-dominating-chinese-screens.html\">500 million monthly users</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://ads.tiktok.com/homepage/?refer=tiktok_web\">Advertising options</a> are still limited; they are mainly geared towards driving awareness. TikTok doesn't hyperlink posts to websites and only recently started allowing advertising, so businesses advertising on TikTok focus on boosting brand awareness rather than leads or traffic.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RzCp7wAq1vd56YEkARi6nDrH8UOCKz9Nsm3qYOGs7IdShNPpo2kx2YZLXxJvWfZW__XjDy_XQnf-M_ENjLTaqX13XTYLntWy6j0NIq5FF5FuE-U63deO_WiNJ4jLi-fca6FJYxgY=s0\" width=\"367\" height=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"social media online advertising: tiktok\"></p> \n<p>Promoting TikTok videos allow brands to build awareness with a young target audience. Most of the posts you'll see on TikTok are aimed at getting laughs. From a brand perspective, you'll want to create videos that are funny and align with other content on the platform. Think of things like dance challenges and memes. This type of content is the most effective.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Paid Search Advertising</h3> \n<p>People searching online are looking for something specific and will click on the first result they believe is going to be the most helpful to them.</p> \n<p>You might be thinking: \"I already appear in organic results on search engines. Why should I pay to advertise too?\"</p> \n<p>Well, there are three key reasons:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>On average, digitally prepared businesses anticipate <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/eir-2020-report.pdf\">four times</a> better revenue compared to the less-prepared ones</li> \n <li>Advertising on search engines protects you from the competition who may be advertising on your branded terms.</li> \n <li>Search ads appear first in the search engine results pages (SERPs) above the organic results.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Paid search advertising allows advertisers to capture the attention of their audience in a more targeted way than with organic search alone.</p> \n<p>Search ads allow you to anticipate the wants, needs, and desires of your potential customers and serve ads to them that are highly contextual. Over time, the analytics of your search ads can help you analyze and improve those ads to reach even more people.</p> \n<p>But how does Google know how to deliver the right ad to the right person? That's where keywords come into play. A keyword is one word or phrase that someone uses to describe what they need in search. Advertising on search platforms takes the targeting capabilities available on social media platforms, like demographics and location, and layers it with the addition of keywords.</p> \n<p>When a Google user types a query into the search field, Google returns a range of results that match the searcher's intent. Keywords align with what a searcher wants and will satisfy their query. You select keywords based on which queries you want to display your ad alongside.</p> \n<p>Keyword research is just as important for paid ads as it is for organic search. That's because Google matches your ad with search queries based on the keywords you selected. Each ad group you create within your campaign will target a small set of keywords and Google will display your ad based on those selections.</p> \n<p>Let's say Mary is moving to a different house and is looking for a home mover. So she goes into Google and types \"who are the best movers.\" By searching \"best home movers,\" she's going to see results for advertisers that targeted keywords like \"moving companies\" and \"top-rated movers.\"</p> \n<p><img alt=\"paid search advertising: Google example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-1.png\" title=\"\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Search engines also consider your intent when choosing the types of ads to display.</p> \n<p>In the example above, search ads were the most helpful resource. But what if you're looking for a location-based business, like a coffee shop? In Google maps, you might see “Promoted Pins” like these, shown in purple on the map and in the search results on the left. Promoted Pins are a great way for businesses to attract customers to their business based on location.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Promoted pins on Google Maps example.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-46-63-PM.png?width=624&amp;height=332&amp;name=Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-Aug-31-2021-06-17-46-63-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"332\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>What if you're looking to make a purchase? Well, Google might show you a different kind of post to match your intent, such as Shopping Post Ads.</p> \n<p>In this example below, Google shows you shopping post ads for the keyword \"buy snowboard.\" Since my query includes the word \"buy,\" Google knows that I'm interested in making a purchase, so I am shown ads for products I might be interested in.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LKjFjSRNnNeMEfFHeQ5uwjJepixpHnmpSwBIMBQ-a5ksoO3P7sM_ZLXoQkmBKjk5iW03qCP14O9mnPNpx_wEPrN2FivRhiaBqQiv-9sc7zwAQokQes0Pjr4EuePVDiUrBayYBRZ2=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"547\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>So how do you select your keywords?</p> \n<p>Keywords typically fall under two categories: brand and non-brand.</p> \n<p>A brand keyword is a word or phrase that includes a brand's name or variations of a brand's name. For example, some of HubSpot's brand keywords include HubSpot, HubSpot Free CRM, and HubSpot Marketing Hub. These are all variations of the HubSpot brand and the tools that we offer.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Branded keywords example in Google paid search ads.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-4.png?width=624&amp;name=Online%20Advertising%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20in%202021-4.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Non-brand keywords are all other relevant keywords that don't include a brand's name or variations of a brand's name. Some of HubSpot's non-brand keywords include inbound marketing, sales software, and customer relationship management.</p> \n<p>While these keywords are not part of HubSpot's brand name, they are relevant terms that allow HubSpot to reach audiences that might be interested in eventually making a purchase.</p> \n<p>Brand and non-brand keywords play a role in your digital advertising strategy. Brand keywords help you protect your brand from your competitor's ads.</p> \n<p>If you don't run ad campaigns for brand keywords, you'll leave your business vulnerable to losing website traffic to the competition who is bidding on your brand keywords. Non-brand keywords still have a role to play, too. Non-brand keywords allow you to reach new audiences unfamiliar with your brand.</p> \n<p>When it comes to when your ad is displayed, you don't just want to pick a certain group of keywords and have the ad shown only when those keywords are entered into the search engine.</p> \n<p>This is where match type comes in. Since there’s an infinite number of ways that people can actually search for one term, Google gives you three match types to choose from: exact match, phrase match, and broad match. You can even use a broad match modifier and exclude negative keywords to optimize where your ads are delivered.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at each match type:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Exact match</strong>: A keyword set to exact match will only display your ad if the search term includes that exact keyword or a very close variation. Exact match keywords are surrounded in [brackets].</li> \n <li><strong>Phrase match</strong>: A keyword set to phrase match will display your ad if the search term contains the same order of the words, but it can also contain additional words. Phrase match keywords are surrounded by \"quotes\".</li> \n <li><strong>Broad match</strong>: A keyword set to broad match displays your ad when the search term contains any or some combination or variations of the words in your keyword, in any order. Broad match keywords don't include any symbols.</li> \n <li><strong>Broad match modifier</strong>: The broad match modifier allows you to select keywords that must be included in the search query for your ad to be displayed. Keywords with a broad match modifier use a +plus sign.</li> \n <li><strong>Negative keywords</strong>: Excludes your ads from being shown on searches with that term. Negative keywords include a -minus sign.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Google vs. Bing vs. Yahoo</h4> \n<p>There are a few advertising platforms out there for search, including Google, Bing, and Yahoo. But Google is by far the most used search engine out there. With<a href=\"https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">3.5 billion search queries a day</a>,<a href=\"https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22searchEngine%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22searchEnginesDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222019-02%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222020-01%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22searchEngine%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22searchEnginesDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222019-02%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222020-01%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D\">over 71% of the total searches</a> made daily around the world are done on Google.

In some cases, you can achieve impressive results with a smaller ad spend on Bing and Yahoo than you could on Google since there is less competition from advertisers.</p> \n<p>My recommendation is to dig into your organic traffic to identify if Bing or Yahoo make up a significant amount of traffic for any given keywords or topics. This might indicate that advertising for those keywords on Bing or Yahoo could be profitable.</p> \n<p>Regardless of where you advertise, the good news is that advertising on all of these platforms more or less work and look the same. So knowing how to advertise on one will make advertising on the others easier.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Native Advertising</h3> \n<p>Publishers like BuzzFeed and The Dodo produce content that snowballs in popularity on social media almost every day. And they make money by helping other brands do it, too. Brands will pay these publishers to craft posts and videos that follow the publishers' formula for virality. They also pay publishers to distribute this sponsored content to their massive audience through social media and their website.</p> \n<p>This is native advertising.</p> \n<p>Check out this example from Geico. It partnered with BuzzFeed to create this video advertisement for morning workouts. It's a topic that is loosely related to insurance, which Geico sells, and it tapped into BuzzFeed's expertise to create this video that feels right at home with the rest of the content on the site.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ok9WQbGyf3MYmZEzlo1EWE1pCoq3X3zesirO54orWEJkFmFw7c2RtTP_-Uo2UuwKzC_wDsEqvs-xTNnUVp4YzgVsk_efCzAifw5B64MT9MPwUv0mAvdyVA-I0oGyAu-iDEOMGVtd=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"475\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>When you pay for a publisher's native advertising services, you'll be able to leverage their editorial expertise and audience reach to help your brand tell captivating stories to a bigger and better viewership. And each publisher is going to support different ad formats and creative types.</p> \n<p>During the creative process, you'll collaborate with publishers to craft sponsored content that covers one of their main topics and looks like a regular piece of content on the publisher's website.</p> \n<p>This way, even though your post is technically promotional, it won't disrupt their audience's browsing experience. They'll enjoy reading your post and won't feel like you or the publisher are advertising to them. This exposes your work to a huge, engaged viewership and attracts new followers to your brand.</p> \n<p>Native advertising creates a symbiotic relationship between publishers and brands. Publishers who do sponsored content right reap the benefits of another revenue stream and gain more audience trust if they promote a native ad from a trustworthy brand.</p> \n<p>For brands, collaborating with prominent publishers can unleash unprecedented amounts of creativity to help them win over the publishers' audience and boost engagement — as the click-through rate on native ads far exceeds traditional. For example, T Brand Studio, the New York Times native ad business, crafted sponsored posts that<a href=\"https://blog.nativeadvertisinginstitute.com/the-new-york-times-makes-some-of-the-best-native-advertising-and-here-is-why\"> captured as much engagement as some of nytimes.com's highest-performing articles</a>.</p> \n<p>To find the optimal native advertising opportunities for your brand, try using<a href=\"https://www.stackadapt.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.stackadapt.com/\">StackAdapt</a> or<a href=\"https://www.nativo.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.nativo.com/\">Nativo</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Display Advertising</h3> \n<p>Display ads are a controversial topic in the digital marketing community. For almost 25 years, advertisers have abused them by tricking internet users into clicking misleading ads — some malicious display ads have even infected people's computers with viruses. It's easy to see why people have developed banner blindness and can't stop downloading ad blockers: display ads have the reputation of being intrusive, distracting, and irrelevant.</p> \n<p>On the other side of the spectrum, though, display advertising technology has advanced to the point where ad networks can leverage data and machine learning to offer advertisers more effective targeting strategies and consumers more relevant ads.</p> \n<p>Ad networks like Google Display Network and Facebook's Audience Network are the leaders in the banner ad renaissance. They can display your ads to the right target audience at the right place and time. And if you want more control of your advertising, they'll let you decide where to place your ads. Below, we'll cover each ad networks' features and targeting capabilities:</p> \n<h4>1. Google Display Network</h4> \n<p>When you use Google's Display Network, you can design visually appealing ads and place them on over two million websites and apps, YouTube, and Gmail.</p> \n<p>You can also build new audiences by targeting people who are most likely to be interested in your product or service and remarket website visitors just by importing a list of their contact information.</p> \n<p>If you don't want to build out your ideal audience or deal with bidding, you can let Google Ads do it for you. Its automated targeting and bidding features can identify your highest-converting audience for the best return on investment.</p> \n<p>Display ads can be most effective when retargeting an audience that's already familiar with your brand.</p> \n<h4>2. Facebook's Audience Network</h4> \n<p>With Facebook's Audience Network, brands can expand their Facebook ad campaigns and use the same targeting data they use on the platform to advertise on a huge collection of websites and apps.<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-facebook-audience-network-and-why-does-it-matter-2016-2\"> </a></p> \n<p>Brands can place native ads, banner ads, full-screen ads, in-stream video ads, and rewarded video ads (for example, \"Watch this video ad to get more tokens!\") on the network's websites and apps that their Facebook audience frequently visits.</p> \n<p>This type of advertising can be particularly effective for mobile games, like in the example below from 5agame who was able to attribute 80% of their revenue through their rewarded video.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img

<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/solopreneur\">solopreneur</a> or running a massive corporation, you need a business budget to understand where your money is coming from and going. A business budget template can help keep the numbers organized, making it easy for you to track revenue, plan for expenses, and save for future growth.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3e2abb94-93d9-4cf5-bd8e-6a96ecc14270&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Click here to download 8 free marketing budget templates.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3e2abb94-93d9-4cf5-bd8e-6a96ecc14270.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>You don’t have to be an accountant to organize your business budget. There are thousands of business budget templates out there to make the process easy. Once you understand what a business budget is and how it can work for you, you can use one of the following free templates to start organizing your finances.</p> \n<p>The business budget follows a set template, which you can fill in with estimated revenues, plus any recurring or expected business expenses.</p> \n<p>For example, if you run a digital marketing business, you might know that you typically make about $10,000 for your work creating campaigns, plus an extra $5,000 for your digital courses. You’d list the estimated revenue from all of your business’ revenue streams as incoming money for the business.</p> \n<p>Then, you have your recurring expenses, which you would list as outgoing money. This could include employee salaries, office expenses, and software and technology costs.</p> \n<h2>How to Create a Business Budget</h2> \n<p>Creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-manage-marketing-budget-free-budget-templates\">business budget</a> is a straightforward process, but it can be more complex for larger companies. Here are the basic steps to creating a business budget.</p> \n<h3>1. Find a Template or Make a Spreadsheet</h3> \n<p>There are many free or paid budget templates online these days, so you can either use one of those to start, or make a simple spreadsheet with custom rows and columns based on your business. We list a few helpful templates below.</p> \n<h3>2. Fill in Revenues</h3> \n<p>Once you have your template, you’ll start by listing all the sources of your business’ income. With a budget, you’re planning for the future, so you’ll need to estimate this based on previous months’ or years’ revenues. For a new small business budget, you’ll rely on your market research to estimate the first revenues for your company.</p> \n<h3>3. Subtract Fixed Costs for the Time Period</h3> \n<p>Fixed costs are the recurring costs you have during each month, quarter, or year. Examples include insurance, rent for office space, website hosting, and internet.</p> \n<h3>4. Consider Variable Costs</h3> \n<p>Variable costs will change from time to time. Examples include utility bills, advertising costs, office supplies, and new software or technology. While you may always need to pay some variable costs, like utility bills, you can also shift how much you spend toward things like advertising expenses when you have lower-than-average estimated income.</p> \n<h3>5. Business Budget Planning</h3> \n<p>Unexpected expenses might come up, or you might want to save to expand your business. Either way, you need to review your budget after including all expenses, fixed costs, and variable costs to find out how much money you can save. It’s wise to create multiple savings accounts for emergencies and for money meant to go back into the business to drive growth.</p> \n<h2>How to Manage a Business Budget</h2> \n<p>There are a few key components to managing your business budget to keep it healthy.</p> \n<h3>Budget Preparation</h3> \n<p>The process all starts with properly preparing and planning the budget at the start of each month, quarter, or year. You can also create multiple budgets, some short-term and some long-term. During this stage, you will also set spending limits and create a system to regularly monitor the budget.</p> \n<h3>Budget Monitoring</h3> \n<p>For larger businesses, you might delegate budget tracking to multiple supervisors, but even if you are a one-person show, you need to regularly monitor the budget. That means setting a time in your schedule each day or week to review the budget and track actual income and expenses, then compare the actual numbers to the estimates.</p> \n<h3>Budget Forecasting</h3> \n<p>With regular budget tracking, you can always know how your business is doing. Check-in regularly to determine how you are doing in terms of revenue, where you have losses, where you can minimize expenses, and how you can move more money into savings. You can use well-tracked budgets to create more accurate budgets for future time periods.</p> \n<h2>Why is a Budget Important for a Business?</h2> \n<p>A budget is crucial for businesses. Without one, you could easily be drowning in expenses or unexpected costs compared to incoming money.</p> \n<p>The business budget helps with several operations. You can use a business budget to keep track of your finances, save money to help you grow the business or pay bonuses in the future, and prepare for unexpected expenses or emergencies.</p> \n<p>You can also review the business budget to determine when to take the next leap for your business. For example, you might be dreaming of a larger office building or the latest software, but you want to make sure you have a healthy net revenue before you make the purchase.</p> \n<h2>Best Free Business Budget Templates</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-budget-templates?_ga=2.88364251.1736734196.1628793578-1536675457.1619887953\">Marketing Budget Template</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/D93NmdMzrpkjlFA8tw7Ga7PJd-mjsUVshgJD7QnZpKzNOXsYMIpi0EX6Cs5POkmjwjuBHk_VXRRbBajUnmshZ7wT2nNN4_PzVGhE7xIwnK_LGHLOGeYTbKdkZc1wCHvx6fSE1ozF=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"309\" alt=\"HubSpot Marketing Budget Template\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-budget-templates?_ga=2.88364251.1736734196.1628793578-1536675457.1619887953\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Knowing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-manage-marketing-budget-free-budget-templates\">how to manage a marketing budget</a> can be a challenge, but with helpful free templates like this <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-budget-templates?_ga=2.88364251.1736734196.1628793578-1536675457.1619887953\">marketing budget template bundle</a>, you can track everything from advertising expenses to events and more.</p> \n<p>This free bundle includes eight different templates, so you can create multiple budgets to help you determine how much money to put toward marketing plus the return on your investment.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://blog.capterra.com/free-small-business-budget-template/\">Small Business Budget Template</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HasjXlMr_yjdOQ48jxYsHUNGcg7_5a51jLbvRjgfV8IVqxgbDJDwt1J4yF8VgOljLNyjV5uCKoLAonzeywxh97w53sK40B7HvuhMejvkMMPbChCK8toO_C6dCmd47HWu-KdFf3Mz=s0\" width=\"624\" height=\"273\" alt=\"Small business budget template\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.capterra.com/free-small-business-budget-template/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>For small businesses, it can be hard to find the time to draw up a budget, but it’s crucial to help keep the business in good health.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.capterra.com/free-small-business-budget-template/\">Capterra offers a budget template</a> specifically for small businesses.

Even in marketing, analyzing the competition is healthy and can help inspire you to learn and adapt the business to better meet consumer needs.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Part of the way to do this is by understanding direct and indirect competition and how each can impact your work. Once you know the differences, you can determine how to best identify and evaluate your competitors — both direct and indirect.</p> \n<h2>What is direct competition?</h2> \n<p>When you think of a marketing competitor, you likely think of your direct competitors. Direct competitors are other businesses offering the same services for the same client needs in the same market as you.</p> \n<p>So, let’s say your marketing firm primarily works with restaurants in the western U.S. There are certainly other firms focused on restaurant marketing specifically in the western U.S., and those firms would be your direct competition.</p> \n<p>Even the smallest markets will have direct competition, which is important to prevent monopolies.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Market Research Templates [Free Kit]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h3>Direct Competition Examples</h3> \n<p>There are many examples of direct competition. McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King are all direct competitors. Similarly, consider the infamous fast-food chicken sandwich wars, when major restaurant chains like Popeyes, KFC, Wendy’s, Zaxby’s, and more all launched chicken sandwiches to appeal to the same consumer base across the U.S..</p> \n<p>Competition doesn’t just apply to huge, national or international brands. Two women’s fashion boutiques in a small, rural town are also direct competitors.</p> \n<p>Digital companies also see direct competition. For example, Instagram and Snapchat offer very similar features, like disappearing stories and direct messaging, to their target audiences.</p> \n<h2>Indirect Competition Examples</h2> \n<p>Let’s say we have a client base in a small town. The customers are hungry, and often frequent the main drag to have dinner. Here, there are four major restaurants — all of which offer different types of food. Although the products they offer are different, the restaurants all stand for the same purpose: to feed hungry clientele in the town.</p> \n<p>Similarly, consider a client who needs to buy gifts for a birthday party. One store sells clothing. A store across the street sells jewelry. Despite the different products, the two stores are competing for the same customer.</p> \n<h2>Direct and Indirect Competition in Marketing</h2> \n<p>When it comes to marketing, knowing your direct and indirect competition can help you improve your campaigns and even reach new audiences.</p> \n<p>The aforementioned chicken sandwich wars are a great example here. Popeyes launched its highly touted fried chicken sandwich with a powerful marketing campaign. Direct competitors — other fast-food restaurants that sell chicken sandwiches — were able to use marketing to showcase their own entries into the so-called competition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The result? The chicken sandwich wars have been heavily covered by major media for the past couple years. Customers have lined up in droves at various fast food restaurants to try the latest and claimed-to-be-greatest chicken sandwiches.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, analyzing your indirect competition can help marketers tap into a wider audience. If you know people shopping for gifts are choosing between your store and similar shops that offer different products, you can create campaigns to draw in those customers. Digitally, indirect competitors might be targeting the same keywords, and understanding that can help boost SEO and get your business to the top of the search engine results page (SERP).</p> \n<h3>1. Customer Feedback</h3> \n<p>One quick way to identify your competitors is to ask your current clients or potential clients. For example, if you have a potential customer come in with questions about your products or services, ask them some other businesses they are considering for this purchase. Send feedback surveys that ask customers what other brands they were considering and why they went with yours.</p> \n<h3>2. Market Research</h3> \n<p>This requires some digging on your end. If you have a brick-and-mortar, you’ll need to review similar stores, their websites, and their social media to get a better idea of their businesses. Customer surveys can also fall into the market research category.</p> \n<h3>3. Social Media</h3> \n<p>Many people share their purchasing experiences on social media and forum websites like Reddit. Check out the recommendations people are sharing for products or services that you also sell to help identify top competitors in your market.</p> \n<h3>4. Keyword Research</h3> \n<p>For indirect competitors, turn to keyword research. You can use the keywords you are targeting to identify other businesses that are targeting the same keywords, and ultimately, the same top spot on the SERP and the same audience.</p> \n<h3>5. Review the SERP</h3> \n<p>Speaking of the SERP, it can also be a handy tool to identify your competitors. Search your keywords to find what businesses are ranking highly for these keywords to see your indirect competitors.</p> \n<h2>Tracking and Analyzing Competitors</h2> \n<p>Now you know the differences between direct and indirect competitors, and you’ve narrowed down a list of both related to your business. What next?</p> \n<p>It’s time to conduct a competitive analysis, which will help you improve your own business strategies when comparing them to your competitors.</p> \n<p>There are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit?__hstc=45788219.3d878fa03537367db88b497b30e7d615.1625243078200.1625243078200.1625243078200.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1625243078200&amp;__hsfp=939966733&amp;_ga=2.50096613.2103912915.1625243077-1473090798.1625243077\">several items to include in a competitive analysis</a>: direct and indirect competitors, products/services sold, competitors’ sales tactics, pricing and sales, marketing and content strategies, and social media and websites.</p> \n<p>This comprehensive data will give you a better idea of how your competitors are operating on every level, from the products they sell to their customer service, all online and offline.</p> \n<p>Researching competitors, products, services, keywords, and marketing tactics adds up to a lot of data that needs sorted and organized, so <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/competitive-analysis-templates?__hstc=45788219.3d878fa03537367db88b497b30e7d615.1625243078200.1625243078200.1625243078200.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1625243078200&amp;__hsfp=939966733&amp;_ga=2.50096613.2103912915.1625243077-1473090798.1625243077\">HubSpot’s competitive analysis templates</a> can make light work of these tasks.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/competitive-analysis-templates?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/competitive-analysis-template.jpg?width=472&amp;name=competitive-analysis-template.jpg\" alt=\"a template for competitive analysis\" width=\"472\" style=\"width: 472px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a>For example, this Content Marketing Competitive Analysis Template can help you track competitors’ strategies across social, blogs, email, and SEO.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/competitive-analysis-templates?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/multi-feature-scoring-card.jpg?width=481&amp;name=multi-feature-scoring-card.jpg\" alt=\"scoring card for multiple features\" width=\"481\" style=\"width: 481px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a>This multi-feature scorecard will allow you to compare your company to its competitors based on a number of customizable attributes.</p> \n<p>There are many different templates to consider when creating a visual competitive analysis, so find the one that best suits your needs.

As an introvert, I do, quite often. Though unsubscribing from a conversation with another person isn’t always possible (and could potentially be seen as rude), unsubscribing from emails is perfectly acceptable behavior.</p> \n<p>As a consumer, the unsubscribe button can feel like a gift from the divine when your inbox is overflowing. As a marketer, the unsubscribe button can be standing between you and your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide\"><span>email marketing</span></a> goals if your list undergoes a mass exodus faster than you’re able to bring in new leads.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=400cd460-b98f-401b-a565-0dc8cd51719c&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: 28 Free CTA Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/400cd460-b98f-401b-a565-0dc8cd51719c.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>However, the unsubscribe button in your emails doesn't have to be feared. In fact, when leveraged wisely, the unsubscribe button can be a powerful tool that helps you curate an engaged email list of your ideal customers who are ready and willing to hear your message.</p> \n<p>Let’s break down the ins and outs of the email unsubscribe button, and how to set it up in a way that helps your business.</p> \n<h2>What is an unsubscribe button?</h2> \n<p>An unsubscribe button is a link or button module typically found at the bottom of a marketing email that gives email subscribers the chance to opt-out of future messages with one simple click.</p> \n<h3>Why Have An Unsubscribe Button</h3> \n<p>I know, the idea of subscribers leaving your list may prompt a bit of panic, especially if you have aggressive list-building goals. However, having an unsubscribe button or link can be to your benefit. One of the most important <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-email-marketers-should-be-tracking\"><span>email marketing metrics</span></a> you should measure is your open rate or the percentage of people on your list who actually open (and likely read) your emails.</p> \n<p>If you have a large number of subscribers who are on your list but don’t want to be, that can significantly drive down your open rates (and negatively impact your click-through rate). Having a large email list isn’t valuable if your audience doesn’t actually want to engage with your emails, because that could indicate they are even less likely to buy your products.</p> \n<p>Having an unsubscribe button makes it easy for those who are uninterested to opt-out of communication, freeing up space for potential subscribers who are genuinely interested in your message and product.</p> \n<h3>Do you have to have an unsubscribe button in your emails?</h3> \n<p>You may be wondering, \"Do I <em>have</em> to have an unsubscribe button in all of my emails?\"</p> \n<p>The short answer is yes, yes you do.</p> \n<p>In the US, the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\"><span>CAN-SPAM Act</span></a> requires all businesses using email to include clear instructions on how to opt-out on all email communications and these opt-out requests must be honored by law. Businesses that violate the CAN-SPAM Act can face hefty fines for each email violation, so it’s in your best interest to make sure you give your subscribers a chance to opt out in every email communication you send.</p> \n<p>Beyond the CAN-SPAM Act, there are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2021/05/26/four-tips-for-global-email-marketing-compliance/?sh=7fb51df01498\"><span>global email marketing regulations</span></a> that are designed to protect consumers and ensure they’re able to opt out of communications they no longer want to receive. People <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-subscribe-to-email\"><span>unsubscribe from emails</span></a> for a number of reasons, and it’s important for businesses to honor that decision.</p> \n<h2>Unsubscribe Button Best Practices and Ethics</h2> \n<p>Now let’s cover unsubscribe do’s and don’ts.</p> \n<h3>1. Make sure your unsubscribe button uses clear language.</h3> \n<p>Avoid using confusing language or making your unsubscribe button or link difficult to understand. Doing so can be a CAN-SPAM violation. Your unsubscribe option should be clear and easy to understand for the average person.</p> \n<h3>2. Don’t hide your unsubscribe options or make them difficult to see.</h3> \n<p>Your unsubscribe button or link should be visually accessible for readers. Companies that purposefully hide or make the unsubscribe feature difficult to see can also be subject to fines and legal repercussions so avoid using fonts or colors that make your unsubscribe options hard to find or visually inaccessible.</p> \n<h3>3. Offer the option to update email preferences.</h3> \n<p>If your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-marketing-services\"><span>email service provider</span></a> gives you the option, allow subscribers to update their email preferences. Perhaps they don’t want to opt out of all communications but would prefer to receive messages about specific topics or want to hear from your company less often. Doing so can help spare unsubscribes while fostering trust with your readers.</p> \n<h3>4. Avoid using negative language.</h3> \n<p>Though it may not violate any laws, having rude or whiny language in your materials when people unsubscribe can come across as needy and unprofessional, and can be a big turn-off. Honor your contact’s decision to unsubscribe, and focus on those who want to engage with your content and products.</p> \n<h3>5. Don’t require a login to unsubscribe.</h3> \n<p>Ideally, the ability to unsubscribe should be one to two simple clicks away for most users. Requiring contacts to retrieve login information or gating the unsubscribe process creates friction and can lead to frustration.</p> \n<h3>6. Include links to your company’s social media profiles.</h3> \n<p>While having a user on your email list gives you more control over when and how your company is able to communicate with them, having contacts unsubscribe doesn’t mean that’s the end-all-be-all of them interacting with your company. Make sure your emails include links to your company’s social media profiles so users who would rather keep in touch on those platforms can easily follow along.</p> \n<h2>Unsubscribe Button Examples</h2> \n<p>Looking for unsubscribe button inspiration?

While it’s important to try new things in your marketing, is it worth trying new things if the platform is still so new that you don’t know if you’ll find success? For example, the once dismissed TikTok is now a social media channel with immense value for all different kinds of businesses.</p> \n<p>Discord is now an emerging platform posing the same questions as TikTok once did. Many marketers are unsure how it works and whether it makes sense to leverage the tool as an experimental strategy.</p> \n<p>If you’re curious, this post will explain what Discord is, whether it makes sense to join the platform, and how to market your brand or business if you do.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Ad Campaign Planning Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What is Discord?</h2> \n<p>Discord is a voice and chat platform where users join conversation servers, sometimes through exclusive invites, and talk to other members about niche topics. Initially launched in 2015 for gamers, it has since grown to house a diverse group of users, from influencers to content creators to businesses using the platform as an alternative to Slack and Microsoft Teams.</p> \n<p>Considering that it has experienced considerable growth and now caters to various groups, it makes sense that marketers may be curious about joining the platform and seeing if it can help them meet their marketing needs.</p> \n<h2>Can you advertise on Discord?</h2> \n<p>Yes, and no.</p> \n<p>There are no native advertising tools that you can find on other social media platforms like Facebook or TikTok, but you can still advertise your business organically through community engagement; “Brands can authentically engage with consumers on Discord by leveraging what is already appealing about Discord to consumers — forming relationships around common interests and having discussions in real-time,” <a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/how-discord-aids-brands-quest-to-engage-fans-around-emergent-culture/605168/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter%20Weekly%20Roundup:%20Social%20Media%20Today%2008-21-2021&amp;utm_term=Social%20Media%20Today%20Weekender\">said</a>&nbsp;Jesse Nicely, VP and group strategy director at Cashmere Agency, to Marketing Dive.</p> \n<h3>Which brands should use Discord?</h3> \n<p>Most businesses can benefit from using Discord, but the benefits are significant for those looking to create an always-on, engaged community of like-minded people that are interested in what your business has to offer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kenny Layton, Discord’s Head of Talent Partnerships, <a href=\"https://edm.com/features/how-discord-gave-artists-a-platform-to-connect-with-purpose\">said</a>&nbsp;to EDM.com, “We like to call ourselves the 24-hour diner of the internet, where communities can just come and hang out with each other at any time they want.” While it is possible to create a community on other social channels, most people follow a wide variety of accounts, creators, brands, etc., but your Discord community is focused solely on your business.</p> \n<p>Brands that are interested in learning more about their audience should also consider using Discord; “A lot of the time with artists they’re always having to guess what the fans want or are thinking...there’s no better way to know what your fans want than to have them tell you. That can inform...marketing and advertising spend. That data is valuable,” <a href=\"https://edm.com/features/how-discord-gave-artists-a-platform-to-connect-with-purpose\">says</a>&nbsp;Brian Barnett to EDM.com.</p> \n<p>However, as mentioned above, it is an emerging platform. There are no specific tools for advertising your channel, but, again, it can help you create relationships with your audience, which is a driving factor of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty?_ga=2.160256125.111883232.1630324730-1819533034.1630324730\">customer loyalty</a>.</p> \n<p>If you’re interested in leveraging the platform, let’s discuss the different ways you can promote your brand on Discord.</p> \n<h2>How to Promote Your Brand on Discord</h2> \n<h3>Build your own community.</h3> \n<p>The best way to promote your brand on Discord is to build a business-specific community server, along with different related channels for conversation. You can then invite users to join, have them find you organically through browsing the platform, or promote it on your other social channels and in marketing materials.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd/featured\">Marques Brownlee</a>, a technology YouTuber, has a Discord community channel called the MKBHD. His community centers around discussions of his content, like podcasts and new videos, but he also created additional channels to promote different topics of conversation, as shown in the image below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brownleee%20discord%20sidebar.jpg?width=390&amp;name=brownleee%20discord%20sidebar.jpg\" alt=\"marques brownleee discord sidebar channels example\" width=\"390\" style=\"width: 390px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Music streaming service <a href=\"http://spotify.com\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;also has a Discord community that features the channel #listeningparty (shown in the image below). Active users can share links to playlists they’re currently listening to, and voice chat about the music. &nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/spotify%20listening%20party.jpg?width=566&amp;name=spotify%20listening%20party.jpg\" alt=\"spotify listening party discord server for listening party\" width=\"566\" style=\"width: 566px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Within your community, you can further promote your brand by sharing links to your external social profiles, as beauty brand Starface has done for their Twitter account in the image below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/starface%20promoting%20twitter%20account.jpg?width=610&amp;name=starface%20promoting%20twitter%20account.jpg\" alt=\"starface promoting twitter account on discord\" width=\"610\" style=\"width: 610px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>In addition to advertising your business, you can also use Discord as a tool for customer service by creating specific channels to house answers to frequently asked questions, or where users can ask questions and get answers from you or other active community members.</p> \n<p>When you create a community, you can also set rules to ensure that everyone is respected and welcomed and designate moderators to patrol the channel to ensure rules get followed.</p> \n<h3>Join communities and servers relevant to your business offerings.</h3> \n<p>Another way to promote your business on Discord is to join other channels or servers relevant to your business and engage in conversations. Most channels are moderated, but you’ll likely be allowed to share links to your content, like high-quality blog posts that help you to draw in new users.</p> \n<h2>Can and Should You Advertise Your Brand on Discord?</h2> \n<p>Nicely <a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/how-discord-aids-brands-quest-to-engage-fans-around-emergent-culture/605168/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter%20Weekly%20Roundup:%20Social%20Media%20Today%2008-21-2021&amp;utm_term=Social%20Media%20Today%20Weekender\">said</a>, \"Discord's fast-paced nature makes it fertile ground for emergent culture and trends, and allows brands the opportunity to constantly engage with consumers on interesting topics.\"</p> \n<p>While the platform doesn’t have the built-in advertising features on other channels, it can be extremely useful for marketers looking to build a community of like-minded users who enjoy your business and want to engage in conversation. However, as noted before, Discord is still an emerging platform for marketing, so it can be challenging to get your foot in the door or see immediate success.</p> \n<p>If you take the time to create a unique Discord community with different channels for conversation, engage with users in your community, and you provide them with high-quality content that they enjoy, you’ll likely find yourself with an active channel that teaches you more about your audience.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

The beta feature enabled users to<a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\">see and create 15-second videos with musical overlays</a>.</p> \n<p>Even in its<a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\">most basic beta form,</a> the Shorts feature saw solid performance in India.</p> \n<p>In late February of 2021, Google and Alphabet CEO<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"> </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Sundar Pichai</a> announced that videos on the India-based Shorts player<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-google-revenue-results-covid-19-2021-2\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-google-revenue-results-covid-19-2021-2\">receive 3.5 billion cumulative daily views</a>.</p> \n<p>The Shorts beta was fully released in the U.S. in March of 2021, <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-shorts-united-states/\">surpassing 6.5 billion daily views</a>.</p> \n<p>A few months later in July, Shorts launched globally in over 100 countries.</p> \n<p>With YouTube Shorts still in beta mode, marketers are wondering how they'll take advantage of this video feature, what the final platform will look like, if it will have similar virality to TikTok, and how it could help brands better engage with YouTube's more than<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/press/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/press/\">2 billion active users</a>.</p> \n<p>The truth is, as<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/short-form-video-trends\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/short-form-video-trends\">short-form video platforms</a> grow more and more popular, it's hard to know which will rise above the others. And, because the YouTube Shorts is still evolving, we can't fully predict what using it will be like in the near future.</p> \n<p>Here's one thing we do know: YouTube houses millions of hours of branded content. As such, YouTube Shorts could be worth your time – especially if you already have a video strategy on the platform.</p> \n<p>Below, I'll walk through the basics of YouTube Shorts, and what opportunities it could provide for marketers upon its official launch.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When explaining why YouTube decided to launch Shorts, a<a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\">blog post from the tech giant</a> read, \"Every month, 2 billion viewers come to YouTube to laugh, learn and connect. Creators have built entire businesses on YouTube, and we want to enable the next generation of mobile creators to also grow a community on YouTube with Shorts.\"</p> \n<p>\"User-generated short videos were born on YouTube starting with our first upload, a short 18-second video called 'Me at the zoo.' As technology advances, creators and artists can now take advantage of the incredible power of smartphones to easily create and publish high-quality content wherever they are in the world,\" the<a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\">YouTube post</a> added.</p> \n<p>The post continues to say that consumers today enjoy bite-sized content that they can enjoy at any time of the day. A platform like YouTube Shorts allows viewers to step away from long-form video content and alternate as they please.</p> \n<h2>What YouTube Shorts Looks Like</h2> \n<p>YouTube Shorts is currently in beta in over 100 countries.</p> \n<p>While we don't know what Shorts will look like for certain when it moves out of beta, I took a few screenshots of the beta I recently discovered on my YouTube app to help marketers envision the potential user experience.</p> \n<h3>Creating YouTube Shorts</h3> \n<p>When you have the YouTube app, creating a Short is one tap away.</p> \n<p>When you land on the home screen, you'll see the \"+\" icon on the lower center navigation. Once you click it, you'll see \"Create a Short\" from the menu.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"how to create a youtube short on the youtube app\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-3.jpeg?width=220&amp;name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-3.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 220px;\" title=\"\" width=\"220\"></p> \n<p>When you tap Create, the Shorts creation interface will be similar to that of Instagram Stories in that it opens to a camera screen that allows you to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Record segments of a 60-second clip or a full minute-long video.</li> \n <li>Upload pre-created content from a camera roll.</li> \n <li>Film a \"short\" with back or front-facing cameras.</li> \n <li>Adjust video speed.</li> \n <li>Set a recording timer.</li> \n <li>Pick sounds for musical overlays.</li> \n <li>Add filters and text.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Here's a quick screenshot of some of the platform's features.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"youtube shorts record screen\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D.png?width=300&amp;name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\" title=\"\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Watching YouTube Shorts</h3> \n<p>Before the Shorts beta test, YouTube had already been testing<a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/\">a section of its site where shorter videos were placed</a>, shown below.</p> \n<p>Today, YouTube added a dedicated shelf for the Shorts feature to its app homepage where you can start to view Shorts created by beta testers as well as short videos YouTube already had on the platform.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"youtube shorts on the homescreen of youtube app\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-2.jpeg?width=217&amp;name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 217px;\" title=\"\" width=\"217\"></p> \n<p>When watching a Short, you can tap icons on the right bottom of the screen to \"Like,\" \"Dislike,\" or comment on the video.

However, we think YouTube Shorts will be worth watching. Here are a few reasons why.</p> \n<h3>1. Short-form creators could see a bigger reach.</h3> \n<p>While Gen Z users flooded TikTok, causing its astounding early growth, YouTube, the<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing?_ga=2.52600488.1277978393.1614954662-689422450.1614954662\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing?_ga=2.52600488.1277978393.1614954662-689422450.1614954662\">second largest website globally</a>, launched Shorts to more than 2 billion monthly active users.</p> \n<p>Rather than wondering, \"<em>Will YouTube Shorts get awareness?</em>\", ask yourself instead, \"<em>How do I tap into YouTube's huge audience with Shorts?</em>\"</p> \n<p>According to<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelson-chacon-92aa74b9\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelson-chacon-92aa74b9\">Nelson Chacon</a>, HubSpot's principal YouTube content strategist, you'll want to know which segment of YouTube's huge audience you want to market to before producing Shorts – or any other YouTube video for that matter.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if you have a solid subscriber list, continue to create content that's still relevant to them – even if it's shorter-form.</p> \n<p>\"Your subscribers know your channel for its content and Youtube, as a platform, works best with consistency,\" Chacon says.</p> \n<p>For example, say you regularly create long-form content related to your product or industry and find that it engages your audiences. Chacon notes that you can use Shorts to create quick tutorials or step-by-step videos around those content topics.</p> \n<h3>2. Brands in most industries could leverage Shorts.</h3> \n<p>Because TikTok has a somewhat niche user-base filled with younger consumers, some types of brands, such as B2B companies, might have a harder time growing awareness there.</p> \n<p>While YouTube shares similar popularity with young adults, the content on its platform is so vast that it brings in people from all sorts of age groups, countries, industries, and niches.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, there's a video for everyone on YouTube. With Shorts, more brands will be able to engage with audiences from a much wider range of audience targets.</p> \n<p>For example, while a B2B brand might have difficulty connecting with Gen Z consumers on TikTok, they might be able to connect with professionals looking for industry-related content on Shorts.</p> \n<p>Similarly, if you target older generations, such as Gen X, your short-form content might get more engagement on YouTube than TikTok.</p> \n<h3>3. YouTube Shorts could be less vulnerable than other viral platforms.</h3> \n<p>This summer and throughout the fall of 2020,<a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/social-media/what-happened-with-the-tiktok-ban-and-what-is-the-future-of-the-platform-02369782\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/social-media/what-happened-with-the-tiktok-ban-and-what-is-the-future-of-the-platform-02369782\">TikTok was threatened with bans and censorship regulations</a>.</p> \n<p>Why is this concerning? If you're a marketer who spends time mastering content strategies on a social media app, a ban or regulation of that app could mean that the content you've worked so hard on might never be seen.</p> \n<p>However, because<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/youtube5year/home/short-story-of-youtube\"> </a><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/youtube5year/home/short-story-of-youtube\">YouTube is one of the oldest and most successful online platforms</a>, and it's owned by the<a href=\"https://abc.xyz/\"> </a><a href=\"https://abc.xyz/\">publicly traded Alphabet</a>, it might be seen as more trustworthy to governments than viral apps that provide less public data security information – like TikTok.</p> \n<h3>4. Shorts could provide long-term benefits.</h3> \n<p>While Instagram Stories and Reels content expire by default after 24 hours,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOqeguIECrQ\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOqeguIECrQ\">some YouTube Shorts beta testers</a> say Shorts don't disappear from YouTube – which could help grow long-term YouTube awareness.</p> \n<p>For example, if a person who prefers short-form content stumbles upon your YouTube page, they can see all of your short videos, rather than only being able to access your longer content.</p> \n<p>Or, if someone's in a rush and searching for a quick how-to video related to something you've filmed, they might find and watch your short videos on that topic – even if you published them months ago.</p> \n<h2>How 5 Brands Use YouTube Shorts</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.danessamyricksbeauty.com/\">Danessa Myricks Beauty</a></h3> \n<p>Have exciting news you want to share with your audience? Take a page out of this brand's playbook.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 749px; max-height: 465px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 62.08%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kP6RBme2aPw\" width=\"749\" height=\"465\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>In this countdown-style video, Danessa Myricks Beauty used a short to promote its launch in Sephora and build some anticipation.</p> \n<p>In the first half of the video, multiple people can be heard saying \"One more day.\" Then, we see the CEO sending off a package to be sent to Sephora stores.</p> \n<p>Here's why this works: There's no time wasted in this Short. It's engaging from the very start and every frame serves a purpose. Secondly, there's a clear message – the audience leaves knowing the 5Ws (who, what, when, where, why).</p> \n<p>Lastly, this Short creates excitement for the brand's growth and invites the audience to join in the countdown.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.lyfemarketing.com/\">LYFE Marketing</a></h3> \n<p>Who said informative content had to be long? LYFE Marketing shows that you can create fun, engaging, and informative content in under 30 seconds.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 749px; max-height: 465px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 62.08%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rh4gGoEMtw8\" width=\"749\" height=\"465\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>In this Short, the brand breaks down color psychology. The talent in front of the camera simply points to the text which appears on different parts of the screen during the video.</p> \n<p>If you don't have a big media budget, this is an effective, low-effort method of creating content your audience will be interested in.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.webfx.com/\">WebFX</a></h3> \n<p>Shorts are a great way to repurpose content. You can take content from a blog post, live stream, or downloadable report to create a short-and-sweet video.</p> \n<p>Digital marketing agency, WebFX, created a short to explain the costs behind social media marketing.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 749px; max-height: 465px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 62.08%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nv5UmMgJ-D0\" width=\"749\" height=\"465\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>With the use of graphics, WebFX delivers great information in a succinct way. It's likely the brand has an article or other form of content that dives deeper into this topic.</p> \n<p>But for social media, snippets are the way to go. When done right, they pique your audience's interest and lead them to your website.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-voice\">The Voice</a></h3> \n<p>To promote its new season, NBC's The Voice created a Short featuring this year's hosts.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 923px; max-height: 681px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 73.78%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFuv31eCC4Y\" width=\"923\" height=\"681\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>What works well here:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>It serves as an ad for the brand.</li> \n <li>It utilizes text to emphasize certain phrases and keep the audience engaged.</li> \n <li>It includes a banner at the end with clear directions for viewers on when and where to watch the show.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/SatoriGraphics/featured\">Satori Graphics</a></h3> \n<p>Here's another great example of how graphics and illustrations can take your Shorts to another level.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 923px; max-height: 681px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 73.78%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJuMRLneUcU\" width=\"923\" height=\"681\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Satori Graphics is a popular YouTube channel to learn graphic design. The channel features hundreds of long-form videos on the topic and this Short serves as an extension of what's already on the channel.</p> \n<p>This tactic can work well for attracting new viewers to the channel, as a one-minute video is less intimidating than a 20-minute video. It's similar to how you present a content offer at the end of a blog article.</p> \n<p>A reader may be more likely to read a blog post first than read a 20-page report, as it's an easier point of entry. The same concept can apply to Shorts.</p> \n<h2>How to Prepare for YouTube Shorts</h2> \n<p>While we aren't sure how Shorts will evolve, it's not too early to consider how you could implement it into your social media or video marketing strategy. Here are a few quick tips to keep in mind.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Optimize short YouTube videos</strong>: Chacon says global creators should begin to add, \"#shorts\" to descriptions of videos that are 60 seconds or less.</li> \n <li><strong>Identify short-form topics: </strong>Are there any topics your team creates content around that could be distilled into a few quick tips, steps, or data points? If so, you might be able to repurpose this information by creating a Short.</li> \n <li><strong>Audit your short-form videos</strong>: Have you created Instagram Reels, TikToks, or other social media videos that would only need a few light tweaks to engage your YouTube audience? If so, you could test them on Shorts when the platform launches.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn more about YouTube Marketing,<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing?_ga=2.41660706.1277978393.1614954662-689422450.1614954662\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing?_ga=2.41660706.1277978393.1614954662-689422450.1614954662\">check out our Ultimate Guide</a> – or download the free resource below.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in March of 2021 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b3dff341-3856-4d52-b45f-abe0d3413edb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Apply for a job, keep track of important information, and prepare for an  interview with the help of this free job seekers kit.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b3dff341-3856-4d52-b45f-abe0d3413edb.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-shorts&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Sep 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8c86a8cf-3857-41c3-b88d-f4d3b084b0cc.png","linkMd5":"094a90e0c88ead2c93111076032a13bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn44@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-850_5231379d0454dd9f.webp","destWidth":750,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7833,"destBytes":11950,"author":"pbump@hubspot.com (Pamela Bump)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8c86a8cf-3857-41c3-b88d-f4d3b084b0cc.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn44@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-42-850_5231379d0454dd9f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-3.jpeg?width=220&name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-3.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn25@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-44-514_1f7d41bf8fea72d9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D.png?width=300&name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn8@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-47-059_36bfaccc37672238.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-2.jpeg?width=217&name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-45-319_8a5aad21a50d61f2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-1.jpeg?width=217&name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D-1.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-46-117_3cb4eb8b1a8f1967.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D.jpeg?width=500&name=4%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Should%20Use%20YouTube%20Shorts%20%5B+%205%20Brand%20Examples%5D.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn54@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-45-239_bcc192bd8c42d87e.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b3dff341-3856-4d52-b45f-abe0d3413edb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn74@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-49-345_635482768605a1ec.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-shorts&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn10@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-48-689_f98c4b1313c8d979.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761741250},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:41","title":"The Plain English Guide to Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend","description":"<p>As a writer, I've never been very good at math. I know … shocking.</p> \n<p>Most marketers can relate because as a bunch, we tend to be better at English and history than math and science.</p> \n<p>However, as a marketer, we need to be able to analyze data and calculate the effectiveness of an article or campaign, even though math might not be our strong suit.</p>  \n<p>One of the calculations we need to run and metrics we need to track is return on ad spend (ROAS).</p> \n<p>Below, let's review ROAS. In this post, we'll discuss what ROAS is, how it's different from ROI, and how to calculate it.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3e2abb94-93d9-4cf5-bd8e-6a96ecc14270&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Click here to download 8 free marketing budget templates.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3e2abb94-93d9-4cf5-bd8e-6a96ecc14270.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Ultimately, ad spend is meant to measure the effectiveness of a specific ad campaign, not your overall ROI -- more on that below.</p> \n<p>Besides ROAS, you'll most likely measure other metrics such as click-through rate and ROI. By measuring multiple metrics, you'll get a more accurate view of your results.</p> \n<p>Of course, measuring performance and tracking analytics is an important part of any marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>By tracking performance, you can improve and iterate on your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-techniques\">marketing techniques</a>. Plus, data is one of the only ways to truly prove that your department brings in revenue, which is incredibly important.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to note that not everything can be measured with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/data-improving-ab-tests\">quantitative data</a>. For instance, calculating brand awareness and sentiment is much more difficult. And while you can calculate downloads or email sign-ups, those might not always lead to revenue.</p> \n<p>When you're analyzing any data, it's important to consider context and review qualitative data as well as quantitative data.</p> \n<p>That being said, today we're going to dive into ROAS specifically. Before we do that, let's review how ROAS is different from ROI.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%202.22.31%20PM.png?width=974&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%202.22.31%20PM.png\" alt=\"ROAS vs. ROI\" width=\"974\" style=\"width: 974px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, this means that the only cost considered in a ROAS calculation is the cost of advertising. On the other hand, the cost of an entire project or campaign will be considered in an ROI calculation.</p> \n<p>The goal of your ads campaign, of course, will be to generate a positive return on your ad spend. However, how can you determine what that ad spend should be?</p> \n<p>In the YouTube video below, HubSpot details how to determine ad spend by understanding the bidding system used by ad networks.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtwEBXoMa80\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>You'd use ROAS to help you determine how you spend your advertising budget and as a signal to determine if your campaigns are successful. This would let you know that you might need to evaluate your approach to running ads.</p> \n<p>So, at this point, you might be wondering, <em>\"How can I calculate ROAS?\" </em>Let's review that now.</p> \n<p>While the equation is simple, you might face difficulty gathering the data needed to run this calculation. For instance, calculating the cost of an ad isn't always easy. You'll need to consider the cost of the ad bid, the labor cost for the time it took to create the creative assets, vendor costs, and affiliate commissions.</p> \n<p>But it's important to get an accurate estimate of the actual money spent on an ad to get an accurate ROAS measurement. If your data isn't accurate, your findings won't be either.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%201.47.38%20PM.png?width=760&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%201.47.38%20PM.png\" alt=\"ROAS formula\" width=\"760\" style=\"width: 760px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Additionally, if you don't run an ecommerce business, it can also be difficult to measure the revenue generated by an ad. For example, someone might convert from your ad because they downloaded an ebook, however, they haven't spent any money yet. In fact, they might not spend money for months.</p> \n<p>To combat this, you can use a CRM software like HubSpot in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads\">HubSpot Ads</a>, to track revenue made from leads.</p> \n<p>With a CRM and ads software, you can keep track of your data and tie it all together -- marketing leads, ad results, etc.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%202.00.01%20PM.png?width=756&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%202.00.01%20PM.png\" alt=\"break even roas\" width=\"756\" style=\"width: 756px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering, <em>\"What's a good ROAS?\"</em> and <em>\"How can I improve my ROAS?\"</em></p> \n<p>Well, a good ROAS is typically around 3:1. If you're barely breaking even, it might be time to dig further into the accuracy of your metrics and evaluate your ads and bidding strategy.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to note that the objective of some <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc\">ad campaigns</a> might not be to make immediate revenue but to increase brand awareness.

Hire with diversity, equity, and inclusion in mind.</h3> \n<p>There are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-diversity-workplace\">countless benefits</a>&nbsp;to diversity in the workplace – for instance, did you know organizations with a diverse leadership team have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/workplace-diversity-stats\">19% higher revenue on average</a> than companies with less diverse leaders?</p> \n<p>Or, how about the fact that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse\">diverse teams can solve problems</a>&nbsp;faster than cognitively similar people?</p> \n<p>Suffice to say, diversity matters.</p> \n<p>When building an effective marketing team, it's critical to consider <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/workplace-diversity-stats\">diversity, equity, and inclusion</a>&nbsp;from the very beginning.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://startup.google.com/grow/\">Google's</a> Global Head of SMB Partnerships Marketing, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elana-chan-3b6225/\">Elana Chan</a>, told me, \"Hiring is the most important thing you'll do as a leader — and that also means you need to think about DEI. It's easy when we're running fast to just ask people in our own networks to apply for open positions, but it's worth it to diversify. Every study and even my own experience has proven that diversification and different points of view are important.\"</p> Chan adds, \"It takes longer to hire people who are outside of your natural network, but it's worth it. You'll get the right people for the job and also set the right tone across your organization. It's important to walk the talk when it comes to DEI, not just when it's convenient.\" \n<p>When you're first building out your team, you'll want to ensure you incorporate DEI into your recruitment plans. To do this, consider writing inclusive job descriptions, advertise roles through diverse channels, and standardize your interview process.</p> \n<p>You might also try using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/recruitment-interview-bias\">recruitment technology like Greenhouse Inclusion</a>&nbsp;to reduce the risks of unconscious bias when interviewing.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/elana%20chans%20quote%20on%20building%20strong%20marketing%20teams.png?width=1104&amp;name=elana%20chans%20quote%20on%20building%20strong%20marketing%20teams.png\" alt=\"elana chans quote on building strong marketing teams\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Hire people who are hungry enough to try anything.</h3> \n<p>If you're just starting out, you don't have unlimited budget to hire a slew of marketers who specialize in various marketing activities. Instead, you likely only have the budget for a handful of marketers — or perhaps even just one.</p> \n<p>So … how do you make that one hire count?</p> \n<p>Above all else, <a href=\"https://wistia.com/\">Wistia</a> co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjsavage/\">Chris Savage</a> believes it's important to consider how driven your first marketing hire is.</p> \n<p>He told me, \"You want to find someone who is extremely hungry, and can make their own things — whether that is video, written content, or audio. Whichever assets your team needs, if you can find someone who can be both the creator and manager of those assets, then you unlock the ability to try things much more easily.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\"At Wistia,\" he adds, \"I hired a lot of misfits who were so hungry that they were willing to try anything. Maybe on paper it didn't make sense, but in reality, it was incredible.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For instance, perhaps your marketing team has identified YouTube as a viable opportunity to reach new audiences and convert those users into leads. If that's the case, consider hiring someone with experience creating video — along with a strong desire to learn quickly, and try new things.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. Hire a marketing customer experience (CX) leader.</h3> \n<p>When asked what the most crucial early hire on a marketing team is, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-cosley-a104122/\">John Cosley</a>, Senior Director of Global Brand Marketing at <a href=\"https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us\">Microsoft Advertising</a>, told me: \"Two years ago, I would have said a marketing data scientist — someone who can analyze datasets and help their organizations better understand their customers and identify future opportunities, as well as advise on marketing tactics and analysis methodologies.\"</p> \n<p>\"Fast forward to today,\" He adds, \"And I would say that the marketing customer experience (CX) leader is the most crucial early hire in scaling a marketing team. Consumer journeys have increasingly become digital and multi-modal and expectations have increased around privacy and trust, personalization, and quality.\"</p> \n<p>If you're interested in creating a customer experience strategy for your business, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-experience-strategy\">How to Define a Customer Experience (CX) Strategy</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Ultimately, a customer experience is about putting the customer first. As Cosley told me, \"Consumers are more likely to value a brand that values <em>them</em>, so it has become critical for brands today to prioritize the customer experience all the way through the purchasing funnel.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Hire early.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Hiring as you're scaling can be a bit like trying to build a plane while you're flying it.</p> \n<p>It can be difficult and messy to get new hires up-to-speed at the same time you need them to perform optimally so your consumers don't feel the friction. To minimize these challenges, consider hiring months ahead of when you'll need certain roles filled.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoisbondiguel/\">Francois Bondiguel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva's</a> Global Head of B2B Marketing &amp; Growth, told me, \"A big challenge that many face as they scale is getting the organizational structure and strategy right. This includes hiring the right people, and ensuring they have leaders in place to guide them through this transformative phase and help them remove roadblocks so they can move fast.\"</p> \n<p>\"On that note,\" Bondiguel adds, \"it's important for key hires to be brought in early to ensure they are properly onboarded prior to projects ramping up. This helps avoid placing unrealistic pressure on new team members as well as the broader group.\"</p> \n<p>To do this effectively, take a look at your team's long-term vision, and brainstorm which role(s) will need to be filled to get your team to the next level.</p> \n<h3>5. Use one data set to guide your entire department.</h3> \n<p>When you're first starting out, I'm willing to bet your lean startup team understands the importance of making data-based decisions … but they likely also work in silos.</p> \n<p>Maybe you have two content strategists who focus on lead generation numbers. Then, perhaps you have another social media marketer who focuses on cost-per-acquisition.</p> \n<p>The issue? \"When you're operating in silos, there are also <em>data</em>&nbsp;silos,\" Chan tells me. \"Which means you can never pull the same number across teams. That's a mistake. If you start off providing your team with a unified data set, then it's easier to grow together. It's much harder to merge data sets later, and then it becomes politics to determine the right numbers to use.\"</p> \n<p>To fix this, ensure you have a unified system for collecting and analyzing data even when your team is small. Consider using a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">CRM</a>&nbsp;to store your data in one place, or creating a department dashboard in <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\">Google Analytics</a>.</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, it's vital you provide your team with a centralized location so your data processes can grow with you as you scale.</p> \n<h3>6. Focus on customer retention in the beginning, rather than just customer acquisition.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>When you start to see your list of customers growing, it can be tempting to want <em>more, more, more</em>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But as a startup, you need to be careful. If you focus exclusively on acquiring new customers, you forget one of your strongest weapons — your existing customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">Typeform's</a> VP of Growth, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkim/\">Jim Kim</a>, told me, \"Many SaaS-based startups ... focus exclusively on customer acquisition and tend to neglect customer retention until they see issues with the customer base size growing.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Kim adds, \"By focusing early on efforts to engage and retain the base of customers already acquired, the startup develops a more holistic understanding of the customers they serve, and can gain insights into the things customers really care about that can then be added to the acquisition activities.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To prevent <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/prevent-customer-churn\">customer churn</a>, you'll want to build out an incredible customer support strategy that enables your existing customers to get their needs met. Additionally, consider how you might provide value beyond the purchase, or create a personalized customer experience so your customers know you care about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Kim points out, \"It's an obvious point, but in my experience, it's hard to remember that retention can actually be a faster way to grow the customer base than new acquisition and usually has a higher marketing ROI, since it's (generally) cheaper to keep a customer than find a new one.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jim%20kim%20quote.png?width=1104&amp;name=jim%20kim%20quote.png\" alt=\"jim kim quote\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Tips for Scaling Your Marketing Team</h2> \n<h3>1. Don't stifle the energy of a startup.</h3> \n<p>As you begin to scale, the workplace inevitably changes. Before, conversations happened casually across office desks, or when grabbing a cup of coffee — now, there are formal meetings with agendas.</p> \n<p>And, while you could previously test out a new idea without necessarily requiring buy-in from leadership, now you're expected to follow stricter processes, which limits the experiments you can try.</p> \n<p>And yet, one thing <em>shouldn't</em>&nbsp;change as you scale.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">As Chan puts it, \"It's important not to stifle the energy of a startup. That's the exciting part of being where you are, and I think the acknowledgement that you're building the car as you're driving it is okay — and fun.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Chan adds, \"At Google we have a saying: 'Operating at the edge of chaos'. If you imagine a frontier, one side is not enough chaos, and the other side is too much chaos. If there's too much chaos, no one knows what's happening, and nothing gets done. But if there's not enough chaos, then there's no innovation and you're not moving forward.\"</p> \n<p>\"It's your job as a leader to operate as closely to this frontier as possible, and I think in a startup that's even more true.\"</p> \n<p>When you begin to scale, you're going to need to implement more formal processes. But these processes shouldn't restrict your employees from taking risks, testing out new ideas, and pushing the boundaries of your marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Consider, as you scale, how you can protect that \"startup energy\" at all costs.</p> \n<h3>2. Stick with what's working.</h3> \n<p>As you begin to scale, you're probably looking for new growth opportunities. And, at this point, it might feel like the sky is the limit — your business is rapidly growing, so why <em>not</em>&nbsp;take some risks?</p> \n<p>But, while certain risks are inevitable, it's not a good idea to expand too far beyond what's already working.</p> \n<p>As Savage told me, \"If you're a startup that's making progress in terms of bringing in customers and getting them to use your product or service, then it's easy to think, 'Okay, I have one channel that's working … now let's add a channel on top of that, and another channel on top, and <em>that's </em>how I'll scale.' Like, PR is working, why not add paid advertising on top?\"</p> \n<p>The mistake, Savage says, is that there are often one or two channels you end up underestimating in terms of growth potential. If your content is performing exceedingly well and driving leads for the business, it's not necessarily a good idea to pivot away from content. Instead, you want to ask yourself — How much more can we expand with our content?</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Chris%20Savage%20quote%20on%20scaling%20businesses.png?width=1104&amp;name=Chris%20Savage%20quote%20on%20scaling%20businesses.png\" alt=\"Chris Savage quote on scaling businesses\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<p>\"There's good advice in personal finance,\" Savage says, \"which states that most wealth is built through a concentration of risk, and it's maintained through a distribution of risk — so, basically, if you want to become wealthy, you need to take just a few big risks.\"</p> \"It's the same thing when scaling customer acquisition … There are a few big things you can do. It's very important to go big on the things that are already working.\" \n<p>Rather than investing in social media, digital marketing, video, PR, and blogging all at once, consider which channels drive the most leads for your business. Those are the channels that got you this far, and those are likely the same channels that will get you even further if you focus your efforts.</p> \n<h3>3. Treat your culture as a business priority.</h3> \n<p>It's easy enough to foster and maintain a strong culture when you're a small team. But, as you scale and expand your team, it can get harder to protect the culture that attracted employees to your office in the first place.</p> \n<p>And while culture might just sound like a buzzword used to replace <em>beer garden </em>and <em>yearly ski trips, </em>it's not.</p> \n<p>In reality, culture is vital to your business' success — in fact, companies with strong cultures are <a href=\"https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/accounting-audit/news/21074466/better-culture-drives-revenue-growth-for-businesses\">1.5X more likely to report average revenue growth</a>&nbsp;of more than 15% over three years.</p> \n<p>As Cosley told me: \"In any growing organization, the key to success is embracing and honoring the culture to which you aspire. It's likely what made your company a great place to work and attracted the high-quality talent that is driving your growth.\"</p> \n<p>Cosley adds, \"It's not hard for core values and cultural priorities to erode or even get lost during expansion if that work is not made a priority. <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">As you scale, you'll want to think and act intentionally about how your culture grows with you, how you define and memorialize it, how it impacts your hiring and onboarding, how you train your leadership, and how you evaluate performance.\" </span></p> \n<p>Keep in mind — whether or not you've actively fostered it, your company already has a culture … it just might not be a strong one. And strong cultures can both attract and retain employees for the long-run, so it's an important business initiative to take the time to create one that aligns with your values and purpose.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/John%20Cosley%20quote%20on%20scaling%20businesses.png?width=1104&amp;name=John%20Cosley%20quote%20on%20scaling%20businesses.png\" alt=\"John Cosley quote on scaling businesses\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<p>Additionally, Cosley notes, \"Culture is not one-dimensional. You need to consider it across areas such as retention and hiring, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement. And culture is contagious. Not only does it deliver more positive outcomes and business results, it helps with critical talent retention, and can lower the cost and time to acquire new talent.\"</p> \n<p>\"Treating your culture as a business priority is essential. Without doing so, it could be detrimental to your organization's potential.\"</p> \n<p>To ensure your culture grows with your organization as you scale, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-culture\">HubSpot's Ultimate Guide to Company Culture</a>.</p> \n<h3>4. Institutionalize key values on your team.</h3> \n<p>To build a strong team culture, Chan recommends institutionalizing key values.</p> \n<p>For instance, perhaps you value autonomy, empathy, adaptability, or intellectual growth. As a leader, it's vital you use these values as foundational building blocks on which your team can grow.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Chan told me, \"For me, learning and intellectual curiosity are really important, so I say to my team, 'You're responsible for making the person next to you smarter'. And that creates the onus on bringing your own best game because everyone around you is so incredibly talented — so how are you being additive, collaborative, and innovative from within that culture? You owe it to each other to be your best.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Praise what's right … and punish what's wrong.</h3> \n<p>Once you've identified the values that matter to your organization, it's vital you <em>encourage</em>&nbsp;those values in each of your employees.</p> \n<p>When providing performance reviews, for instance, take the time to identify where employees have demonstrated key team values, and where they might still be lacking.</p> \n<p>As Savage told me, \"The way you scale it is, you praise the right stuff and punish the wrong stuff. It's that simple — most culture is modeled. You need the most senior people to act the way you believe you should be acting, and if you do that, it permeates the building.\"</p> \n<p>As an example, let's say you value risk-taking on your team. If that's the case, you'll want to praise your team when they take risks, and even praise the failure that might result from those risks.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if you're in a mode where you're risk-averse and looking for optimization of processes, you'd want to praise actions that demonstrate risk management.</p> \n<h3>6. Hire for the future — not just today.</h3> \n<p>Finally, when you're scaling, you want to consider who you can hire today that will continue to meet the needs of your business even as those needs change over time.</p> \n<p>For instance, when I was first hired at a startup, I was hired to create blog content. Fast-forward six months, and I was additionally tasked with creating a podcast, and increasing the subscriptions to an email newsletter. As the business scaled, my role changed quickly. So it's vital you hire with the future in-mind.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When asked about the biggest challenge leaders face when scaling, Kim told me, \"[It's] the challenge to balance long-term and short-term hiring. For a larger, more established business, scaling a team is not as challenging. The roles are already clearly defined, and there is likely already someone doing that job. It's easy to hire for a role like this.</p> \n<p>\"But,\" Kim adds, \"when the team is trying to scale, the roles may be less clear and transitory. What you think you need today could be wildly different tomorrow. Balancing the needs of today, while keeping an eye out on how things might change in the future is something that's extremely hard to do.\"</p> \n<p>Hiring and recruiting isn't an easy task, but to ensure you're hiring for the future, you'll want to take the time to determine someone's work ethic, flexibility, and ability to shift roles as the needs change. And, as mentioned above, you'll want to find someone who's hungry to be there.</p> \n<h3>7. Create processes for effective communication.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>As your team scales, it becomes even more important to ensure you have processes in-place to ensure fair, effective cross-team communication.&nbsp;</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/francois%20quote.png?width=1200&amp;name=francois%20quote.png\" alt=\"francois quote on scaling high-performing marketing teams\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"> \n<p>For instance, perhaps you've noticed your meetings have become opportunities for your most extroverted employees to share their successes, while the majority of your team stays silent.</p> \n<p>To combat this, consider creating a meeting agenda or slide deck, so people know what they need to share, and when.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Bondiguel puts it, \"Another challenge is communication. You need to put good processes in place (access to documents, meeting cadence, etc.) to ensure the entire team has all the information and context they need to perform and do their best work. This has never been more important as teams adapt to hybrid work environments.\"</p> \n<p>And there you have it.

It's one of the reasons marketers love creative briefs.</p> \n<p>A creative brief acts as a roadmap that takes a project from ideation to completion. It ensures the scope, timeline, key stakeholders, and purpose of the project are communicated clearly. The creative brief is the single source of truth for everyone working on a project. If questions come up or tasks become unclear, the creative brief will steer things in the right direction.</p> \n<p>If you’re just starting out in a creative role, taking on your first gig as a designer or consultant, or you simply want to get better at writing creative briefs, this article has everything you need to know to write the most effective creative briefs.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=6f35d7bf-efdd-4cd9-8437-6ad468559ee7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Download: Creative Brief Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6f35d7bf-efdd-4cd9-8437-6ad468559ee7.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>Whether you’re a consultant pitching a creative brief to a client, or a project manager presenting a brief to your team, start by speaking with the project stakeholders. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/create-compelling-creative-brief?_ga=2.193051305.527745099.1631034287-119888798.1631034287\">These discussions</a> will help you understand the company's mission, project goals, and challenges your team faces. Then, you’ll have enough information to write a compelling brief that focuses on what’s really important to your company or client.</p> \n<p>The idea of a creative brief sounds simple, but it can be hard to wrap a lot of important details into just a few pages. Therefore, a creative brief is typically made of eight sections that can fit on one to two pages.</p> \n<p>Creative briefs are pretty standard documents within just about every marketing, advertising, or design team. But the format of every company's creative brief might vary slightly to suit the needs of the project or client. Below is a simple outline that will be the foundation of your creative brief. It includes the most important steps in the creative process and information that'll be relevant to stakeholders involved in the project.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Once you’re fully informed and ready to write, use the following steps to draft yours. To make it even easier, I've included a fill-in-the-blank template in the last step.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/creative-brief-template?hubs_post-cta=header\">Follow Along with HubSpot's Free Creative Brief Templates</a></h5> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/creative-brief-template?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Photoshop-Creative-Brief-Cover.png?width=297&amp;name=Photoshop-Creative-Brief-Cover.png\" alt=\"creative brief template\" width=\"297\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/creative-brief-template?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download Now</a></p> \n<h3>1. Decide on a name for the project.</h3> \n<p>The first step in developing a creative brief is deciding on a project name. This might sound simple, but it's one of the most critical components of a creative brief. If you're building a campaign around a brand new product or service, the campaign name will be the first time many members of your team will be introduced to it. Referring to the campaign (and therefore product or service) by the correct name prevents the <a href=\"https://chadjthiele.com/2012/06/09/lessons-learned-from-the-telephone-game/\">game of telephone</a> from happening. Without a specific and clear campaign name, people will make up their own terminology which can <a href=\"https://www.mobilespoon.net/2019/07/boss-obsessed-terminology.html\">alter the intent of the campaign</a>.</p> \n<p>To create a project or campaign name for your creative brief, keep it creative and brief. A few words or a short sentence should work just fine. If you're launching a product, identify what the call to action will be for the target audience, then center the name around that. Here are a few examples of fictional campaign names:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>The Search for Adventure Campaign-</em> A scavenger hunt-themed amusement park.</li> \n <li><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">The Don't Forget Your Memories Campaign</em><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\"> - A photo frame company.</span></li> \n <li><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">The \"What's hotter than Pepperco hot sauce?\" Campaign</em><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\"> - A hot sauce brand.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Write about the brand and summarize the project’s background.</h3> \n<p>Another simple, yet essential section is the company background. If you work in an agency setting, this is non-negotiable as your team is likely handling several client campaigns at once. However, if you're developing a creative brief for an in-house project, you'll still want to include this part. New hires on your team, freelancers, and vendors will appreciate the background that your internal team is already privy to.</p> \n<p>The company background shouldn't be a general history of the company or a copied and pasted paragraph from the about page. Instead, tailor this to the project at hand. Set the scene with one or two sentences that sum up the brand’s mission. Follow this with a few sentences that give background on the brand and what led to the development of the project.</p> \n<p>While some creatives have put this information all together in a quick paragraph, others separate it with headers like “Brand Statement” and “Background.”</p> \n<p>Here are some questions to consider when writing a company background for your creative brief:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Has the company launched a campaign like this before?</li> \n <li>Why is the company choosing to launch this campaign right now?</li> \n <li>What's happening in the market and how will this campaign respond to it?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Highlight the project objective.</h3> \n<p>Here is where the creative brief gets more specific. The project objective should briefly explain the purpose of the project, the timeline, and the audience it'll target. This can be done in a sentence or two, but you can get creative and stylize it in sections.</p> \n<p>This part of the creative brief will be helpful in emphasizing why the project needs to happen. The goal aspects will help you and your team align on the project’s expectations. If the company or client hasn’t identified any major challenges, you can focus this section on goals and objectives. Explain what a successful project looks like and how it will benefit the company.</p> \n<p>Pro Tip: Writing a project objective is very similar to writing a goal, so take a look at this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/goals-vs-objectives\">blog post</a> for more detail on goal and objective writing.</p> \n<p>Here’s an example of a <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/aaga8/paypal-creative-brief\">sample creative brief for PayPal</a> that offers separate sections for “The Problem” and “The Goal”:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"PayPal Sample brief showing The Problem and The Goal\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-Sep-07-2021-05-06-49-25-PM.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-Sep-07-2021-05-06-49-25-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Describe the target audience.</h3> \n<p>Next, it's time to define the target audience for the project. This is the segment of your market that will directly benefit from the product or service being launched. You can take audience segmentation a step further by identifying a primary and secondary audience. Doing so will give your team more freedom to explore creative ideas that might resonate with one group more than the other.</p> \n<p>When crafting the target audience section, be sure to include the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Demographics</strong> - Simple demographic information gives your team insight into exactly who the audience is. This includes data points like age, income, education, ethnicity, and occupation.</li> \n <li><strong>Behaviors</strong> - Buying behaviors, trends, and other customer history make up the target audience behaviors. These provide important context to the creative brief because they explain where the customer is in their buyer journey.</li> \n <li><strong>Psychographics</strong> - This is how the audience thinks and feels about your brand and the product or service you sell, in general.</li> \n <li><strong>Geographics</strong> - Digital, physical, and hybrid campaigns will benefit from having geographics stated explicitly in the creative brief so that media buyers can price ad slots in each market.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip: Your creative brief shouldn't be too long, and this section can take up quite a bit of space. To make this section more digestible, consider using</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer personas</a>.</p> \n<p>Here’s how the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/aaga8/paypal-creative-brief\">sample brief for PayPal</a> noted above thoughtfully explains a new product’s target audience:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"PayPal sample brief target audience\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-Sep-07-2021-05-06-46-80-PM.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-Sep-07-2021-05-06-46-80-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Interpret the competitive landscape.</h3> \n<p>Knowing what your competitors are doing is advantageous for the whole team. You can use competitive data to come up with ideas that haven’t been tried yet, learn from their failed projects, or build a project that improves on a strategy they’ve used in the past.</p> \n<p>Include a quick list of competitors with similar product or service offerings. Briefly list a few things your company has in common with them, how your brand has differentiated itself already, and a few areas where this project can help you get ahead.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>6. Prepare the key message.</h3> \n<p>The key message can be the most difficult part of the creative brief to develop because just about every stakeholder will have a different opinion of what it should be. To get buy-in faster, try this simple trick. Ask yourself \"We're launching this project, so what?\" The so what? is your key message. It explains why your target audience should stop what they're doing and pay attention to your campaign.</p> \n<p>The key message includes the pain point, what the audience's experience might be like without the pain point, and the benefit they'll receive as a result of your company's solution. This framework places the customer in the spotlight of the campaign. Instead of telling them what this product or service could do for them, it positions them as the main character in the journey from problem to solution.</p> \n<h3>7. Choose the key consumer benefit.</h3> \n<p>If you're launching a new product, there are likely several features and benefits that the target audience will experience when they decide to purchase it. However, it's very difficult to structure a campaign around several different features. That's why marketers and creatives use something called a key consumer benefit (KCB) in the creative brief to keep everyone aligned on the primary benefit being communicated. To choose the right KCB, you'll want to get input from the project stakeholders and rely on consumer data to guide the decision.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro Tip: Your KCB won't always be the fanciest feature of your product. The benefit that solves the biggest problem for your audience is a great choice for the KCB.</p> \n<h3>8. Select an attitude.</h3> \n<p>The tone and voice of your campaign create the overall attitude and that should be consistent throughout every creative element that's being developed. Identifying a few adjectives that describe the attitude of the campaign can help copywriters draft copy that sends the correct message within the right context. Graphic designers can use colors and techniques to portray the tone and voice as well.</p> \n<p>In this section of the brief, you should also note the appropriate voice for your audience. While some audiences, like those in the business world, prefer more formal language, others might engage more with a casual, relatable tone. To substantiate your decision to choose a particular brand voice and tone, you could write something like, “Our brand voice is a casual and carefree tone because it speaks to younger Gen-Z audiences.”</p> \n<p>Pro tip: Use a thesaurus to find specific words that evoke nuanced emotions and attitudes for a hyper-targeted campaign.</p> \n<h3>9. Determine the best call to action.</h3> \n<p>Finally, your audience needs something to do once they see your campaign. The good thing about CTAs is that they don't have to be physical actions. A CTA could have a goal to change thoughts and perceptions about your brand which doesn't require the audience to do anything at all.</p> \n<p>Your creative brief might include several different CTAs, especially if you have a primary and secondary target audience. But it's a good idea to have one primary CTA that drives the project objective we talked about earlier.</p> \n<h3>10. Draft the distribution plan.</h3> \n<p>When the project is done, you’ll need to make sure your audience actually sees it. List a few channels or platforms on which you plan to announce the launch, as well as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">any promotional content</a> you plan to create.</p> \n<p>When drafting this section, think about your target audience. Don’t waste time on a promotional strategy that they won’t see. For example, if you’re promoting a project to Gen-Z, you’ll want to invest in social media rather than billboards or newspaper ads.</p> \n<h3>11. Share the creative brief with stakeholders.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve drafted a creative brief, share it with the team you’ll be working with. You’ll also want to circulate it around the company via Slack, email, or presentations. If you’re a consultant working outside of a client’s company, encourage your clients to share the brief internally.</p> \n<p>As you or your clients spread awareness, you should be open to answering questions or taking feedback from colleagues in case they have any great ideas. This strategy will <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tried-and-true-sales-marketing-alignment\">improve team alignment</a>, increase support of the project, and ensure that all of your colleagues are on the same page.</p> \n<h2>Creative Brief Template</h2> \n<p>Having trouble with the flow and organization of your brief?

Below are some of the most common types of creative briefs used across industries today plus examples of what they might look like.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Creative Briefs</h3> \n<p>A marketing creative brief is most commonly used to bring campaigns to market. This type of creative brief can be used for both new and existing campaigns. Broad business goals and strategies to accomplish them are usually included in this type of creative brief. It's also not uncommon to see revenue goals and a budget included in a marketing creative brief.</p> \n<h4>Simple Marketing Creative Brief Example</h4> \n<p><img alt=\"Simple Marketing Creative Brief Example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-3.jpeg?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-3.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h3>Product Design Creative Briefs</h3> \n<p>Product design creative briefs outline the go-to-market strategy for a new product or feature launch. Product marketers are responsible for developing this type of brief. Developed in conjunction with the product manager, the product design creative brief will describe the features and benefits of the product and how the audience will benefit from them.

These briefs are concise and include the client's brand guidelines as well as the specific project guidelines. A budget may also be included in the brief so that all teams can make wise decisions about the tactics they recommend for the client. An account manager or supervisor develops the creative brief and shares it with client stakeholders before the agency begins working on the project.</p> \n<h4>Advertising Agency Creative Brief Example</h4> \n<p><img alt=\"Advertising Agency Creative Brief Example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-Sep-07-2021-05-06-46-36-PM.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Creative%20Brief%20in%2010%20Simple%20Steps%20%5BExamples%20+%20Template%5D-Sep-07-2021-05-06-46-36-PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h2>Streamline Projects with a Creative Brief</h2> \n<p>Scope creep happens to the best of us.
