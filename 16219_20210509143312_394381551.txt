The woman in this piece was the first artist I ever met&#8230; on the day I was born! From the time I was little, my mom, aka watercolor artist Judi Cumming, was cold hard proof that being an artist was possible. Throughout my childhood, she painted and showed her work a lot &#8211; then she stopped, and I was never really sure why. Well, we get into all of that and more. Our family always jokes that my mom is operating on a different cosmic plane than most of us, and after you hear her insightful thoughts today, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll agree.</p>\n<p>Now, not only is <em>my</em> mom on the podcast, but in order to keep the &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Day&#8221; theme going, the boy who made <em>me</em> a mom is showing up for the Not-So-Speedy Speed Round! Yep, I convinced 14 year old Charlie to come on for a few minutes.

Ah yes, there&#8217;s nothing like a deadline to motivate an artist!</p>\n<p>Next, here&#8217;s one of the pieces from the &#8220;In Tandem&#8221; series she did with her calligrapher friend Susan <em>{I own this one}</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/05/07/girls-like-farkles/mom3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38339\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38339\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"2215\" srcset=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom3.jpg 584w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom3-405x1536.jpg 405w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom3-540x2048.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yep, there it is in my living room! If you&#8217;re trying to read that, you won&#8217;t be able to. This one was gibberish and titled something about &#8216;the tower of babble&#8217;. I love it so much.</p>\n<p>So, we talked a little bit about my mom finding her way to walking when she experienced that bout of overwhelming anxiety. While she started out &#8216;learning to walk a 10k&#8217;, she eventually turned this therapy into two epic journey&#8217;s in France and Spain! Here she is walking the El Camino trail <em>{I think this photo is in France?}</em>, and a few of her watercolor paintings that were inspired by bits and pieces along the trail:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/05/07/girls-like-farkles/mom4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38340\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38340\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"2310\" srcset=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom4.jpg 584w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom4-388x1536.jpg 388w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom4-518x2048.jpg 518w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Sigh.</em> Lovely.</p>\n<p>So, as you can see, she knows what she&#8217;s doing with watercolors. When she came to visit us last summer, we headed down to my studio to make a couple of pieces together. She did the painting, and I added my tiny cut out people&#8230; now they get to wander around in these washy, dreamlike worlds:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/05/07/girls-like-farkles/mom5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38341\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38341\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom5-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"3673\" srcset=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom5-scaled.jpg 407w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mom5-244x1536.jpg 244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" /></a></p>\n<p>I wish I got to walk around in there! <em>Ah,</em> that was so much fun&#8230; we even broke out some straws and blew the ink around like we did when I was little.</p>\n<p>Okay, time to crack open the family albums!
