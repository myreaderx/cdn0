My favorite part about casting announcements for these movies is that to me, it almost doesn&#8217;t matter if Norton is going to be playing a stern family patriarch, a happy-go-lucky vacationer, an evil oil tycoon, or anything in between – I&#8217;m just thrilled that he&#8217;s going to be rolling around in the sandbox Johnson is creating.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s carved out a niche playing duplicitous characters over the course of his career, but he can also play a full-blown scumbag with the best of &#8217;em. Remember him as &#8220;Worm&#8221; in <em>Rounders</em>? Of course you do. How about as the skeezy, double-crossing Steve in <em>The Italian Job</em>? Great stuff. But in his work with Wes Anderson starting with 2012&#8217;s <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>, he&#8217;s shown a much more lighthearted and comedic side of himself, so maybe Johnson wants to tap into that energy for this sequel. When all of the people involved in a project like this have proven themselves time and time again, the mysterious nature of these casting announcements becomes less of an annoyance and more of a catalyst for imagination.</p>\n<p>Production on <em>Knives Out 2</em> is set to begin sometime this summer in Greece, whisking Daniel Craig&#8217;s protagonist, Detective Benoit Blanc, off to an international locale after he spent the entirety of the first film Stateside in an imposing Massachusetts manor outside of Boston. Johnson is back to write and direct the sequel, and his producer <strong>Ram Bergman</strong> is reuniting with him to run point on the production. Johnson, Bergman, and Craig all signed a huge deal with Netflix to make <em>Knives Out 2</em> and <em>Knives Out 3</em> at the streamer, and it&#8217;s one of the biggest streaming deals in history thus far. Those three guys stand to make upwards of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/knives-out-sequels-deal/\">$100 million each</a> from the deal, which involved the rights to the franchise moving from Lionsgate&#8217;s theatrical division to the omnipresent streaming service.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/knives-out-2-cast-edward-norton/\">&#8216;Knives Out 2&#8217;: Edward Norton Joins Daniel Craig in Murder Mystery Sequel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BvaNqSAxCg0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 18:00:29 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-2-cast-Edward-Norton-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e21fe40b553cfc04f9dd010e7686c766","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn67@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-15-583_f3828d94ef7be13b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":39019,"destBytes":25006,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-2-cast-Edward-Norton-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn67@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-15-583_f3828d94ef7be13b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn26@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-31-725_c40724c362375b23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BvaNqSAxCg0:oIkrNr4F2y0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-31-665_6a1c61c982d6f44f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BvaNqSAxCg0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn67@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-31-705_b5b072e90093e0e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘The Shining Girls’ Cast With Elisabeth Moss Adds Jamie Bell as a Time-Traveling Serial Killer","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670821","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670837\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"The Shining Girls Cast Jamie Bell\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Shining Girls</em></strong>, an upcoming Apple TV+ series based on the novel by Lauren Beukes, has found its time-traveling serial killer in the form of <strong>Jamie Bell</strong>. The series tells the story of a killer in Depression-era Chicago who finds a way to travel through time – a feat he uses to target women in different eras. But one of his potential victims, played by <strong>Elisabeth Moss</strong>, survives the attack and decides to hunt the killer down.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670821\"></span></p>\n<p>Multiple sources are reporting that Jamie Bell is joining <em>The Shining Girls</em> cast. Elisabeth Moss stars in the Apple TV+ series, which comes from writer and executive producer <strong>Silka Luisa</strong>. Moss and Lindsey McManus will also executive produce, and so will Leonardo DiCaprio, Lauren Beukes, and Alan Page Arriaga. The series is based on the novel by Beukes&#8217;s, and it has one hell of a hook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Harper Curtis is a killer who stepped out of the past. Kirby Mazrachi is the girl who was never meant to have a future. Kirby is the last shining girl, one of the bright young women, burning with potential, whose lives Harper is destined to snuff out after he stumbles on a House in Depression-era Chicago that opens on to other times.</p>\n<p>At the urging of the House, Harper inserts himself into the lives of these shining girls, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. He&#8217;s the ultimate hunter, vanishing without a trace into another time after each murder &#8212; until one of his victims survives.</p>\n<p>Determined to bring her would-be killer to justice, Kirby joins the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> to work with the reporter, Dan Velasquez, who covered her case. Soon Kirby finds herself closing in on an impossible truth . . .</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bell will play Harper while Moss is playing Kirby. <strong>Wagner Moura</strong> is also part of the cast, playing the reporter role. I read the novel when it came out, and thought it was pretty damn great. The Harper character is incredibly loathsome and vicious, so Bell has his work cut out for him. Also, the Kirby character goes through hell, which makes it the perfect role for Moss, an actress who seems to love playing distressed women.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on when we might see the series, but production is expected to start in Chicago this summer. <em>The Shining Girls</em> joins an ever-increasing line-up of promising new shows headed to Apple TV+. Little by little, the streaming service is making a name for itself.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-shining-girls-cast-jamie-bell/\">&#8216;The Shining Girls&#8217; Cast With Elisabeth Moss Adds Jamie Bell as a Time-Traveling Serial Killer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/uHLITgsSKEc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 17:30:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"2957f74ef94f0f9d840d72a5b4540a0c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn22@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-26-899_d02a9db4aa8d3345.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26107,"destBytes":14858,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Shining-Girls-Cast-Jamie-Bell-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn22@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-26-899_d02a9db4aa8d3345.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn37@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-31-721_4f2bb6128e151928.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uHLITgsSKEc:qpRxPRLtuZQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-34-248_221d18d3fa0e63d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/uHLITgsSKEc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn43@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-32-138_c3ef4a4fa3a14e21.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754326},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘Lisey’s Story’ Trailer: Julianne Moore Escapes to Another World in This Stephen King Apple TV+ Miniseries","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670798","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Liseys-Story-Trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670818\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Liseys-Story-Trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Lisey's Story Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Liseys-Story-Trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Liseys-Story-Trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Liseys-Story-Trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Liseys-Story-Trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a hot second since we&#8217;ve had ourselves a new <strong>Stephen King</strong> adaptation, but thankfully <strong><em>Lisey&#8217;s Story</em></strong> is on the way to change that. Based on King&#8217;s 2006 novel, this Apple TV+ miniseries stars <strong>Julianne Moore</strong> as the widow of an author (of course there&#8217;s an author character; this is a Stephen King story after all) who finds herself suddenly remembering things she deliberately blocked out of her marriage. On top of that, she&#8217;s being pursued by a psycho who wants her dead husband&#8217;s unpublished work. And if those things weren&#8217;t enough, she&#8217;s also able to suddenly enter an alternate dimension. Or is she? Watch the <em>Lisey&#8217;s Story</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670798\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Lisey&#8217;s Story Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqcI0kk-Cts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Julianne Moore, <strong>Clive Owen</strong>, <strong>Joan Allen</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Jason Leigh</strong>, <strong>Dane DeHaan</strong>, <strong>Ron Cephas Jones</strong>, and <strong>Sung Kang</strong> star in <em>Lisey&#8217;s Story</em>, an Apple TV+ miniseries based on the Stephen King novel. The series is described as &#8220;a deeply personal, pensive thriller that follows Lisey Landon (played by Moore) two years after the death of her husband, famous novelist Scott Landon (played by Owen). A series of unsettling events causes Lisey to face memories of her marriage to Scott that she has deliberately blocked out of her mind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That synopsis is <em>very</em> vague, and as you can see from the trailer, there&#8217;s a lot more going on here. Much like the tagline for the major motion picture <em>The Snowman</em>, the book&#8217;s synopsis gives you all the clues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lisey lost her husband Scott two years ago, after a twenty-five year marriage of profound and sometimes frightening intimacy. Scott was an award-winning, bestselling novelist and a very complicated man. Early in their relationship, before they married, Lisey knew there was a place Scott went—a place that both terrified and healed him, could eat him alive or give him the ideas he needed in order to live. Now it’s Lisey’s turn to face Scott’s demons, to go to that terrifying place known as Boo’ya Moon. What begins as a widow’s effort to sort through the papers of her celebrated husband becomes a nearly fatal journey into the darkness he inhabited.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pablo Larraín directs the miniseries, and King penned every episode of the series. King wrote the novel as a tribute to his wife – it&#8217;s the story of the wife of a novelist, after all. And King has long wanted to turn it into a TV series. Before a series was even announced, he <a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/stephen-king-mr-mercedes-it-movie-what-scares-him-1202518482/\">said</a>: &#8220;<i>Lisey&#8217;s Story</i> is my favorite of the books and I would love to see that done, especially now that there&#8217;s a kind of openness on the streaming services on TV and even the cable networks. There&#8217;s more freedom to do stuff now and when you do a movie from a book, there&#8217;s this thing that I call the sitting on a suitcase syndrome. That is where you try to pack in all the clothes at once and the suitcase won&#8217;t close. So it&#8217;s tough to take a book that is fully textured, and do it in two hours and 10 minutes.

There&#8217;s no place for complacency, we need to know our history,&#8221; executive producer and showrunner <strong>Alex Stapleton</strong> described of the battle for LGBTQ rights.</p>\n<p>The six-part documentary series focuses on everything from the FBI surveillance of homosexuals during the Lavendar Scare of the 1950s to the Culture Wars and AIDS crisis of the 1990s. Each episode is directed by a different filmmaker, who brings their own personal experiences and struggles to the story. <em>Pride</em> will also include archived footage from the decades-long fight, as well as interviews with key figures such as <strong>Madeleine Tress</strong>, videographer <strong>Nelson Sullivan</strong>, <strong>Bayard Rustin</strong>, writer <strong>Audre Lord</strong>, Senators <strong>Tammy Baldwin</strong> and <strong>Lester Hunt</strong>, and trans pioneers <strong>Christine Jorgensen</strong>, <strong>Flawless Sabrina</strong>, <strong>Ceyenne Doroshow</strong>, <strong>Susan Stryker</strong>, <strong>Kate Bornstein</strong>, <strong>Dean Spade</strong> and <strong>Raquel Willis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Pride</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Featuring little-known characters such as Madeleine Tress or 1980s videographer Nelson Sullivan who chronicled a vanishing downtown New York City during the AIDS epidemic, the series also features international figures such as Civil Rights pioneer Bayard Rustin, writer Audre Lorde and Senators Tammy Baldwin and Lester Hunt. The evolution of trans rights and identities through the decades is charted through interviews and archival footage of pioneers including Christine Jorgensen, Flawless Sabrina, Ceyenne Doroshow, Susan Stryker, Kate Bornstein, Dean Spade and Raquel Willis.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Pride</em> will air on FX beginning with the first three episodes at 8:00 P.M. ET on <strong>May 14</strong> and the final three episodes set to air on <strong>May 21</strong> at 8:00 P.M. ET. The day after they premiere on FX, all episodes can be streamed on Hulu.

Jordan said that he wasn’t going to play the role! I love the guy as an actor but to play Superman, someone needs to be able to be the coolest guy in the room, while to play Clark Kent they need to be able to be the LEAST cool guy in the room. I honestly can’t see Michael B Jordan doing the latter. That’s why I also can’t get behind guys like Aldis Hodge…big and tough and cool can only go so far. Brad’s suggestion of Rene Jean Page made the most sense to me, but I think one of our bigger rising stars of the moment would fit the type that I see able to play the role: Kingsley Ben Adir. I know he’s been cast in Secret Invasion, but tons of actors cross that Marvel/DC aisle.

It’s hard to imagine now, because we’re still in the crest of the current one, but the superhero era is a wave that will eventually – yes, really, even if it takes decades – ebb. Before superhero movies, there were blockbusters of vastly more stripes, somehow managing to avoid interconnected universes or the like. The Walt Disney Company is at the convergence of the current wave, with Marvel and Lucasfilm underneath their vast umbrella. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But right now, Disney+ is inadvertently giving its audiences a chance for a bit of a history lesson of what blockbusters used to look like, with the streaming arrival of the 1955 musical adaptation of </span><strong><i>Oklahoma!</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Yes, it’s true, there was once a time when blockbusters weren’t about the world ending, but were about simple love stories given grand treatments.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670554\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Pitch</h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, of course, is not a Walt Disney Pictures release – it was presented in theaters by 20th Century Fox, arriving 12 years after the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage show essentially transformed the very meaning of what a Broadway musical was or could be. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the few truly important and earth-shaking musicals to turn into a movie; when it premiered in 1943 on stage, it proved that a Broadway musical could fully weave in its singing and dancing sequences to an overall story. (You may think that’s pretty commonplace now, and it is. That’s because of the huge success of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) Though its story may seem simple, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> felt revolutionary at the time. So it made sense that Fox would want to adapt to the big screen this wildly popular love story set against the backdrop of the American West at a time of growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as the stage show felt distinctive, so too would the film. Hollywood was not lacking in movie musicals in the 1940s and 1950s, but one era was winding down as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would help usher in the next one. The era of soundstage-bound MGM musicals like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An American in Paris</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singin’ In the Rain</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was at its tail end, as audiences began flocking to their television sets instead of movie theaters. Studios wanted to draw in audiences once again, on a massive canvas that could tell stories the way TV simply couldn’t at the time. By the mid-1950s, studios were experimenting with how they would showcase their films in different widescreen methods; the wider the better. Some of the formats included CinemaScope, VistaVision, Cinerama, and Todd-AO, among others. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would be the first of its kind – the first Todd-AO film released in theaters, at an aspect ratio of 2.20:1. But the technology of Todd-AO, named in part for producer Michael Todd, had yet to be fully adopted by major movie theaters across the country. So </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, directed by Fred Zinnemann, was filmed twice, once in Todd-AO and once in the more widely used CinemaScope, at an aspect ratio of 2.55:1.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Movie</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, the important news: though there are really two versions of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (seeing as the CinemaScope version has different takes of every shot within the film), the one you can stream right now on Disney+ is the Todd-AO version. And your eyes may take a little time to adjust to that reality. It’s not just that the aspect ratio is different, making for an experience slightly less wide than the now-traditional 2.35:1 aspect ratio for modern films. It’s that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Todd-AO was shot at 30 frames per second, not the standard 24 frames per second. The good news is that 30 frames per second doesn’t create the same heightened surreality of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hobbit </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at 48 frames per second. But it does mean that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is sometimes unnervingly gorgeous, with sumptuous cinematography by Robert Surtees that soars through cornfields and depicts the lush beauty of the American West (though Arizona subs in for Oklahoma for the exterior shots) with a level of crispness rarely seen. The flip side is that some of the interior shots have a slight soap-opera feel, as if the facsimile of a movie set becomes faker at a higher frame rate. But largely speaking, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a movie any cinematography nerd should watch, just to see what this now-defunct format looks like. When the overture and opening credits, both presented on black screens, end and the camera tracks through a cornfield to meet the upbeat cowboy Curly (Gordon MacRae) as he belts out “Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin’, it’s truly thrilling to watch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rodgers and Hammerstein’s status as musical legends was established with the set of songs they crafted here. (Disney theme-park fans will appreciate that a number of the songs in the film serve as instrumental background music in Main Street, U.S.A. in both Disneyland and Walt Disney World, too.) That aforementioned opening number, as well as the title track, “The Surrey With The Fringe on Top,” “I Cain’t Say No,” and others are permanently etched in popular culture. These songs are close to being as unbeatable as anything from Rodgers and Hammerstein’s later musicals like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">South Pacific</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sound of Music</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the latter of which you can also stream on Disney+. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you have to do a fair bit of compartmentalizing with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The show was recently revived on Broadway (pre-pandemic) to massive critical acclaim, in no small part because the new version </span><a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-unbearable-whiteness-of-oklahoma-on-broadway/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grapples </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with the reality that this story is&#8230;oh, fairly racist and sexist when you think about it for more than a few seconds. The story could be a simple enough love triangle – there’s Curly, the pretty farmgirl Laurey (Shirley Jones, in her film debut), and the rough farmhand Jud (Rod Steiger) who wants Laurey and is willing to resort to violent ends to get what he wants. But said story takes place in the turn-of-the-century period right before Oklahoma shifted from being a territory once belonging to Native Americans to a full-blown state of the Union. Even if you leave aside the full erasure of Native Americans and their culture from the story (both on stage and screen), you’re left with a story where women and men occupy very old-fashioned gender norms of the early 20th century. And there’s also racial whitewashing in the form of Ali Hakim, a Persian peddler played for comic relief by the very white actor Eddie Albert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same vein as I’ve asked in this column before, I would love to know – oh, the money I’d give to have the experience – how Disney and its consultants come to the decision of what films and TV shows do or do not merit the pre-show content warning. Considering that Albert’s take on Ali Hakim includes an accent best defined as Vaguely, Insultingly Foreign, and songs like the aforementioned and bouncy “I Cain’t Say No” are meant as a charming depiction of a woman who can’t resist spending time with lots of different men&#8230;well, what exactly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> merit the content warning? We can argue about how effective the vagueness of that content warning is. They never actually explain to viewers what potentially offensive content is about to be depicted. But when a film such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma! </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrives on a family-focused streaming service without context of any kind, there’s a disturbing conclusion: someone at Disney+ is asleep at the wheel. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if you can leave its outdated elements aside (and I don’t blame you if you can’t), is the progenitor in many ways of the next era of movie musical and worth watching for that reason too. With this film, studios would make splashy, expensive, and lengthy musicals, meant to make clear to audiences that television sets aren’t as transportive as a massively wide silver screen. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including its overture and entracte, clocks in at just under 150 minutes, but that doesn’t include its intermission – many more musicals in the next decade-plus would push and move beyond the three-hour mark.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Legacy</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma! </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has an impressive legacy even as it’s lined with questionable content from top to bottom. (Not enough is said about the film’s ending, in which Curly and Jud have an inevitable fight after the latter sets a fire at Curly and Laurey’s wedding. The fight leads to Jud being killed by his own knife, followed by a makeshift trial meant to absolve Curly of any wrongdoing so he can go on his honeymoon. Everyone in town, save the federal marshal, would rather solve things in a Wild West form of justice, which the film depicts without acknowledging its grim underbelly.) By creating an event status around movie musicals, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma! </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ushered in an era of expansive genre filmmaking that brought in some of the best directors in the industry to try their hand at a different kind of story, from Robert Wise with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sound of Music</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to George Cukor with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Fair Lady</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The true legacy the film leaves behind, and the one that would be nice to have something acknowledged via Disney+, is its visual one. Even if you’re an intrepid enough viewer who’s wisely turned off the motion-smoothing technology on your HDTV (and if you haven’t, you really should), you may get initially thrown off by the way that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oklahoma! </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looks. You don’t need motion smoothing to know that this film looks slightly unexpected, in both jarring and exciting ways. That 30-frame-per-second shooting style via Todd-AO is deliberate, and a welcome glimpse at a time in American filmmaking when studios went all-in financially on event filmmaking, even if no one was wearing a cape or boasting superpowers. Dive into this film and see what studio filmmaking used to be.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/oklahoma-revisited/\">Revisiting &#8216;Oklahoma!&#8217;, a Problematic and Influential Technical Marvel That Reshaped the Movie Musical</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fe6fxs_phUA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 17:00:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oklahoma-Revisited-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"006ceaecc612bad8dd2cbaddddf0bb5c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn51@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-27-059_160054be7104de7c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33804,"destBytes":23786,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oklahoma-Revisited-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn51@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-27-059_160054be7104de7c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_1/2021/05/11/18-29-32-408_db571fcd461bb9e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fe6fxs_phUA:Xm7HlaSpDI0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn91@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-240_262a63810e6c3c5e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fe6fxs_phUA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-31-690_506e1086987d0340.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘Resident Evil Village’ Makes It Clear – No One Knows What ‘Resident Evil’ is Anymore","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670510","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670823 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Resident-Evil-Village-Review-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Resident Evil Village Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Resident-Evil-Village-Review.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Resident-Evil-Village-Review-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>What even is <em><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></em>? What even is <em>Resident Evil</em> anymore? The franchise has suffered an identity crisis since <em>Resident Evil 6 </em>(which resembled a Michael Bay movie with zombies more than anything else), consistently shuffling around protagonists, embracing a first-person perspective, and introducing super-powered human beings in the vein of Paul W.S. Anderson&#8217;s divisive film adaptations, only to do nothing with those characters in subsequent games, unsure if it wants to go in a new direction untethered from its original plot or not.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670510\"></span></p>\n<p>All of this was racing through my mind after my first Lycan encounter in <em>Resident Evil Village</em>.

The various viruses over mainline entries and spinoffs have caused all matters of monstrous transformations, so when you&#8217;re on the eighth numerical game still with no clear direction, the real question is why <em>not</em> resort to drastic measures and make a werewolf game? You might as well throw in an interpretation of vampires. And how about using the template of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> (a village of crazed locals, Gothic castles, merchants inexplicably existing to sell items and upgrades) to justify placing the game within this franchise.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the approach here, as <em>Resident Evil Village</em> brings back <em>Resident Evil 7</em>&#8216;s Ethan Winters, having survived the incident at the Baker home (there is a recap video available of that much more focused and terrifying game for those coming into this blind) and now living off the grid somewhere in Europe at the request of glorified special forces operative Chris Redfield. He lives with his wife Mia and newborn daughter Rose, giving players some short-lived peace walking around with the baby and exploring their home. Through some lazy writing telegraphing a superbly predictable and lame twist (oh, it continuously gets way worse), tragedy strikes, leaving Ethan stranded in the snow on the outskirts of the titular village. The only way to save Rose is to investigate.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one consistent issue from the start: Ethan is just plain boring, even when the game strives for an emotional payoff. Early on, we are also reminded that he is special in ways that deflate the tension and terror of a horror experience. Although, I&#8217;m guessing the developers know that because the final third of the game is a jump button away from being something as action-centric as <em>Doom Eternal</em>. Certain scenes here (especially involving a severed hand) are unintentionally laugh-out-loud funny, breaking all immersion. There is a clear disconnect between the ludicrous narrative set-up and the seriousness of Ethan&#8217;s personal mission, with none of the self-aware humor and purposefully awful dialogue that gave <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, the game it&#8217;s trying to mimic, charm.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that the first-person shooter gameplay experience streamlines things, further eliminating what made Leon Kennedy&#8217;s battle against the Las Plagas feel so fresh and special, and most importantly, like an installment of a series that was organically evolving. Gone are the goofy wrestling moves (why introduce Lycans if you aren&#8217;t going to let me German Suplex them?), which, in addition to being entertainingly silly, were necessary to the gameplay – let me conserve ammo! Bullets, healing items, crafting ingredients (one of the game&#8217;s only new features), treasures to sell to Duke (your friendly merchant this time around), and livestock (you can now use cooking recipes to create permanent upgrades to your health and damage taken upon impact); all of it is everywhere, removing a great deal of fear and suspense. Yes, this game is only being reviewed in Standard difficulty, but the alternative of raising it to improve the scarcity of ammunition and consumables does not offset enemies taking a ridiculous number of bullets to kill.</p>\n<p>However, there is one bright spot for nightmare fuel, and that&#8217;s the castle of the much-advertised and marketed Lady Dimitrescu, a towering presence with vampiric overtones. The atmosphere is often filled with dread, there are plenty of notes to come across detailing the twisted lore of how she and her three daughters came to be (each of them also functions as a mini-boss trying to halt your progress).Tthe scale of the building, coupled with an abundance of locked doors and some puzzles (they are all very easy) is the closest the game comes to a satisfying survival horror experience. There is also a problem; that section is only 3-4 hours of the 12-14 hour game, meaning that <em>Resident Evil Village</em> peaks early with a terrific boss fight (in the game&#8217;s defense, there are a couple of pretty good ones here).</p>\n<p>The rest amounts to a rushed tour through the far less elaborate domains of other freaks; a creepy doll that looks like something out of a Tim Burton movie, a rotund amphibious creature lacking in personality, and a Magneto knockoff that&#8217;s more obnoxious than interesting (during a boss fight, he refers to a villainous female antagonist as &#8220;that bitch&#8221; multiple times, exemplifying how atrociously &#8220;edgy&#8221; the dialogue is). Then there&#8217;s the final baddie, who turns out to have motives more fitting for a <em>Silent Hill</em> game, who is nonetheless one of the more positive spots. The scattershot nature of these areas and battles suggest <em>Resident Evil</em> doesn&#8217;t know what it is anymore, and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> definitely doesn&#8217;t know what it wants to be. Just wait until the game gives you control of another character and becomes <em>Call of Duty</em> featuring Lycans. Also, that segment follows a factory level where you fight off mechanical monsters.</p>\n<p>The fact that all of this is fairly stupid doesn&#8217;t mean it couldn&#8217;t have worked because, again, the real problem is there are no scares beyond the occasional loud noise/sudden enemy appearance, and if you want to analyze it as an action game, it&#8217;s elementary. The initial presence of a Lycan is thrilling, but the novelty wears off, as does mowing down undead servants and mechanical mutants. If anything, the final few hours are exhausting to play. I would say the game becomes a shell of its former self, but it didn&#8217;t have a shell to begin with.</p>\n<p>Even the usual compliments – this is a AAA game and it certainly looks exceptional – are backhanded here. Ray-tracing capabilities do wonders for environments such as Dimitrescu&#8217;s Castle. Still, there are a startling number of areas (especially the outdoors of the village itself) rendered in a low resolution. Technically, the game is functional despite having no difficulty setting that feels right. Completing the game also unlocks a harder difficulty and the usual <em>Resident Evil</em> bonuses (new weapons, a challenge mode, a store to purchase various collectibles using in-game currency). There&#8217;s also a half-baked version of the Mercenaries mode with additional online modes on the horizon, but for the first time in my life, I&#8217;m done with a <em>Resident Evil</em> game after playing it once. There&#8217;s no need to frustrate oneself, admiring the potential and excitement of the first few hours before it plummets and becomes a chore. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> is a place not worth staying in.</p>\n<p><b>/Film Rating: 5 out of 10</b></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/resident-evil-village-review/\">&#8216;Resident Evil Village&#8217; Makes It Clear – No One Knows What &#8216;Resident Evil&#8217; is Anymore</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/B6jZhxu5zlw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 16:00:38 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Resident-Evil-Village-Review-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"336db48e95bfeb491b08a1a8ed64a06f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn59@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-18-731_884b0c05f9bd0faa.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":41475,"destBytes":28450,"author":"Robert Kojder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Resident-Evil-Village-Review-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn59@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-18-731_884b0c05f9bd0faa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn85@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-31-722_39dd25b8b2287e47.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=B6jZhxu5zlw:NA5MTYRy2D8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn8@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-275_5ccb8b9ae654a0ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/B6jZhxu5zlw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn23@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-121_4d37feff6cd15d08.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘The Martian’ Considered Channing Tatum in the Lead Role Instead of Matt Damon","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670697","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670699\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"the martian channing tatum\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839-768x329.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839.jpeg 1496w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Ridley Scott&#8217;s acclaimed sci-fi film <strong><em>The Martian</em></strong> asked the big questions: What would it take for NASA to rescue an astronaut who got left behind on Mars? How would a man realistically survive on a barren planet given limited resources and a bunch of potatoes? And why can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMHG3gRZ2ik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aquaman control whales</a>? But one big question might have changed the movie completely: what if <strong>Channing Tatum</strong> was cast in the lead role instead of <strong>Matt Damon</strong>? It sounds like a random hypothetical, but according to <em>The Martian</em> author <strong>Andy Weir</strong>, it could&#8217;ve happened.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670697\"></span></p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2567085/matt-damon-almost-missed-out-on-oscar-nominated-role-because-studio-Interference-the-martian\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"CinemaBlend (opens in a new tab)\">CinemaBlend</a>, Weir, who wrote the 2011 novel upon which <em>The Martin</em> is based, revealed that Channing Tatum almost got cast in the lead role of Mark Watney, the botanist who was left behind on Mars. And the <em>22 Jump Street</em> would have gotten the part (though maybe not the Oscar nomination) if studio 20th Century Fox had gotten their way.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, when Matt Damon threw his hat in the ring, we were like, &#8216;Oh hell yeah.&#8217; Bear in mind, in The Martian I had no say whatsoever. My only job was to cash the check. The producers and Ridley were like, ‘Oh hell yeah. That works.’ But the studio was really pushing to have Channing Tatum play the lead. And I was like, &#8216;I don’t see that. He’s an absolutely gorgeous man, but I don’t see him being this really really smart guy.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Weir continued, &#8220;I’m sure the real Channing Tatum is plenty intelligent, but that’s not the kind of character he usually plays. He usually plays either a guy who’s gorgeous, or a guy who’s a badass, or both. But yeah, we got Matt, and Matt did such a fantastic job. He nailed it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While it stings a little that Tatum isn&#8217;t seen as being able to play intelligent, Weir is right. Tatum has proven himself a much more adept and self-aware comedic actor than his early-career hunky heartthrob roles had led people to believe, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine him convincingly playing a scientist. He would bring a different energy than Damon did — much more dopey strongman than Damon&#8217;s sardonic survivalist. And while Damon is admittedly a lot more Hollywood handsome than many real-life scientists, he&#8217;s got a kind of cool intelligence to his persona that made <em>The Martian </em>such a success.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s fun to imagine what could&#8217;ve been. Would Tatum have landed an Oscar nomination for his role? Would he have given a big middle finger to detractors who didn&#8217;t think he could play intelligent? Maybe in another timeline.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-martian-channing-tatum/\">&#8216;The Martian&#8217; Considered Channing Tatum in the Lead Role Instead of Matt Damon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/I5TlCbku82M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 00:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"ac8a31dec61de028895da87a8ce8023c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn4@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-26-809_b69e150612993cbc.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":39880,"destBytes":26144,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-martian-e1620673866839-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn4@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-26-809_b69e150612993cbc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn95@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-31-663_3f493757a7ed0dc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I5TlCbku82M:fSNcNdOdBr0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-31-763_4dfa06ff1ab3a012.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/I5TlCbku82M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn31@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-31-632_e69b98a02b82c846.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754326},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘Sweet Tooth’ Featurette: Robert Downey Jr. Talks About Tweaking the Source Material for the Netflix Adaptation","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670675","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-670678 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sweet-Tooth-featurette-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Tooth featurette\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sweet-Tooth-featurette.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sweet-Tooth-featurette-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Jeff Lemire</strong>&#8216;s comic book series <em><strong>Sweet Tooth</strong></em> is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/sweet-tooth-tv-show/\">getting the Netflix treatment</a> as a streaming show, courtesy of executive producers <strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong> and <strong>Susan Downey</strong>.

After a decade of living safely in his secluded forest home, a sheltered hybrid deer-boy named Gus (Christian Convery) unexpectedly befriends a wandering loner named Jepperd (Nonso Anozie). Together they set out on an extraordinary adventure across what&#8217;s left of America in search of answers — about Gus&#8217; origins, Jepperd&#8217;s past, and the true meaning of home. But their story is full of unexpected allies and enemies, and Gus quickly learns the lush, dangerous world outside the forest is more complex than he ever could have imagined.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Sweet Tooth</em> premieres on Netflix on <strong>June 4</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/sweet-tooth-featurette/\">&#8216;Sweet Tooth&#8217; Featurette: Robert Downey Jr. Talks About Tweaking the Source Material for the Netflix Adaptation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/emxZgObkXp8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 May 2021 23:30:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sweet-Tooth-featurette-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"00b4f86d05885921bfdb57c78465634d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn13@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-14-896_c251dfddf1fd58a5.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32699,"destBytes":22762,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sweet-Tooth-featurette-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn13@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-14-896_c251dfddf1fd58a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn21@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-31-720_c09c5255e2f276f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=emxZgObkXp8:azRHmqrAhFA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-32-212_686824ca7175d8a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/emxZgObkXp8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn72@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-395_b0c129d03bfdf9b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Featurette: How the VFX Team Pulled Off the Action Scenes","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670565","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670575\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-1-700x312.jpg\" alt=\"the falcon and the winter soldier featurette\" width=\"700\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-1-700x312.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-1-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-1-768x342.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-1.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong> looks and feels like a Marvel movie, especially in its action scenes. And those high-flying action sequences couldn&#8217;t have been done without a grade-A VFX team.

In the featurette, Marvel host Lorraine Cink talks with Eric Leven, the VFX Supervisor of Marvel Studios&#8217; <em>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</em>, &#8220;about some of the VFX magic behind the scenes that helped bring some of Sam Wilson&#8217;s high-flying action scenes to life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That includes the opening scene in which Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) chases a group of wingsuit flyers weaving throughout the canyons, in which Leven and his team really did strap a man onto the back of a wingsuit flyer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Anytime you can do anything for real, you want to do it for real,&#8221; Leven said. &#8220;I think what&#8217;s really important, especially in a sequence like this, is even if 70%, 80% is done on a computer in CG, but having enough of it to sell that it&#8217;s real&#8230;if you have enough shots in there that are real, it makes the rest of the sequence believable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Leven&#8217;s vision for the action was to make it believable to the audience, saying, &#8220;What I really wanted to do for the big action sequences was as much as possible make things feel like they&#8217;re grounded in reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directed by Kari Skogland with Malcolm Spellman as head writer, <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> stars Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Emily VanCamp and Daniel Brühl. The series also features Erin Kellyman, Georges St. Pierre, Amy Aquino, Adepero Oduye and Danny Ramirez.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All six episodes of <em>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</em> are now streaming on Disney+.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All eyes are on the shield, as Sam Wilson aka The <span class=\"il\">Falcon</span>, and Bucky Barnes aka The <span class=\"il\">Winter</span> <span class=\"il\">Soldier</span> decide to team up—or rather, work together—when a new global threat launches them into an unexpected mission that may hit too close to home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-featurette-vfx/\">&#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8217;

The fantasy epic from A24 and director <strong>David Lowery</strong> was supposed to embark on its quest via a world premiere at SXSW in 2020 before opening in theaters soon after, but the pandemic drove a sword straight into those plans. Those of us eager to see the film at any cost hoped A24 would release it digitally, but the indie distributor held fast and saved the film for theaters. Now, <em>The Green Knight</em> will gallop onto big screens in July, and there&#8217;s a new trailer to get us excited all over again.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670715\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Green Knight Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS6ksY8xWCY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure <em>The Green Knight</em> is on everyone&#8217;s &#8220;must-see&#8221; list for the year, because how could it not be? Here, David Lowery takes the Arthurian story of <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em> and reworks it into a film that looks strange, scary, and unique. The movie is described as &#8220;a fresh and bold spin on a classic tale from the knights of the round table,&#8221; and &#8220;tells the story of Sir Gawain, King Arthur&#8217;s reckless and headstrong nephew, who embarks on a daring quest to confront the eponymous Green Knight, a gigantic emerald-skinned stranger and tester of men. Gawain contends with ghosts, giants, thieves, and schemers in what becomes a deeper journey to define his character and prove his worth in the eyes of his family and kingdom by facing the ultimate challenger.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dev Patel</strong> plays Sir Gawain, and leads a cast that includes <strong>Alicia Vikander</strong>, <strong>Joel Edgerton</strong>, <strong>Sarita Choudhury</strong>, <strong>Sean Harris</strong>, <strong>Kate Dickie</strong>, <strong>Barry Keoghan</strong>, and <strong>Ralph Ineson</strong>. Director David Lowery wrote the script. Last year, when folks were clamoring for a potential digital release of <em>The Green Knight</em>, Lowery weighed in and didn&#8217;t completely shoot down the idea, although he preferred a theatrical release.</p>\n<p>When asked about the film&#8217;s release date, he <a href=\"https://theplaylist.net/david-lowery-green-knight-release-20200504/\">said</a>: &#8220;No one knows. That&#8217;s the case with everything at the moment. No one knows anything. All I can say is that at some point audiences will see it. And they&#8217;ll see it in the best way possible, given the circumstances. Hopefully, that’s in theaters. Hopefully, theaters survive. I&#8217;m a big-time defender of the theatrical experience, and one of the things I love about A24 is that they are, as well. If I were just an audience member and I’ve been stuck at home for six months and I wanted to see a new movie, I’d rather see it at home than not see it at all. So I’m confident that it’ll be seen soon, but &#8216;soon&#8217; is variable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the end, it was probably wise to hold out for a theatrical release, because it sure looks like <em>The Green Knight</em> is going to look pretty damn great on a big screen. <em>The Green Knight</em> opens on <strong>July 30, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-green-knight-trailer-new/\">&#8216;The Green Knight&#8217; Trailer: Dev Patel Faces His Destiny in David Lowery&#8217;s Arthurian Legend Fantasy Film</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/6zI6LmKvllU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 13:05:55 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-green-knight-trailer-new-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"76eb5779ea12509bfdb8ec9d1ec0f535","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn63@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-28-730_ff142dad65b0036a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":25057,"destBytes":13954,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-green-knight-trailer-new-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn63@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-28-730_ff142dad65b0036a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-31-625_02ebd628e454c140.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6zI6LmKvllU:1ed2zhwI3xw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn60@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-150_3124e3da7cd6ce29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/6zI6LmKvllU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-133_181d1609fe7b7ba4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"The Morning Watch: Creating Katie-Vision in ‘The Mitchells vs. The Machines’, How Realistic Are Bank Heists in Movies & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670726","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670739 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsmachines-katievision-acceptance-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Making of The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsmachines-katievision-acceptance.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsmachines-katievision-acceptance-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-morning-watch/\">The Morning Watch</a> is a recurring feature that highlights a handful of noteworthy videos from around the web.

That would be hard enough on its own, but to complicate matters, a zombie outbreak has turned Vegas into a place of non-stop death and carnage. And just to further complicate matters, the government has decided to drop a nuclear bomb on the Gambling Capital of the World. So our heroes have to dodge the living dead, break into a safe, and get the hell out of town before they get nuked. Sounds like a piece of cake, right?</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670779\"></span></p>\n<p>This premise – a zombie heist flick! – is oodles of fun, and fun is exactly what Snyder is having here. Seemingly free to do whatever the hell he wants thanks to some Netflix money, Snyder indulges himself, and why not? Vegas is a place of indulgences, after all. Those familiar with Snyder&#8217;s work will spot all his trademarks here – the rippling muscles, the slow-motion action, the burning-bright explosions, the on-the-nose needle drops (does he put The Cranberries song &#8220;Zombie&#8221; in this zombie movie? You know he does). Snyder also busts out a killer opening credits sequence, something he&#8217;s done before (see: <em>Watchmen</em>). The opening credits fill us in on what&#8217;s going on and introduce us to most of our characters.</p>\n<p>After a military truck leaving Area 51 slams into some newlyweds fleeing Vegas and engaging in some vehicular hanky-panky (yes, the cause for the zombie apocalypse in this film is a blowjob), a super-strong zombie is unleashed and starts chomping on flesh. Before you can say George A. Romero, Las Vegas has been overrun with the living dead, and a team of mercenaries is brought in to fight what the media calls the Zombie War. Lots and lots of people die, and Snyder stages it all with glorious excess – huge guns blow bodies into ground meat; throats are torn; limbs go flying; heads roll; and geysers of thick red blood flow forth. Eventually, the decision is made to wall off Vegas completely, trapping the zombies within as if they were residents of Manhattan in <em>Escape From New York</em>.</p>\n<p>The government then gets the bright idea to nuke Vegas – and they plan to do it on the 4th of July, complete with a fireworks show (no one will ever accuse this movie of being subtle). The potential nuking gives <em>Army of the Dead</em> its ticking clock as a team is rounded up to break into Vegas and heist a hell of a lot of loot from a safe, with all of this bankrolled by a shady billionaire (is there any other kind) played with cool grace by Hiroyuki Sanada.</p>\n<p>The team consists of many of the same people who fought in the Zombie War, including leader Scott (<strong>Dave Bautista</strong>) and his pals Cruz (<strong>Ana de la Reguera</strong>) and Vanderohe (<strong>Omari Hardwick</strong>). They add more members fast. There&#8217;s wisecracking helicopter pilot Peters (<strong>Tig Notaro</strong>, who steals the entire movie); YouTube zombie-killing sensation Mikey Guzman (<strong>Raúl Castillo</strong>); and out-of-his-league German safecracker Dieter (<strong>Matthias Schweighöfer</strong>). This is more than enough characters, but remember – Snyder loves excess, so he keeps throwing more and more people into the mix. Scott&#8217;s estranged daughter Kate (<strong>Ella Purnell</strong>) ends up tagging along, as does the shady millionaire&#8217;s right-hand man (<strong>Garret Dillahunt</strong>), who is clearly up to something from the minute we meet him. Then there&#8217;s the Coyote (<strong>Nora Arnezeder</strong>), who knows exactly how to get into Vegas. There are a few other characters as well, but they&#8217;re so pointless they might as well have ZOMBIE BAIT on their foreheads.</p>\n<p>The unfocused script, by Snyder, <strong>Shay Hatten</strong>, and <strong>Joby Harold</strong>, makes almost all of these characters extra-quirky to the extreme. Even Scott, the stoic leader of the group, has a running bit where he keeps talking about opening a food truck. But truth be told, a lot of these folks are duds. The only real standouts are Notaro&#8217;s chopper pilot and Schweighöfer&#8217;s hapless safecracker. Hardwick&#8217;s Vanderohe is occasionally fun, too, particularly in the scenes he shares with Schweighöfer. At first, the tougher-than-nails Vanderohe can&#8217;t stand the German safecracker, but soon the two develop an amusing friendship.</p>\n<p>The zombies don&#8217;t fare much better as characters. Snyder tries to change things up by giving us some abnormal ghouls. Yes, there are the standard shuffling, mindless zombies, but then there are a group of Alpha zombies. They&#8217;re smarter than the average undead person, and they behave a little like the Velociraptors in <em>Jurassic Park</em> – hopping around, snorting and sniffing. They also spend the entire movie yelling<em> &#8220;Gahhhhh!&#8221;</em> at each other and everyone else, and let me tell you, that gets real old real fast. We get a zombie king, and a zombie queen. There&#8217;s a zombie tiger. A zombie horse. Even a zombie baby. These details <em>should</em> seem fresh, but they get lost in all of the mayhem.</p>\n<p>And mayhem is really the name of the game here. Snyder stages long stretches of <em>Army of the Dead</em> like a videogame, with our characters moving down hallways and wordlessly blowing away zombies. These are technically action scenes, but there&#8217;s no grace; no style. Not even a blunt realness. Instead, it&#8217;s just shot after shot of people firing guns. This thing might as well come with a seizure warning due to the constant muzzle flashes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all very exhausting, and at 148 minutes, <em>Army of the Dead</em> more than overstays its welcome. It also tries to shoehorn in a few clumsy emotional moments at the last minute, and throws in a few twists and turns as well, but none of this works – and I doubt anyone is very interested in that sort of thing anyway. You don&#8217;t come into this sort of movie looking for character development. You just want to see some jacked people firing big, loud guns. And you&#8217;ll get that, and then some. There&#8217;s a certain fun to be had in <em>Army of the Dead</em>, but it&#8217;s the mindless, ugly fun that you wake up the next day regretting. Come to think of it, it&#8217;s kind of like a trip to Las Vegas.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 6 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/army-of-the-dead-review/\">&#8216;Army of the Dead&#8217; Review: Zack Snyder&#8217;s Zombie Heist Movie is Mindless, Ugly Fun</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/g6xNGVAxG8k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 14:00:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/army-of-the-dead-review-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"180669bdfbcc352f698a2b51a78e472e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-14-684_74b18135c309fa72.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":44261,"destBytes":30628,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/army-of-the-dead-review-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-14-684_74b18135c309fa72.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn57@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-31-631_84b2cdc6f55f8191.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=g6xNGVAxG8k:IEV2pwgk04I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-250_855e99de7494a44d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/g6xNGVAxG8k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn67@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-182_d7fc7cde69649deb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"‘Lupin’ Part 2 Trailer: The Master Thief is Back on Netflix This June","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670833","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670834\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lupin-part-2-e1620746283685-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"lupin part 2 trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lupin-part-2-e1620746283685-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lupin-part-2-e1620746283685-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lupin-part-2-e1620746283685-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lupin-part-2-e1620746283685.jpg 1439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The master thief is returning with a vengeance this June. Netflix has released a new <strong><em>Lupin</em></strong> Part 2 trailer announcing the release date for the next five episodes of the hit French caper series.

But even as a fugitive, Assane, has a flair for the dramatic, unable to resist toying with his enemies and making his homages to the fictional gentleman thief who inspired him, Arsène Lipin.</p>\n<p>In <em>Lupin</em> Part 2, &#8220;Assane&#8217;s quest for revenge against Hubert Pellegrini has torn his family to pieces. With his back to the wall, he now has to think of a new plan, even if it means putting himself in danger.&#8221; Sy is set to reprise his role as Assane Diop, a master criminal driven to a life of thievery to get revenge on the people who framed his Senegalese immigrant father for a crime he didn’t commit. Naturally, he bases his heists on the exploits of the fictional gentleman thief Arsène Lupin.

The show is clearly doubling down on the style that made the first five episodes so fun. <em>Transporter</em> director Louis Leterrier helmed the first three episodes of the series, while Marcela Said (<em>Narcos: Mexico</em>) directed the next two episodes, lending the series a fun sense of style and panache that turned <em>Lupin</em> into Netflix&#8217;s first major hit of 2021. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-lupin/\">I tore through the first five episodes</a> of <em>Lupin</em>, and can&#8217;t wait to see Omar Sy do his thing again (and finally get to use his inherent charm to the fullest extent) in the upcoming Part 2.</p>\n<p><em>Lupin</em> is created by <strong>George Kay</strong> in collaboration with <strong>François Uzan</strong> and produced by Gaumont Télévision.

The dependable, familiar Ed and Lorraine Warren will be back, once again played by the dependable, familiar <strong>Patrick Wilson</strong> and <strong>Vera Farmiga</strong>. But the two previous main <em>Conjuring</em> movies end with Ed and Lorraine banishing evil via some ritual exorcism, while <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em> flips things upside down and gives us an exorcism upfront. And while that might be where the story usually ends, for Ed and Lorraine it&#8217;s just beginning.</p>\n<p>I got to watch the first 11 minutes of <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em>, and talk with the film&#8217;s director <strong>Michael Chaves</strong> about changing things up for a big-budget thrill-ride of a movie while also dealing with the tricky situation of the real-life murder that inspired the film.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670602\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;The design of this is to take <em>The Conjuring</em> and the Warrens into a place they&#8217;ve never gone before, into a direction we&#8217;ve never seen,&#8221; Michael Chaves said before he played the opening scene of <em>The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do</em> <em>It</em>. What followed was an exorcism sequence that isn&#8217;t shy about tipping its hat to the granddaddy of exorcism movies, <em>The Exorcist</em>. There&#8217;s even a moment where a priest steps out of a cab and stands, shrouded in darkness, looking up at a house. It&#8217;s a moment deliberately meant to recall the now-iconic scene of Max von Sydow arriving for the conclusion of William Friedkin&#8217;s horror classic, and Chaves is either bold or courting ridicule to include it here. But he has no regrets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think <em>The Conjuring</em> movies are always these love letters to horror movies and to horror cinema,&#8221; Chaves said. &#8220;You look at the first one and you can see so much of <em>The Changling</em> in it. And I think it does that with great love. And [the <em>Devil Made Me Do It </em>opening scene] was, without a doubt, a shameless <em>Exorcist</em> reference. You know, it&#8217;s funny because I was on the verge of cutting it out. I was like, &#8216;You know what, it&#8217;s too much on the nose.&#8217; People are going to be like, &#8216;You&#8217;re just shamelessly stealing from the greatest movie of all time.&#8217; But I kept it, and I was glad I did because when we started screening it, people loved being able to see those references and make those connections.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From there, the opening moments unveil the exorcism of a demonically possessed child named David Glatzel, played by <strong>Julian Hilliard</strong>. Not only is a priest present for this exorcism, but so are the boy&#8217;s family, and our trusty heroes Ed and Lorraine Warren. But while the Warrens usually triumph over evil in moments like this, this exorcism doesn&#8217;t go so smoothly. Even after all the sound and fury, and rituals, and prayers, and nasty-looking body twisting – which was achieved with a real contortionist, Chaves said, not CGI – the demon still clings to the boy. That&#8217;s where Arne Cheyenne Johnson (<strong>Ruairi O&#8217;Connor</strong>) comes in.</p>\n<p>Arne is dating David&#8217;s older sister Debbie (<strong>Sarah Catherine Hook</strong>), and he&#8217;s present at the exorcism, too. Desperate to help, he grabs hold of the possessed boy and demands the demon take him instead – another <em>Exorcist</em> callback, of course. Witnessing all this, Ed Warren is understandably perturbed, but he&#8217;s not able to intervene in time. The demon seems to finally flee the boy, but now the Warrens are going to have a whole new problem on their hands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the Warrens go on these adventures before, and there&#8217;s the expectation that they&#8217;re going to face the demon,&#8221; Chaves said. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to exorcise that demon by the end of the movie. And from the very beginning, we were like, &#8216;Let&#8217;s just turn that whole idea on its head.&#8217; Let&#8217;s start with that. Start with the thing that you think the movie is going to end with and then have it go horribly wrong. Because there&#8217;s also that expectation that the Warrens – they&#8217;re the good guys, and they always get it right. And they always save the day. And the [opening scene gives us the] idea that it doesn&#8217;t always happen that way, and that&#8217;s not the way life is. And what happens when they get it wrong? What happens when it goes wrong? And that&#8217;s how we wanted to start the movie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here is the part of this story where I tell you all of this really happened. Well&#8230;sort of. All of the <em>Conjuring</em> films so far have boasted that they were &#8220;based on true events,&#8221; and that&#8217;s often <em>partially</em> true. The Warrens were real paranormal investigators and claimed to have worked on countless disturbing cases. And sure enough, the exorcism of David Glatzel happened, and Chaves even included actual audio of that exorcism over the film&#8217;s end credits – and he played it for the cast, too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We played the audio for the cast before we did the exorcism; we played it in that room [where the scene was shot] just to kind of get a sense of the reality of it,&#8221; Chaves said. &#8220;And as much as we want to make this big studio terrifying horror movie, we also want to capture what was real about it, and really understand what was real about it – even if it&#8217;s just through listening to the audio. So we played it in the room and&#8230;it was something where it was just this shared experience, where you&#8217;re sitting around with the people, [and] we&#8217;re recreating this moment. And you&#8217;re looking at everybody, and listening to this recording about what happened, and it&#8217;s really unsettling. You really are like, &#8216;This was real and this family went through this, and this boy went through this.&#8217; [And] I think everybody kind of the temperature in the room just dropped when it played.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-director.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670777\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-director-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-director-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-director-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-director-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-conjuring-3-director.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>An exorcism is one thing, but <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em> has more in store than just that. And that&#8217;s where things get a little tricky and potentially tasteless. In the previous <em>Conjuring</em> films, the cases primarily concern ghosts, with a little demonic action thrown in for good measure. And while those movies involve characters being flung around and scared out of their wits, they almost always come out the other side safe and sound. There&#8217;s no body count.</p>\n<p>But <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em> is a completely different matter. Because Arne Johnson is a real person who really claimed that a demon that was possessing young David jumped out of the boy and into him. And what followed was much more disturbing than a horror movie. Several months after the exorcism, Johnson stabbed his landlord Alan Bono to death with a pocket knife. And things only got stranger from there – when he went to trial for the crime, Johnson&#8217;s defense team argued that their client was innocent of the murder due to demonic possession. As the official synopsis for <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em> states, this was &#8220;the first time in U.S. history that a murder suspect would claim demonic possession as a defense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And that presents an unusual issue for <em>The Devil Made Me Do It</em>. While the other main <em>Conjuring</em> films can play fast and loose with the facts and not worry about offending anyone, this third entry in the main series involves an actual murder. As much as I love these movies, I have to admit it didn&#8217;t exactly sit easy with me, and I specifically asked Chaves how the film intended to balance the act of a real-life tragedy with the fun horror movie thrills we&#8217;ve come to expect from this series. Chaves gave me a very lengthy, very detailed answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This actually started with a real Catholic-approved exorcism that [Arne Johnson] was witness to, and the Warrens were witness to,&#8221; the filmmaker began. &#8220;And he claimed that he became possessed at this event, and he went on a few weeks later to murder his landlord. Now, this went to trial and he claimed demonic possession as his defense. And the Warrens knew him, and they came to his side in this. Up to this point, every case that we&#8217;ve seen every time [that] has been brought to the screen, [there are] no real victims. The Warrens can walk away and the demons been cleared, and that question of what you believe, it can really take a back seat because it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Hey, that was a fun thrill ride!&#8217; And no one was hurt during the process of it. And we can enjoy that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I got that script and I started reading it for the first time, as elated and out-of-my-mind-excited [as I was] to do this movie, I was also conflicted by the fact that there&#8217;s a real victim in this. There&#8217;s a man who lost his life and we&#8217;re not even telling [the story] from that point of view,&#8221; Chaves continued. &#8220;We&#8217;re telling it from the point of view of the man who claimed to be possessed, the man who took his life – the murderer. And from the very beginning, I was like, &#8216;I hope I get this right. And I hope I tell that story fairly.&#8217; Because I don&#8217;t think you can downplay that at all. And if you look on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Arne_Cheyenne_Johnson\">Wikipedia</a> you can see how this trial turned out, and you can see what actually happened. And ultimately, [Johnson] never denied murdering [Alan Bono], and justice ultimately was served. He went to jail and he served his time. And that was also one of the things that I definitely wanted to show in the film, that wherever you stand on this, whatever your belief is, our courts worked, our system worked and justice was served.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chaves concluded: &#8220;Ultimately, this is a <em>Conjuring</em> film, and this is the story of the Warrens, and their experience, and their journey. And they believed this happened, and they believed in Arne Johnson. So they put their careers on the line, and they went to trial and they testified for him. There are always stories about faith. And usually [they are] stories about our faith in God, or the characters&#8217; faith in God. And [this story] is much more about the faith we put in other people. Just like his girlfriend at the time, Debbie Glatzel, who is the sister to David Glatzel, the kid who got exorcised. She was there at the murder and she testified on his behalf. And she married him in jail, and she stayed with him her entire life. She believed him and she stuck by him. And when I was looking at this, I struggled to decide what I believe actually happened, but what I ultimately decided is my belief needs to take a back seat to their story. And ultimately it&#8217;s the story of their faith and the faith they put on each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It <em>opens on <strong>June 4, 2021</strong>.

Only Amanda Knox didn&#8217;t have Matt Damon as a dad knocking down doors and doing everything he can to free his daughter from prison. In <em>Stillwater</em>, Damon plays against type as an oil rig &#8220;roughneck&#8221; from Oklahoma who travels to Marseilles to try to exonerate his daughter. But Damon&#8217;s character is out of his depth — both in the complicated French legal system and in the strange city of Marseilles, which for some reason is depicted like a third-world country in this trailer.</p>\n<p>But despite some of the dicey choices in this film, there&#8217;s still cause for excitement: this is the first dramatic feature from McCarthy since the filmmaker won a couple Oscars (for Best Screenplay and Best Picture) for the acclaimed 2015 journalism drama <em>Spotlight</em>. McCarthy has been dabbling in family films in the years since, writing for <em>Christopher Robin, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms</em>, and writing and directing the Disney family film <em>Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made</em>.</p>\n<p>Starring opposite Damon are Abigail Breslin and Camille Cottin. McCarthy co-wrote the <em>Stillwater</em> screenplay with Marcus Hinchey, Thomas Bidegain, and Noé Debré. The director is also a producer on the project along with Steve Golin, Jonathan King, and Liza Chasin. The movie was originally scheduled for release last fall, but the pandemic caused the movie to be delayed until this summer.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Stillwater</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A dramatic thriller directed by Academy Award® winner Tom McCarthy and starring Matt Damon, <i>Stillwater</i> follows an American oil-rig roughneck from Oklahoma who travels to Marseille to visit his estranged daughter, in prison for a murder she claims she did not commit. Confronted with language barriers, cultural differences, and a complicated legal system, Bill builds a new life for himself in France as he makes it his personal mission to exonerate his daughter.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Focus Features has set <em>Stillwater</em> for theatrical release on <strong>July 30, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stillwater-trailer/\">&#8216;Stillwater&#8217; Trailer: Matt Damon Tries to Exonerate His Daughter in Tom McCarthy&#8217;s New Thriller</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/x9HG39wq7CU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 15:30:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/053_6201_D032_00985_RC-e1620742542128-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"7b272abbe7aa27802722a239ce2d92ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn9@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-14-831_68d9bd7d6150a1c0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":31377,"destBytes":18622,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/053_6201_D032_00985_RC-e1620742542128-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn9@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-14-831_68d9bd7d6150a1c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-31-700_413434aff628d0bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x9HG39wq7CU:OQ1hAT_ehuQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn47@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-092_b54458a872e66c1d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/x9HG39wq7CU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-31-594_15d93d2fda7e3f1e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754327},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"Hulu Wants Their Own ‘The Last Dance,’ Announces Los Angeles Lakers Docuseries","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670692","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670711\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Lakers Docuseries\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s already a series set to dramatize the L.A. Lakers in the works, and now a docuseries is getting in on the action as well. Perhaps realizing they want their own <em>The Last Dance</em>, Hulu has ordered an &#8220;expansive docuseries&#8221; that focuses on the Los Angeles Lakers franchise. The series comes from Lakers&#8217; CEO and controlling owner <strong>Jeanie Buss</strong>, Lakers senior executive<strong> Linda Rambis</strong>, and director <strong>Antoine Fuqua</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670692\"></span></p>\n<p>Hulu made the announcement today, revealing that the nine-part original series – set to premiere in 2022 – &#8220;details the past four decades of the Lakers, and contains colorful and emotional new interviews from over 35 people within the organization, including the Buss family, legendary coaches Pat Riley and Phil Jackson, and NBA Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and team captain Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, among numerous other current and former players. Also featured are interviews with a range of high-profile fans and a treasure trove of archival footage featuring never-before-seen interviews with the Lakers late owner, Jerry Buss.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more info:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Starting from his acquisition of the team in 1979, the docuseries captures Jerry Buss’ remarkable journey to build, sustain and pass on a family-run sports empire. The project will offer a fresh and revealing look inside the legendary “Showtime” era that saw the team win five NBA titles and turned the Forum into Hollywood’s hottest ticket throughout the 1980s. The series also details the high-stakes drama off the court and incredible successes of the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal-led championship teams, as well as the cultural impact of the Lakers franchise and rebirth of the team, culminating with the 2020 NBA championship led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis. At the heart is a story about sports, business and, most of all, family – and how those competing forces must be harnessed to achieve greatness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The series comes from director Antoine Fuqua in association with Fuqua Films, as well as Haven Entertainment and Los Angeles Media Fund. Lakers CEO and controlling owner Jeanie Buss and Lakers senior executive Linda Rambis are involved as well, which immediately makes me a little suspicious. Having the Lakers&#8217; controlling owner directly involved with the docuseries may help with access, but it could also lead any potentially negative material to be quashed before it ever makes it to air.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Dr. Buss bought the Lakers in 1979, he sat alone at center court of the Forum and thought of all the possibilities. But even in his wildest dreams, my father could not have imagined what the next decades would bring for our organization, our league and our city of Los Angeles. I am thrilled that the true story of the Lakers will finally be shared with the world – and that we are in such capable hands with Hulu and Antoine, a director whose storytelling I’ve admired for years,&#8221; said Jeanie Buss.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are proud to bring this docuseries to the world and shed light on the legendary history of the Lakers,&#8221; added Fuqua. &#8220;This expansive look into one of the greatest sports franchises of all time is a project we all feel deeply passionate about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And Belisa Balaban, VP, Original Documentaries, Hulu, said: &#8220;The Los Angeles Lakers are one of sports’ most illustrious franchises. Theirs is a history of epic highs and tragic lows, and generations of legendary players and teams who have made a profound impact, not just on the sports world, but on the culture. We are honored to join Jeanie, Antoine and the whole creative team to bring Hulu viewers the very real inside look at the remarkable story of the rise and fall, and rise again of the Lakers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Buss and Fuqua will executive produce the series alongside Haven Entertainment&#8217;s <strong>Kevin Mann</strong>, <strong>Michael Mann</strong>, and <strong>Brendan Bragg</strong>, Los Angeles Media Fund’s (LAMF) <strong>Jeffrey Soros</strong>, and <strong>Simon Horsman</strong>. The Lakers docuseries is one of two different Lakers-related projects on the way. HBO is making a series about the 1980s Lakers that features Adrien Brody as Pat Riley, Bo Burnham as Larry Bird, Jason Segel as Paul Westhead, and newcomer Quincy Isaiah as Earvin &#8220;Magic&#8221; Johnson.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lakers-docuseries/\">Hulu Wants Their Own &#8216;The Last Dance,&#8217; Announces Los Angeles Lakers Docuseries</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/b1iVt6mggSQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"818b6169a29871bbb6e3a2e3e800264a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn5@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-30-992_7450a6ccb413b48a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":38274,"destBytes":24508,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lakers-Docuseries-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn5@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-30-992_7450a6ccb413b48a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-078_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn11@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-32-287_503a914dd361f460.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-32-473_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b1iVt6mggSQ:8g0BcLI8WNQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-32-273_0283248692001c5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/b1iVt6mggSQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn35@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-32-257_6837e6e0d2114abc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757754326},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:14","title":"Superhero Bits: Mickey Rourke Lashes Out at Marvel, A Mysterious Figure on ‘The Flash’ Movie Set & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670641","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670701 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benaffleck-jimmykimmel-robin-vaxlive-700x311.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Affleck and Jimmy Kimmel at Vax Live\" width=\"700\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benaffleck-jimmykimmel-robin-vaxlive.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benaffleck-jimmykimmel-robin-vaxlive-360x160.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Why is <strong>Mickey Rourke</strong> bashing Marvel while praising <em>Law &#38; Order: SVU</em>?

Plus, its a little annoying that Thanos comes with several interchangeable heads, but most of them don&#8217;t match up with with Iron Gauntlet, which doesn&#8217;t have an alternate hand to swap out. For example, the head that makes it look like Thanos is being dusted doesn&#8217;t make sense if he&#8217;s wearing the Iron Gauntlet. But we have to take what we can get, I guess.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670762 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo3-700x700.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel Legends Avengers: Endgame Action Figures\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo3.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo3-360x360.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-legends-avengers-endgame-action-figures-thanos-vs-iron-man/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo1/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo1-360x360.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Marvel Legends Avengers: Endgame Action Figures\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo1-360x360.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo1.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-legends-avengers-endgame-action-figures-thanos-vs-iron-man/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo2/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo2-360x360.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Marvel Legends Avengers: Endgame Action Figures\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo2-360x360.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvellegends-endgame-finalbattle-ironman-photo2.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n\n<p>The Iron Man figure is a better offering, if only because of the outstanding 3D sculpt of <strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong>&#8216;s likeness as Tony Stark. My only problem is that the suit should look a little more battle damaged, especially since Tony Stark&#8217;s face shows the result of being knocked around by Thanos.</p>\n<p>Anyway, at least both of the figures come with a hand in a snapping pose. That&#8217;s all you really need to recreate the scene in question, and maybe you can use the other interchangeable heads on some of the other Marvel Legends action figures in our collection.</p>\n<p>You can pre-order the Avengers: Endgame action figures two-pack at <a href=\"https://www.entertainmentearth.com/product/hsf0192?id=TO-901297023\" target=\"_blank\"
