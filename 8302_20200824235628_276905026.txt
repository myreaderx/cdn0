The crisis has caused a sharp reduction in trade and significant movements in exchange rates but limited reduction in global current account deficits and surpluses.<span id=\"more-30318\"></span> The outlook remains highly uncertain as the risks of new waves of contagion, capital flow reversals, and a further decline in global trade still loom large on the horizon.</p>\n<p>Our new <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/ESR/Issues/2020/07/28/2020-external-sector-report\">External Sector Report</a> shows that overall current account deficits and surpluses in 2019 were just below 3 percent of world GDP, slightly less than a year earlier. Our latest forecasts for 2020 imply only a further narrowing by some 0.3 percent of world GDP, a more modest decline than after the global financial crisis 10 years ago.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>New trade barriers will not be effective in reducing imbalances.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>The immediate policy priorities are to provide critical relief and promote economic recovery. Once the pandemic abates, reducing the world’s external imbalances will require collective reform efforts by both excess surplus and deficit countries. New trade barriers will not be effective in reducing imbalances.</p>\n<p><strong>Why imbalances matter</strong></p>\n<p>External deficits and surpluses are not necessarily a <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2018/07/24/addressing-global-imbalances-requires-cooperation/\"> cause for concern</a>. There are good reasons for countries to run them at certain points in time. But economies that borrow too much and too quickly from abroad, by running external deficits, may become vulnerable to sudden stops in capital flows. Countries also face risks from investing too much of their savings abroad given investment needs at home. The challenge lies in determining when imbalances are excessive or pose a risk. Our approach focuses on each country’s overall current account balance and not its bilateral trade balances with various trading partners, as the latter mainly reflect the international division of labor rather than macroeconomic factors.</p>\n<p>We estimate that about 40 percent of global current account deficits and surpluses were excessive in 2019 and, as in recent years, concentrated in advanced economies. Larger-than-warranted current account balances were mostly in the euro area (driven by Germany and the Netherlands) with lower-than-warranted current account balances mainly existing among Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. China’s assessed external position remained, as in 2018, broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies, due to offsetting policy gaps and structural distortions.</p>\n<p>Our report offers individual economy assessments of external imbalances and exchange rates for the 30 largest economies. Over time, these imbalances have accumulated, with the stocks of external assets and liabilities now at historic highs, potentially raising risks for both debtor and creditor countries. The persistence of global imbalances and mounting perceptions of an uneven playing field for trade has fueled protectionist sentiments, leading to a rise in trade tensions between the US and China. Overall, many countries had pre-existing vulnerabilities and remaining policy distortions heading into the crisis.<img class=\"wp-image-30320 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1-200x234.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1-257x300.png 257w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1-400x468.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1-600x702.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1.png 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>COVID-19: An intense external shock</strong></p>\n<p>With the world economy still grappling with the COVID-19 crisis, the external outlook is highly uncertain. Even though we forecast a slight narrowing of global imbalances in 2020, the situation varies around the world. Economies dependent on severely affected sectors, such as oil and tourism, or reliant on remittances, could see a fall in their current account balances exceeding 2 percent of GDP. Such intense external shocks may have lasting effects and require significant economic adjustments. At the global level, our forecasts imply a more limited narrowing in current account balances than after the global financial crisis a decade ago, which partly reflects the smaller, precrisis global imbalances this time than during the housing and asset price booms of the mid-2000s.</p>\n<p>Early in the COVID-19 crisis, tighter external financing conditions triggered sudden capital outflows with sharp currency depreciations across numerous emerging market and developing economies. The exceptionally strong fiscal and monetary policy responses, especially in advanced economies, have promoted a recovery in global investor sentiment since then, with some unwind of the initial sharp currency movements. But many risks remain, including new waves of contagion, economic scarring, and renewed trade tensions.</p>\n<p>Another bout of global financial stress could trigger more capital flow reversals, currency pressures, and further raise the risk of an external crisis for economies with preexisting vulnerabilities, such as large current account deficits, a high share of foreign currency debt, and limited international reserves, as highlighted in this year’s analytical chapter. A worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic could also dislocate global trade and supply chains, reduce investment, and hinder the global economic recovery.<img class=\"wp-image-30321  aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-924x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"686\" height=\"761\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-200x222.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-271x300.png 271w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-400x443.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-600x665.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-768x851.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-800x886.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-924x1024.png 924w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-1200x1329.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Providing relief and rebalancing the world economy</strong></p>\n<p>Policy efforts in the near term should continue to focus on providing lifelines and promoting economic recovery. Countries with flexible exchange rates would benefit from continuing to allow them to adjust in response to external conditions, where feasible. Foreign exchange intervention, where needed and where reserves are adequate, could help alleviate disorderly market conditions. For economies facing disruptive balance of payments pressures and without access to private external financing, official financing and swap lines can help provide economic relief and preserve critical health care spending.</p>\n<p>Tariff and nontariff barriers to trade should be avoided, especially on medical equipment and supplies, and recent new restrictions on trade rolled back. Using tariffs to target bilateral trade balances is costly for trade and growth, and tends to trigger offsetting currency movements. Tariffs are also generally ineffective for reducing excess external imbalances and currency misalignments, which requires addressing underlying macroeconomic and structural distortions. Modernizing the multilateral rules-based trading system and strengthening rules on subsidies and technology transfer is warranted, including by expanding the rule book on services and e-commerce and ensuring a well-functioning WTO dispute settlement system.</p>\n<p>Over the medium term, reducing excess imbalances in the global economy will require joint efforts on the part of both excess surplus and excess deficit countries. Economic and policy distortions that predated the COVID-19 crisis might persist or worsen, suggesting the need for reforms tailored to country-specific circumstances.</p>\n<p>In economies where excess current account deficits before the crisis reflected larger-than-desirable fiscal deficits (as in the United States) and where such imbalances persist, fiscal consolidation over the medium term would promote debt sustainability, reduce the excess current account gap, and facilitate raising international reserves where needed (as in Argentina). Countries with export competitiveness challenges would benefit from productivity-raising reforms.</p>\n<p>In economies where excess current account surpluses that existed before the crisis persist, prioritizing reforms that encourage investment and discourage excessive private saving are warranted. In economies with remaining fiscal space, a growth-oriented fiscal policy would strengthen economic resilience and narrow the excess current account surplus. In some cases, reforms to discourage excessive precautionary saving may also be warranted (as in Thailand and Malaysia) including by expanding the social safety net.</p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/45228659001/rkPdEdoaW_default/index.html?videoId=6178099914001\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 13:00:10 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1.png","linkMd5":"c9798219f8cf6a66a1f2ffccc7af802a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-56-14-515_078dd72346023e66.webp","destWidth":650,"destHeight":760,"sourceBytes":87872,"destBytes":46084,"author":"IMFBlog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REVISED-eng-esr-blog-july-30-chart-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-56-14-515_078dd72346023e66.webp","https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-esr-blog-july-29-chart-2-924x1024.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-27-867_c45d635d4931fd62.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"Impact of Conflict and Political Instability on Banking Crises in Developing Economies","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=29921","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/montfort-mlachila/\"> Montfort Mlachila </a> and<a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/rasmane-ouedraogo/\"> Rasmane Ouedraogo </a></p>\n<p>While the economic effects of conflict and political instability have been analyzed extensively, much less attention has been paid to how banks are affected.<span id=\"more-29921\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/02/28/The-Impact-of-Conflict-and-Political-Instability-on-Banking-Crises-in-Developing-Countries-49047\"> Our IMF staff paper </a> addresses this gap by investigating whether rising conflict and political instability globally over the past several decades has led to more banking crises in developing countries.

In Central African Republic, bank nonperforming loans increased to more than one-third of total loans and some banks became undercapitalized following the outbreak of the conflict in 2013.</p>\n<p>The primary channel of transmission is the occurrence of fiscal crises following a conflict or political instability. Conflicts and political instability can have a negative impact on the productive capacity of a country and this in turn can reduce government revenue and increase unproductive spending, including military expenditures, leading to fiscal crises. This can also lead to government dysfunctionality and weakening of institutions.</p>\n<p>Governments facing conflict and/or political instability need to address their root causes and try to mitigate their negative effects with the appropriate design and implementation of economic policies. Creating adequate fiscal space in normal times can reduce the likelihood of fiscal crises and in turn lower the probability of systemic banking crises.</p>\n<p>Our findings also suggest that policymakers should pay attention to conflicts in neighboring countries even if they themselves are not conflict-afflicted as their banking systems may suffer negative spillovers from their neighbors given that banks operate across borders.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:00:09 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-conflict-blog-chart-1july-27.png","linkMd5":"7fb6f3a01c4b6752068a994a57d39e42","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-16-507_83c584d4a6627a26.webp","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":1178,"sourceBytes":132416,"destBytes":54844,"author":"IMFBlog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-conflict-blog-chart-1july-27.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-16-507_83c584d4a6627a26.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"Chart of the WeekAging Economies May Benefit Less from Fiscal Stimulus","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30366","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/jiro-honda/\">Jiro Honda</a> and <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sites.google.com_site_hiroswebsite_&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=G8CoXqdZ57E1EOn2t2CVrg&#38;r=k0Ecz7FhipZK4A_BZ6YtlQ&#38;m=776ypdGCz6RfL7C1y45sZ9Mt3mTorodgdqctB6HTSQQ&#38;s=hvEb0aEiwEGhLMnEsbqxKzQEoRMIEHFTsC5DKwS08jw&#38;e=\"> Hiroaki Miyamoto </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ja/News/Articles/2020/08/17/chart-of-the-week-aging-economies-may-benefit-less-from-fiscal-stimulus\">日本語</a></p>\n<p>In the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers around the world are undertaking fiscal stimulus—a combination of spending increases and tax reductions—to support their economies. <span id=\"more-30366\"></span>Even before the present crisis, the importance of fiscal policy has been increasing, with monetary policy constrained by near-zero interest rates. Our <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/06/12/Would-Population-Aging-Change-the-Output-Effects-of-Fiscal-Policy-49274\"> new staff research </a> <u> </u> finds that age also matters when considering fiscal stimulus. Specifically, we find that fiscal policy isn’t as effective in boosting growth in economies with older populations, compared to economies with younger populations.</p>\n<p>As our chart shows, fiscal stimulus in economies with a younger population has a significantly positive effect on growth, but the effect is much weaker in aging economies. We looked at 17 <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> countries from 1985 to 2017, and split the sample into two groups by looking at the ratio of old people among population. In the aging economies, the average old-age dependency ratio (defined as the ratio of people 65 and older to those between 15 and 64 years old) is 26.5 percent whereas in non-aging economies it is 18.9 percent.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30367 \" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-966x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"737\" height=\"782\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-200x212.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-283x300.png 283w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-400x424.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-600x636.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-768x814.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-800x848.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-966x1024.png 966w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-1200x1272.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px\" /></p>\n<p>On a more granular level, an aging economy behaves this way because its labor force isn’t growing, while its public debt tends to be high, and, therefore, fiscal stimulus has weaker effects on private consumption and investment. This is because the working age population is more likely than retirees to benefit from fiscal stimulus through effects such as increased corporate hiring. Furthermore, many pensioners are on fixed incomes whose consumption remains steady or even declines over time. In addition, population aging could reduce potential growth (by lowering labor input and productivity), with which fiscal stimulus may induce less private investment. The “older” the economy and the higher its debt, the less impact fiscal stimulus has on growth.</p>\n<p>These findings complement existing observations that countries with aging populations have relatively low growth and higher public debt. Yet our findings are especially important because old-age dependency ratios have been rising for several decades and are projected to increase further. Within the next 30 years, more than 20 countries across the world would exceed the old-age dependency ratio of 50 percent—an unprecedented level in global history—with some even reaching 70 percent.</p>\n<p>In other words, population aging is posing significant challenges to policymakers. How can we support aggregate demand with the weaker growth impact of fiscal stimulus in aging economies? The paper draws the following implications for policymakers to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A larger fiscal stimulus may be required to support aggregate demand during recessions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given the lower output effects of fiscal stimulus, other economic policies (including structural reforms) would need to play a more important role in supporting domestic demand. Policy measures to enhance labor supply (for example, through stronger female labor force participation or labor market needs-based immigration) would help increase the output effects in aging societies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secure sufficiently large fiscal space (room to raise spending or lower taxes more than previously planned, without endangering debt sustainability or access to capital markets) during booms, in order to prepare for a larger fiscal stimulus during recessions, without creating concerns for fiscal sustainability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 14:00:06 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-966x1024.png","linkMd5":"23855ba654914ac5b1efda2c80ad4a48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-16-169_13f8be24915a7c7b.webp","destWidth":966,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":453376,"destBytes":57414,"author":"IMFBlog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-fiscal-stimulus-cotw-aug-3-chart-1-966x1024.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-16-169_13f8be24915a7c7b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"Transparency Makes Central Banks More Effective and Trusted","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30300","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/tobias-adrian/\">Tobias Adrian</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/ghiath-shabsigh/\">Ghiath Shabsigh</a>, and <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/ashraf-khan/\">Ashraf Khan</a></p> \n<p><span lang=\"ES\"><a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30300/.https://www.imf.org/ar/News/Articles/2020/07/30/blog-transparency-makes-central-banks-more-effective-trusted\"><span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SA\">عربي</span></a></span>,<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/zh/News/Articles/2020/07/20/blog-the-covid-19-gender-gap\">&nbsp;</a> <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/zh/News/Articles/2020/07/30/blog-transparency-makes-central-banks-more-effective-trusted\">中文</a>, <a href=\"https://blog-dialogoafondo.imf.org/?p=13851\">Español</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ja/News/Articles/2020/07/30/blog-transparency-makes-central-banks-more-effective-trusted\">日本語</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ru/News/Articles/2020/07/30/blog-transparency-makes-central-banks-more-effective-trusted\">Русский&nbsp;</a></p> \n<p>The role and mandates of central banks have become broader and more complex since the 2008 global financial crisis. <span id=\"more-30300\"></span>The unconventional nature and growing scale of interventions (as seen again during the COVID-19 pandemic) have brought on much higher scrutiny. More transparency and accountability are required to maintain public support, safeguard independence, and enhance policy effectiveness.</p> \n<p>The IMF has developed a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2020/07/29/The-Central-Bank-Transparency-Code-49619\">Central Bank Transparency Code</a> to help member countries answer these demands and increase trust and support. It aims to facilitate more effective communication between central banks and their various stakeholders, reducing uncertainty and contributing to better policy choices.</p> \n<div class=\"blockquote\"> \n <p><strong>More transparency and accountability are required to maintain public support to central banks, safeguard independence and enhance policy effectiveness.</strong></p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Accountability and effectiveness</strong></p> \n<p>Central banks have been engaging in a growing list of activities. More of them have taken over supervision and other financial stability functions, for example. Transparency is an instrument to facilitate accountability, allowing the public to better understand how these actions serve their best interest and are consistent with existing mandates, with the ultimate goal of increasing effectiveness. The increasing responsibilities and significant expansion of balance sheets have led to a <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2019/11/25/central-bank-accountability-independence-and-transparency/#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%2C%20the%20IMF,and%20interaction%20with%20key%20stakeholders.\"> stronger demand for central banks </a> to better explain what they do, how, and why. This is especially important as their independence has come under scrutiny in many countries. In central bank parlance, transparency and accountability become the collateral guarantee of independence.</p> \n<p>The new code is part of the IMF’s broader focus on issues of accountability and governance.</p> \n<p>A voluntary code, it allows central banks to measure transparency in five key areas or “pillars:” governance, policies, operations, outcomes, and official relations. Under each pillar, the code provides a list of best practices from “core” to “expanded” to “comprehensive” for key functions such as monetary or macroprudential policy.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-30302 \" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-1022x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"957\" height=\"959\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-66x66.png 66w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-200x200.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-300x300.png 300w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-400x401.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-600x601.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-768x769.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-800x801.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-1022x1024.png 1022w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-1200x1202.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px\" /></p> \n<p>This range of practices takes into account the immense diversity of the IMF’s 189 members central banks in terms of legal frameworks, governance arrangements, and levels of economic and financial development. Each central bank and its stakeholders can determine if transparency is balanced in practice and within each country’s specific circumstances. Importantly, it is designed not to be a ranking tool and steers clear of expressing preferences or making recommendations about mandate, institutional setups, or governance procedures.</p> \n<p>The code acknowledges that transparency is not an absolute goal or an end in itself. Central banks have legitimate reasons for delaying or withholding publication of market sensitive data, financial stability considerations, and personal data. Confidentiality is particularly relevant for foreign exchange interventions, reserve management, supervisory decisions on individual institutions, and emergency liquidity assistance. The code contains appropriate qualifications and outlines the general principle that central banks should develop clear policies explaining and justifying what is kept confidential.</p> \n<p><strong>Dialogue with stakeholders</strong></p> \n<p>The preparation of the transparency code involved extensive consultations with central banks, monetary unions, and international financial institutions and standard-setting bodies. In particular, it received extensive input from 73 central banks representing diverse regional and economic development backgrounds. An advisory panel formed by eminent academics and former governors provided additional perspective and practical experience.</p> \n<p>One concern was for the code to be applicable for all countries and different central banks, regardless of their income level, exchange rate regime, or geographical location. The code was conceived so that assessments can be done in full or with a subset of principles and practices best applicable to specific circumstances. IMF staff can assist with the evaluations, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for designing targeted capacity development programs. To help with implementation, several pilot assessments will be conducted over the coming years.</p> \n<p>Flexibility and attention to individual circumstances were commended by member countries’ representatives in the IMF Executive Board. On approving the code in mid-July, they said in a<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/30/pr20258-imf-executive-board-approves-new-central-bank-transparency-code\"> statement</a> that it is a “timely and useful tool for central banks to guide their transparency practices and strengthen accountability, ensuring more effective policy outcomes and better-informed dialogue with stakeholders.”</p> \n<p>Developed with and for central banks, the IMF transparency code will help them to continue playing their crucial roles in a manner that maintains and strengthens support from their stakeholders and society at large. As central banks are once again called to step up their actions, it is critical to continue building trust and credibility with the citizens they ultimately serve.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:00:13 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-1022x1024.png","linkMd5":"2875672d04630de58e1aafed6457c3f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-56-16-596_32c6b9ff484b27ee.webp","destWidth":1022,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":615602,"destBytes":59244,"author":"IMFBlog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-central-bank-transparency-blog-july-24-chart-1-1022x1024.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-56-16-596_32c6b9ff484b27ee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"Corruption and COVID-19","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30267","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/26101-2/\">Vitor Gaspar</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/martin-muhleisen/\">Martin Mühleisen</a>, and <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/26101-2/\">Rhoda Weeks-Brown</a></p>\n<p><span lang=\"ES\"><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ar/News/Articles/2020/07/27/blog-corruption-and-covid-19\"><span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SA\">عربي</span></a></span>,<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/zh/News/Articles/2020/07/20/blog-the-covid-19-gender-gap\"><u> </u></a> <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/zh/News/Articles/2020/07/27/blog-corruption-and-covid-19\">中文</a>, <a href=\"https://blog-dialogoafondo.imf.org/?p=13823\">Español</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/fr/News/Articles/2020/07/27/blog-corruption-and-covid-19\">Français</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ja/News/Articles/2020/07/27/blog-corruption-and-covid-19\">日本語</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/pt/News/Articles/2020/07/27/blog-corruption-and-covid-19\">Português</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ru/News/Articles/2020/07/27/blog-corruption-and-covid-19\">Русский </a></p>\n<p>Corruption, the abuse of public office for private gain, is about more than wasted money: it erodes the social contract and corrodes the government’s ability to help grow the economy in a way that benefits all citizens. <span id=\"more-30267\"></span>Corruption was a problem before the crisis, but the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/blog/the-imf-on-corruption-and-covid-19\"> stronger governance </a> for three reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, governments around the world are playing a bigger role in the economy to combat the pandemic and provide economic lifelines to people and firms. This expanded role is crucial but it also <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2020/04/30/how-imf-covid19-financial-help-is-used\"> increases opportunities for corruption.</a> To help ensure the money and measures are helping the people who need it most, governments need timely and transparent reporting, ex-post audits and accountability procedures, and close cooperation with civil society and the private sector.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Governments are playing a bigger role in the economy and this increases opportunities for corruption.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, as public finances worsen, countries need to prevent tax evasion and the waste and loss of funds caused by <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2019/05/28/corruption-and-your-money/\"> corruption in public spending</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, crises test people’s trust in government and institutions, and ethical behavior becomes more salient when medical services are in such high demand. Evidence of <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2019/04/04/tackling-corruption-in-government/\"> corruption </a> could undermine a country’s ability to respond effectively to the crisis, deepening the economic impact, and threatening a loss of political and social cohesion.</p>\n<p>During this crisis the IMF hasn’t taken its eye off the ball of our governance and anti-corruption work. Our message to all governments has been clear: <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/15/fiscal-policies-to-contain-the-damage-from-covid-19/\"> spend whatever you need but keep the receipts</a>, because we don’t want accountability to be lost in the process.</p>\n<p>In our lending work, we have provided quick disbursements to meet urgent needs. At the same time, enhanced governance measures to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/covid19-special-notes/enspecial-series-on-covid19budget-execution-controls-to-mitigate-corruption-risk-in-pandemic-spendin.ashx?la=en\"> track COVID-19 related spending </a> have been part of the emergency financing for countries to fight the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Borrowing countries have committed to (i) undertake and publish independent ex-post audits of crisis-related spending and (ii) publish crisis-related procurement contracts on the government’s website, including identifying the companies awarded the contract and their beneficial owners. The IMF also ensured that emergency resources are subject to the IMF’s <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/Safeguards-Assessments-Documents#sort=@imfdate%20descending\"> Safeguards Assessment </a> policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term reform beyond the crisis</strong></p>\n<p>Governance safeguards for emergency assistance related to COVID-19 are part of a more comprehensive effort by the IMF to improve its member countries good governance and efforts to tackle corruption.</p>\n<p>The IMF has significantly increased its focus on governance and corruption over the last few years. We adopted in 2018 an enhanced <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/04/21/pr18142-imf-board-approves-new-framework-for-enhanced-engagement-on-governance\"> framework</a> designed to make our work with countries more candid, evenhanded, and effective. This laid the foundation for our COVID-19 policy and lending response, where stronger governance matters even more.</p>\n<p>We recently assessed our progress in recent years and published the findings in a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2020/07/15/Progress-In-Implementing-The-Framework-For-Enhanced-Fund-Engagement-On-Governance-49576\"> staff analysis</a>. Here are the key highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We speak more candidly and in-depth about governance issues with countries. Text mining analysis shows that we increased coverage of governance and corruption issues in our annual assessments of countries’ economic health and in our lending programs. Governance-related references more than doubled in staff reports in the 18 months after the IMF approved the framework, compared with 2017. In 2019, the IMF discussed governance with countries four times more than the average over the prior ten years. Just recently—for instance—our surveillance work has focused on central bank governance and operations in Liberia, financial sector oversight in Moldova, and the anti-corruption framework in Mexico. Fund staff are proposing more concrete governance and anti-corruption recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IMF-supported lending programs include specific conditionality related to governance and anti-corruption reforms, with governance improvements now being a core objective of many programs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have stepped up technical assistance and training to help countries strengthen governance and anti-corruption efforts. We aim to help countries improve governance in areas such as tax administration, expenditure oversight, fiscal transparency, financial sector oversight, anti-corruption institutions, and asset declarations for senior officials. This includes governance diagnostic missions to a dozen countries, comprising detailed analysis of governance weaknesses based on legal frameworks and proposing prioritized solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moreover, so far, ten advanced economies—Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have participated in the voluntary assessment of their national frameworks to limit opportunities for transnational corruption. The purpose of the assessments, conducted by the IMF, is to determine the degree to which a country does two things: (1) criminalizes and prosecutes bribery of foreign public officials and (2) prevents foreign officials from concealing corrupt proceeds in its own financial system or domestic economy. The IMF strongly encourages member countries to volunteer for such coverage in its annual economic health checks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Curbing corruption requires government ownership of reforms, international cooperation, and a joint effort with civil society and the private sector. It also involves political will and the assiduous implementation of reforms over months and years.</p>\n<p>This crisis will sharpen our focus on governance in the years ahead because of the pandemic’s devastating effects and costs for people and economies. Countries can’t afford to lose precious resources at the best of times, and even less so during and after the pandemic. If ever there was a time for anti-corruption reforms, it is now.</p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"//players.brightcove.net/45228659001/rkPdEdoaW_default/index.html?videoId=6174530233001\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:00:07 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"87cf94017e3a1b817bde59769956d1e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"IMFBlog","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"Top 10 Blogs on COVID-19","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30378","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/\">IMFBlog</a></p>\n<p>The pandemic has altered people’s lives in both enormous and small ways.

That could erode part of the 7 percent overall current account surplus the country had in 2019.</p>\n<p>The outlook for smaller, tourism-dependent nations is even more stark. This chart and the External Sector Report focus on medium to large economies, but, under the same scenario, some smaller states especially reliant on tourism could see a dramatically larger direct impact on their trade and current account balances.</p>\n<p>Still, the overall effect a decline in tourism will have on current account balances may be less than these projected direct impacts foretell. Smaller, tourism dependent countries and even larger economies with a large tourism industry may see offsetting indirect effects. For example, smaller nations with less domestic resources often rely on more imports to support their tourism industries. A drop in tourism exports and the economic activity that it drives, both directly and indirectly, will lead to a corresponding drop in imports—lessening the overall impact on the current account balance.</p>\n<p>Much is still unknown about the pace of tourism recovery in 2020. Peoples’ desire and ability to travel abroad may continue to face headwinds going into 2021 due to the ongoing pandemic, leaving an uncertain outlook for tourism industries in economies both big and small.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:00:15 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-tourism-cotw-aug-17-chart-1-944x1024.png","linkMd5":"a1eec2aa57c1a30c9e78fe8087468ca0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-15-689_f48ae3248a1bac47.webp","destWidth":944,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":519601,"destBytes":71020,"author":"IMFBlog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-tourism-cotw-aug-17-chart-1-944x1024.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-15-689_f48ae3248a1bac47.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"COVID-19 Response in Emerging Market Economies: Conventional Policies and Beyond","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30351","description":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/martin-muhleisen/\">Martin Mühleisen</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/tryggvi-gudmundsson/\">Tryggvi Gudmundsson</a>, and <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/helene-poirson-ward/\">Hélène Poirson Ward</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0066cc;\"><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ar/News/Articles/2020/08/06/blog-covid-19-response-in-emerging-market-economies-conventional-policies-and-beyond\"> <span lang=\"ES\"><span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SA\">عربي</span></span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/zh/News/Articles/2020/08/06/blog-covid-19-response-in-emerging-market-economies-conventional-policies-and-beyond\">中文</a>, <a href=\"https://blog-dialogoafondo.imf.org/?p=13922\">Español</a>,</span> <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/fr/News/Articles/2020/08/06/blog-covid-19-response-in-emerging-market-economies-conventional-policies-and-beyond\">Français</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ja/News/Articles/2020/08/06/blog-covid-19-response-in-emerging-market-economies-conventional-policies-and-beyond\">日本語</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/pt/News/Articles/2020/08/06/blog-covid-19-response-in-emerging-market-economies-conventional-policies-and-beyond\">Português</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/ru/News/Articles/2020/08/06/blog-covid-19-response-in-emerging-market-economies-conventional-policies-and-beyond\">Русский </a></p>\n<p>The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emerging market economies far exceeded that of the global financial crisis. Unlike previous crises, the response has been decisive just like in advanced economies. <span id=\"more-30351\"></span>Yet, conventional policies are reaching their limit and unorthodox policies are not without risks.</p>\n<p><strong>A pandemic still unfolding </strong></p>\n<p>COVID-19 is still to play out fully in the emerging market universe (see chart for country list), posing risks to both people and economies. While countries such as China, Uruguay, and Vietnam have managed to contain the virus, others such as Brazil, India, and South Africa continue to grapple with a rise in infections.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Emerging markets are likely to face an uphill battle.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>The economic impact has been even more severe as emerging market economies were buffeted by multiple shocks. Compounding the effects of domestic containment measures has been a decline in external demand. Particularly hit are tourism-dependent countries due to a decline in travel and oil exporters as commodity prices plummeted. With global trade and oil prices projected to drop by more than 10 percent and 40 percent respectively, emerging market economies are likely to face an uphill battle. This is even as capital outflows have stabilized and sovereign spreads retreated compared to the sharply volatile market conditions seen in March.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the IMF’s latest <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/06/24/WEOUpdateJune2020\"> June <em>World Economic Outlook </em>Update </a> projects emerging market economies to <em>shrink</em> by 3.2 percent this year—the largest drop for this group on record. By way of comparison, in the global financial crisis, growth for the group took a significant hit but still bottomed out at a <em>positive</em> 2.6 percent in 2009.</p>\n<p><strong>A decisive policy response</strong></p>\n<p>The crisis would have been worse still without the extraordinary policy support. For sure, decisive policy actions in advanced economies led to a turnaround in market conditions that allowed emerging market economies to resume external financing efforts in April and May, which contributed to record levels of bond issuance so far this year—to the tune of $124 billion as of the end of June. But not all countries have seen improved fortunes. Fuel exporters, frontier countries and those with high debt are experiencing a greater financial shock that pushed up borrowing costs, or even worse, denied them further access to markets.</p>\n<p>Policy support by advanced economies provided emerging market economy policymakers with wiggle room to soften the economic blow. Unlike previous episodes, where emerging market economies tended to tighten policy to avoid rapid capital outflows and the inflationary effect of exchange rate depreciations, the current crisis has seen emerging market economies’ policy reaction more in line with that of advanced economies (see the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19\"> IMF’s policy tracker</a>). Most emerging market economies used reserve buffers more sparingly and allowed exchange rates to adjust to a larger extent, while many countries injected liquidity as needed to ensure market functioning. Countries like Poland and Indonesia further eased macroprudential policies to support credit.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30353 \" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-947x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"706\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-200x216.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-277x300.png 277w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-400x433.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-600x649.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-768x831.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-800x865.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-947x1024.png 947w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-1200x1298.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px\" /></p>\n<p>Like their more advanced peers, many emerging market economies, including Thailand, Mexico, and South Africa, eased monetary policy during this cycle. In a few cases, limited room to cut policy rates further and distressed market conditions induced use of unconventional monetary policy measures for the first time. These included purchases of government and corporate bonds, although the amounts remain modest so far compared to the larger advanced economies. Conversely, the use of capital flow measures to deter capital outflows has been quite limited so far.</p>\n<p>A similar picture is evident on the fiscal policy front. Emerging market economies have relaxed their fiscal stance in an attempt to tackle the health crisis, support people and firms, and offset the economic shocks. While more modest than that of advanced economies, these efforts were significantly greater than during the global financial crisis.</p>\n<p><strong>From conventional to unorthodox policies</strong></p>\n<p>Despite these actions, the outlook for emerging market economies remains clouded by considerable uncertainty. Chief among many risks is the possibility of a more prolonged health crisis, which would hurt more lives and could have dire economic consequences. Confronting a more severe downturn will be challenging because most emerging markets entered the current crisis with limited room for traditional fiscal, monetary, and external policy support. And much policy room has already been used up by actions undertaken in recent months.</p>\n<p>Dwindling policy space may force some countries to take recourse to more unorthodox measures. From price controls and trade restrictions to more unconventional monetary policy and steps to ease credit and financial regulation. Some of these measures—which are also being implemented by some advanced and low-income economies—have significant costs, particularly if used intensively. Export restrictions, for example, could seriously distort the multilateral trading system, and price controls hamper the flow of goods to those who need it most.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of other unorthodox policies will depend on the credibility of the institutions; for instance, whether a country has a track record of credible monetary policy. As we navigate the contours of the ongoing crisis, little time is available to properly analyze the risks and benefits of these actions in a careful manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Not out of the woods yet</strong></p>\n<p>Emerging market economies have navigated the first phase of the crisis relatively well, but the next phase could be much more challenging. The virus remains present, financial conditions are still fragile, and policy space is lower, particularly for those countries facing high risks to debt sustainability. The latter group of countries is quite large. Approximately one third of all emerging market economies entered the crisis with high-debt levels and are assessed to have no space for undertaking additional discretionary fiscal policy, or as having that space significantly at risk.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30354 \" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-1024x948.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"775\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-200x185.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-300x278.png 300w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-400x370.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-600x556.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-768x711.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-800x741.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-1024x948.png 1024w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-1200x1111.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>As the crisis develops, there is also a high risk that liquidity problems morph into solvency concerns. Besides sovereign debt stresses, corporate default risks are alarmingly high in a number of emerging market economies. Moreover, the crisis has hit poor people much harder, and this increase in inequality will amplify policy challenge in many countries.</p>\n<p>The complexity of these challenges requires a multi-faceted policy response. First, domestic policies will need to be designed to allow for more durable and inclusive growth. Second, increased support from bilateral and multilateral lenders will be required where market access remains precarious. So far, the IMF has provided 22 emerging market economies with approximately $72 billion (SDR 52 billion) in <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/COVID-Lending-Tracker\"> financial assistance</a>. Finally, for countries where debts prove to be unsustainable, timely and durable resolution of these problems will be needed, by seeking broad burden sharing across creditors including in the private sector. The latter two policy angles will be analyzed in two subsequent blogs on IMF lending and the IMF’s role in debt resolution.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 14:00:12 +0000","feedId":8302,"bgimg":"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-947x1024.png","linkMd5":"8a9b97759cbe7eef60c40cc17ceb5120","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn6@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-16-923_e074ab15366210e4.webp","destWidth":947,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":530721,"destBytes":63630,"author":"IMFBlog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-1-947x1024.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn6@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-16-923_e074ab15366210e4.webp","https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eng-covid-emerging-markets-blog-aug-3-chart-2-1024x948.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-56-26-595_b18e9084cb93cfc1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313366329},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:06","title":"Chart of the WeekUnemployment in Today’s Recession Compared to the Global Financial Crisis","link":"https://blogs.imf.org/?p=30253","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/bloggers/ippei-shibata/\">Ippei Shibata</a></p>\n<p>There has been much discussion in recent months about how workers who transitioned to working from home—and those who were deemed “essential”—are less affected by the layoffs and job losses brought on by lockdowns than are workers in “social” jobs that require closer human interaction, like restaurant workers. <span id=\"more-30253\"></span>However, our <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/06/19/The-Distributional-Impact-of-Recessions-the-Global-Financial-Crisis-and-the-Pandemic-49492\"> new IMF staff research </a> suggests that this does not tell the full story.</p>\n<p>In particular, we find that while teleworkable jobs are indeed more secure than non-teleworkable occupations during the current pandemic-related recession, this pattern has also been observed during the global financial crisis of 2007–09—meaning that something more than pandemic-related restrictions is at play.<img class=\"wp-image-30254  aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-880x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"629\" height=\"732\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-200x233.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-258x300.png 258w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-400x465.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-600x698.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-768x893.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-800x930.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-880x1024.png 880w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1-1200x1396.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-unemployment-july-20-chart-1.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px\" /></p>\n<p>As the chart shows, unemployment has increased less for teleworkable occupations during both recessions.

It finds that young and low-skilled workers have always been harmed more in recessions, while women and Hispanics are more severely affected during the current recession.

What is good for women is ultimately good for addressing income inequality, economic growth, and resilience.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>It is crucial that policymakers adopt measures to limit the scarring effects of the pandemic on women.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>Why has COVID-19 had disproportionate effects on women and their economic status? There are several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, women are more likely than men to work in social sectors &#8212; such as services industries, retail, tourism, and hospitality &#8212; that require face-to-face interactions. These sectors are hit hardest by social distancing and mitigation measures. In the United States, unemployment among women was two percentage points higher than men between April-June 2020.</p>\n<p>Because of the nature of their jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. In the United States, about 54 percent of women working in social sectors cannot telework. In Brazil, it is 67 percent. In low-income countries, at most only about 12 percent of the population is able to work remotely.<img class=\" wp-image-30261 aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"642\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-200x206.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-291x300.png 291w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-400x412.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-600x618.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-768x792.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-800x825.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-993x1024.png 993w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1-1200x1237.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-1-1.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" /></p>\n<p>Second, women are more likely than men to be employed in the informal sector in low-income countries. Informal employment – often compensated in cash with no official oversight – leaves women with lower pay, no protection of labor laws, and no benefits such as pensions or health insurance.</p>\n<p>The livelihoods of informal workers have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. In Colombia, women’s poverty has increased by 3.3 percent because of the shutdown in economic activities. The UN <a href=\"https://www.care-international.org/files/files/enlac_rga_report_english_final_junio2_1comprimido.pdf\"> estimates </a> that the pandemic will increase the number of people living in poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean by 15.9 million, bringing the total number of people living in poverty to 214 million, many of them women and girls.<img class=\"wp-image-30222  aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-869x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"742\" srcset=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-200x236.png 200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-255x300.png 255w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-400x471.png 400w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-600x707.png 600w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-768x905.png 768w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-800x943.png 800w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-869x1024.png 869w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2-1200x1414.png 1200w, https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eng-covid-and-gender-blog-july-1-chart-2.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></p>\n<p>Third, women tend to do more unpaid household work than men, about <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/10/15/Reducing-and-Redistributing-Unpaid-Work-Stronger-Policies-to-Support-Gender-Equality-48688\">2.7 hours per day more</a> to be exact. They bear the brunt of family care responsibilities resulting from shutdown measures such as school closures and precautions for vulnerable elderly parents. After shutdown measures have been lifted, women are slower to return to full employment. In Canada, the May <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200605/dq200605a-eng.htm\"> job report </a> shows that women’s employment increased by 1.1 percent compared with 2.4 percent for men, as childcare issues persist. Furthermore, among parents with at least one child under the age of 6, men were roughly three times more likely to have returned to work than women.</p>\n<p>Fourth, pandemics put women at greater risk of losing human capital. In many developing countries, young girls are forced to drop out of school and work to supplement household income. According to the Malala Fund <a href=\"https://malala.org/newsroom/archive/malala-fund-releases-report-girls-education-covid-19#:~:text=Malala%20Fund,the%20transmission%20of%20COVID%2D19.&#38;text=Following%20the%20Ebola%20outbreak%20and,enrolment%20rates%20for%20girls%20dropped.\"> report</a>, the share of girls not attending school nearly tripled in Liberia after the Ebola crisis, and girls were 25 percent less likely than boys to re-enroll in Guinea. In India, since the COVID-19 lockdown went into effect, leading matrimony websites have <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/online-matchmaker-sign-ups-increase-30/article31434245.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> reported 30 percent surges in new registrations as </a> families arrange marriages to secure their daughters’ futures. Without education, these girls suffer a permanent loss of human capital, sacrificing productivity growth and perpetuating the cycle of poverty among women.</p>\n<p>It is crucial that policymakers adopt measures to limit the scarring effects of the pandemic on women. This could entail a focus on extending income support to the vulnerable, preserving employment linkages, providing incentives to balance work and family care responsibilities, improving access to health care and family planning, and expanding support for small businesses and the self-employed. Elimination of legal barriers against women’s economic empowerment is also a priority. Some countries have moved quickly to adopt some of these policies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Austria, Italy, Portugal, and Slovenia have introduced a statutory right to (partially) paid leave for parents with children below a certain age, and France has expanded sick leave to parents impacted by school closures if no alternative care or work arrangements can be found.\n</li>\n<li>Latin American <a href=\"https://mlr.vicepresidencia.gov.co/Paginas/prensa/2020/Nace-Coalicion-latinoamericana-para-empoderar-a-las-mujeres-en-medio-de-crisis-por-Covid-19.aspx\"> women leaders </a> have established the &#8220;Coalition of Action for the Economic Empowerment of Women” as part of a wider whole-of-government effort to increase women&#8217;s participation in the post-pandemic economic recovery.\n</li>\n<li>In Togo, 65 percent of participants in a new mobile cash-transfer program are women. The program enables informal workers to receive grants of 30 percent of minimum wage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the longer term, policies can be designed to tackle gender inequality by creating conditions and incentives for women to work. As discussed in a recent <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/02/18/fiscal-policies-for-womens-economic-empowerment/\"> blog</a>, particularly effective are gender-responsive fiscal policies, such as investing in education and infrastructure, subsidizing childcare, and offering parental leave. These policies are not only crucial to lift constraints on women’s economic empowerment, they are necessary to promote an inclusive post-COVID-19 recovery.</p>\n<p><em>This blog drew from a body of
