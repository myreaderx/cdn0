Let&#8217;s get to work!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll take each question individually, to make our homework today as simple as possible.</p>\n<h2>How far did Airbnb&#8217;s bookings fall during Q1 and Q2?</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at Airbnb&#8217;s gross bookings on a quarterly basis. The company defines gross bookings as &#8220;net of cancellations and alterations,&#8221; so these numbers are not artificially inflated.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the chart:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075001\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png?resize=680,227 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png?resize=50,17 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p>Where does the decline begin? Q1, as we&#8217;ll see when we dig into monthly data, but the above chart does a good job painting just how bad things got for Airbnb in growth terms as Q1 closed and Q2 kicked off.</p>\n<p>As you can see, Airbnb&#8217;s second quarter gross bookings were its lowest in recent history; Q2 2020 put up the smallest bookings result since at <em>least</em> the first quarter of 2017. For a company that had done $10.0 billion in gross bookings in a single quarter just over a year before, the declines were catastrophic.</p>\n<p>But the results are actually worse than that chart shows; Airbnb actually saw gross bookings go <em>negative</em> for a few months.</p>\n<p>How is that possible? Recall that the gross bookings figure <em>discounts</em> cancellations and alterations. So, if Airbnb had a big wave of cancellations, its gross bookings number could fall so sharply it goes negative, even if the company were still seeing some new bookings.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what happened in March and April. Observe:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075005\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"159\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png 1006w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?resize=150,35 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?resize=300,70 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?resize=768,179 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?resize=680,159 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?resize=50,12 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p>So how far did Airbnb&#8217;s gross bookings fall? They fell to -$900 million in March. More simply, Airbnb saw its expected rental volume fall by nearly $1 billion in a single month. And then in April it fell by another $600 million as more cancellations piled up.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Airbnb cut staff and took on expensive capital; its business had gone from accreting to bleeding in no time at all.</p>\n<h2>How far have Airbnb&#8217;s bookings come back since?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Cwm1iAYfdLU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 15:12:47 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300","linkMd5":"e78091d0bac4cca640c6d7b06c5f7421","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn6@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-33-357_1ba81e7e68c3a2fe.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31720,"destBytes":31720,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn6@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-33-357_1ba81e7e68c3a2fe.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.32.12-AM.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn87@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-35-942_a02f01ab9d75effe.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-8.36.16-AM.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn53@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-34-763_e0b5c4ec981fc212.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn99@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-37-131_f06ed16608f0aa05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cwm1iAYfdLU:_jSMqryqw1w:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-080_bbad8383491bdb37.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Cwm1iAYfdLU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn71@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-36-930_bddc026b98b05f9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674928},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"GoodRx, Walgreens, CVS shares all down on Amazon’s Pharmacy news","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074972","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Consumer healthcare stocks are plummeting this morning on news that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/amazon-launches-amazon-pharmacy-its-delivery-service-for-prescription-medications/\">Amazon has finally launched its integrated pharmacy service</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dlYrpbotkt\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/amazon-launches-amazon-pharmacy-its-delivery-service-for-prescription-medications/\">Amazon launches Amazon Pharmacy, a delivery service for prescription medications</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon launches Amazon Pharmacy, a delivery service for prescription medications&#8221;

For example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq905lMJHuU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">this Shutterfly ad</a> resulted in a 14% lift in ad recall and a 2% increase in favorability in its target audience.</p> \n<p>The key, YouTube says, is that the audio has to carry the message: “Think: If I close my eyes, I can still clearly understand what this ad is about.”</p> \n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fq905lMJHuU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p> \n<p>In addition to launching audio ads in beta, YouTube is also announcing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10057354\">dynamic music lineups</a>, allowing marketers to target their campaigns at collections of music channels on YouTube. These lineups can be focused on a genre, such as Latin music or K-pop, or on an interest like fitness.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/music-industry-changes\">a separate blog post</a>, YouTube’s Head of Music Lyor Cohen made a broader case to advertisers about why they should see YouTube as an essential music streaming platform.</p> \n<p>After all, according to Cohen, more than 2 billion logged-in viewers are watching at least one music video each month. And, he wrote, “music is more front and center than you might think” — 60% of YouTube’s music viewing happens on mobile, where background viewing/listening is disabled.</p> \n<p>That might seem like an odd thing to emphasize while launching an ad format better suited to background listening, but Cohen continued, “Regardless of when and how people are tuning in, we have ways to help advertisers connect, even when they’re consuming music in the background. Now you can complement the moments your consumers are watching, by engaging them in moments when they’re listening, with newly announced audio ads.”</p> \n<div class=\"embed breakout\"> \n <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qe7C35XYD1\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/youtube-ads-on-tv/\">YouTube brings more ad formats and measurement to TVs</a></p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"“YouTube brings more ad formats and measurement to TVs” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/youtube-ads-on-tv/embed/#?secret=qe7C35XYD1\" data-secret=\"qe7C35XYD1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n</div> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/6bkJ5u6AKFs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:04:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"28890eaedac3c2e581859b2c2770a15e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Anthony Ha","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn63@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-35-804_f9de9acd132f923f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6bkJ5u6AKFs:EV_o-P_QB7E:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-107_353be3ea28f4c3f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/6bkJ5u6AKFs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-36-951_d7be792fe3d8d0ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674924},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074982","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Survival and strategy games are often played in stages. You have the early game where you’re learning the ropes, understanding systems. Then you have mid-game where you’re executing and gathering resources. The most fun part, for me, has always been the late mid-game where you’re in full control of your powers and skills and you’ve got resources to burn &#8212; where you execute on your master plan before the endgame gets hairy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where Apple is in the game of power being played by the chip industry. And it’s about to be endgame for Intel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple has introduced three machines that use its new M1 system on a chip, based on over a decade’s worth of work designing its own processing units based on the ARM instructions set. These machines are capable, assured and powerful, but their greatest advancements come in the performance per watt category.</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I personally tested the 13” M1 MacBook Pro and after extensive testing, it’s clear that this machine eclipses some of the most powerful Mac portables ever made in performance while simultaneously delivering 2x-3x the battery life </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at a minimum.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These results are astounding, but they’re the product of that long early game that Apple has played with the A-series processors. Beginning in earnest in 2008 with the acquisition of PA Semiconductor, Apple has been working its way towards unraveling the features and capabilities of its devices from the product roadmaps of processor manufacturers.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The M1 MacBook Pro runs smoothly, launching apps so quickly that they’re often open before your cursor leaves your dock. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-dock.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074937\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-dock.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"128\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video editing and rendering is super performant, only falling behind older machines when it leverages the GPU heavily. And even then only with powerful dedicated cards like the 5500M or VEGA II. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compiling projects like WebKit produce better build times than nearly any machine (hell the M1 Mac Mini beats the Mac Pro by a few seconds). And it does it while using a fraction of the power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This thing works like an iPad. That’s the best way I can describe it succinctly. One illustration I have been using to describe what this will feel like to a user of current MacBooks is that of chronic pain. If you’ve ever dealt with ongoing pain from a condition or injury, and then had it be alleviated by medication, therapy or surgery, you know how the sudden relief feels. You’ve been carrying the load so long you didn’t know how heavy it was. That’s what moving to this M1 MacBook feels like after using other Macs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every click is more responsive. Every interaction is immediate. It feels like an iOS device in all the best ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the chip level, it also </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an iOS device. Which brings us to&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><b>iOS on M1</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The iOS experience on the M1 machines is&#8230;present. That’s the kindest thing I can say about it. Apps install from the App Store and run smoothly, without incident. Benchmarks run on iOS apps show that they perform natively with no overhead. I even ran an iOS-based graphics benchmark which showed just fine. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2075007\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-5.31.44-AM.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That, however, is where the compliments end. The current iOS app experience on an M1 machine running Big Sur is almost comical; it&#8217;s so silly. There is no default tool-tip that explains how to replicate common iOS interactions like swipe-from-edge &#8212; instead a badly formatted cheat sheet is buried in a menu. The apps launch and run in windows only. Yes, that’s right, no full-screen iOS apps at all. It’s super cool for a second to have instant native support for iOS on the Mac, but at the end of the day this is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> win, not a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consumer experience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple gets to say that the Mac now supports millions of iOS apps, but the fact is that the experience of using those apps on the M1 is sub-par. It will get better, I have no doubt. But the app experience on the M1 is pretty firmly in this order right now: Native M1 app&#62;Rosetta 2 app&#62;Catalyst app&#62; iOS app. Provided that the Catalyst ports can be bothered to build in Mac-centric behaviors and interactions, of course. But it’s clear that iOS, though present, is clearly not where it needs to be on M1.</span></p>\n<p><b>Rosetta 2</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is both a lot to say and not a lot to say about Rosetta 2. I’m sure we’ll get more detailed breakdowns of how Apple achieved what it has with this new emulation layer that makes x86 applications run fine on the M1 architecture. But the real nut of it is that it has managed to make a chip so powerful that it can take the approximate 26% hit (see the following charts) in raw power to translate apps and still make them run just as fast if not </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">faster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than MacBooks with Intel processors. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2075083\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074944\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-intel-rosetta.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s pretty astounding.

And I’m happy to say that this is pretty easy to do because I was unable to track any real performance hit when comparing it to older, even ‘more powerful on paper’ Macs like the 16” MacBook Pro. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s just simply not a factor in most instances.

But even now they’re just as fast. It’s a win-win situation. </span></p>\n<p><b>Methodology</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My methodology  for my testing was pretty straightforward. I ran a battery of tests designed to push these laptops in ways that reflected both real world performance and tasks as well as synthetic benchmarks.

This is a pretty straightforward way to visualize the difference in performance that can result in heavy tasks that last over 20 minutes, where the MacBook Air’s lack of active fan cooling throttles back the M1 a bit. Even with that throttling, the MacBook Air still beats everything here except for the very beefy Mac Pro. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074995\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png 1874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png?resize=768,357 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png?resize=680,316 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png?resize=1536,715 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebKit-Compile-Battery-Remaining.png?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, the big deal here is really this second chart. After a single build of WebKit, the M1 MacBook Pro had a massive 91% of its battery left. I tried multiple tests here and I could have easily run a full build of WebKit 8-9 times on one charge of the M1 MacBook’s battery. In comparison, I could have gotten through about 3 on the 16” and the 13” 2020 model only had one go in it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This insane performance per watt of power is the M1’s secret weapon. The battery performance is simply off the chart. Even with processor-bound tasks. To give you an idea, throughout this build of WebKit the P-cluster (the power cores) hit peak pretty much every cycle while the E-cluster (the efficiency cores) maintained a steady 2GHz. These things are going at it, but they’re super power efficient.</span></p>\n<p><b>Battery Life</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to charting battery performance in some real world tests, I also ran a couple of dedicated battery tests. In some cases they ran so long I thought I had left it plugged in by mistake, it’s that good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ran a mixed web browsing and web video playback script that hit a series of pages, waited for 30 seconds and then moved on to simulate browsing. The results return a pretty common sight in our tests, with the M1 outperforming the other MacBooks by just over 25%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074994\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png 1878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png?resize=1536,808 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mixed-Web-Browsing-and-Video.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fullscreen 4k/60 video playback, the M1 fares even better, clocking an easy 20 hours with fixed 50% brightness.

The fact of it, however, is that I have been unable to push them hard enough yet to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> any effect of this due to Apple’s move to unified memory architecture. Moving RAM to the SoC means no upgradeability &#8212; you’re stuck on 16GB forever. But it </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means massively faster access to that memory by chips on the system that need it most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I was a betting man I’d say that this was an intermediate step to eliminating the concept of discrete RAM altogether. It’s possible that a future (far future, this is the play for now) version of Apple’s M-series chips could end up supplying memory to each of the various chips from a vast pool that also serves as permanent storage. For now, though, what you’ve got is a finite, but blazing fast, pool of memory shared between the CPU cores, GPU and other SoC denizens like the Secure Enclave and Neural Engine. </span></p>\n<p>If you want an indicator of how <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> thinks about the tight connection loop between OS X Big Sur and the M1 processor, which it was built for and vice-versa, note that the M1 MacBook Pro&#8217;s about screen does not show clock speeds at all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2075094\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png 1396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-6.51.11-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While running many applications simultaneously, the M1 performed extremely well.

The 16&#8243; MBP still has more raw power, but rendering games at retina is still very possible here.</p>\n<p><b>The M1 is the future of CPU design</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All too often over the years we’ve seen Mac releases hamstrung by the capabilities of the chips and chipsets that were being offered by Intel. Even as recently as the 16” MacBook Pro, Apple was stuck a generation or more behind. The writing was basically on the wall once the iPhone became such a massive hit that Apple began producing more chips than the entire rest of the computing industry combined. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple has now shipped over 2 billion chips, a scale that makes Intel’s desktop business look like a luxury manufacturer. I think it was politic of Apple to not </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1326225964989259776?s=20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mention them by name</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during last week’s announcement, but it’s also clear that Intel’s days are numbered on the Mac and that their only saving grace for the rest of the industry is that Apple is incredibly unlikely to make chips for anyone else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years ago I wrote an article about the </span><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/03/09/the-iphone-battery-intervention/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone’s biggest flaw</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> being that its performance per watt limited the new experiences that it was capable of delivering. People hated that piece but I was right. Apple has spent the last decade “fixing” its battery problem by continuing to carve out massive performance gains via its A-series chips all while maintaining essentially the same (or slightly better) battery life across the iPhone lineup. No miracle battery technology has appeared, so Apple went in the opposite direction, grinding away at the chip end of the stick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we’re seeing today is the result of Apple flipping the switch to bring all of that power efficiency to the Mac, a device with 5x the raw battery to work with. And those results are spectacular.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gEz7XZx6dD\"><p><a

The company&#8217;s founders strongly feel that this approach helps users close the loop between food, exercise and well-being.</p>\n<p>Levels provides actionable health information by constantly monitoring the wearer&#8217;s blood sugar using proven technology. This isn&#8217;t a wearable worn around the wrist; Levels uses medical hardware that&#8217;s attached to the wearer&#8217;s arm for two weeks. It sounds scarier than it is. I have one on right now, and it&#8217;s painless.</p>\n<p>The $12 million seed round was led by Andreessen Horowitz with other notable investors participating, including Marc Randolph (co-founder and first CEO of Netflix), Dick Costolo (former CEO of Twitter), Michael Arrington (founder of TechCrunch), and Matt Dellavedova (NBA, Cleveland Cavaliers).</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Levels says there are 45,000 people on its waitlist, and with this funding, the company expects to fulfill all pre-orders and millions more. The company expects customers will be able to purchase Levels starting in early 2021.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Levels is ultimately a behavior change mechanism,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Josh Clemente said. &#8220;We will continue to establish product development milestones that are focused on achieving that end state before we fully launch. This funding will allow us to grow the team and perform the research necessary to understand specifically which mechanisms to focus on and translate those into the product. Once we reach that degree of efficacy, we&#8217;ll launch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The founders of Level are passionate about this cause. Over several phone calls with TechCrunch, Levels&#8217; founders Josh Clemente and Dr. Casey Means explained the company&#8217;s targets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Optimizing metabolic function can improve energy, endurance, memory, mood, and cognitive performance. Seven of the ten leading causes of death in the US are strongly related to metabolic dysfunction,&#8221; said Dr. Casey Means, Co-founder of Levels. &#8220;Levels helps you improve metabolic fitness by alerting you to foods that negatively impact glucose levels. Armed with this information, you can take control of your metabolic health and make healthier lifestyle decisions.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074786\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"742\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png?resize=1536,1113 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XDBROp7Cywc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:00:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png","linkMd5":"62ebe3172f39b3e1738e9585502006c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn31@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-27-687_12290cb735a71904.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":1304,"sourceBytes":716688,"destBytes":97502,"author":"Matt Burns","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/levels.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn31@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-27-687_12290cb735a71904.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn16@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-36-488_63207407ec2d6d4f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XDBROp7Cywc:Xs9nx5lZuKE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn69@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-34-710_7154ff8da115a9d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XDBROp7Cywc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-37-259_8b709d42231bce21.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674935},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Hey look, glow-in-the-dark PowerBeats","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2075102","description":"<p class=\"p1\">Now that Apple’s getting more serious about its own branded headphones, Beats have, perhaps, lost a little bit of luster within the company. The products are still wildly popular, of course, and the brand offers a lot more options than its parent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Powerbeats are one of the more utilitarian entries among the brand’s wireless offerings (though not quite to the extent of those <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/beats-announces-50-bluetooth-earbuds/\">new $50 models</a>), trading the fully wireless form factor for a behind-the-neck cable and a lower price. Today Beats is offering a new special edition take on the product, launched a collaboration with the Ambush jewelry line and Nigerian singer, Burna Boy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You’ve got your usual lineup of specs here: 15 hours of battery, sweat and water resistant design and Apple’s H1 chip, et al. Most importantly, though, they’re the first glow-in-the dark product from Beats.

In many ways, Mati works a bit like Plaid, but not just for other types of data. When a company starts using Mati, they can verify various data points, such as residency, income and taxes.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Instead of taking a photography of important documents, Mati can help you connect to a government database or a utility provider to download and share data from those services directly.</p>\n<p>“What we do is a digital reputation API that turns anonymous strangers into trustworthy users,” co-founder and CEO Filip Victor told me. And this kind of verifications are extremely important for fintech startups and companies operating in the so-called sharing economy industry.</p>\n<p>Filip Victor himself has suffered in the past from poor reputation processes. As an immigrant in the U.S., he couldn’t verify himself on Airbnb. The issue is that most reputation services aren’t that flexible. You run into edge cases quite quickly when you’re an immigrant or you don’t have the right documents.</p>\n<p>Mati has chosen to focus on high-growth regions, such as Latin America and South East Asia because they tend to be underserved when it comes to digital reputation. Clients include Te Creemos, Taptap Send and Tropipay.</p>\n<p>“We went region by region, country by country and scraped into different databases. We gained access to things like social security access via the user,” Victor said.</p>\n<p>Mati is thinking about other use cases beyond financial services and sharing economy startups. Many online services could benefit from some level of trust.

Initially, Instagram limited Guides to a select group of creators who were publishing content focused on mental health and well-being. Today, the company says it&#8217;s making the format available to all users, and expanding Guides to include other types of content, as well &#8212; including Products, Places, and Posts.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/instagram-guides-may-soon-allow-creators-to-recommended-places-products-and-more/\"> in August noted an expansion</a> of Instagram Guides appeared to be in development, with a focus on allowing users to create travel guides and product recommendation guides, in addition to a more generic &#8220;posts&#8221; format.</p>\n<p>This &#8220;Guides&#8221; format was designed to give Instagram creators and marketers a way to share long-form content on a social network that had been, until now, focused more on media &#8212; like photos and videos. By comparison, an Instagram Guide could look more like a blog post, as it could include text accompanied by photos, galleries and videos to illustrate the subject matter being discussed.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The feature could help increase users&#8217; time in the app, since users wouldn&#8217;t have to click through to external websites and blogs to access these posts &#8212; for instance, through a link in the creator&#8217;s bio or through a link added to one of the creator&#8217;s Stories.</p>\n<p>With the expansion to Products, Places and Posts, Instagram&#8217;s Guides can now cover more areas. Instagram says it made the feature easier to use, too. It may also feature Product Guides inside its new shopping destination on the platform, Instagram Shop, the company noted.</p>\n<p>Visitors to Guides can share the Guides across their own Stories and in Direct Messages, expanding their reach even further.</p>\n<p>The expansion to Guides is rolling out now to all users.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4wTBR1Ymqac\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:00:12 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"07a71f533eff827fc1ff30bcc6f12431","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-34-814_ff23aa4cc011f406.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4wTBR1Ymqac:AYSt4JKh860:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn44@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-36-836_71367fc442d4c7b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4wTBR1Ymqac":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-34-661_2bf22944e4aaeafe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674895},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Google updates Maps with more COVID info and finally launches its Assistant driving mode","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074694","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> today announced an update to Google Maps that includes a number of new COVID-related features, as well as the ability to see the live status of your takeout or delivery orders, as well as the launch of the long-expected new Assistant driving mode.</p>\n<p>In addition, the company shared a few new stats around Google Maps today.

To do so, you have to book your order from Google Maps on Android or iOS.</p>\n<p>For Google Maps users who don&#8217;t have an Android Auto-compatible car, the new Google Assistant driving mode in Maps has long been something to look forward to. The company first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/google-assistant-is-coming-to-google-maps/\">talked</a> about this set of new features at its I/O developers conference <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/assistant/next-generation-google-assistant-io/\">in May 2019</a>, but as is so often the case, features announced at I/O take a while to get to market. Originally, this was supposed to launch last summer.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074741\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074741\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2074741 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"574\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Google Maps</p></div></p>\n<p>The idea here is to allow drivers to get alerts about incoming calls, have the Assistant read out text messages and control your music right inside of Google Maps. Using the Assistant ideally reduces driver distractions. For now, this new mode is only coming to Android users in the U.S., though, and the number of features it supports remains limited. Google promises to support more features over time, but it&#8217;s not clear which features it plans to add to this mode.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GCXfl9r5P2\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/google-assistant-is-coming-to-google-maps/\">Google Assistant is coming to Google Maps</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Google Assistant is coming to Google Maps&#8221;

Today, the company announced broad changes to <a href=\"https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/introducing-dropbox-spaces#:~:text=Dropbox%20Spaces%20transforms%20your%20folders,in%20sync%20with%20your%20team.\">Dropbox Spaces</a>, the product introduced last year, to make it a collaboration and project management tool designed with these new requirements in mind.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/dropbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"dropbox\">Dropbox <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> president Timothy Young says that the company has always been about making it easy to access files wherever you happen to be and whatever device you happen to be on, whether that was in a consumer or business context. As the company has built out its business products over the last several years, that involved sharing content internally or externally. Today&#8217;s announcement is about helping teams plan and execute around the content you create with a strong project focus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now what we&#8217;re basically trying to do is really help distributed teams stay organized, collaborate together and keep moving along, but also do so in a really secure way and support IT, administrators and companies with some features around that as well, while staying true to Dropbox principles,&#8221; Young said.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>This involves updating Spaces to be a full-fledged project management tool designed with a distributed workforce in mind. Spaces connects to other tools like your calendar, people directory, project management software &#8212; and of course files. You can create a project, add people and files, then set up a timeline and assign and track tasks, In addition, you can access meetings directly from Spaces and communicate with team members, who can be inside or outside the company.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"SwYOj6cPK3\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/dropbox-ceo-drew-houston-says-the-pandemic-forced-the-company-to-reevaluate-the-product-roadmap/\">Dropbox CEO Drew Houston says the pandemic forced the company to reevaluate what work means</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Dropbox CEO Drew Houston says the pandemic forced the company to reevaluate what work means&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/dropbox-ceo-drew-houston-says-the-pandemic-forced-the-company-to-reevaluate-the-product-roadmap/embed/#?secret=SwYOj6cPK3\" data-secret=\"SwYOj6cPK3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Houston suggested a product like this could be coming in his September interview when he said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Back in March we started thinking about this, and how [the rapid shift to distributed work] just kind of happened. It wasn’t really designed. What if you did design it? How would you design this experience to be really great?

companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bolt-threads\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bolt-threads\">Bolt Threads <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (mushrooms), Ananas Anam (pineapple fibers), and Desserto (cactus leather) &#8212; with its emphasis on the durability of its fabric.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We’ve had the product tested in a huge range of different applications of various leather-based apparel to upholstery to standard leather goods like handbags and wallets. The key difference between our material and mushroom leather is that the structural components is so high,&#8221; Scullin said. &#8220;We&#8217;re confident in the material’s ability to perform in a really wide range of applications so there’s a wide range of uses for that.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>To that end, MycoWorks is focused on the high-end fo the market. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a misconception that brands are willing to sacrifice performance for sustainability and that’s not true,&#8221; Scullin said. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real adoption occurs in an industry like this when the performance is there.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Scullin won&#8217;t say how much the MycoWorks material costs nor would he talk about which specific companies are working with the company&#8217;s product right now. He did say that the company hopes eventually to be price competitive with not just the traditional leather market, but the plastic market for leather replacements, which is worth $70 billion per-year alone.</p>\n<p>With the company&#8217;s current capacity it can produce tens of thousands of square feet of fungal material per yar, according to Scullin. That means MycoWorks still has a long way to go to catch up to an industry that produces billions of square feet of leather.</p>\n<p>The funding for MycoWorks is impressive, but it also has to contend with some competitors that are getting traction of their own in the fashion industry.</p>\n<p>In October, Bolt Threads announced the creation of a consortium alongside longtime partners <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/adidas\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"adidas\">Adidas, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Stella McCartney and the fashion house behind brands like Balenciaga to explore mushroom leather-based products.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"O71u5VbOLl\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/bolt-threads-partners-with-adidas-owners-of-balenciaga-and-gucci-and-stella-mccartney-on-mushroom-leather/\">Bolt Threads partners with Adidas, owners of Balenciaga and Gucci, and Stella McCartney on mushroom leather</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Bolt Threads partners with Adidas, owners of Balenciaga and Gucci, and Stella McCartney on mushroom leather&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/bolt-threads-partners-with-adidas-owners-of-balenciaga-and-gucci-and-stella-mccartney-on-mushroom-leather/embed/#?secret=O71u5VbOLl\" data-secret=\"O71u5VbOLl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>For MycoWorks investors including <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTT Investment Ltd.

It&#8217;s a terribly toxic and polluting process, both in the tanning and dyeing and in the waste and landfilling associated with both animal leather and its plastic replacements.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;The process of growing the mycelium is carbon negative. Customers will look at [our product] vs. an animal hide and say why wouldn’t I choose [that],&#8221; said Sculin. &#8220;In addition you have the non-animal aspects and the plastic free aspects that are driving so many decisions right now… what we really are to our brand partners is an advanced manufacturing company. We are motivated by sustainability. We represent a way for them to change their supply chains.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Cro0UUDKbMk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:01:19 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b0cc0a73217839dbe9b9cf14d9628036","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-34-653_5b0f482468caf979.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Cro0UUDKbMk:4AYmzx4QHII:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn40@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-594_66830328fc60fa2b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Cro0UUDKbMk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-34-726_46c39673fe1787df.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674902},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Trust & Will raises $15M as digital estate planning hits mainstream","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074360","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Let’s get something morbid out of the way right up front: estate planning is a growth business in 2020.

Customers pay an upfront setup fee based on which product they choose, and then they pay a smaller recurring annual subscription fee.</p>\n<p>The company, which originally only worked in Nevada due to the state laws around digital wills, now has attorneys who can assist clients in multiple states. The company has also since conducted the first electronic will in Florida’s history, which, let’s just say, is an important center in the estate-planning industry.</p>\n<p>A couple of other new changes. First, the startup has built up a number of banking and financial planning relationships with institutions such as Fifth Third Bank (which also joined the Series B round as a strategic investor), AARP, and fintech savings startup Acorns.</p>\n<p>Second, the company hired former General Assembly CFO John Zdanowski to take on the startups chief financial officer role. The team has grown to 24, and Barbo noted by email that all three co-founders have become dads since the company’s seed round — putting a bit of a poignant note on their mission to make estate planning accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074361\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074361\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2074361\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg 2100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrustWill_founderbabies.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trust &#38; Will&#8217;s three co-founders with their very-well-estate-planned children.

Everything satisfyingly snaps into place. I keep waiting for my test machine to start lagging, and nearly a week later, it&#8217;s just as fast as the day I started using it. The new Mac mini is surprising, and most users will find it a major upgrade over existing Mac computers. It&#8217;s hard to beat regardless of the price.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>For casual users, those who live in a web browser or Apple&#8217;s apps, the Mac mini is a no-brainer option. This is the desktop I would buy for myself. Even for power users, those who run bespoke applications, the Mac mini should be seriously considered. Most mainstream applications excel on the new Mini — especially apps with a creative tilt toward photography or video.</p>\n<p>The Mac mini has long been a forgotten friend among the Mac lineup. Hardly updated and never promoted, it sat on the bench for years, watching as Apple&#8217;s portables received updates and refreshes as the world became more mobile. But here we are in the midst of a never-ending pandemic. With coffee shops closed and business travel limited, the COVID-19 crisis could lead to the rediscovery of the desktop computer.</p>\n<p>The M1-powered Mac mini is a winner.</p>\n<h2>Review</h2>\n<p>There are several things you should know. One, the new Mac mini runs the M1 SoC, which is fundamentally different from its Intel predecessor. Instead of a CPU, it&#8217;s an SoC &#8212; System on a Chip, which comes with advantages and concessions. The chipset is built around an ARM design with more integrated components than its CPU counterparts. In many ways, it&#8217;s more similar to the system powering phones and tablets than the chips used in traditional computers. Because of this design, components that used to be discrete are now integrated directly into the chip.</p>\n<p>Second, Apple provided a 6K 32-inch Pro Display XDR with my test Mac mini (these will be returned to Apple). I&#8217;m also running a 24-inch display over HDMI. According to the Mac mini&#8217;s product page, the system is limited to two monitors. I was able to hook up a third monitor through 3rd party software but it was unstable and should not be considered a capability.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you should know TechCrunch also reviewed the new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/macbook-air-m1-review-the-right-apple-silicon-mac-for-most/\">13-inch MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a>. We benchmarked these systems with similar conditions to demonstrate the differences between the units.</p>\n<p>In our tests, we found Apple&#8217;s M1 system on a chip (SoC) to outperform its rivals, regardless of price. With the M1 at its core, the Mac mini is faster in most regards than every Apple computer available except for the ultra-expensive Mac Pro — and sometimes the Mini is faster than the Mac Pro, too. What&#8217;s more, this performance increase is noticeable throughout the system and not just limited to raw computing tasks in purpose-built applications. The system is snappy, responsive and feels like the start of a new era of computing.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tAi3Cr60KT\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/\">Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/embed/#?secret=tAi3Cr60KT\" data-secret=\"tAi3Cr60KT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EgW5RbqdlI\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/macbook-air-m1-review-the-right-apple-silicon-mac-for-most/\">MacBook Air M1 review: The right Apple Silicon Mac for most</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;MacBook Air M1 review: The right Apple Silicon Mac for most&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/macbook-air-m1-review-the-right-apple-silicon-mac-for-most/embed/#?secret=EgW5RbqdlI\" data-secret=\"EgW5RbqdlI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>The new Mac experience</h2>\n<p>Snappy hardly describes the experience of the new Mac mini. This system flies. Users will instantly notice the increase in speed, too, from startup time to launching apps. In the past, even on powerful machines, macOS has always felt heavy compared to iOS, but not anymore. With the M1 chip, macOS (Big Sur) is light and free and a joy to use.</p>\n<p>Even better, the ARM-based M1 chip allows Macs to run iOS applications, and they run as smoothly on the Mac as they do on an iPad.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s likely a hesitation around embracing a new Intel-less Mac. Will your legacy applications run on these machines? Will they run well? I can&#8217;t answer every variable. I installed and ran dozens of applications during my few days with the system and never experienced a roadblock. Even with older programs, everything ran as advertised, and in most cases, ran better on this M1-powered Mac mini than on my few-months-old 15-inch MacBook Pro. I didn&#8217;t find one application unable to run on the new platform.</p>\n<p>The largest speed increases are most noticeable when using native apps for the M1 processor. With Apple&#8217;s Final Cut Pro, the application loads seemingly instantly — two seconds from button press to it being open and ready to go.</p>\n<p>With the M1 chip, it&#8217;s less painful to edit 8K footage in the native Final Cut Pro app than it was to edit 4K footage on an Intel Mac. Exporting the files still takes time, though, and this is one of the few tasks where Intel&#8217;s platform outperforms the M1.</p>\n<p>Even when using legacy software, the system preformed with ease. Edits in Photoshop seemed more fluid. Lightroom loaded photo albums quicker and without hesitation. Editing video in Premiere was easier and less painful as I scrubbed through 6K footage. Even unzipping files was much quicker.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074937\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074937\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074937\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-dock.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"128\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matt Burns</p></div></p>\n<p>This is a silly demonstration, but watch the GIF above.

While it looks mostly the same, the macOS is now purpose-built for Apple&#8217;s own silicon. To take full advantage of the redesigned chip, applications need to be re-coded into an Arm-friendly design. And yet, we found something surprising: Even the apps that are not re-coded yet are still impressively fast thanks to Apple&#8217;s Rosetta 2 that enables software encoded for Intel&#8217;s platform to run on the new Apple platform and take advantage of the M1&#8217;s power.</p>\n<p>For most uses, this holistic approach of building the hardware and software results in major advantages. Common system-level tasks like launching apps, waking from sleep and unzipping files are lightning-fast. Other items like rendering video and editing photos are just as fast, too. Right now, at launch, all of Apple&#8217;s apps &#8212; from Music to Photos to Safari &#8212; are re-encoded for the M1. Like those from Adobe, other apps are not yet native, but the older versions run fine, and in most cases, run better on the M1 than an Intel platform.</p>\n<p>The M1 platform lacks a dedicated graphics processing unit. It&#8217;s built-into the core of the chip. Thanks to a memory dedicated to machine learning, this lack of a discrete GPU is hardly noticeable for professional users. Still, those who do intensive graphics work (like professional gfx visual artists) should hesitate. Even then, this conclusion could change once the applications become native to the new ARM architecture.</p>\n<p>The M1 also lacks the ability to use an eGPU — an external graphics card — but most users should not fret. It could be a problem for pros who found the Intel-based Mac minis paired with a powerful eGPUs as a viable, low-cost alternative to the Mac Pro. However, based on our testing, the GPU performance in these M1 systems are impressive and could be good enough for most, even in creative media editing applications.</p>\n<p>In addition to common workflows, I ran through some industry benchmarks to see how the system responds and came away impressed. We took it one step further, too, and charted the performance between Apple&#8217;s top-of-the-line systems and the new 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>Benchmarks often oversimplify results, but in this case, they seem necessary. This puts systems on common ground. By looking at multiple tests, the results draw a common conclusion. The M1 is really good.</p>\n<h2>The new Mac lineup</h2>\n<p>The Mac mini has two siblings. The M1 is also available in Apple&#8217;s 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. The differences are minor. The same computing platform powers all three but feature different cooling schemes in the MacBook Pro and Mac mini. Because of the improved cooling, the MacBook Pro and Mac mini are better suited for sustained performance.</p>\n<p>In our testing, all three machines performed similarly. The Air started to fall short in the longer tests, and that&#8217;s likely due to its passive cooling that does not feature a fan. In the MacBook Pro and Mini, the SoC is cooled by a fan, while a heatsink is used in the Air.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for you? For most users, the Air&#8217;s performance is sufficient as it only slows down during long, intensive tasks. For browsing the web, editing photos and watching videos, the Air is perfect.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one downside to the new Mac mini over its Intel sibling. The M1 Mac mini only sports two Thunderbolt 3 inputs. For some users, this could be a deal-breaker, though it&#8217;s not for me. There are countless ways to expand the Thunderbolt capability of the Mac mini, and to me, the performance of the machine outweighs the port limitation.</p>\n<p>The M1 Mac mini also lacks a 10GB Ethernet option, limiting its use as a server for some users. This is also likely an M1 limitation, and something I would expect would be addressed in future chipset revisions.</p>\n<p>Multiple monitor support is a major downside to the M1 Mac mini. It only supports two monitors: one through Thunderbolt and one over HDMI. I was able to get a third monitor running at low resolution through third-party software, but it was unstable and performed poorly. To some, including me, multiple monitor support is a major issue and two monitors are often not enough.</p>\n<h2>Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>Apple, when promoting the M1-powered computers, laid out some wild claims about the chipset. We found most of the claims to be factual. We ran a handful of benchmarks on the M1 systems, comparing them against the most recent Macs, including the Mac Pro.</p>\n<p>Benchmarks paint with a broad stroke and often miss nuances. That&#8217;s the case here. While the first few benchmarks demonstrate the speed of the M1, the final test fails to capture a critical aspect of Final Cut Pro. Sure, it&#8217;s slower to export than an Intel-based system, but using the M1-native version of Final Cut Pro is much smoother than what&#8217;s available on older systems. I was able to easily manipulate, scrub and edit 8K footage without even a hiccup. Rendering takes longer, but editing is seemingly easier.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074941\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074941\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074941\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xcode-unzip-time.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Here we downloaded the Xcode 12.3 beta.

processors","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074723","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">For the past two years, some of the world&#8217;s biggest chip makers have battled a series of hardware flaws, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device/\">Meltdown and Spectre</a>, which made it possible — though not easy — to pluck passwords and other sensitive secrets directly from their processors. The chip makers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/intel-announces-hardware-fixes-for-spectre-and-meltdown-on-upcoming-chips/\">rolled out patches</a>, but required the companies to rethink how they approach chip security.</p>\n<p>Now, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> thinks it has the answer with its new security chip, which it calls Pluton. The chip, announced today, is the brainchild of a partnership between Microsoft, and chip makers Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>Pluton acts as a hardware root-of-trust, which in simple terms protects a device&#8217;s hardware from tampering, such as from hardware implants or by hackers exploiting flaws in the device&#8217;s low-level firmware. By integrating the chip inside future Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm central processor units, or CPUs, it makes it far more difficult for hackers with physical access to a computer to launch hardware attacks and extract sensitive data, the companies said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Microsoft Pluton design will create a much tighter integration between the hardware and the Windows operating system at the CPU that will reduce the available attack surface,&#8221; said David Weston, director of enterprise and operating system security at Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Microsoft said Pluton made its first appearance in the Xbox One back in 2013 to make it far more difficult to hack the console or allow gamers to run pirated games. The chip later graduated to Microsoft&#8217;s cloud service Azure Sphere, used to secure low-cost Internet of Things devices.</p>\n<p>The idea now is to bring that same technology, with some improvements, to new Windows 10 devices.</p>\n<p>The chip comes with immediate benefits, like making hardware attacks against Windows devices far more difficult to succeed. But the chip also solves a major security headache by keeping the device&#8217;s firmware up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the Pluton chip can stand the test of time is another matter. Most of the chip vulnerability research has been done by third-party researchers through extensive, and often tedious work. Microsoft&#8217;s Weston said the Pluton chip has undergone a security stress-test by its own internal red team and by external vendors. But that could come back to haunt the company if it got something wrong. Case in point: just last month, security researchers <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-t2-chip-unfixable-flaw-jailbreak-mac/\">found an &#8220;unfixable&#8221; security flaw </a>in Apple&#8217;s T2 security chip — a custom-built chip in most modern Macs that&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/\">analogous</a> to Microsoft&#8217;s Pluton — that could open up Macs to the very security threats that the chip is supposed to prevent.</p>\n<p>Microsoft declined to say if it planned to offer the Pluton chip designs to other chip makers or if it planned to make the designs open source for anyone to use, but said it plans to share more details in the future, leaving the door open to the possibility.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/cKGRdTm1gag\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:00:04 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1ea161db543484a9bfc764e28482e96d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Zack Whittaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn71@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-34-680_bd1d3691e1a3a56f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cKGRdTm1gag:71o9ranG75s:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn51@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-36-685_9470552d34a61ecd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/cKGRdTm1gag":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn45@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-730_38327d35b1cf0330.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674889},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Turo puts $1 million toward helping Black people make money sharing cars","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074456","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Car sharing marketplace <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/turo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"turo\">Turo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has teamed up with Kiva to offer interest-free loans to Black people and folks from traditionally underserved communities to buy cars and then share them on Turo.

Today they have a cloud-based network of 60 Points of Presence (PoPs) around the world, giving customers access to networking resources and network security no matter where they happen to be</p>\n<p>The bet they made was a good one because the world has changed, and that became even more pronounced this year when COVID hit and forced many people to work from home. Now suddenly having the ability to sign in from anywhere became more important than ever, and they have been doing well with 2x growth in ARR this year (although he wouldn&#8217;t share specific revenue numbers).</p>\n<p>As a company getting Series E funding, Kramer doesn&#8217;t shy away from the idea of eventually going public, especially since he&#8217;s done it twice before, but neither is he ready to commit any time table. For now, he says the company is growing rapidly, with almost 700 customers &#8212; and that&#8217;s why it decided to take such a large capital influx right now.</p>\n<p>Cato currently has 270 employees with plans to grow to 400 by the end of next year. He says that Cato is a global company with headquarters in Israel where diversity involves religion, but he is trying to build a diverse and inclusive culture regardless of the location.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My feeling is that inclusion needs to happen in the earlier stages of the funnel. I&#8217;m personally involved in these efforts, at the educational sector level, and when students are ready to be recruited by startups, we are already competitive, and if you look at our employee base it&#8217;s very diverse,&#8221; Kramer said.</p>\n<p>With the new funds, he plans to keep building the company and the product. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge opportunity and we want to move as fast as possible.

Three of the biggest insurance companies in the US &#8212; Travelers, State Farm Ventures, and Nationwide &#8212; led the round, with building materials giant Standard Industries, and other unnamed building tech firms, also participating. Past financial backers Menlo Ventures, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and Alsop Louie Partners as well as new backer Guidewire Software were also in this round.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>This funding takes the total raised by Hover to just over $142 million, and for some context on its valuation, it&#8217;s a significant jump compared to its last round, a Series C in 2019, when Hover was valued at $280 million (according to <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/55767-16/company/profile#insights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PitchBook data</a>).</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s funding, that valuation jump, and the interest from insurance firms comes on the heels of huge growth for the company.

This year, it&#8217;s expecting to hit &#8220;north of $70 million&#8221; in its annual run rate, with insurance companies and other big business partners accounting for the majority of its growth.</p>\n<p>Hover was founded in 2011 and it first made its name with homeowners and the sole-trader and small business contractors working on their homes repairing roofs and fixing other parts of their structures. Its unique contribution to the market was a piece of software that bypassed a lot of the fragmented and hardest work involved in doing home repair by tying the whole process to the functions of a smartphone: its camera, phone sensors, and the use of apps.</p>\n<p>In essence, it allowed anyone with an ordinary smartphone camera to snap several pictures of a space (up to 8), which could then be used to piece together a &#8220;structured&#8221; 3D image to better assess a job.</p>\n<p>Those 3D images are not ordinary 3D pictures: they are dynamically encoded with information about materials, sizes and dimensions and other data critical to carrying out any work. A contractor using the Hover app could set up a system where these pictures, in turn, could be used to automatically create priced out quotes, with bills of material and timings for work, for their prospective clients. (Compare that to the &#8220;back of the business card&#8221; pricing that typifies quite a lot of jobs, in Altman&#8217;s words.)</p>\n<p>And these days, Hover also serves as an e-commerce portal for builders to order in the parts to carry out that work.</p>\n<p>Hover now has around 35 patents on its tech, Altman said.</p>\n<p>The company has had a lot of traction in the market in part because of how it&#8217;s digitized an analogue process that had before it been firmly offline and lacking in transparency, in what is essentially not just a fragmented process, but also a very fragmented marketplace, with some 100,000 home repair firms active in the US today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The home improvement segment was one of the few that was not online,&#8221; Altman said. &#8220;For example, if I needed a new roof, it&#8217;s not that easy to just tell me what that would cost. The reason is because someone has to pull dozens of measurements off a house before costing that out, estimating the time it would take to fix and so on. Hover built a pipeline that turns photos into all of those answers.&#8221; It currently has about 10,000 contractors using its app, Altman said, so there is still a lot of growth to go.</p>\n<p>Altman said that in its early days, the company had something of a hurdle convincing people of the usefulness of having an app that let even the homeowner take pictures of an issue on a property in order to start the process of finding someone to fix it. That&#8217;s because even in an age where DIY is pretty commonplace &#8212; and The Home Depot, incidentally, is also a previous backer of Hover &#8212; many builders and their partners see that role as theirs, not their clients.</p>\n<p>That has changed a lot, especially in the last year in the age of a global health pandemic that has driven many to reduce social contacts to help contain the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eliminating the need for on-site home visits is a huge deal, but we were spending a lot of time convincing some before Covid that this was a good idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The provider &#8212; whether it involved an insurance carrier or contractor &#8212; didn&#8217;t like the idea of engaging a homeowner, asking them, to do that work.&#8221; That has shifted considerably, he said, &#8220;with the Covid experience,&#8221; with many now asking for this option.</p>\n<p>While smaller contractors account for more of its revenues today, insurance is the faster-growing segment of its business, Altman said, where large firms are integrating their apps with Hover&#8217;s, sending out links to customers to snap pictures with the Hover app that then get automatically sent to the insurance company&#8217;s app to kickstart the process of working through customers&#8217; claims.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to us that we provide our customers with the best possible experience, and Hover&#8217;s technology helps us to do that by creating a simpler, faster and more transparent claims process,” said Nick Seminara, executive vice president and chief claims officer of Travelers, in a statement. “We see a tremendous opportunity for Hover in the insurance industry, and we’re pleased to continue our partnership and invest in their future.”</p>\n<p>Longer term, there are a number of areas where you could imagine Hover&#8217;s technology to apply. The company is already doing a lot of work in commercial buildings, and the next step is likely going to be expanding to more interior work, including home design and decor.</p>\n<p>This is a huge market where you could see tech like this linking up with the likes of home sales firms, where companies are able to not just market a home, but potentially fixer-uppers with all the planning work set out for how to fix it up when you buy it; and also of course the extensive landscape of e-commerce businesses selling home furnishings, electronics and more.</p>\n<p>Many of these, like Ikea and Houzz, have already put in a lot of investment into leveraging newer tech like Apple&#8217;s AR platform to improve their user experience, and so the appetite to take things to the next level is definitely there.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Xw7IDkQHHWY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:16:28 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"6956e9d3fb40f912c68f8114b7a0441c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-24-043_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-36-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-34-660_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-35-549_e4f909b7a642140b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xw7IDkQHHWY:nS5x45Vy_0M:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn89@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-49-220_41c229e7e2e832c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-37-422_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Xw7IDkQHHWY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-34-729_f6f1605473baa314.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674889},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"MacBook Air M1 review: The right Apple Silicon Mac for most","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074739","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Reviewing hardware is an act of minutia.

That move came as the company was butting up against the limitations of its chosen technology. PowerPC took them far at the time, but it couldn’t deliver on the processing power it desired for the next generation of portables.</p>\n<p>As with that transition, the move toward Apple silicon has been years in the making. The company has been making a concerted effort to wean itself off of third-party components. Among other things, it’s increasingly difficult to differentiate your product when you’re essentially using the same parts as everyone else on the market. Creating your own processors is, of course, a long and difficult process. Thankfully, however, the company had a head start.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074197\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074197\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074197\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074517497.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074197\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>The Arm-based chips that power the company’s mobile devices are a great starting point.

And the results are, in a word, impressive. You’ve no doubt seen some of the benchmarks that have popped up over the past several days that have left many in the community taken aback. While it’s true that Apple talked up performance in its own presser, it’s easy enough to discount those numbers without more specific benchmarks. We’ve split our testing of the three systems among three editors — and it’s pretty safe to say we were blown away by what the systems can do.</p>\n<p>Okay, so, a brief break down of the M1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eight-core CPU with a stated 2x performance gain</li>\n<li>Seven- or eight-core GPU (depending on the Air model you go in for) with up to a 2x graphical upgrade</li>\n<li>16-core neural engine</li>\n<li>Increased power</li>\n<li>Improved image signal processing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Air, in particular, presents some truly robust gains of the most recent versions of the system, released back in March. That may feel like forever ago, given everything that has transpired, but that’s a mere eight months. The system excels at two benchmarks in particular: battery life — measures by a simple video playback — and Geekbench, which tests a system’s CPU and GPU performance by simulating real-world situations. Anecdotally, things are just faster all over the place.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074099\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074099\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2074099\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ezgif-1-a7cc1c3ba575.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"516\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>Apps open almost instantly and resource-intensive tasks like editing 4K video are surprisingly zippy. Some of these are changes you’ll likely notice right away, even if you’re not pushing the system to the limit. Take the neat trick of waking up instantly from sleep. It’s something we’ve taken for granted on mobile devices but haven’t seen as much on desktops.</p>\n<p>These advances, perhaps unsurprisingly, arrive in the same package.

Perhaps the company is seeking to maintain consistency on the outside as the products undergo rather dramatic changes under the hood. Maybe a redesign didn’t line up with the move to Arm. Or, hey, maybe Apple thinks the current design represents some sort of platonic ideal for thin and light laptop.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ddnY7Dp0Qg\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/\">Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/embed/#?secret=ddnY7Dp0Qg\" data-secret=\"ddnY7Dp0Qg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Whatever the case, you’d be hard-pressed to pick the new Air out of a lineup.

I’m always going to argue for more ports, especially given the fact that one will semi-regularly be monopolized by a charging cable. I’m also a fan of spreading them out a bit more — preferably on either side of the machine for those instances when you just can’t get enough slack from the cable or have something a bit wider plugged into the port. Of course, there’s no surprise on that front, unlike the new 13-inch Pro, which lost two ports in the process of upgrading.</p>\n<p>That will likely sting for some users attempting to figure out whether to upgrade here. The change appears to be connected to some limitations of the new M1 SOC. If I was a betting man, however, I would suggest that there’s a pretty reasonable possibility that whatever pro-focused version of the chip comes next will support more ports for upcoming devices like the first Apple Silicon 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QuN0b3wLQO\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/apple-macbook-air-review/\">Apple MacBook Air review</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Apple MacBook Air review&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/apple-macbook-air-review/embed/#?secret=QuN0b3wLQO\" data-secret=\"QuN0b3wLQO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In fact, the company is likely reserving a number of upgrades to differentiate this round from some new pro-focused devices likely to arrive at some point next year. It’s all part of a kind of configuration of Apple’s Mac strategy that we’re seeing play out in slow motion. The new Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac mini represent the entry-level tier for the Mac line. It’s a category that’s become an increased focus for the company in recent years — and one we’ve seen play out across the iPhone and Apple Watch lines.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, still truth in the longstanding notion of the premium “Apple Tax,” but the company has expended its approach to improve things on the lower end. One of the more surprising aspects of this strategy on the Mac side is just how much the company has closed the gap between the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook. There are differences between the two devices, of course. For many or most, the biggest is the $300 price gulf between the $999 starting price for the Air and $1,299 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>So, how does Apple justify the price difference? And more to the point, will the upsell make a difference for a vast majority of users? Before we go any further, let’s break down the key differences between the new Air and Pro.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stated Battery</strong> &#8211; Pro: Up to 20 hours, Air: Up to 18 hours</li>\n<li><strong>Display</strong> &#8211; Pro: 500 nits of brightness, Air: 400 nits</li>\n<li><strong>Microphone Array</strong> &#8211; Pro: Studio-quality three-mic array, Air: Three-mic array</li>\n<li><strong>Touch Bar</strong> &#8211; Pro: Yes, Air: No</li>\n<li><strong>Speakers</strong> &#8211; Pro: Stereo speakers with high dynamic range, Air: Stereo speakers</li>\n<li><strong>Fan</strong> &#8211; Pro: Yes, Air: No</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last bullet is the most important when it comes to performance. The arrival of the M1 made a fanless MacBook Air a possibility — something that was unheard of in early models. It bodes well for the thinness of future MacBooks, and more immediately, it means extremely silent performance. And, indeed, no matter how much stress testing I’ve managed to do over these past few days, the system has remained eerily silent — though I’d caution you that the passive cooling system can result in a rather toasty Air if you really push things. And, more importantly for a workload standpoint, the system will throttle during resource-intensive tasks — but you’ll have to push it.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the five-minute, 8K clip we exported in Final Cut Pro. At 33:13 minutes on the Pro and 32:59 minutes on the Air, the end result was, honestly fairly negligible (the Mac Pro, meanwhile, blew them both away at a blazing five and a half minutes). Ditto for running a WebKit compile. That took 25 minutes and five seconds on the Air and 20 minutes and 43 seconds. That’s not entirely negligible, but both systems beat out the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro’s 26 minutes and 56 seconds. And both systems took far less of a battery hit, losing around 9% during the process, versus the 16-inch’s 39%.</p>\n<p>The new M1 chips are remarkably energy efficient, even when performing more resource-intensive tasks. In a video playback test, I got 16 hours of life. That’s less than the maximum 18 hours stated by Apple’s numbers, but it’s an impressive figure, nonetheless. I would certainly feel comfortable leaving the house without a charge.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2074098\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png 822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png?resize=768,301 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png?resize=680,266 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-14-at-11.04.20-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /></p>\n<p>Per Matthew’s numbers, the Pro fares even better. He was able to get right around the stated 20 hours. That higher figure likely comes due a higher capacity battery courtesy of the thicker laptop footprint. In both cases, however, the systems blew away last year’s 13 and 16-inch Pros, which got eight hours and eight minutes and six hours and 40 minutes, respectively. That’s a tremendous bump in an important metric.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2075072\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2075072\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2075072\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/geekbench-arm2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2075072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s break down those Geekbench 5 numbers.

A few relevant examples: the Core i7 MacBook Air from earlier this year averaged 1136, while the 13-inch Pro hit 1240. Running the Intel version of the benchmark (using the Rosetta 2 emulator), the numbers predictably took a hit, but still best the Intel systems. And, indeed, Intel-designed apps performed quite smoothly.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074946\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074946\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074946\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/final-cut-pro-time.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p>Most of the benchmarks we ran found the two systems scoring remarkably close to one another. In other words, I think it’s a safe bet a majority of people searching for systems at this tier won’t be bumping up against those kinds of limits too often. Those who do find themselves frequently performing tasks that challenge those hardware limitations are going to have the difficult choice of buying the new 13-inch Pro now or waiting the see what models like the 16-inch have in store.

While the category has long been its bread and butter, a case can be made that the company has surrendered some of that market to the likes of Microsoft’s Surface line and others. Apple made the case that the Touch Bar found it rekindling that relationship, but I think there’s a much stronger case to be made for a MacBook Air that can process much heavier workloads than its predecessors.</p>\n<p>And, frankly, I haven’t missed the Touch Bar. My primary laptop is a 15-inch Pro with Touch Bar, but it’s a feature that hasn’t really impacted my workflow — and it’s not for a lack of trying. I suspect that for those attempting to distinguish between the Pro and Air the missing feature will barely register. And besides, my favorite part of the Touch Bar addition — TouchID — is here as it was on the last Intel version of the Air. On a whole, I’ve found the ability to log in with a fingerprint more useful than scrolling through photos or emojis on the thin touch strip.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074746\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074746\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2074746\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ezgif-1-93eb04be7f24-1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"586\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>Speaking of touch — there’s another elephant in the room here. Obviously the touchscreen Macs some predicted didn’t arrive at the event early this month. Even so, it seems reasonable to expect that they will at some point in the not so distant future, with the lines continuing to blur between macOS and iOS. Look no further than Big Sur, which continues the recent trend of adopting key features from the mobile operating system.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074664\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074664\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2074664\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ezgif-7-4b3d456ba000.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"466\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074664\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>As I noted in my recent writeup of macOS 11.0, a number of features are practically begging for touchscreen interaction. Take the sliders in the newly added Control Center. Sure, the trackpad works fine, but it sure would be satisfying to swipe them over with a finger. This becomes even more pronounced when playing certain iOS optimized games, which now play natively on the M1. Take &#8220;Among Us.&#8221; I played the wildly popular social game on the new Air — and while the gameplay was predictably smooth, playing with the trackpad feels less natural than touch.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CgTDeGncJ2\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/macos-big-sur-is-now-available/\">macOS Big Sur is now available</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;macOS Big Sur is now available&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/macos-big-sur-is-now-available/embed/#?secret=CgTDeGncJ2\" data-secret=\"CgTDeGncJ2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In this implementation, you either have to use the pointer to control an on-screen joypad or simply point the character in the right direction. There’s also the fact that the game occupies a fixed window that you can’t expand to take up the full display. The M1 chip goes a long ways toward opening up the available Mac ecosystem, making porting an iOS app as simple as ticking a box to make it available through the Mac App Store, but in many cases, additional optimization for these systems is warranted particularly for more professionally minded applications.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074194\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074194\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074194\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074519411.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074194\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>As for the other primary input device, the keyboard is pretty much the same as the latest Intel Air — which is to say head and shoulders above early versions. That’s no doubt a dark couple of generations of keyboards Apple would like to forget. They were solid as a rock, and insufferably loud. They also caused a lot of users undue stress by getting jammed. The latest version of the scissor mechanisms are far superior to the early butterflies. I won’t go so far as saying it’s the best laptop typing experience, but it’s like night and day compared to early models.</p>\n<p>Another aspect that warrants mention is the webcam. It’s a feature that rarely warrants a sentence in most laptop reviews, but this is 2020. It’s a weird year with weird demands and here we are carrying out the vast majority of our interaction with other human beings over Zoom. It sucks, but it’s life. Many people have no doubt already invested in external webcams as part of the shift toward working from home. For the first time in — well, probably ever — webcams are an important factor in purchasing for many or even most people.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074094\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074094\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074094\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg 2020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg?resize=300,107 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg?resize=768,274 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg?resize=680,242 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg?resize=1536,547 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photo-on-11-15-20-at-11.35-AM-1.jpg?resize=50,18 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074094\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>Apple has, indeed, upgraded the camera for the latest Air — but not entirely. That is to say the sensor is the same, and the camera is still stuck at 720p. But the new image signal processor (ISP) included as part of the M1’s SOC design does result in a better image. You can see the difference above. Frankly, neither is great to be honest, but one is decidedly less bad than the other. On the left you’ll see the Air’s image.</p>\n<p>The resolution is still low, but the color — among others — is certainly improved. The white balance is more inline with reality and it handles shades better. I’m going to still defer to my external webcam for things like Extra Crunch panels, but for a quick meeting, sure, I’m fine letting the Air do the job. This would have been a perfect time for Apple to go all-in with a webcam refresh on these systems. Common wisdom says there are limitations on camera hardware give the thickness of the laptop lid, but if I had to venture a guess here, I’d say the company is looking at webcam video as another point of differentiation for Pro models.</p>\n<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2074739-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/wav\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/macbook-air-audio.wav?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/macbook-air-audio.wav\">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/macbook-air-audio.wav</a></audio></p>\n<p>The microphone, meanwhile, remains a point of distinction between the Air and Pro.

The M1 chip already displays some pretty dramatic performance gains for a lot of tasks, coupled with substantial increases in battery life, courtesy of decreased power consumption.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074191\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074191\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2074191\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-16-074419281.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074191\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p>There are some limitations worth noting on these models. Two USB-C ports appears to be the maximum in the current configuration and all three models currently top out at 16GB of RAM. If either of those are dealbreakers, the company will happily still sell you an Intel model for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>When Apple Silicon was announced at WWDC back in June, Tim Cook noted that it would take two years to transition the full line. That means we’re very much at the beginning of this journey and there’s a lot left to reveal, including how dramatically different the true Pro tier of MacBooks look.</p>\n<p>For most users with most needs, the Air is a fine choice. If I had to buy a new MacBook today I would pull the trigger on Air and upgrade the memory and storage for good measure. It’s a surprisingly powerful machine in a compact package.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MNt8ME7MEC\"><p><a
