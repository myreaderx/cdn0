Source: Kristian Pedersen Click to enlarge</p></div>\n<p>In Figure 2, Kristian made more room for the graphs by using two line category labels. I find the data values in Figure 1 to be very distracting. I much prefer the pale gridlines of Figure 2. If exact numbers are needed then the table can be included as well. His redrawing the figure shows that small changes can make a big difference.</p>\n<p>Note that the third column shows the change in the share of expenditures. These figures do not show the large percent change of healthcare insurance expenditures that some of the other entries emphasized.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:23:20 +0000","feedId":46447,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e71edd4ac90203cc91c8fd3553c6e1b3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Naomi Robbins","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/KP-300x214.png":null,"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/KP2-300x234.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602647166959}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 11:46:06","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 11:46:06","feedId":46447,"fetchDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 03:46:06 +0000","fetchMs":192,"handleMs":6,"totalMs":123507,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"9128a42e23caa7de0e7439c434c47fc1","hostName":"europe61*","requestId":"9ff7c0d0d5234fb3956bf7a494e62638_46447","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:41:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:04:20","id":46447,"name":"Effective Graphs","url":"http://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/feed/","subscriber":69,"website":null,"icon":"https://blogs.forbes.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-59-59-205_df10b0c8fbc25b62.ico","description":"[Please go to 'Settings' to change your Tagline]","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 11:48:10","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 11:48:10","id":null,"feedId":46447,"linkMd5":"e71edd4ac90203cc91c8fd3553c6e1b3"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602647166747,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":206,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":6,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":123264,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe69.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-023.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://europe70.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-027.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
