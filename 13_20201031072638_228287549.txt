This article was originally published in October 2014.</em></p>\n<p>Before folks sat around the TV watching <em>American Horror Story</em> or classic movies like <em>The Shining</em> and <em>Friday the 13th</em>, they gathered around the radio to listen to their favorite weekly programs. Many of them were comedies or dramas, just like today’s television programs, but there were also shows dedicated to the creepy crawly — auditory storytelling that made goosebumps rise and sent shivers down the spine. It’s often said that what you can’t see is scarier than what you can, and radio programs can sweep you up and create a whole spooky world in your imagination.</p>\n<p>With Halloween coming this weekend, there’s no better time to visit some of the scariest shows and episodes that old-time radio has to offer. They’re all available for free online, making for quality, affordable entertainment. If you’re interested in more, I strongly suggest checking out both <a href=\"http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RadioHorrorHosts.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.escape-suspense.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.escape-suspense.com</a>; both were immensely helpful in my research for this piece. I’ve broken it down by radio show, then given a few suggestions of episodes to listen to from each show.

The show presented literary works that were performed by Welles’ Mercury Theater company. The program was elected into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. While not focused on fear, two particular episodes gave some genuinely good scares:</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43742 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/orson.jpg\" alt=\"Radio broadcast about war of the worlds by Orson Welles. \" width=\"400\" height=\"418\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs0K4ApWl4g\">War of the Worlds</a>”</strong> — Originally aired as a 60-minute Halloween special, this episode gained fame for scaring many listeners into believing it was real. It starts with some nice music, but then, like a real breaking news bulletin, is interrupted with a frantic reporter. He states that scientists have witnessed strange explosions on Mars. The scientists believe it’s simply volcanic activity, but reality proves much more frightening. Set just like a live news program, the brilliance of this episode of radio cannot be understated. You’ll thank yourself for listening, preferably in the dark on Halloween night. After you’ve done that, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936594056/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1936594056&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\">read the 1898 book by H. G. Wells</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/49569777\">Dracula</a>”</strong> — This was the very first episode of <i>The Mercury Theater on the Air</i>. Although it aired in July, its horror is fit for Halloween. Orson Welles plays the roles of both Dr. Seward and Count Dracula. Hear the tale of Jonathan Harker being imprisoned in Dracula’s decrepit castle. Then follow the cast as they travel to England and try to solve the mystery of this unusual count from Transylvania.</p>\n<h3><i>Quiet, Please</i></h3>\n<p>With a haunting introduction, this show is known as one of the scariest/weirdest, but also most inventive, of old-time radio. While it didn’t get much notice when it originally aired, it’s become known as one of the finest radio dramas to ever have been produced. It only ran from 1947 to 1949, with around 100 episodes broadcast. For a long time only 12 episodes were available for listening, but then in the 80s, the majority of the rest of them were found and made available to the public. You can listen to all the episodes at the <a href=\"https://www.quietplease.org/\"><i>Quiet, Please</i></a> website.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.quietplease.org/index.php?section=episode&#38;id=60\">The Thing On the Fourble Board</a>”</strong> — This episode that aired in August of 1948 is widely regarded as the finest piece of radio horror to ever hit the airwaves. It starts fairly slowly, with a man, Porky, describing working on an oil derrick. His friend comes to join him for some pork chops, and they discover … <i>something </i>… that’s come up from a mile below the earth. I listened to this during the very middle of the day, and I still got goosebumps. It features perhaps the most chilling “voice” you’ll ever hear.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.quietplease.org/index.php?section=episode&#38;id=103\">Tanglefoot</a>”</strong> — A tale that deals with the classic horror niche of giant insects. A plumber finds a way of growing a common fly to giant proportions. It’s cute at first, as a pet, but as you can imagine, things get out of hand quickly. Some of the sound effects are so realistic, I had to actually do a double take that they weren’t coming from my house. The eerie music also provides some extra goosebumps and shivers. Don’t worry though, you can blame it on the cool night air.</p>\n<h3><i>Suspense</i><b><i> </i></b></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43744 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/sus.jpg\" alt=\"Logo of suspense. \" width=\"433\" height=\"230\"></img></p>\n<p><i>Suspense</i> was one of the most successful radio dramas to ever hit the airwaves, running for 20 years (1942-1962) and over 900 episodes. With so many episodes in the thriller category, it was hard to choose just a few highlights. With <i>Suspense</i>, at least in my opinion, most of the shows make it or break it in the final minute or so. The stories highlighted below made it more than any of the others.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.escape-suspense.com/files/Suspense.6.23.1949.GhostHunt.mp3\">Ghost Hunt</a>”</strong> — This particular broadcast set the stage for the genre of “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_footage_(film_technique)\">found footage</a>” horror that saw a revival in cinematic form in more recent decades. Airing in 1949, “Ghost Hunt” features the “found” recording of radio personality Smiley Smith’s night in a haunted house. Mr. Smith is recording the audio of his evening spent in the home with a paranormal investigator, and at one point even tells his audience to listen with the lights off. (I did no such thing.) You can guess what Mr. Smith encounters based on the title, but it has a twist ending that I guarantee you won’t see coming.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.escape-suspense.com/files/suspense_1943.05.25_Sorry,%20Wrong%20Number%20%28WEST%20COAST%29.MP3\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a>”</strong> — This episode of <i>Suspense </i>was its most popular and successful, eventually being not just re-aired, but <i>re-performed</i> seven times after its original premiere in 1943. It’s a fairly simple tale of a woman trying to call her husband’s office at night to check in and find out when he’s coming home. The telephone switchboard wires get crossed somehow and she ends up listening in on a conversation she definitely should not be hearing. There are some unintended consequences, and this story has another ending that will leave you a little bit shocked.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sVt-HX2vw\">House in Cypress Canyon</a>”</strong> — A young couple is new to the LA area, and needs a house to rent. They stop by a realtor’s office, find a place they like, and move in. All seems well, until they find a locked closet that has no key. They write it off, but in the middle of the night they hear noises, seemingly emanating from this closet. After closer inspection . . . and that’s where I’ll stop and let you listen to this episode.</p>\n<h3><i>Lights Out</i><b><i> </i></b></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43745 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/lights.jpg\" alt=\"A poster of lights out by Arch Oboler.\" width=\"300\" height=\"538\"></img></p>\n<p><em>Lights Out</em> was one of the very first radio shows dedicated to horror/suspense drama pieces. It ran for 13 years, from 1934 to 1947, and eventually transitioned into a television show. This series was actually so gory and grotesque at first that it had to be toned down once it expanded to a national audience (none of the highlighted shows below are gory — just incredibly suspenseful). Fun fact: this show was created by NBC writer Wyllis Cooper, who also created <em>Quiet, Please</em> once this show ran its course.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://escape-suspense.typepad.com/files/lights-out-1947-07-16-death-robbery.mp3\">Death Robbery</a>”</strong> — Actor Boris Karloff is best known for his work in horror films like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RXZF6C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B002RXZF6C&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Frankenstein </i></a>and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JQB7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B00000JQB7&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Mummy</i></a>, but he had the chops to perform on radio as well. In this episode of <i>Lights Out</i>, he plays a scientist whose specialty is bringing creatures back from the dead. He “robs death” from animals, hence the title. When his wife unexpectedly passes, he tries his scientific method on her, and as you can imagine, the results are less than pleasant.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://escape-suspense.typepad.com/files/lights-out---1938-02-16_murder-castle.mp3\">Murder Castle</a>”</strong> — An especially chilling episode, “Murder Castle” is unique because it’s based on the true story of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes\">H. H. Holmes</a> — the mass murderer who haunted Chicago during the time of the 1893 world’s fair. The story was made famous in more recent times by Erik Larson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375725601/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0375725601&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Devil in the White City</i></a>. This particular dramatization features a young woman, Ella Malone, who’s been picked up by police, and is muttering the word “revenge” over and over and over again. We then cut to a gentleman, Henry Stewart, who is interviewing a series of prospective housemaids and nurses who are promised a job, but ultimately have gone missing . . . Ms. Malone has an idea of what might be going on, and tries to dig deeper into the mystery all on her own. The menace in Stewart’s voice is masterfully done over the airwaves, and hard to convey in mere words on the internet. Give it a listen for yourself, if you dare.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://escape-suspense.typepad.com/files/lights-out-1942-12-15_knock_at_the_door.mp3\">Knock at the Door</a>”</strong> — There’s something especially haunting about a dainty-sounding woman becoming psychotic and pushing her mother-in-law down a well. This tale is narrated by Ella, our murderer, as she describes her descent into madness — how she married a nice fellow named Jay, how Jay brought his mother home unannounced to live with them, and how Ella soon felt pushed out of the way by their guest. Our narrator, after hearing some convincing voices in her head, pushes her poor mother-in-law down a well and seemingly doesn’t have to deal with her anymore. But oh how wrong she is when the fair couple hears a knock at the door while eating dinner one night . . .</p>\n<h3><i>Escape</i></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43746\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2014/10/escape.jpg\" alt=\"A painting of radio drama Escape.\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"></img></p>\n<p><em>Escape</em> is one of the later radio dramas in this list, running from 1947-1954, ultimately airing about 230 episodes. While not focusing on horror (it was more of an adventure series), there are episodes that definitely offer some quality scares. <em>Escape</em> is also unique in that most of the episodes are adaptations from short stories or even novels by the likes of H.G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Evelyn Waugh, Ray Bradbury, and even Jack London. The three below are perhaps the most chilling that the show offered in its seven-year run.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.escape-suspense.com/files/three_skeleton_key.mp3\">Three Skeleton Key</a>”</strong> — This rat-infested tale is set in a lighthouse on a lonely island off the coast of South America. Originally a short story, this adaptation first appeared on <i>Escape </i>in 1949, and it was re-performed three times on that show, and another two times on <i>Suspense</i>. Narrated by famous radio man Vincent Price, it tells the tale of three men who are manning the lighthouse. They see a seemingly deserted ship coming towards their rocks, and when the ship breaks on their island, they come to discover that the crew has in fact been taken over and replaced by hundreds . . . no, thousands . . . of <i>rats</i>. The squealing sound effects will have you squirming in your chair as you listen.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://escape-suspense.typepad.com/files/escape_1947.10.29_pollock-and-porrah-man.mp3\">Pollock and the Porroh Man</a>”</strong> — Originally a short story by the famed H.G. Wells, the tale opens with a man named Pollock being visited by a friend in London. The pair had traveled to Africa some months back, during which Pollock was a normal, if arrogant, fellow. Now, however, it was obvious to the friend that Pollock was disturbed — clearly the events in Africa had gotten to him. You see, Pollock had a curse placed upon him for stealing an idol; he tried to rid himself of the curse, but didn’t quite follow the necessary protocol, and was haunted all the way back to London. The friend tries to convince Pollock that it’s all in his head — but is it? There’s only one way to find out.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.escape-suspense.com/files/escape.1953.09.13.Abominable_%20Snowman.mp3\">Abominable Snowman</a>”</strong> — This story takes place in the Himalayas, on a fictional mountain where a group of men are hunting the fabled Yeti. What makes this tale especially enjoyable is that it’s one of the most believable; I’m not a Yeti believer, but there are plenty of folks who are, and it’s not as much of a stretch as many of these other tales. Going into the wilderness in search of an ancient creature is something that happens even today in real life, so the sounds of the Yeti coming through the speakers are perhaps more frightful than the far more improbably-gigantic fly scenario of “Tanglefoot.” It also combines the adventure genre with a tinge of horror, making it extra satisfying for those of us who enjoy some natural risk from the environment to go along with the supernatural.</p>\n<h3><em>The Mysterious Traveler</em></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43747 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/mysterious.jpg\" alt=\"The poster of The Mysterious Traveler.\" width=\"356\" height=\"279\"></img></p>\n<p>Functioning as a multimedia publisher, <em>The Mysterious Traveler</em> broadcasted a radio show, printed a magazine, and created a comic book — all of them telling tales that ran the gamut from mystery to sci-fi to pure drama. The radio show ran for over 370 episodes, from 1943-1952. Unfortunately, only 75 or so of those episodes still exist today for the public to enjoy. A couple of the most chilling are highlighted below:</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://traffic.libsyn.com/bounce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhwcdn.libsyn.com%2Fp%2Fc%2F7%2F8%2Fc78ad9befad43435%2FOTR_mysterious_traveler__good_die_young_02_27_1944.mp3%3Fc_id%3D1463958%26cs_id%3D1463958%26expiration%3D1552575738%26hwt%3D065a21d7de1e4173eb0b360e8c63d203\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Good Die Young</a>“</strong> — This episode could perhaps be the most unnerving of this list (and in fact was voted as such in a popular old-time radio forum). A father brings home a new wife, much to the surprise and chagrin of his teenage daughter. The new stepmother is loving, caring, even doting — but, she’s taken some of the father’s attention that used to be for his daughter alone. So, the daughter contrives all sorts of ways to get rid of the new wife, only to be met with understanding and compassion. One day, though, the daughter raises the stakes of her game and makes a terrible error in judgment. What makes this episode so unsettling is that the villain is but a child . . . does she turn her conniving ways around? You’ll have to listen.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://escape-suspense.typepad.com/files/mysterious-traveler.1951.11.06_behind_the_locked_door.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Behind the Locked Door</a>“</strong> — This episode of <em>The Mysterious Traveler</em> was the show’s most popular, and was repeated several times. Two archaeologists and a guide, exploring caves near Lake Mead in the Southwestern US, come upon an old wagon train that had been buried under a rock slide a hundred years prior. When the guide is attacked, the other two men must figure out what happened, and also find a way to escape the cave of horrors. Could it be that the members of the long-gone wagon train are haunting the place they perished in?</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/scary-old-time-radio-shows/\">The 15 Spookiest Episodes of Old-Time Horror Radio</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/eVW80JOmolY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 12:30:38 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1747dfe064f91b5a2cd4e29139c18d97","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jeremy Anderberg","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://www.escape-suspense.com/files/Suspense.6.23.1949.GhostHunt.mp3","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/oldradio-copy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn11@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-11-236_bc69c23445c38fb9.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/orson.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn32@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-11-196_cad053aa1baeb0ac.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/sus.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn75@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-11-169_5316aeee139d1609.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/lights.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn21@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-36-383_4f0563d00b2d4c9a.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2014/10/escape.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-13-325_8a52ae45986e12b0.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2014/10/mysterious.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn23@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-11-044_c7d6c68f2dcd5d6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/eVW80JOmolY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-11-080_41d30d730ff6bf8f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129169634},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:09","title":"How to Survive Being Buried Alive","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=129922","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129930\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3.jpg 1200w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3-768x1328.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3-888x1536.jpg 888w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3-1184x2048.jpg 1184w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3-320x553.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Buried-Alive-3-640x1107.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></img></p>\n<p>Medical practices have come a long way in the last hundred years. Case in point, the safety coffin. Also known as a security coffin, the safety coffin was a popular item in the 18th and 19th centuries. Its goal? To provide a way for folks who were prematurely buried to signal that they were still alive, just in case doctors made a mistake.</p>\n<p>Safety coffins typically featured a bell or a flag system connected to the inside of the coffin, below ground. If your buddies conducted your funeral a bit too early, you could let them know you were in fact still kicking and in need of being unearthed.</p>\n<p>Being buried alive is a terrifying and common fear (particularly if you have claustrophobia!), even if it is exceedingly rare in our modern world. Unfortunately, safety coffins aren’t around anymore, so if you’re buried alive you’ll have to get out the manual way; here’s hoping the coffin isn’t enclosed in a concrete/metal/plastic burial vault/liner, you’ve been placed in a flimsy wood box, have been buried in a shallow grave covered with dry, loose dirt — and possess zombie-like strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Like this illustrated guide?

But my guest today says that if we want to live a truly flourishing life, we ought to make time for study and thought long after we leave formal education behind, and embrace learning as something wonderfully useless. </p>\n<p>Her name is <a href=\"https://zenahitz.net/\">Zena Hitz</a> and she’s the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691178712/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0691178712&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Lost in Thought: The Hidden Pleasures of an Intellectual Life</em></a>. We begin our conversation with how the unique Great Books curriculum at St. John’s College works, and how Zena got her undergraduate degree there and then went on to pursue a more traditional academic path, only to discover the downsides of the modern university system and be drawn back to St. John’s, where she now teaches. From there we turn to what Zena argues are the hidden pleasures of the intellectual life, which include learning for its own sake as opposed to doing it to advance some goal, developing a rich inner life, and embracing the idea of true leisure. We then discuss how thinking and studying for its own sake is different from watching TV or playing video games, and how it can create a resilience-building, inner-directed refuge from an externally-driven world. We end our conversation with how you can carve out space for contemplation amidst the overload and noise of modern life, the importance of finding a community that wants the same thing, and how to get started with deeper study and reflection by reading the Great Books.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What’s unique about St. John’s College?

Receiving further training in multiple areas of survival and preparedness is essential for a positive outcome. Your level of training and preparedness and your distance from or ability to contact emergency care providers can mean the difference between full recovery, mere survival, or death. Be smart, be prepared, and live strenuously.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impalement injuries happen when the body is penetrated by the forceful impact of what is typically an elongated, solid object. This force can be generated by the person themselves, as when a person falls from a height onto a spiked iron fence, or the force can be generated by an external source, as when the debris/shrapnel from a strong wind or explosion is propelled into the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this kind of injury, an object with which someone has been impaled remains embedded. A bullet fired from a gun would not be considered an impalement, whereas a stab wound from a knife, with the knife remaining in place, would. An impaled object may be visible with some portion remaining outside the body, or it may be concealed and entirely embedded in the tissue. These embedded items are more commonly referred to as foreign bodies and are not the focus of this article. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While being a relatively rare occurrence, impaled objects present unique challenges for patients, first responders, and hospital staff (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345709/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and make for some gnarly-looking x-rays</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Individual management of an impaled object varies widely based on the size, shape, and material of the item, whether fixed or free, the area of the body that’s impaled, the cause of the impalement, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the many variables, however, an impaled object’s essential management is almost universally the same. And in all but the most minor instances of trauma involving an impaled object, emergency medical services should be immediately activated, if possible, or contacted at the earliest opportunity. Here’s what to do until you can reach/be reached by professional medical care.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Treat an Impalement Injury</span></h3>\n<h3>Do Not Remove the Object!</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve probably heard this before, and it is the fundamental element of managing an impaled object. Leave the object in place! Depending on the size, shape, velocity, and area of impact of the object, it is likely that one or more blood vessels have been severed or internal organs penetrated. The object, left in its place, fills the hole that is created and can </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">limit </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hemorrhage. When the object is removed, this void is no longer filled, and immediate, massive hemorrhaging can occur, internally and externally, quickly leading to shock and death. While external bleeding can be relatively simple enough to control, internal bleeding cannot (outside of an operating room) and is of particular concern. Depending on its shape and size, removing the object may also damage the affected tissue beyond simple blood loss. </span></p>\n<h3>Expose the Wound Site</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut off clothing and any gear to expose the wound site. Don’t try to manually remove clothing or equipment and risk causing further injury by incidentally manipulating the object. Instead, cut their clothing with trauma shears, use a pocket knife, rip things open Superman-style — whatever you need to do to expose some skin. You can’t treat a wound if you can’t see a wound. Don’t be shy; you can always cover the victim back up later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the impaled object is a knife, or another object resulting from an attack, take care not to cut through the hole created by the object, if possible. The clothing may be entered into evidence, and cutting through that hole can ruin the integrity of the evidence. If it’s an attack from the reincarnation of Vlad the Impaler, it’s already too late for you. Don’t worry about evidence.</span></p>\n<h3>Reduce Object to a Manageable Size</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be necessary to reduce the object’s size to a length that is more manageable for stabilizing the object and transporting the patient. A longer object can be difficult to stabilize and can cause more damage to the injury site since it has more leverage than a smaller object. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not always necessary to shorten the object. This is an example of a situation that requires some common sense and exercise of good judgment, as there isn’t a specific rule on when to leave it or reduce the size. In most instances, this should be done by a team of emergency medical providers and with the utmost care to prevent further injury to the patient. Clipping off part of an arrow after a bow-hunting accident could potentially be done if you’ve got a ways to go before reaching professional care.</span></p>\n<h3>Stabilize the Object and Control Bleeding</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-129900\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Treat-Impalement-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Treat-Impalement-1.jpg 1200w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Treat-Impalement-1-768x544.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Treat-Impalement-1-320x227.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Treat-Impalement-1-640x453.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The object needs to be stabilized to prevent further injury. Again, “depending on . . .,” this may be as easy as applying a “bulky dressing” (a thick pad or compress) around the object and securing it with rolled gauze, triangular bandage, or similar. Depending on the object’s size, a bulky dressing may require a lot of material, and in some circumstances you may have to get creative. If the object is visible through both sides of the affected area (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e.g., it goes in one side of the leg and out the other)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, stabilize the object on both sides. Bleeding can be controlled with pressure and may be achieved by the bulky dressing applied for stabilization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To illustrate our goal in applying the bulky dressing, hold a pen or pencil tightly in your fist with only an inch or two of the pen enclosed inside your hand. Move the end of the exposed pen and notice how much it can be moved, despite a tight grip. Now place fully 2/3 or more of the pen in your fist. Notice how much more difficult it is to move and how much less movement occurs. Our goal is to create a dressing that can prevent the object from moving, just as holding more of the pen results in less movement.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Treating Various Body Parts for an Impalement Injury</span></h3>\n<h3>Eye</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the impaled object is in the eye, take great care not to apply pressure to the eye. Apply a bulky dressing around the object, and cover both eyes. Our eyes track together, so if the right eye is impaled and the left eye can look around, the right eye will move with it. The goal is to prevent unnecessary movement, so both eyes must be covered. In this situation, staying calm and reassuring the patient is vital since you have just removed their eyesight. Another option is to use a small styrofoam cup (if you happen to have one handy) with a hole the object’s size cut through the bottom. Place the cup’s mouth over the eye, and feed the object through the hole in the bottom. Use rolled gauze or anything you have on hand to secure the cup on the injured eye and cover the other unaffected eye. </span></p>\n<h3>Head and Neck</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While rare, impaled objects in the head and neck have very high mortality rates for obvious reasons. A solid object being forced into the skull and brain tissue isn’t exactly friendly to life. And the neck — with critical formations including the spinal cord, multiple large blood vessels, esophagus, and my personal favorite, the airway — doesn’t like to be disrupted either. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite a high chance of death, there are several unbelievable stories of objects impaled in just the right way, even into the brain, that were carefully extracted with no permanent damage to the patient. Stabilize the item in the head with bulky dressing, secure it with circumferential wrap, and be very, very careful not to move it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the neck, securing a dressing with tape is the best idea. Never wrap bandaging circumferentially around the neck. An impaled object in the neck will most assuredly require advanced airway management by medical providers. Controlling bleeding and stabilizing the object is your goal. Since the neck has a lot of soft tissue and muscle, assist the patient in keeping their head still to minimize neck movement. </span></p>\n<h3>Chest and Abdomen</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the neck, the chest and abdomen contain vital structures (just about every one of our all-important internal organs). The danger of moving or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">re</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moving the object cannot be overstated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a chest injury, the main concern is impalement of lungs and heart, and major vessels leading to and from the heart. Even if the heart has been pierced, it is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possible</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the patient to survive with quick intervention and transport to a trauma center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a lung has been penetrated, you may discover what is known as a sucking chest wound. We’ll cover sucking chest wounds specifically in another article in the future, but here’s a quick rundown: When a hole has been created in the chest wall and into the pleural cavity (the anatomical space that the lung lives in), air is able to enter around the lung and cause it to collapse. As the pressure in the pleural cavity increases, this can lead to shock by preventing the effective filling and pumping of the heart. Sucking chest wounds are more commonly discussed in regards to gunshot wounds, but they can happen as a result of an impalement as well. A sucking chest wound can be identified by the sound of air entering the chest cavity and by bubbling, frothy blood at the injury site.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treating this injury when there is no impaled object is a much simpler task. The main idea is to seal the wound with an occlusive (air-tight) dressing. This could be as easy as saran wrap or the plastic wrapper from another dressing in your trauma kit. If possible, attempt to seal off the wound around the impalement with an air-tight dressing prior to stabilizing. If you don’t have anything available, don’t waste time on it. Focus on bleeding control and object stabilization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether a chest impalement is a sucking wound or not, wrapping the chest circumferentially should be avoided. The extra manipulation needed to wrap around the chest can cause further injury and wrapping too tightly can inhibit effective expansion of the chest on inhalation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply your bulky dressing and secure it with tape. Some men have hairier chests than others, and an abundance of thick man-fur can prevent the tape from sticking. While we carry razors in the ambulance for just such occasions, it’s probably not something you keep in your first aid or trauma kit (though you might consider adding it). You might have to get creative and do something like an improvised duct tape wax job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any chest injury (or neck injury for that matter ) is likely to mean the patient will have trouble breathing effectively. This can cause the patient to panic and is frightening to witness when you don’t know what to do nor have any way of fixing it. Remember to stay calm and provide reassurance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The abdomen houses a large number and variety of organs and the major vessels — abdominal aorta and vena cava — coming from and going to the heart. The liver and spleen can also cause severe internal hemorrhage if damaged. Stabilizing the abdomen can be difficult depending on the object and the physical size of the patient. Tape or gauze or other similar stretchable bandages can be used to secure a bulky dressing to the abdomen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving a patient with a chest or abdominal impalement is a concern and should be avoided if possible until EMS arrives. Keeping the patient flat on their back is best to prevent further movement and damage. If you’re out in the middle of nowhere, you might need to work on your skills with building a </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-improvised-stretcher/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">field-expedient stretcher</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<h3>Extremities</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the extremities have fewer and smaller blood vessels and no internal organs, they still present a real danger of life-threatening blood loss. Continue the same idea of applying bulky dressing to stabilize the object and securing it with gauze wrap. The advantage of the extremities, though, is that if bleeding isn’t controlled by your bulky dressing and pressure, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-save-lives-like-an-army-medic-using-a-tourniquet-to-control-major-bleeding/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a tourniquet can be placed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to stabilizing the object itself, it can help to apply a splint to the affected limb. Former combat medic Bruce West has a </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/save-lives-like-a-combat-medic-how-to-splint-a-lower-leg-fracture/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great article on lower extremity splints</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (with some helpful tips for trauma assessment, to boot). Reducing movement can be done with an extremity by isolating and immobilizing the affected limb rather than keeping the patient lying still on their back.</span></p>\n<h3>Exceptions</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are, as always, exceptions to the rules; here are a couple that apply to the general prohibition against removing the impaled object:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an object that has impaled the cheek, you can see both ends of the object, the only thing affected is the cheek, and the patient is awake and alert, you can generally remove the object safely (though just because you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, doesn’t mean you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Be prepared to control any (probably limited) bleeding in this case. EMS is (depending on their protocols) able to remove an object if it is interfering with the patient’s airway or their ability to use an advanced airway if needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the impaled object is in the chest and interfering with chest compressions during CPR, it’s okay to remove the object. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: it’s essential to make sure compressions are actually needed due to a cardiac arrest. Don’t be that guy doing compressions on somebody that isn’t dead yet.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Let’s say you’re at your local axe throwing chapter, and your buddy takes an axe dead center of his sternum and keels over. Ensure he’s actually dead, toss the axe aside, and get down on some chest compressions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea here is that if you’re doing compressions, the patient is clinically already dead. Any damage done by removing the object isn’t going to cause further harm to an already dead person. We’ve now moved on from “best possible outcome” to literal life or death.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conclusion</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this article only covers immediate, temporary care of an impaled object, there are a dozen other things that must be considered in a traumatic situation: performing a thorough physical assessment of the patient, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-treat-someone-for-shock/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treating for shock</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, treating other injuries, and more.
