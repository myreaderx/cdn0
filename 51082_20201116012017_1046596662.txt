It was awarded the “Best DSLR Macro Lens” in TIPA World Award 2020, but more important than awards and prizes are the words of praise from photographers using the lens in real world conditions. Being the first 100mm lens equipped with maximum 2x magnification, which stands out from the same category in its class, the <a href=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/laowa-100mm-f-2-8-2x-ultra-macro-apo-lens-for-canon-rf-and-nikon-z/\">Laowa 100mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO</a> gives macro shooters another level of intimacy with their subjects.</p>\n<p>Featuring an Apochromat (APO) design, the chromatic aberration at both ‘in-focus’ &#38; ‘out-of-focus’ area is suppressed to the minimum and the clarity and sharpness are greatly improved. The “ability to focus to infinity makes itself even more versatile”, says Venus Optics, adding that “not only is it well-suited for macro photography but also good for portrait shooting.”</p>\n<h4><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228993\" src=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100_pentax002.jpg\" alt=\"Laowa 100 /2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO for Canon videographers 2\" width=\"1420\" height=\"946\" srcset=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100_pentax002.jpg 1420w, https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100_pentax002-520x346.jpg 520w, https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100_pentax002-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1420px) 100vw, 1420px\" title=\"Laowa 100 /2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO for Canon videographers 12\">The Pentax K-mount version</h4>\n<p>The stepless aperture control available on this new version of the lens is one of the the most advantageous and essential features for videography, as it allows a smooth transition between each aperture level. The clickless aperture ring allows videographers to adjust the aperture smoothly and quietly. Additionally, there are 13 aperture blades assembled in the manual aperture version, giving a very softly diffused out-of focus rendering.</p>\n<p>The Pentax K-mount of the Laowa 100mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO is assembled with the automatic aperture coupling lever, which allows aperture control via the body of the camera. Users can either use the manual aperture ring or park the focusing ring at the “A” symbol and adjust the aperture via the camera. Exif data would be stored in the metadata as well.</p>\n<p>The lens is currently available to order in authorized resellers and in<a href=\"http://www.venuslens.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Venus Optics</a> official website. The ex-VAT retail price of both Canon EF mount and Pentax K mount in the United States is $449. Pricing may vary in different countries.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 13:00:23 +0000","feedId":51082,"bgimg":"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100stepless001.jpg","linkMd5":"d74436b8975e29635a9ef1fbfc04e74d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn93@2020_6/2020/11/16/01-20-13-596_642ecd389d2d8bcc.webp","destWidth":1420,"destHeight":946,"sourceBytes":97467,"destBytes":76064,"author":"Jose Antunes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100stepless001.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn93@2020_6/2020/11/16/01-20-13-596_642ecd389d2d8bcc.webp","https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100stepless003.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_5/2020/11/16/01-20-16-267_1f907a61f001d54c.webp","https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/laowa100_pentax002.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn25@2020_4/2020/11/16/01-20-16-095_cb6ad1792efcdd36.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605489551567}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 09:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 09:19:11","feedId":51082,"fetchDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 01:19:11 +0000","fetchMs":913,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":67111,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"25831ba229ab386e6c9fb33b53312d7f","hostName":"us-011*","requestId":"60676736c5d34a26bc4f150972daa0db_51082","contentType":"application/rss+xml;
