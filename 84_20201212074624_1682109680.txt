The early arcade hits all featured scoring mechanics and leaderboards, and there was a certain point of pride in putting your initials down as one of the highest scoring players on a certain machine. Games have of course expanded into all sorts of territories but that competition and high-scoring factor has remained strong. This was true when the iPhone released and mobile gaming started to grow too. In the very early days the OpenFeint service brought an Xbox Live-like experience to mobile games that featured leaderboards, achievements, challenges, forums, and more. Some of my favorite memories of the early days of mobile gaming are getting hyper competitive with players on our forums in a variety of games, or just watching from the sidelines as score battles took place between other expert players.</p> \n<p>There was one problem though. The number of people playing mobile games is significantly larger than most other pools of players on other platforms. You might achieve a score you’re pretty darn proud of only to find out that you’re in the 8 millions or so on the leaderboard. That’s not very fun, and even if you do outperform your best score and move up even hundreds of thousands of spots, is being in the 7 millions all that more meaningful than being in the 8 millions? No. Well GameClub is hoping to solve this problem while revitalizing the competitive aspects of some of the classic mobile games in their catalog. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leagues.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"590\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275308\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leagues.png 1024w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leagues-300x173.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leagues-768x443.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>They’re doing this with what they call Leagues. They <a href=\"https://gameclub.io/stories/introducing-leagues\">describe the Leagues as</a> “weekly leaderboards tailored to your skill level\" so instead of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people all competing for spots on the same leaderboard, you’ll be competing on leaderboards made up of smaller pools of players. There are 5 different leagues that you can move up (or down) in, and you’ll do that by finishing in the top 10% of players for the week in your current league in which case you’ll be bumped up into the next league filled with even stiffer competition. Likewise, if you finish in the bottom 10% of a league for the week, you’ll be bumped down to the league below. </p> \n<p>This is a smart way of doing things as it gives players who are hyper competitive and hyper skilled a chance to move up into the highest tier of league so they’re all battling against each other. If you only kind of care about competition and if you aren’t particularly skilled at a certain game, but still enjoy playing it, you can chill in whatever league you end up settling in based on your own skill level and still have a manageable pool of players to compare scores and compete with. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-2.35.12-pm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1208\" height=\"836\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275309\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-2.35.12-pm.png 1208w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-2.35.12-pm-300x208.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-2.35.12-pm-768x531.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-2.35.12-pm-1024x709.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Leagues are live right now in eight GameClub games: <em>Any Landing</em>, <em>Arcade Ball</em>, <em>Chippy</em>, <em>Flick Fishing</em>, <em>Hook Champ</em>, <em>Minigore</em>, <em>Neon Shadow</em>, and <em>Super Crate Box</em>. You also don’t necessarily have to be a GameClub subscriber to participate in them, as if you were a previous owner of any GameClub game you’re entitled to the updated version of it for free without needing to subscribe, and that includes the new league functionality. So if you owned any of the games I just mentioned be sure to grab its updated version from the App Store and get those competitive juices flowing again, especially in some of the old TouchArcade community favorites like <em>Hook Champ</em> or <em>Minigore</em>, and expect many more GameClub titles to get support for leagues in the future.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:28:29 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leagues.png","linkMd5":"6bccddf22fcb2b5dd6ff4883c8019457","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn27@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-04-828_53218ef0fe4d13c7.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":590,"sourceBytes":264802,"destBytes":264802,"author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leagues.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn27@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-04-828_53218ef0fe4d13c7.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-2.35.12-pm.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn61@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-06-372_aec342577ab4c1f3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759162873},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:46:02","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:46:02","title":"Celebrate ‘Gunship Battle Total Warfare’s 2nd Anniversary with a Series of In-Game Events with Plenty of Rewards Up for Grabs","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=275296","description":"<p>Joycity’s popular strategy game <em>Gunship Battle Total Warfare</em> arrived on mobile in 2018, meaning that it’s currently commemorating its two year anniversary.

In today’s article, we’ve got some interesting news items to look over from last night’s The Game Awards presentation. And that’s a good thing, because there aren’t a whole ton of new releases of note to look at today. We summarize them anyway, because that’s what we do around here. Things finish up with the usual incoming and outgoing sales, with some interesting titles discounted due to the aforementioned The Game Awards.</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>Sephiroth from ‘Final Fantasy VII’ Joins the ‘Super Smash Bros. Ultimate’ Roster</strong></p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBDLh35Buf4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>There wasn’t a whole lot of time to speculate after Nintendo announced the next <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> DLC character would be announced at The Game Awards, but that didn’t stop people from guessing. I didn’t see anyone actually predict Sephiroth, and I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad thing. Whatever you may think of the murderous silver-haired weirdo, he should at least bring with him another track or two of <em>Final Fantasy</em> music. <em>Maybe</em>. Sephiroth is scheduled for a December 2020 release, which doesn’t leave a whole lot of time for him to pop up. Keep an eye on the sky, because he could drop in at any time.</p> \n<p><strong>Capcom Shows Off Some Cool New and Upcoming Switch Games</strong></p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX_JDyVkgpE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Capcom has recently become aware that the Switch exists as something other than a place to dump ports, and last night that resulted in a couple of new announcements. <em>Ghosts ‘n Goblins Resurrection</em>, due on February 25th of next year, is something of a remake of and homage to the first two games in the series with some extra touches. I’m not fully sold on it yet, but I’m glad to see the series back in action. <em>Capcom Arcade Stadium</em> is also scheduled for February, and it will bring a total of 32 Capcom arcade hits to the Switch. It’s a free download that includes shoot-em-up <em>1943</em>, with the remaining selection available in DLC packs. Some rarities are included in the list like <em>Carrier Air Wing</em> and <em>Pro Gear</em>. Nice. Capcom also showed a new trailer for<em> Monster Hunter Rise</em>, which will release next year on March 26th. The game is looking drop-dead gorgeous, so feel free to feast your eyes.</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Warplanes: WW1 Sky Aces ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275275\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/warplanesww1skyaces.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/warplanesww1skyaces.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/warplanesww1skyaces-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/warplanesww1skyaces-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/warplanesww1skyaces-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Just as its World War II counterpart did before it, <em>Warplanes: WW1 Sky Aces</em> makes its way to Switch from the mobile waters. Naturally this one is more inclined towards biplanes than jets, lending it a slightly different feel. You get to fly more than 30 historical airplanes into a variety of combat situations, diving into three campaigns that show you multiple sides of the war. You won’t just be dogfighting, mind you. There are also bombing runs to deal with, among other objectives. This leans into the more arcade-like end of the airplane combat genre, but in that respect it’s fairly fun. I’m pretty sure you can try it out for free on your mobile device, so you may want to do that if you’re curious.</p> \n<h3><strong>Autumn’s Journey ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275276\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/autumnsjourney.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/autumnsjourney.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/autumnsjourney-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/autumnsjourney-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/autumnsjourney-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Here’s another visual novel from Ratalaika, a port of a game that came out on home computers several years ago. The heroine is a young woman named Auralee who has to help a dragon regain his true form by teaching him about humanity. Naturally, romance is a afoot. A-<em>claw</em>? I already used this joke a few days ago. Anyway, it’s a fluffy tale of love between a woman and a jerk-store dragon. Or a woman and a <em>different</em> dragon? Or neither? Multiple endings, friends. <em>Angelique</em> has so much to answer for. Not a bad little read for a fiver, I’ll say. Hardly amazing, but entertaining enough and decently-written.</p> \n<h3><strong>Splashy Cube ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275277\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/splashycube.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/splashycube.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/splashycube-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/splashycube-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/splashycube-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Hard to believe 2020 is nearing its end and we’re still seeing games with the <em>Verby Noun</em> naming pattern.<em> Flappy Bird</em> has so much to answer for. In this game you play as a little blob-eating cube that tumbles through colorful mazes filled with traps and hazards. Eat up blobs of the same color, avoid blobs of different colors, and try to earn a high score on the way to the exit of each stage. Plenty of levels have been packed in, along with some unlockable skins for that little extra bit of mustard. Seems like a decent bit of mindless entertainment.</p> \n<h3><strong>Persian Nights 2: The Moonlight Veil ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275278\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/persiannights2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/persiannights2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/persiannights2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/persiannights2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/persiannights2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Hidden objects? In <em>my</em> Artifex Mundi adventure game? It’s more likely than you’d think, friends. <em>Where’s Waldo?</em> has so much to answer for. This is a follow-up to the original<em> Persian Nights</em> game that came out a while back on the Switch. The story sees you trying to save your sister from a grim end in a magical land inspired by Persian tales and legends. The gameplay is essentially identical to what we’ve seen in the other dozen or so games from this publisher on the Switch, so it all comes down to how much you get into that kind of thing. Personally, I do not get much into that kind of thing, but the success of these games tells me that some of you probably are.</p> \n<h3><strong>Shady Part of Me ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-275279\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shadypartofme.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shadypartofme.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shadypartofme-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shadypartofme-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shadypartofme-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>A narrative-focused puzzle-platformer making heavy use of light and shadows for its visual identity? Sigh, okay. <em>Limbo</em> has so much to answer for. Silly gripes aside, this is a pretty decent game. Take control of a mysterious girl and her shadow as they make their way through what is probably a whole lot of traumatic memories manifesting as various things. Switch between the girl and her shadow to solve puzzles and move forward, as you’d expect in this sort of affair. The presentation is excellent, so if you’re not opposed to playing something that settles for competently doing things that other games have done before, you may want to give this a look.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Okay yes, <em>LEGO</em> sales.

Ustwo calls it a ‘Chillectathon’ and having played it for a bit, I can see why. <em>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</em> is an adventure game focussing on friendship, nature, and family and it is full of great music and lovely visuals. Alba is visiting a Mediterranean island with her grandparents but eventually ends up having to save the island and the wildlife on it. <em>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</em> has controller support but it plays great with touch controls in portrait mode. Watch the trailer for it below:</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-Eu9WE3grA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>So far, <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/09/24/apple-arcade-assemble-with- care-review/\">Assemble With Care</a></em> on Apple Arcade from Ustwo is one of the best games on the service. I can’t wait to see how <em>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</em> is beyond the opening moments. In addition to Apple Arcade, <em>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</em> is also out on PC via Steam. If you’d like to play it on Apple Arcade, you can get it <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alba-a-wildlife-adventure/id1528014682\">here</a> on the App Store. Check out the Steam page <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337010/Alba_A_Wildlife_Adventure/\">here</a> and the official website <a href=\"https://www.albawildlife.com/\">here</a>. Head over to <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/alba-a-wildlife-adventure-by-ustwo-games.412314/\">our forum thread</a> for <em>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</em> for more discussion. With <em>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</em> out now, 2020 is nearly done for Apple Arcade. What did you think of the service this year compared to 2019 and are there any upcoming games you’d like on the service?</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 11:17:38 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1528014682/100x100bb.jpg","linkMd5":"bf3454e6708a8386f4129ac71ee899ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn32@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-46-04-853_4c771caff3f5e852.webp","destWidth":100,"destHeight":100,"sourceBytes":2562,"destBytes":2562,"author":"Mikhail Madnani","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1528014682/100x100bb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn32@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-46-04-853_4c771caff3f5e852.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759162840},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:46:02","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:46:02","title":"Genshin Impact’s First Map Expansion ‘Dragonspine’ Arrives on December 23rd with the Version 1.2 Update","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=275287","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"https://toucharcade.com/games/genshin-impact\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1517783697/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> After releasing <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/18/genshin-impact-release-date-ios-android-pc-pre-registrations-free-mihoyo/\">Genshin Impact</a></em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1517783697?mt=8\">(Free)</a> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/10/30/genshin-impact-patch-1-1-release-date-ios-android-pc-ps4-contents/\">version 1.1</a>, miHoYo is back with another major update that will arrive later this month. <em>Genshin Impact</em> “The Chalk Prince and the Dragon\" brings the game’s first map expansion “Dragonspine\", new characters, a new seasonal event, and more. <em>Genshin Impact</em> 1.2 arrives on December 23rd for iOS, Android, PS4, PS5 (via backwards compatibility), and PC platforms bringing the new map, characters, seasonal event, and more.

I hope Sony and miHoYo can eventually allow players on mobile and PC to bring over progress between platforms including PlayStation. I’m also very curious to see how the game expands next year with the Nintendo Switch version.

Driving that point home even further, this week saw the surprise release of Image &amp; Form’s strategy RPG <em>SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1483051049?mt=8\">($9.99)</a> on iOS, and I just can’t get over how at home this title feels on mobile. You may be familiar with the <em>SteamWorld</em> series already by way of <em>SteamWorld Dig 1</em> or <em>2</em>, action platformers that (sadly) never made their way to mobile, or <em>SteamWorld Heist</em>, an extremely clever turn-based action game that <strong>did</strong> make its way to mobile in 2016 and <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/11/10/steamworld-heist-review/\">we thought the world of it</a>. Or if you’re really an old-school fan or into wildly obscure video games, maybe you know <em>SteamWorld Tower Defense</em> from the Nintendo DSi. </p> \n<p>Well <em>SteamWorld Quest</em> is quite a departure from all those. This is a full blown RPG built in the similar style to the other <em>SteamWorld</em> games but taking place in an entirely new world with new characters, and it tells a story that isn’t directly related to any of the previous <em>SteamWorld</em> games. Like the other games in the series though, the story isn’t the focus. It’s humorous and entertaining to be sure, but the meat and potatoes of any <em>SteamWorld</em> game is its mechanics and game loop, and this is where <em>SteamWorld Quest</em> really shines.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/abUmPVrMNyA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>The battle mechanics in <em>SteamWorld Quest</em> are card-based and are similar to something you’d find in <em>Slay the Spire</em> or <em>Night of the Full Moon</em>. Except here I feel like they’re even more polished and refined than any similar games. There’s just that special kind of sauce in the combat that makes you want to battle over and over and over again. And you get to battle <strong>a lot</strong>, and then collect and upgrade gear, progress your characters and the story, and more. It’s a full-blown RPG with oodles of charm filling in the gaps between some of the most exciting tactical battles you’ll ever have. </p> \n<p>If you need a little more, you can read what Shaun thought about the Switch version of <em>SteamWorld Quest</em> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/04/30/switcharcade-round-up-tons-of-reviews-including-steamworld-quest-boxboy-boxgirl-and-type-rider-todays-new-releases-the-latest-sales-and-more/\">in his full review</a> from last year. Like always, Shaun’s thoughts mimic mine in that this certainly isn’t a perfect game, but you can feel the developer’s passion come through and the card-based combat is seriously strong enough to carry the entire game. For less than half the price of other platforms, and for a game that I feel is much better suited to the touchscreen, you can’t really go wrong with <em>SteamWorld Quest</em> on iOS.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 01:44:20 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"33421f8af6531ece8c58d3d0881585a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jared Nelson","publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759162872},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:46:02","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:46:02","title":"An Hour of AirPods Max Hot Takes – The TouchArcade Show #473","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=275302","description":"<p>In this week’s TouchArcade Show we spend a concerning amount of time breaking down Apple’s latest product announcement, the over-the-ear headphones they’re calling AirPods Max.
