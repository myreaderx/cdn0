Ron Paul (R-Texas) <a href=\"https://campaign.ronpaulchannel.com/snowden/petition/\">launched a\npetition</a> calling for NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden to be\ngranted clemency.</p>\n<p>On the page on the Ron Paul Channel’s website where visitors can\nsign the petition, the former congressman says,</p>\n \nEdward Snowden sacrificed his livelihood, citizenship, and\nfreedom by exposing the disturbing scope of the NSA’s worldwide\nspying program. Thanks to one man’s courageous actions, Americans\nknow about the truly egregious ways their government is spying on\nthem.\n \n<p>The news of Paul’s petition comes on the same day <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2014/02/13/European-Parliament-panel-votes-down-asylum-protection-for-Snowden/UPI-48431392301754/?spt=su\">\nit was reported</a> that the European Parliament had voted against\ncalling for  Snowden to be granted asylum.</p>\n<p><em>The New York</em> <em>Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em>\n<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/new-york-times--guardian--urge-clemency-for-snowden-153422938.html\">\nboth</a> urged U.S. officials to grant Snowden clemency last\nmonth.</p>\n<p>According to the Ron Paul Channel, Snowden’s temporary asylum in\nRussia will expire at the end of July.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, Intelligence Squared hosted a debate on the motion\n“Snowden was Justified.” Speaking for the motion were legal adviser\nto Edward Snowden and ACLU attorney Ben Wizner and Pentagon Papers\nwhistle-blower Daniel Ellsberg. Speaking against the motion were\nformer CIA Director James Woolsey and former federal prosecutor and\ncontributing editor to <em>National Review</em> Andrew\nMcCarthy. </p>\n<p>Wizner said Snowden was justified “because he provided to\njournalists and through them to us information that we had a right\nto know and that we had a need to know. The government had not just\nconcealed this information, it had lied to us about it.”</p>\n<p>Woolsey claimed that Snowden had released information to\n“Hezbollah, Al Qaeda, Hamas, Pyongyang, Tehran, and so on.”\nThankfully, Ellsberg pointed out that Snowden released information\nto journalists who have since reported on the documents.</p>\n<p>Before the debate began 29 percent were for the motion, 29\npercent were against the motion, and 43 percent were undecided.\nAfter the debate, 54 percent were for the motion, 35 percent were\nagainst the motion, and 11 percent were undecided.</p>\n<p>Watch the debate below:</p>\n<p>  </p> \n </div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/hacker-news-feed-200/~4/jiGostIbJW8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 19:29:18 +0000","feedId":27398,"bgimg":"http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/_external/2014_02/credit-gage-skidmorewikimedia-1.jpg?h=187&w=280","linkMd5":"7fb5695a419a8002a86c850b58e7b4c4","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/_external/2014_02/credit-gage-skidmorewikimedia-1.jpg?h=187&w=280":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/hacker-news-feed-200/~4/jiGostIbJW8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_3/2020/10/13/14-03-55-516_afcb630421b044b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602597713686}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 22:01:53","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 22:01:53","feedId":27398,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:01:53 +0000","fetchMs":110,"handleMs":49,"totalMs":243870,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":50,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"fa10cf689958fca83c3f2c65b7f12392","hostName":"us-019*","requestId":"26ed24c0f21d41cd87779ead7ed167ae_27398","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":72,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx5oss":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:41:13","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:42:39","id":27398,"name":"Hacker News 200","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/hacker-news-feed-200","subscriber":119,"website":null,"icon":"http://news.ycombinator.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn48@2020_2/2020/09/06/20-42-38-240_f30e4f8a80f4b103.ico","description":"Hacker News stories with a score above 200","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 22:05:57","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 22:05:57","id":null,"feedId":27398,"linkMd5":"7fb5695a419a8002a86c850b58e7b4c4"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":72,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602597713458,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":180,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":49,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":121787,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":121858,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/hacker-news-feed-200/~4/jiGostIbJW8","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1,"destHeight":1,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_3/2020/10/13/14-03-55-516_afcb630421b044b4.webp","sourceBytes":43,"destBytes":72,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":27398,"totalSpendMs":888,"convertSpendMs":4,"createdTime":"2020-10-13 22:03:55","host":"us-51*","referer":"http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/13/ron-paul-launches-snowden-clemency-peti","linkMd5ListStr":"7fb5695a419a8002a86c850b58e7b4c4","githubUser":"myreaderx5oss","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"43 B","destSize":"72 B","compressRate":"167.4%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx5oss":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
