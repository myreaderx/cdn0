in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania on preventing all votes that are cast from actually being counted, with his latest dubious attack on mail-in voting <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-trump-tweet-supreme-court-pennsylvania-mail-in-ballots-misleading-2020-11\">flagged by Twitter on Monday as potentially \"misleading.\"</a></p>\n<p>In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 45,000 votes. This time around, however, former Vice President Joe Biden has been leading the polls there ever since he won the Democratic nomination — on the eve of the election, he's up by an <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/\">average of 4.9%</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of the pandemic, all Pennsylvanians are eligible to cast their vote by mail. But registered Democrats are far more likely to do so — <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/PA.html\">only 25%</a> of mail-in ballots were requested by registered Republicans — which could be in part because of unsubstantiated claims made by the president. The latest: that counting these votes, up to three days after the election itself, \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1323430341512622080\">will allow rampant and unchecked cheating.</a>\"</p>\n<p>The president repeated that lie in person.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">\n —Sam Levine (@srl) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1323459357015707649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Neither Trump nor his allies have ever provided a coherent explanation for how counting ballots could enable fraud, or why Democrats, if they were capable of stealing an election, would rely on ballots received after Election Day that are already subject to litigation. What they have done is explain that challenging the legitimacy of Americans' votes — stopping them from being counted — is central to their strategy.</p>\n<p>As Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-claim-election-victory-ballots-97eb12b9-5e35-402f-9ea3-0ccfb47f613f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_content=1100content=1100\">reported on Sunday</a>, three aides to the president have said he plans to claim \"victory\" on Tuesday night even if votes are not done being counted in bellwether states like Pennsylvania. Accordingly, \"Trump's team is preparing to falsely claim that mail-in ballots counted after Nov. 3 — a legitimate count expected to favor Democrats — are evidence of election fraud.\"</p>\n<p>However, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pennsylvania-elections-boockvar-night-calling-26c50dd8-54d6-4b20-aff7-c95bed472aba.html\">explained on</a> NBC's Meet the Press, \"elections have never been called on election night\"; it is news organizations, not state governments, that call winners and losers, the day of, based on exit polls and statistical probabilities.</p>\n<p>Last month, Pennsylvania's highest court upheld a policy of counting mail-ballots that arrive up until Nov. 6, so long as there is no evidence they were cast after Election Day. The US Supreme Court this week <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-virus-outbreak-campaigns-local-elections-pennsylvania-355f8dca7a34a4902f42d8f4931c419e\">decided not to hear</a> a Republican challenge to that ruling, for now deciding not to penalize voters for delays in mail delivery; it could revisit the issue pending future litigation.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, Trump called that non-decision \"dangerous,\" adding another claim about mail-in voting that sounded more like incitement: \"It will also induce violence in the streets.\" In-person, he repeated what appeared to be a threat: \"There's a lot of bad things that can happen with the streets. You're going to have a population that's going to be very angry.\"</p>\n<p>It is unlikely, albeit not impossible, that it will come to that. As of Nov. 1, 82% of Democrats who requested mail-in ballots have already returned them. The 2.4 million ballots returned overall is also equal to just under 40% of all votes cast in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If Trump loses Pennsylvania, odds are he's already lost it.</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

Who should you trust in a field that's largely unregulated, but chock full of professionals with an alphabet soup of initials after their names?&#160;</p><p>\"CFP,\" which stands for Certified Financial Planner, is one of the most common and respected types of financial advisor you'll come across. Generally speaking, individuals designated as CFPs hold some of the strictest certifications for financial planning, as established by <a href=\"https://www.cfp.net/\">the CFP Board</a>, the nonprofit trade organization that aims to set the bar for trust, ethics, and expertise within the financial planning industry.&#160;</p><p>The CFP Board believes that \"every single American deserves competent and ethical financial advice from qualified professionals who are required to act as fiduciaries,\" says CFP Board CEO <a href=\"https://www.cfp.net/about-cfp-board/leadership-and-staff/kevin-r-keller\">Kevin R. Keller</a>, adding that the organization's role is \"to set and uphold the Certified Financial Planner certification for more than 87,000 professionals in the United States. We exist, in part, to set standards that go further than the minimum requirements of the law, for the benefit of the public and the profession.\"</p><p>Wondering if hiring a CFP is right for you? Here's everything you need to know about them.</p><h2>What is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP)?</h2><p>First, it's important to understand what a CFP is not. Unlike the CPA (certified public accountant), the CFP is not a state-sanctioned license to practice. Nor does it indicate registration with a federal or federal-sanctioned agency, like the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEC</a> or <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FINRA</a>, which oversees stockbrokers.&#160;</p><p>Instead, the CFP is a professional credential set and enforced by the CFP Board. It offers those in the financial industry the opportunity to develop their skills, specialize, and continue their education to earn and maintain a prestigious designation.</p><p>It's also important to understand the difference between the general term \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-a-financial-planner-do-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial planner</a>\" and the Certified Financial Planner designation. Anyone can hang out a shingle and call themselves a financial planner, but it takes a lot of time and effort to become a CFP.</p><h2>How to become a CFP</h2><p>Earning a CFP begins with education. Candidates must have a bachelor's or graduate degree from an accredited college or university.&#160;</p><p>They'll also complete additional CFP Board-approved coursework for certification at one of 200 educational institutions. These classes span 72 financial planning specialties, such as investments, retirement planning, risk management, insurance, taxes, and estate planning.</p><p>When ready, candidates have to pass an intensive exam asking them to apply their financial knowledge to real-life situations.&#160;</p><p>Additionally, they have to complete either 6,000 hours of unsupervised financial planning services to the public or 4,000 hours of apprenticeship work with a professional firm, either before or after taking the exam.&#160;</p><p>Finally, they will have to agree to and conduct business according to the CFP Board's ethical standards, which include acting as a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-fiduciary-financial-adviser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fiduciary</a>.&#160;</p><p>Once they receive the CFP, they have to continue to meet annual requirements for ongoing certification.&#160;</p><h2>What do CFPs do?</h2><p>A good financial planner helps organize and offers guidance on every aspect of your financial life, including saving for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/automate-retirement-savings-2019-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retirement </a>or college, guiding your investment strategies; planning for big shorter-term expenses, like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/buy-a-house-by-35-monthly-savings-math-2018-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buying a house</a>; everyday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-manage-your-money-expert-budgeting-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">budgeting</a> and spending; tax strategies; insurance and estate planning.</p><p>\"A financial professional or financial planner is the person who asks you meaningful questions, allows you to answer, and then provides a framework for you to make decisions about your future,\" says Julie Genjac, Managing Director of Applied Insights at <a href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hartford Funds</a>. \"They educate you and connect you to resources, even outside of your financial life. They are your impartial sounding board, and can share stories of others who have experienced similar situations.\"</p><p>Often, professionals in a related field choose to earn CFP certification in addition to their main practice. You'll find CPAs, attorneys, insurance agents, and other legal, financial, or business professionals with CFP certification.&#160;</p><p>Others work solely as financial planners, wealth management advisers, analysts, or investment and portfolio managers. They often actively help you to invest or buy products, such as mutual funds and insurance.</p><h2>How are CFPs different from other planners and advisors?</h2><p>What makes CFPs different is the education, ongoing certification requirements, and practical experience they have acquired. They are also held to a high standard of ethics and expected to act as a fiduciary for their clients — which means they are ethically bound to deliver advice and take action that is in the client's best interest — and will back up that promise in writing.&#160;</p><p>Not all financial professionals are held to these standards. Professionals working for brokerages and financial services companies, for example, are often held to a lesser \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/financial-planner-vs-financial-adviser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suitability standard</a>,\" which only mandates that they recommend appropriate products and strategies.</p><h2>How much do CFPs cost?</h2><p>Pay scales for CFPs vary. Some work on a commission basis, meaning they get a percentage of the investment and insurance products they sell you.&#160;</p><p>Fee-only financial planners generally charge an hourly rate or a retainer, which is usually a small percentage of the value of the assets they manage on your behalf. Some may have a fixed fee for specific services. <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/second-kitces-research-study-real-financial-planning-process-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to a 2019 Kitces Research Study on Financial Planning</a>, the average professional charges $2,361 to create a client's written financial plan, for example.</p><p>You may also find planners that get compensated in a combination of ways: They charge fees for certain services and reap commissions for certain products. In fact, in 2019, the CFP Board changed guidance in its ethical standards to include fee-only, fee-and-commission, and commission-based compensation models.&#160;</p><p>Some feel the fee-only approach best fits with a planner's fiduciary ethos. Working on commission isn't necessarily a bad thing, though, as long as the planner is transparent about receiving them — and in what amount for which product or company. Those compensated via commission argue it keeps client costs down.&#160;</p><p>Working with a CFP may cost more than if you chose another type of financial advisor — not just because they tend to be fee-based, but because of the specialized education and increased experience CFPs offer.&#160;</p><h2>How do you find a CFP?</h2><p>Professionals who hold the credential use the CFP or CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER trademark as a way of identifying themselves, displaying it after their names. In addition:</p><ul><li>All CFPs are issued a certification number that can be verified through the <a href=\"https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFP Board website</a>.&#160;</li><li>The CFP Board's consumer website, <a href=\"https://www.letsmakeaplan.org/choose-a-cfp-professional/find-a-cfp-professional?gclid=CjwKEAiA9om3BRDpzvihsdGnhTwSJAAkSewLIgB1GH95lrTy3VJcGVIZSW8HPzAjHhIrZIMoPLldXRoCt3Pw_wcB&gclid=CjwKEAiA9om3BRDpzvihsdGnhTwSJAAkSewLIgB1GH95lrTy3VJcGVIZSW8HPzAjHhIrZIMoPLldXRoCt3Pw_wcB_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LetsMakeAPlan.org</a>, lets you locate actively practicing CFPs. You can search by geography, specialty, language, and other criteria.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.napfa.org/find-an-advisor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Association of Personal Financial Advisers (NAPFA) website</a> also offers a tool that allows you to search for professionals based on geography. This group requires members to be fee-only planners.</li></ul><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>CFPs have to complete years of education, thousands of hours of practical experience, and ongoing adherence to high ethical standards and certification requirements. As fiduciaries, they are ethically bound to put their clients' financial interests above their own. They also take a holistic approach to financial planning, looking at both long-term and short-term goals.&#160;</p><p>That said, though CFPs are held to a high standard, non-CFP financial planners and advisers can also provide you with the same level of ethics and professionalism.&#160;</p><p>What's most important of all: whether or not you can really connect with your advisor. This is often a long-term relationship and one that deals with very personal matters. So you should feel comfortable with who they are and how they work with you, regardless of the letters that are trailing after their name.&#160;</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-a-financial-planner-do-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What does a financial planner do?

They reportedly demanded money from Marugov, who owned the \"Meat Empire\" and \"Ozyorsky\" sausage factories.</p><p>The woman was able to successfully escape through the window and alert authorities from a neighbor's house, but not Marugov; his body was reportedly found with a crossbow next to it.</p><p>Per the BBC, Russia's Investigative Committee said the attack occurred early in the morning at Marugov's estate 25 miles outside of Moscow.</p><p>The assailants fled the scene in a getaway car, which was later discovered in Istra, a town outside of Moscow. A male suspect has reportedly been detained by police.</p><p>The Moscow Times reports that Marugov has been embroiled in a \"property rights conflict\" with ex-wife Tatyana Marugova since 2019; the duo had divorced about five years earlier.&#160;</p><p>The BBC identified Muragov as an \"oligarch,\" a term that in post-Soviet Russia came to refer to the new generation of billionaires who emerged amid the sudden privatisations of major industries during the 1990s. Many oligarchs, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin,&#160;<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-an-oligarch-126244\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-an-oligarch-126244\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">\"use their proximity to the authorities to receive super profits,\"</a> but it is unclear if Muragov and his sausage business have any such connections.</p><p>In addition, many of Russia's oligarchs have met with grisly ends in recent years, such as&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-boris-berezovsky-found-dead-2013-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-boris-berezovsky-found-dead-2013-3\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Boris Berezovsky</a>&#160;in 2013,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikolai-glushkov-murdered-exile-may-have-been-poisoned-before-2018-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikolai-glushkov-murdered-exile-may-have-been-poisoned-before-2018-9\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Nikolai Glushkov</a>&#160;in 2018, and just last year,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/uk/dmitry-obretetskiy-russian-billionaire-uk-death-gbr-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/uk/dmitry-obretetskiy-russian-billionaire-uk-death-gbr-intl/index.html\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Dmitry Obretskiy</a>. Also last year, in August, Marugov's son Alexander was killed in a motorcycle accident.&#160;</p><p>The rich have more generally been on edge about security concerns in recent years. As <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-spending-more-privacy-security-2018-11\">Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower reported</a>, some ultrawealthy individuals started prioritizing safety over flashiness and toned down displays of wealth.</p><p>\"Now, particularly with personal information readily available via internet and social-media sources, people are using what was once private information to learn where clients live — or information about their activities in order to seek personal encounters with them,\" Gary Howlin, the senior vice president of executive protection company Gavin de Becker &#38; Associates, told Hoffower.</p><p>And, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/luxury-panic-rooms-gun-violence-increased-demand-rich-people-2018-11\">as Business Insider's Katie Warren reported in 2018</a>, some super rich people had begun paying up to $500,000 for luxury panic rooms.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

business cycle reversal, Morgan Stanley is warning.&#160;</p><p>A decade of slowing secular growth and rising wealth inequality, paired with the failure of monetary policies to normalize growth is leading to a \"tectonic shift\" in US macroeconomic policy, the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's chief investment officer Lisa Shalett said in a Monday note to clients.&#160;<br><br>\"With policy interest rates at the zero lower bound on fed funds and wealth/income inequality at levels not seen since the 1920s, investors are turning to Keynesian approaches to break the logjam of excess supply and savings chasing insufficient aggregate demand,\" Shalett said. <br><br>Those \"Keynesian\" approaches could come in the forms of tolerating increased spending from the government and tolerating higher inflation, said Shalett.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-and-avoid-in-3-election-outcomes-stifel-2020-10?r=gr-sub\" data-analytics-position=\"5\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Stifel asked its analysts to identify stocks most likely to be positively or negatively affected by the election results. Here are the dozens of stocks to buy or avoid in each of the 3 outcomes.</a></em></p><p>\"The new business cycle, combined with a vastly different policy regime, should produce fresh market leadership centered on capital investment, infrastructure, housing, and a leveraged consumer sector,\" she added.</p><p>Shalett said stock sectors that will benefit from this shift include financials, industrials, clean energy, construction, consumer durables, and service-sector automation.</p><p>This shift will occur soon because of the current levels of volatility in the stock market, she said. Volatility within the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/vix-of-vix-index\">CBOE VIX volatility index</a> is at its third highest in five years. The last two times it reached these levels in recent times, Shalett said, structural change in the form of the Fed's reversal of monetary policy from tightening to easing, and the Covid-19-induced lockdowns happened. This time, the results could be even more pronounced.&#160;</p><p>\"We don't see recent market volatility as merely signaling a pause in the bull market related to temporary uncertainties, nor do we think it's an end-of-cycle repositioning that accompanies all recessions,\" Shalett said. \"Rather, we see market churning as a burgeoning recognition by investors of much more profound change in which government activism, spending and regulation are cheered by investors while debt, inflation and dollar debasement are acknowledged as necessary for economic normalization.\"</p><p>This profound shift means US Treasuries, the dollar, and overvalued long-duration assets are at risk.</p><p>\"Could the VIX volatility be signaling a structural shift or a shift in the business cycle?\" Shalett said. \"We think chances are decent of both, which is why we don't recommend sticking with yesterday's leaders.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Nearly 100 million ballots have been cast ahead of Tuesday's presidential election — more than two-thirds of the total ballots cast in 2016.</p><p>President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic is, of course, a key issue for voters. Although vaccine development is racing ahead and the US has significantly ramped up testing since the spring, the administration was initially painfully slow to distribute tests and personal protective equipment.</p><p>Trump has also been criticized for ignoring and contradicting top public-health experts. The president has suggested that masks are voluntary and erroneously blames increased testing for the US's high case count. His administration at one point even updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-coronavirus-asymptomatic-testing-advice-change-2020-9\">testing asymptomatic people wasn't necessary</a>, despite knowledge that asymptomatic individuals fuel transmission.</p><p>Biden, by contrast, emphasizes his desire to let scientists lead the federal coronavirus response. He has championed mask wearing and promised to further expand contact tracing and at-home testing.</p><p>Biden and Trump agree on many points, though, including that a vaccine should be free for all Americans. Biden also plans to set aside emergency funding for K-12 education and loans for small businesses during the pandemic — actions Trump has already taken.</p><p>Here's a rundown of how <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-coronavirus-plan-needs-strategy-to-unite-country-2020-9\">Biden's coronavirus plan</a> compares to Trump's actions so far:</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"COVID-19 response\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-TxaTe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TxaTe/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"763\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></div><h2>'The devil is in the details'</h2><p>Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the similarities between Trump's and Biden's coronavirus plans at the vice presidential debate last month.</p><p>\"When you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way,\" Pence said. \"And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing the vaccine — it looks a little bit like plagiarism.\"</p><p>The candidates do share several important priorities, but public-health experts say they differ in their execution strategies.</p><p>\"The devil is in the details,\" Dr. Leana Wen, a public-health professor at George Washington University, told Business Insider. For example, she said, \"it's not just a matter of the right to get a test — it's also the ability to get a test.\"</p><p>Experts say Trump's aggressive push to reopen schools and downplay the threat of the virus contradicted science-based guidance, including the White House's own safety criteria.</p><p>\"A lot of people agreed those [criteria] were very good, but the confusion was that, in my opinion, there wasn't a clear message from the top once those were directed. And, in fact, Trump himself seemed to undermine them,\" Marissa Levine, a public-health professor at the University of South Florida, told Business Insider.</p><p>That's part of the reason why Biden has accused Trump of having \"no plan\" to lead the country out of the pandemic.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f77da522400440019129cec?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump day US President Donald Trump departs a rally at Dayton International Airport in Dayton, Ohio September 21, 2020.

Actually, it's the opposite,\" Wen said. \"What you really need is to empower the locals to do their work, but you only do that by having the federal government provide the resources to do so.\"</p><h2>A clash over testing strategies</h2><p>The US has now tested more people per capita than most countries: around 370 out of every 100,000 people. But the Trump administration adopted a piecemeal approach to testing, leaving it to states to create testing plans.

Each weapon has its role and purpose and excels in certain environments.</p><p>The M2 Browning .50 cals are obviously cool and sling a huge round that can pierce armor and literally destroy anything it comes in contact with. But these benefits come with a price.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa065786f5b310011724e80?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter M240\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Spc.

Newer versions have corrected this issue, but historically, the weapons had to be head spaced and timed after putting a new barrel on, which is also a huge pain. Lastly, I've seen these weapons jam more than I'm comfortable with.</p><p>The Gau-17 Minigun is about as badass as it gets, but it has its limitations. For one, it requires electrical power, which creates obvious barriers. Additionally, when it jams, it typically jams hard and cannot be easily cleared. It is a very high-maintenance weapon that is no fun to clean.</p><p>In my opinion, the M240 meets all the requirements that you would expect of a high performance, heavy weapon.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa0657a69331a0011bc6cec?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Army paratroopers M240B Humvee\" height=\"1668\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>US Army Paratroopers train on a M240B machine gun, mounted on a M1167 HMMWV, at Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany, August 24, 2017.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Army/VIS Gerhard Seuffert</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>First, it's extremely reliable: In my experience with it, jams are not common and when they do occur, they are usually easy to clear — an important aspect of survivability. The M240 is also easy to jam feed, which allows you to keep your barrel on target and get back in the fight quicker. The barrels are light and easy to change out. Finally, their internals are not very complicated, making cleaning and maintenance a breeze.</p><p>I mostly shot the M240 from a mount, but we did do some training carrying them around. The point is, if your vehicle or boat is put out of service, you can take the M240 off the mount and keep going if need be. With an effective range of 1,100 meters, an M240 can reach way out.</p><p>After spending extensive time with each of these weapons systems, I would choose the M240 every day of the week and twice on Sunday. Its reliability, accuracy, and easy operational use are unparalleled.</p><p><em>Jonathan is a former Navy SWCC and Special Operations Combat Medic.

However, in October 2019, Lowey announced that she would retire at the end of her term and Jones found himself running for an open seat.</p><p>The district, in the northern suburbs of New York City, encompasses much of Westchester County and all of Rockland County. It is a mix of middle-class towns and villages, along with some of the most affluent communities in the country.</p><p>Jones, 33, grew up in Spring Valley, a village in Rockland County, where he was raised by his mother in Section 8 housing.

(Ritchie Torres, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/nyregion/maloney-torres-ny-congressional-races.html\">from the nearby 15th Congressional district of New York</a>, identifies as Afro-Latino and is expected to win on Election Day.)</p><p>Jones recently spoke with Business Insider about his campaign. Below are edited excerpts from that interview.</p><p><strong>Q. If elected to the House, how do you view your role influencing possible court reform measures that would largely be under the Senate's purview?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> Article III of the US Constitution vests the authority to create the federal courts and alter the size of the Supreme Court. There could be court expansion included in H.R. 1 [the sweeping voting rights and ethics legislation that House Democrats passed in March 2019, which was blocked by GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky], which is what a democracy reform package should look like. We have to add judges at all levels of the federal judiciary in order to insure that litigants get the justice that they deserve.</p><p><strong>How would you tackle the student loan debt crisis?</strong></p><p>For the vast majority of people, a college education is required, while wages have stagnated. The cost of college and amount of debt that people carry after graduation has significantly increased.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9e45f069331a0011bc6953?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mondaire-Jones-3\" height=\"3605\" width=\"5407\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jones speaks at a Black Lives Matter rally in Irvington, New York.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Kevin Hagen</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>My proposal is to make sure that all public colleges and universities are tuition-free, while forgiving the college debt that current exists. It will liberate an entire generation to fully participate in the economy.</p><p><strong>What would you say to those who feel that tuition-free college can't be accomplished?</strong></p><p>The data shoes that debt forgiveness is a boon to the economy. We're already paying for not making college affordable and accessible to all. The student debt crisis at the undergraduate level is $1.7 trillion nationally, yet we passed a COVID-19 relief bill earlier this year that involved spending more than that.</p><p><strong>There hasn't been a stimulus measure signed into law since this April, with little relief in sight to unemployed Americans and small businesses. What would your ideal stimulus package look like?</strong></p><p>It has to be <a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406440\">some iteration of what [Congresswoman] Maxine Waters proposed</a>. Until the coronavirus crisis is over, there would be monthly checks of $2,000 for every adult and $1,000 for each child, as opposed to a one-time check. The previous bill [CARES Act] didn't even take into account college students. There would be rental assistance for our small businesses, many of which are really struggling right now. [Washington State Congresswoman] Pramila Jayapal's Paycheck Guarantee Act would ensure that people remain employed with their salary and benefits. The package has to include trillions in aid for state and local municipalities that are really struggling to provide essential government services.</p><p><strong>What are some environmental priorities that you'd like to see in the US?</strong></p><p>Investing in green infrastructure would create 20 million new jobs. Incinerators are often built in majority-minority communities, resulting in higher asthma rates for residents. We have to tackle environmental injustice and racism, which means prioritizing investments in underserved communities impacted by adverse decisions.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/mondaire-jones-new-york-17th-district-house-congressional-election-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=B4AaAODBYHI:QRxnhxcrvrA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/B4AaAODBYHI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:42:52 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f9e96bd69331a0011bc6967?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"db7a36a83b72a49163a72c3af4a7b3a2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn47@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-35-503_89227f644f87c21e.webp","destWidth":4949,"destHeight":3712,"sourceBytes":381662,"destBytes":381662,"author":"insider@insider.com (John L.

TJ Cox</strong> and Republican <strong>David Valadao</strong> are set for a rematch in California's 21st Congressional District as Valadao looks to reclaim the House seat he once held for three terms. In 2018, Cox defeated Valadao by only 862 votes, a margin of 0.8 percentage points, in a tightly contested race.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Rep. TJ Cox is a California native <a href=\"https://tjcoxforcongress.com/about-tj\">campaigning for reelection on a platform</a> of immigration policy reform, supporting schools, and healthcare for all, and has consistently hammered Valadao on his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Previously an engineer working on water conveyance systems and dams, Cox has introduced <a href=\"https://cox.house.gov/media/press-releases/representative-tj-cox-secures-wins-central-valley-water-house-infrastructure\">multiple bills</a> and passed one item of legislation to increase the quality of central California's drinking water and river restoration infrastructure.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f283b665af6cc11ed0805a6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"TJ cox at rally\" height=\"1758\" width=\"3516\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Democratic Rep. TJ Cox (CA-21).\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mario Tama/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Valadao, a former member of the California State Assembly and farmer, has been in politics for most of his life. The son of Portuguese immigrants, Valadao noted that he <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/political-notebook/article86701207.html\">could not support</a> then-candidate Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency in 2016. But after President Trump was elected, Valadao voted in line with the president 97.9% of the time <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/david-g-valadao/\">according to FiveThirtyEight</a>, and is supporting Trump in 2020.&#160;</p><p>Cox has faced some scrutiny and controversy in his short tenure in Congress for <a href=\"https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/2020/02/19/tj-cox-david-valadao-face-questions-business-dealings/4787198002/\">owing over $140,000 in unpaid federal taxes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article234047417.html\">and owing tens of thousands of back wages to workers,</a> initially failing to disclose some of his financial holdings, and, <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/political-notebook/article219337805.html\">as the Fresno Bee reported</a>, listing two separate primary residences in Maryland and California for tax purposes, which Cox explained as an \"honest mistake\" and subsequently fixed. He eventually did pay back employee back wages.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article240603301.html\">Bee has now endorsed Valadao over Cox in the race</a>, writing: \"While Cox has sponsored or cosponsored useful legislation in his first term, the financial revelations raise questions about Cox's credibility. Voters should retire Cox and bring back Valadao, who is once again seeking the seat.\"</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-house-elections-results\">See Insider's full coverage of the race for the House of Representatives</a></h3><h2>The district</h2><p>Located in the south-central region of California, the state's 21st Congressional District comprises Kings County and portions of Tulare, Kern, and Fresno counties. A little over 70% of the district is Hispanic and has a median household income of $37,228, according to the 2010 US Census.</p><p>The district backed President Barack Obama by 11 points in 2012 and voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by a margin of over 15 points in 2016, <a

money race</h2><p>According to campaign finance filings, the incumbent, Cox, <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8CA10167/\">has raised</a> $5.1 million, spent $4.6 million, and has around $535,000 in cash on hand. <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA20094/\">His opponent, Valadao</a>, raised $3.7 million in the same period of time, spent $2.9 million, and has around $931,600 on hand.&#160;</p><h2>What some of the experts say</h2><p>The race between Cox and Valadao is rated as a \"toss-up\" by <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">The

brightness, and was one of the most affordable options we looked at.</strong></li></ul><p>Everyone needs a good flashlight. Even if you don't camp, use one professionally, or spend much time outside at night, a bright, reliable flashlight is an essential part of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-emergency-kit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency preparedness</a> and is just plain handy to have around the house. If the power ever goes out, each family member should have access to a light to guide them to safety. Fortunately, these useful tools have come a long way in the last decade.</p><p>\"The transition many years ago from incandescent bulbs was a huge leap forward,\" Jake Keller, head training advisor for the <a href=\"http://mcsosar.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multnomah County (Oregon) Sheriff's Office Search &#38; Rescue Team</a> told Business Insider. \"LED lights help extend battery life and durability and require fewer battery changes. The technology continues to improve, and now you're seeing things like low-level red lights incorporated into a normal light, as well as more rechargeable options.\"</p><p>Since LEDs dominate the industry of late and remain superior to older models, the flashlights featured in this guide are only of the LED variety. This isn't to say older models aren't still feasible options but when boiling it down to the best, LED wins in every category.&#160;</p><h2>How to shop for a flashlight</h2><p>When choosing a flashlight, there are a number of factors Keller recommends considering: \"In an everyday carry application, I look for something small that easily fits into a pocket. I'd sacrifice an adjustable focus and battery life in favor of something small, bright, and quick to use.\"</p><p>During my tests, I paid special attention to brightness, ease of use, and size, but since different users have diverse needs, I also looked at battery runtime and adjustable focus abilities.

When fully charged, the light was the brightest of all of the flashlights we tested. But after 10 minutes on its Turbo mode, the lumens dropped dramatically. Still, after the 90-minute test period, the A7 was one of the brightest models.</p><p>The A7 has five brightness modes including a Firefly mode, which is its dimmest at a reported 0.5 lumens, and a battery runtime of 108 days. Turbo is the brightest and is meant for short periods of ultra-brightness. There's also a Strobe mode, which has a high lumen output.&#160;</p><p>I like that the mode switching button is separate from the on/off button. This lets you easily keep the light set to your favorite mode and not have to cycle through each time you turn it on. Also, the anodized aluminum body (AL 6061-T6) surrounding the on/off button is raised, which makes it difficult to accidentally turn the unit on while it's in a backpack or pant pocket. And, at 4.5 inches long and one inch in diameter, it's easy to stow.</p><p>The Wowtac A7 didn't exactly wow during the durability tests as the light went out during the drop test &#8212; though it did start working again once I picked it up. The light has an IPX8 waterproof rating, which proved accurate as it handled full submersion without any impact on its performance.&#160;</p><p>I'd have liked to see a more common battery used in the A7, too. Instead, it operates on a 18650 battery. But, the rechargeable Li-ion Wowtac brand battery that it comes with lasted 10 hours on top brightness. Plus, charging the device is simple with the included micro USB charging cord.</p>\n\tThe best budget flashlight\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa08a9e1df1d5001821875b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dorcy flashlight\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>The </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F7PDK1O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00F7PDK1O&#38;linkId=b20b139eb933f27a2507931ce96afed0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Dorcy Floating Flashlight</strong></a><strong> is an affordable option that performs surprisingly and is not only waterproof but can float, too.</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Affordable, easy-to-use, floats, waterproof, built-in carabiner, long-lasting battery with consistent brightness</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Only one brightness mode</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F7PDK1O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00F7PDK1O&#38;linkId=b20b139eb933f27a2507931ce96afed0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Dorcy Floating Flashlight</a> is one impressive flashlight that costs less than just $20. It's the only light in our tests that floats, and it can handle being submerged without malfunctioning &#8212; though we weren't able to track down an IP rating. The waterproof properties make the light ideal for boats, around the pool, or in other wet areas. Its hard-plastic body is also quite durable passing the drop test with ease.&#160;</p><p>However, at 6.5 inches long and 2.5 inches in diameter, it only fits in larger pockets but does have a clip on the end for easy attachment to your belt loop or a rope.</p><p>Another downside is that there's only one brightness setting, though it doesn't dim much over time. After 90 minutes, it was among the top four brightest flashlights in this guide. The Dorcy Floating Flashlight has a manufacturer-reported beam distance of 67 meters and runs on 3 common AA batteries, which are included. And, I found the batteries last for roughly 40 hours of continuous use.&#160;</p><p>The on/off button is designed to make it hard to accidentally turn it on when you toss it in a bag. This is important because an easily engage on/off button could kill the battery before you have a chance to use your flashlight &#8212; which is a major consideration for hikers and backpackers. The button even functioned well when I wore thick gloves.&#160;</p><p>I also put the flashlight on a 15-percent incline to see if it would roll away, a concern when doing work in uneven terrain. The rubber surrounding the lens kept the Dorcy light in place.</p>\n\tThe best dual power flashlight\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2c44a15af6cc385a1c6862?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Coast 600R\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>The </strong><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1440274-REG/coast_20518_polysteel_600r_rechargeable_pure.html/BI/20673/KBID/15977/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x924614/SID/EZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Coast 600R Waterproof Flashlight</strong></a><strong> produces a strong beam of light with adjustable focus whether you operate it using the rechargeable battery or alkaline batteries.</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Operates using either rechargeable or 4 AA batteries, excellent performance in our brightness and durability tests, IPX8 waterproof rating, easy to operate with heavy gloves on</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>It's a pain to switch between modes, rolls easily</p><p>When a rechargeable battery runs out of juice, you don't want to sit around for hours waiting for it to recharge.

Plus, the rechargeable battery powers up using a standard micro USB charging cable that comes with the device.</p><p>The performance was also among the best in my tests. While the lumens decreased significantly after 40 minutes of operating on high, the light was still impressive after 90 minutes when drawing on either power source. The performance of the alkaline batteries appears to be better, and the light was still producing a decent beam after more than 72 hours of continuous operation.</p><p>At 8 inches long, it's one of the bigger flashlights in this guide, but it's also quite durable. On the drop test, the light didn't go out, though the stainless-steel body did make a small nick on the floor. The IPX8 waterproof rating also checked out.&#160;</p><p>The beam distance according to the manufacturer is a max of 247 meters, and it has an adjustable focus for when you want to direct your light to a specific spot. There are three brightness modes, which are a little cumbersome to switch through since you not only have to cycle through the modes, but the light also turns off between each mode.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best flashlight for long-term brightness\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2c44b158c24d3ac9595552?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Thrunite Flashlight\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>If you want a light that starts bright and stays bright for up to two hours, the </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JLKWQBR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07JLKWQBR&#38;linkId=6b648e01ec1f6bc30a2f5366b24de6fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>ThruNite TC15 Ultra-Bright Flashlight</strong></a><strong> is your best bet.</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very bright, 5 brightness options plus strobe, IPX8 waterproof, handled a drop from 10 feet, 246-meter beam distance</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Uses a 18650 battery, gets incredibly hot after a while on max, power/mode selector button could be better</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JLKWQBR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07JLKWQBR&#38;linkId=6b648e01ec1f6bc30a2f5366b24de6fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">ThruNite TC15 Ultra-Bright Flashlight</a> is a durable and powerful little light. At 5 inches long by 1 inch in diameter, it's small enough to fit in your pocket while its heavy-duty anodized aluminum (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6061_aluminium_alloy\">T6061-T6</a>)&#160; body is IPX8 waterproof resistant and can handle being submerged in water. The flashlight also withstood a 10-foot drop without a problem.</p><p>In the brightness tests, the TC15 did an extraordinary job. It just missed out on being the brightest from the start, and it only dimmed slightly over the course of the next hour and a half. It was the brightest by far at the end of the testing period.&#160;</p><p>There are five brightness levels plus a strobe mode effect. ThruNite warns against running the flashlight on max brightness for more than ten minutes to protect the battery and I found this to be good advice, especially since the light gets too hot to hold when you keep it on Turbo for an extended period.</p><p>Though it performed well, there were a few downsides. You need a 18650 battery to operate the flashlight. Fortunately, the TC15 does come with a rechargeable ThruNite brand 3100mAh battery and a micro USB charge cord. Since the light runs so bright, the battery lasted less than two hours on top mode. You likely won't use that high for long, and the dimmer modes lasted much longer.</p><p>The last negative is the on/off/mode selector button: It's very easy to accidentally turn it on. Switching between modes isn't intuitive, either. For instance, to engage Turbo mode, you double click the button. For strobe, you double click again. If you don't use the flashlight often, you'll want to keep the user manual handy.</p>\n\tThe best penlight\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2c44d60ef1883b9a70654c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Coast HP3R\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>The </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UP3TOEA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00UP3TOEA&#38;linkId=bf9b1093172d6f33c18d5707f538566c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Coast HP3R Penlight</strong></a><strong> is compact enough to keep in your pocket on a daily basis and provides an adjustable focus light right where you need it.</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Dual power &#8211; 2 AAA batteries and rechargeable Li-ion, long battery life, adjustable beam focus, passed our drop test, doesn't roll easily</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Limited lighting modes, only IPX4 water-resistant, easy to accidentally turn on</p><p>Due to their compact size, penlights tend not to perform as well as other flashlights. However, if you need a light that directs a bright beam right where you need and is easy to pop into your shirt or pants pocket, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UP3TOEA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00UP3TOEA&#38;linkId=bf9b1093172d6f33c18d5707f538566c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Coast HP3R Penlight</a> does an excellent job.&#160;</p><p>Based in Portland, Oregon, Coast focuses on LED lights for professionals, such as law enforcement, search and rescue teams, and oil rig workers. Jake Keller, the SAR trainer we interviewed for this article, lists Coast as one of a handful of brands he highly recommends. And, the company backs its products with <a href=\"https://coastportland.com/pages/warranty\">a lifetime warranty</a> against defects in workmanship and materials.&#160;</p><p>What I like most about the HP3R is that it operates on 2 AAA alkaline batteries or using the included Li-ion rechargeable battery, which charges using a standard micro USB charging cord. The alkaline batteries (which are included) lasted much longer than the rechargeable (72+ hours vs. 6 hours on high), but the rechargeable batteries produced a brighter beam.</p><p>Neither power source was particularly bright compared to the full-size flashlights, but thanks to the adjustable lens, you can direct the beam right where you want it &#8212; and the beam distance is up to 93 meters.</p><p>Though the light is only IPX4 water-resistant, which means it's protected from splashes of water from any direction but can't handle submersion, the anodized aluminum body handled the drop test with no effects on its performance.&#160;</p><p>The biggest negatives were that the penlight is easy to accidentally turn on, and it takes some practice to get the hang of adjusting between its two brightness options. The mode sequence as you press the power/mode selector button is high-off-low-off-high. However, if the light is off for a few seconds, the light remembers the last mode you were in. So, if you habitually use high brightness, you don't need to cycle through modes each time you turn the light on.</p>\n\tWhat else was considered\n\t\n\t<p>I looked at several flashlight brands and models while researching this guide and the following just missed the cut but are still worth considering.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QW842D6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07QW842D6&#38;linkId=0286645919462696a86bfaa93529ab31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>ThruNite T1</strong></a><strong> ($39.99): </strong>There's a lot to like about the T1. It has four brightness options plus strobe, is made with durable T6061-T6 aircraft-grade anodized aluminum that stood up to the drop test, and it's IPX8 waterproof. Plus, it was the smallest light I tested at just 2.5 inches long, 1 inch in diameter, and 2.5 ounces. It also gets quite bright and maintains its brightness. It wasn't included because it relies on an uncommon 18350 rechargeable battery that has a short runtime. It was also a pain switching between light modes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08H1P6L4T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08H1P6L4T&#38;linkId=fee9370083f8afa31b67fc858d9fedc2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>ThruNite Archer 2A</strong></a><strong> ($29.99): </strong>The Archer 2A is similar to the T1 in a lot of ways: Similar durable body material, same waterproof rating, and the same brightness/strobe modes. The biggest differences are that the Archer 2A is more of a penlight with a body that's 6 inches long and &#190; inches in diameter. And, the 2A relies on 2 AA batteries for operation, which are easier to switch out but didn't perform as well in the brightness tests, which is a big reason why it didn't make it into the guide.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08622QMT3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B08622QMT3&#38;linkId=baacf2795abc8f8e915999847802b1e4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Coast SX300R</strong></a><strong> ($59.99): </strong>The SX300R is all about options. It operates using a rechargeable Li-ion battery or 4 AAA batteries. The body extends to access LED lights incorporated into the body with white, red, and flashing red modes. The tail cap features a strong magnet allowing you to stick the flashlight where you want it. It's not included in the guide because it isn't waterproof, the light went out in our drop test, and it's easy to accidentally turn on. However, you might overlook these negatives if you need a good area light.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KH2JP5G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01KH2JP5G&#38;linkId=60ba7fbe30d65460c7b6a52a9072da9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Anker Bolder LC90</strong></a><strong> ($29.99): </strong>This was one of the top performers in the brightness test starting out bright and maintaining a strong lumen output. It has adjustable focus and three brightness settings, including a strobe and SOS function. Unfortunately, it's a bit cumbersome to switch between the light modes and is easy to accidentally turn on.&#160; Plus, it isn't waterproof, rolls easily, and relies on a relatively uncommon 18650 battery.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PH79G8B/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07PH79G8B&#38;linkId=f033c1f387776502ff075489e1e3b808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Headspin</strong></a><strong> ($135.99): </strong>If you like camping, you should consider this versatile light. The Headspin has a small base light that attaches to one of four mounts: Headlamp, magnet, bike, and flashlight. I was unimpressed with the rechargeable battery, which can't be switched out and only lasted for 90 minutes on high. To its credit, the lumen output didn't decrease much during the runtime. Also, I didn't like that it isn't waterproof, just IP66 water-resistant.</p>\n\tHow we test\n\t\n\t<p>There are several tests I put each model through to thoroughly review each option. The most important factors to consider are <strong>brightness</strong>,&#160;<strong>battery power, light modes,&#160;</strong>and&#160;<strong>durability.</strong> Here's how I considered each of those factors while testing:</p><p><strong>Brightness: </strong>I used a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A0ETXY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_101617_best-flashlights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B005A0ETXY&#38;linkId=881681949e79fb5b014cc2ca83a9ed94\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">light meter</a> and an old mattress box to measure the lumens of each flashlight. I cut two holes in one end of the 42-inch-long box (one hole for the flashlight to shine through and another for the light sensor). I then covered the interior with white paper and measured the lumens of the reflected light with the flashlight set to max brightness and a wide beam. I recorded measurements every 10 minutes for an hour and a half. This showed both the brightness of the reflected light and how that changed over time. For most models, the lumen output decreased by at least 50 percent in the first 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>Battery power: </strong>After the 90-minute brightness test, I let each battery operate on high until it was out of juice. Though a few still produced a dim light after a few hours some put off a marginally bright light for days. I also looked at whether the flashlight used common batteries (i.e., AA or AAA) that are easy to replace or if it used a popular charging cord in the case of rechargeable batteries.</p><p><strong>Light modes: </strong>How many brightness options are there? Are there other colors or functions, such as strobe or SOS? Is it easy to switch between the different modes? These are all questions I considered when examining each flashlight.</p><p><strong>Durability</strong>: You don't want your flashlight to break easily. To test durability, I dropped each flashlight from 10 feet above a flight of hardwood stairs. None of the flashlights broke but the light went out on a few of them, which would make it hard to find if dropped in the dark. I also looked at whether they were waterproof or just water-resistant. If waterproof (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code\">IPX8</a>), I submerged the flashlight in water for at least five minutes to see if it continued to function

David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesman, told Insider. \"However, if he's not currently serving — active duty, National Guard or Reserve — he's not in violation of [Defense Department] regulations.\"</p><p>\"Whether it's a current uniform or an old one, the appearance to the public of inappropriate military involvement in elections is the same,\" Lapan added.</p><p>The example at the public library in Miami may have been an isolated incident, according to Alex McCoy, Common Defense's policy director and a Marine Corps veteran.</p><p>\"We expected there to be a lot more right-wing group voter intimidation at polling places and early voting sites than there actually seems to have been,\" McCoy told Insider. \"Any of it is bad, obviously, but we were worried it would be more extensive and more widespread.\"</p><p>McCoy added that the group was still preparing for \"very limited counter-demonstrations\" in the country and that his members would \"be present and be visible as a deescalatory measure.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa0898369331a0011bc6def?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tarrant County Elections Center Election Line\" height=\"2016\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>People wait in line to vote on the last day of early voting on October 29, 2020, in Fort Worth, Texas.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Montinique Monroe/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>'We have put our lives on the line in defense of our country before'</h2><p>On Saturday, six veteran-volunteers handed out water, hand sanitizers, and face masks for voters waiting in lines at a polling place in North Carolina.</p><p>Kyle Pritz, the lead organizer for Common Defense's North Carolina branch and a former US Marine, said his team was specifically called upon for assistance by another organization that experienced \"overt\" instances of voter intimidation from \"neo-Confederates.\"</p><p>North Carolina has been fraught with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/charlottesville-one-year-anniversary-photos-protests-heather-heyer-memorial-2018-8\">racial tensions</a> amid the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement and the 2017 Charlottesville protests that turned into a deadly car attack. At a separate protest in the same county on Saturday, several people, including children, were <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article246861942.html\">pepper-sprayed</a> by law enforcement officials during a march to the polls. Police officials claimed the protest was unsafe and that the activists did not disperse after being ordered to do so.</p><p>Pritz said the polling site, which shared a parking lot with a church, was mostly uneventful; however, he noted that patrons at a bar across the street were brandishing their handguns.

The military veterans were instructed not to wear any clothing containing military camouflage and were prohibited from carrying weapons.

You can also adjust the mist output.</p>\n\tWhich is better: warm mist or cool mist?\n\t\n\t<p>In general, humidifiers are divided into \"warm mist\" and \"cool mist.\"</p><p>Warm-mist humidifiers release moisture into the air by heating it, which kills bacteria in the water. But, if there are children or animals in the house, warm-mist humidifiers can be hazardous because of how hot the appliance becomes, as well as the potential for accidentally spilled hot water.</p><p>Within the cool-mist humidifier segment, there are three types:</p><ul><li><strong>Ultrasonic humidifiers</strong>&#160;use high-frequency waves to split water drops into particles, which are then released into the room.</li><li><strong>Evaporative humidifiers </strong>take the room's air and pass it through a filter with water in it, creating a mist. That mist is then blown out the other end of the humidifier.</li><li><strong>Impeller humidifiers</strong> are similar to ultrasonic humidifiers, but instead of using ultrasonic waves, they break-up water drops using a rotating disc. These humidifiers operate louder than the others.</li></ul><p>The option you should choose depends on your environment. The Mayo Clinic <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/expert-answers/cool-mist-humidifiers/faq-20058199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recommends cool-mist humidifiers</a> if you have children, because of the aforementioned safety concerns. It also said that both cool-mist and warm-mist humidifiers are equally effective. However, cool-mist humidifiers require more cleaning because they have a higher chance of bacteria and mold growth. It's also recommended that distilled or purified water be used instead of tap water.</p><p>As mentioned, warm-mist humidifiers disperse steam by heating water, rather than using a fan. They're quieter and can heat up small rooms, however, they also require more energy to operate. There are pros and cons to both, and the best option will depend on your needs.</p>\n\tCheck out our other home heating and cooling guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

before the election, he rejected a lawsuit brought by Texas GOP candidates who sought to invalidate the votes by arguing that the locations, established by county election officials, weren't

Monday seeking to invalidate 127,000 ballots cast at drive-thru voting locations in Texas.</p><p>The decision is a victory for voters in Harris County, which includes Houston and is the most populous county in the state.</p><p>With his decision, Judge Andrew Hanen, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, apparently reached the same conclusion as the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court, which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-ballots-harris-county-drive-thru-voting-election-2020-11\">rejected an appeal by Republicans</a> to hear a case over the same issue.</p><p>Several Republican candidates running for office in Texas, as well as Steven Hotze, a right-wing radio host <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/voter-fraud-and-suppression/one-plaintiffs-who-trying-throw-out-drive-thru-votes-harris-county\">known for playing down the coronavirus pandemic</a>, brought the lawsuit against Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins.</p><p>Hollins established 10 drive-thru voting locations to make it easier for people to vote if they were anxious to enter buildings because of the coronavirus pandemic. 10% of all early votes in the county took place at those locations, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/02/texas-drive-thru-votes-harris-county/\">according to the Texas Tribune</a>.</p><p>Hotze and the candidates — Wendell Champion, Steve Toth, and Sharon Hemphill — argued such locations could be established only with the explicit approval of the Texas Legislature and sought to have the 127,000 ballots already cast to be invalidated.</p><h2>The judge said the group didn't have the standing to sue but ordered for the votes to be set aside anyway</h2><p>In court on Monday, Hanen ruled the groups did not have the standing to sue and that the ballots were legally cast.</p><p>He also admonished the plaintiffs for bringing the case only now, even though early voting had been in progress for two weeks, and Harris County already had drive-thru voting locations during primary elections over the summer.</p><p>\"I find that when you balance the harms, you've got to weigh in favor of counting the votes,\" Hanen said.</p><p>Hanen said that if the case did have standing, he would have ruled to count the 127,000 votes that had already been cast, but ban the drive-thru locations going forward, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/02/texas-drive-thru-votes-harris-county/\">according to the Texas Tribune</a>.</p><p>\"If I were voting tomorrow … I would not vote in a drive-thru just out of my concern as to whether that's illegal or not,\" he said.</p><p>Hollins said the county's drive-thru voting locations would remain open through Election Day.</p><p>\"My office and those 11,000 election workers are going to continue to be committed to protecting the right to vote for the 2.5 million voters registered here in Harris County,\" Hollins said in a statement to reporters following the ruling.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa072dc91178a0019b3dc7e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"texas houston drive-thru voting\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2223\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Voters in cars line up at a drive-thru mail-ballot drop-off site at NRG Stadium on October 7 in Houston.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Go Nakamura/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In the lawsuit, Hollins garnered high-profile support: Democratic candidates, the Texas State Conference of NAACP Branches, the Texas Coalition of Black Democrats, and the League of Women Voters of Texas all fought for the ballots to be counted. Hollis also garnered support from the right, including the top <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/01/ben-ginsberg-voter-suppression-republicans/\">GOP election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg</a> and the anti-Trump Republican group the Lincoln Project.</p><p>Hanen, in his decision, ordered county officials to maintain a registry of the votes that were cast at drive-thru polling places in case the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals came to a different conclusion.</p><p>Lawyers for the Republican candidates who brought the lawsuit appealed the case to the 5th Circuit later Monday. They also plan to appeal their loss in the Texas Supreme Court to the US Supreme Court, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanNWolfe/status/1323366874244153350\">according to the Reuters reporters Jan Wolfe and Jennifer Hiller</a>.</p><p>Texas has experienced extraordinary early turnout this election, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-early-voting-record-turnout-presidential-election-biden-trump-2020-10\">surpassing 2016's total last week</a> with <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/31/early-vote-tally/\">nearly 10 million votes</a>. Though no Democrat has won the presidential race in Texas for decades, it's close this year: FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/texas/\">projected a vote share</a> of 50.2% votes for President Donald Trump and 48.9% for Democratic nominee Joe Biden.</p><p>Republicans have launched dozens of lawsuits across the country seeking to limit voting. Several of them have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-court-issues-flurry-of-last-minute-election-orders-2020-10\">resulted in Supreme Court decisions</a>, and more litigation is expected.</p><p>\"Today is a victory for Texas voters and the more than 120,000 Texans who followed the rules, made a plan to drive-in vote, and exercised their constitutional right. Make no mistake: this is not a partisan victory,\" the Biden campaign said in a statement.</p><p><em>This article has been updated.</em></p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\"

class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>This year, voters with disabilities nationwide told Business Insider how they have been pushing election officials to ensure that they can cast a ballot privately and independently.</li>\n<li>Voters with disabilities face a wide array of obstacles when casting their ballots, including a lack of support from local election officials and accessibility issues at election sites.&#160;</li>\n<li>Some voters have gone to great lengths to spread awareness of these accessibility issues and create the same opportunity for themselves in Tuesday's election.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>People with disabilities in states across the country have been preparing for weeks to vote in this year's presidential election.</p><p>They've taken steps able-bodied voters ordinarily wouldn't, several people with disabilities told Business Insider. In Florida and Pennsylvania, for example, some voters told Business Insider they took on the added mantle of serving as their own advocates, attending town halls, and imploring their local election officials for guarantees that they can cast a ballot privately and independently.</p><p>Despite their preparation and research ahead of Election Day, these efforts seemed largely ineffective as accessibility issues prevailed and made it difficult to vote securely as any able-bodied person could.</p><p>Voting in person took Marsha Bukala hours. A 62-year-old visually impaired woman in Florida, Bukala detailed to Business Insider the long-winded process she had been involved in to vote securely.</p><p>Bukala chose to vote in person rather than send a ballot by mail because it had \"really, really small print\" that she wouldn't have been able to make out on her own without assistance from another person.</p><p>When she went to the polls in October, she waited in line to use the site's single available accessible voting machine. She asked the poll workers to black out the screen so she could use it without people around seeing her votes.</p><p>\"We don't know how to do that,\" Bukala said a poll worker told her. She asked the poll workers to instead turn the tables and the machine to face away from people.</p><p>The poll workers' lack of knowledge struck Bukala, who days ahead of voting had asked her county's supervisor of elections whether they would be aware of the process for in-person accessible voting.</p><p>Millions of people are opting to vote by mail this year because of the pandemic. But accessibility needs must still be met for in-person voting, according to disability rights attorney Eve Hill.</p><p>\"Many polling places discourage people with and without disabilities from using the accessible machines because of confusion about how they work,\" Hill said. \"As a result, to this day, those machines are often only used by people with disabilities, making their votes less private than the votes of people without disabilities.\"</p><p>Bukala was ultimately able to cast her vote, but the process ate away two hours of her day and underscored the issues of accessibility that continue to permeate the US election system.</p><p>People with disabilities have to put in \"a lot of work to vote in general,\" said Sarah Meek, senior director of legislative affairs at ANCOR, a national network of providers offering support services for people with disabilities.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, another voter with a disability described to Business Insider the weeks-long process she engaged in to vote, despite her taking several steps to prepare ahead of the election.</p><p>Christine Hunsinger kept checking the state's <a href=\"https://www.votespa.com/Pages/default.aspx\">website</a> with information on voting for instructions on casting her accessible ballot. For weeks, she couldn't find any updated information. She decided to attend an in-person town hall with a state legislator to ask, where she was given a link with ballot instructions she could not find on her own.</p><p>Hunsinger, who's print-impaired, also had difficulty finding the spot where she had to sign her ballot. She tried calling the county but was met with long wait times to reach someone who could help. She ultimately used an app to connect with a volunteer assistant who helped her navigate the ballot.</p><p>Measures like these take away a person's agency and make voters with disabilities feel like they're treated like a \"second-class citizen,\" said Nancy Burgess-Hall, a Florida voter. Burgess-Hall and her husband, Doug, were involved in a weeks-long lawsuit against the state of Florida to increase accessibility in voting. They reached a settlement, with all 67 Florida counties mandated to provide accessible vote-by-mail options by March 2022.</p><p>It's a step in the right direction, Doug said, to providing voters with disabilities greater agency and independence when casting a ballot.</p><p>\"Some people may choose to want to have someone to help them. I don't really want to,\" Bukala said, echoing the need for expanding options for voters with disabilities. \"I want to be able to do it on my own. And I mean, we should have that and it should work.

any available advantages.</li>\n<li>There are eight counties across the country, from Arizona and Ohio to Wisconsin and Florida, that will play outsized roles in picking the next president.</li>\n<li>The results from each county will also provide a sense of the demographic and cultural changes that exist in America today.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>With Election Day within sight, keeping tabs on a handful of counties can help cut through the noise on election night.</p><p>TV coverage of the returns usually feature myriad maps, with most swing states having one or two counties serving as a bellwether for the rest of the state.</p><p>The reason these counties say so much about their respective states comes down to a mix of population and demographics.</p><p>Maricopa County in Arizona, for example, accounted for more than half of all the votes cast in Arizona back in 2016. More often than not, that means that whoever wins Maricopa County wins Arizona.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the eight counties that will be the most influential in the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.</p><p>&#160;</p><h3>Cuyahoga County, Ohio</h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f77ff12282c500018c786f3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"cleveland-skyline\" height=\"2796\" width=\"4200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The skyline of Cleveland, Ohio.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Angelo Merendino/Corbis via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Population (2019 estimate):</strong> 1,235,072</p><p><strong>2008 results:</strong> Barack Obama 69%, John McCain 30%</p><p><strong>2012 results:</strong> Barack Obama 69%, Mitt Romney 29.5%</p><p><strong>2016 results:</strong> Hillary Clinton 66%, Donald Trump 30.5%</p><p>As Ohio has shifted to the right over the past few years, a robust Democratic turnout in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland and an array of blue-leaning suburbs, will be critical for Joe Biden. The key for a Democratic win in the Buckeye State is to maximize turnout in Cuyahoga, especially among Black voters. In 2016, Donald Trump won Ohio by 8% — if the president can make any gains with minority groups in Cuyahoga, it could make all the difference in what is expected to be a close race in the state.</p><p>&#160;</p><h3>Maricopa County, Arizona</h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa07e8b1df1d5001821870d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Phoenix-light-rail\" height=\"2829\" width=\"4244\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A view of Downtown Phoenix.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Christian Petersen/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Population (2019 estimate):</strong> 4,485,414</p><ul><li>2008: Barack Obama 44%, John McCain 54%</li><li>2012: Barack Obama 44%, Mitt Romney 54%</li><li>2016: Hillary Clinton 45%, Donald Trump 48%</li></ul><p>Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation and accounts for roughly 61 percent of the state's population. The county has consistently voted for Republican presidential nominees since 1952, but Democrats have made major gains here over the past decade. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected to the Senate in 2018, carried Maricopa by 60,000 votes in her successful campaign. Whoever wins Maricopa County will most likely win the state.</p><p>&#160;</p><h3>Seminole County, Florida</h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa087cb69331a0011bc6ddf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sanford-seminole\" height=\"2650\" width=\"3977\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/John Raoux</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Population (2019 estimate): </strong>1,235,072</p><p><strong>Past presidential election results:&#160;</strong></p><ul><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">2008 results:</strong> Barack Obama 48%, John McCain 51%</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">2012 results:</strong> Barack Obama 46%, Mitt Romney 53%</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">2016 results:</strong> Hillary Clinton 47%, Donald Trump 48%</li></ul><p>Seminole County, once a sleepy outpost of Orlando, has become a fast-growing bedroom community in Central Florida. For generations, the county has supported Republicans — the last Democratic presidential nominee to win here was Harry Truman in 1948. However, Donald Trump only won the county by 1% in 2016, and Democrats have made enormous gains in suburban areas over the past four years. US Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, a moderate Democrat and the first Vietnamese-American woman ever elected to Congress, is representative of the growing diversity of the area. In a state that consistently has razor-thin election results, any advantage in Seminole will be crucial for Biden and Trump.</p><p>&#160;</p><h3><strong>Wake County, North Carolina</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa058e96f5b310011724e34?format=jpeg\" alt=\"raleigh north carolina wake county skyline\" height=\"1249\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The skyline of Raleigh, North Carolina.\n<p class=\"copyright\">The Washington Post via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Population (2019 estimate):&#160;</strong>1,111,761</p><p><strong>Past presidential election results:&#160;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>2008:&#160;</strong>Barack Obama 53%, John McCain 43%</li><li><strong>2012: </strong>Barack Obama 54%, Mitt Romney 44%</li><li><strong>2016:&#160;</strong>Hillary Clinton 57%, Donald Trump 37%</li></ul><p>Wake County is the most populous in North Carolina and includes the state capital, Raleigh.

The county, immediately north of Detroit, is still a middle-class stronghold and remains politically competitive. Barack Obama won Macomb handily in 2008 and 2012, but Donald Trump easily took the county in 2016 and it made all the difference in winning Michigan. That year, the president won Macomb by 48,348 votes, but only won the state by 10,704 votes.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/battleground-counties-swing-states-presidential-election-biden-trump-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=URZMKNnlJBw:1wAh_DK10xc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/URZMKNnlJBw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 23:18:27 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f9074e4abcd0c0018d68da1?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d45743ccc96cdf821b2507f630101bc0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-50-296_5dbcfaab837fc62c.webp","destWidth":3742,"destHeight":2806,"sourceBytes":264964,"destBytes":264964,"author":"insider@insider.com (John L.

On the Xbox Series S, the resolution maxes out at 1080p, but keeps the framerate locked to 60 frames per second. And on every next-gen console, the game is said to load much faster.</p>\n<p>Because the PlayStation 5 has a variety of unique features separate from the two upcoming Xbox consoles, Epic is adding functionality to the PS5 version of \"Fortnite\" that isn't coming anywhere else: For starters, you'll be able to jump into specific \"Fortnite\" game modes directly from the console home screen.</p>\n<p>\"'Fortnite' supports PS5's Activities, starting with the ability to go straight into the Battle Royale Lobby with either Solo, Duos, or Squads selected,\" Epic's blog post said. \"Once in the Lobby, choose to queue up for your selected mode!\"</p>\n<p>The PS5 version of \"Fortnite\" also takes advantage of the new haptic triggers on the PS5 gamepad — triggers that offer vibration functionality, but also add more nuanced feedback to players.</p>\n<p>\"In addition to general vibration support,\" Epic's post said, \"we've integrated haptic trigger feedback for ranged weapons on the new DualSense controller.\" What this means in game, according to Epic, is the PlayStation 5 gamepad, \"makes it feel like you're holding the Suppressed SMG or Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle.\"</p>\n<p>The next-gen versions of \"Fortnite\" will still allow cross-platform multiplayer with friends on other platforms. Moreover, any progress you've made or unlocks you've purchased on Xbox One will transfer to next-gen Xbox consoles, and the same goes for PS4 players moving to PS5.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All next-gen versions of \"Fortnite\" will be available at launch on the respective platforms: November 10 for Xbox Series S and Series X players, and November 12 for PlayStation 5 players.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got a tip?</strong>&nbsp;Contact Business Insider senior correspondent Ben Gilbert via email (<a href=\"mailto:bgilbert@businessinsider.com\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">bgilbert@businessinsider.com</a>),</em><em>&nbsp;or Twitter DM (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealBenGilbert\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">@realbengilbert</a>).

The event is one of the biggest shopping holidays of the year — sales are so high that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-it-called-black-friday-2018-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the day can push a retailer into \"the black,\" or solvency</a>.</p><p>Shoppers can expect thousands of deals to crop up on the days leading up to and following the big sales event. That said, many retailers often wait until the big day to drop the best deals.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">Is Black Friday 2020 cancelled?</strong></h2><p>No, but it will be unlike any Black Friday that came before it. This year, Black Friday will be longer and more online than ever.</p><p>Nearly every major retailer will offer deals and exclusive offers throughout the month of November, if they haven't started already.&#160;</p><p>With the ongoing pandemic, the in-store Black Friday experience will look a lot different than in previous years. It's hard to imagine seeing the deluge of people scrambling for doorbuster deals happening this year with safety restrictions in place.</p><h2>When is Black Friday 2020?</h2><p>Black Friday is always the Friday after Thanksgiving. This year, Black Friday falls on November 27.&#160;</p><p>However, due to increased online shopping and subsequent supply-chain delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, several storefronts<strong style=\"color: #000000;\">,</strong> including <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Ft.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Walmart </a>and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721541128379073190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Best Buy</a>, have augmented their schedules. For instance, Best Buy launched its \"Black Friday\" sale alongside Amazon Prime Day. The electronics retailer decided to begin its sale early this year \"to help shoppers start their shopping season early — and safely.\"&#160;</p><h2>What time does Black Friday start?</h2><p>Technically speaking, Black Friday starts at 12:01 a.m. local time for online retailers. However, Black Friday sales start whenever each retailer decides their sales will go live.</p><p>From what we've seen so far, several retailers will be releasing new deals every week in 2020.&#160;</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a>:</strong> While Amazon hasn't released when it will release its official, wide-ranging Black Friday sale, it's offering several one-day offers during the lead-up. Last year, Amazon's deals started online at midnight on November 22.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-buy-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Buy</a></strong>: Stores will be closed Thanksgiving Day, but the retailer is running its 'Prep for the Holidays Black Friday' sale for the whole month of November.&#160;</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gamestop</a></strong>: While Gamestop has yet to announce its Black Friday sale dates, we do know that all stores will be closed for Thanksgiving Day and that the retailer is planning to offer deals ahead of November 28.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/home-depot-black-friday-deals-preview-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Home Depot</strong>:</a> The Home Depot's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales run from November 6 through December 2. <br>Its early preview is already available to view on The Home Depot app.&#160;</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kohl's</a></strong>: Stores will be closed Thanksgiving Day, but the retailer's sale is slated to start on Black Friday, November 28.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/macys-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Macy's</strong></a>: Macy's is currently mum on when it will kick off its Black Friday sale. Last year, Macy's&#160;opened from 5 p.m. Thanksgiving Day to 2 a.m. November 29 of last year. They reopened at 6 a.m. November 29 of last year.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2F%3Forigin%3Dtab-logo&u1=1603305111588apyg1isz5|xid:fr1603305115335ije305115335ije\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-orig-url=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2F%3Forigin%3Dtab-logo&u1=1603305111588apyg1isz5588apyg1isz5\" data-ml-id=\"7\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1603305115335ije\" data-uri=\"3fc9f7b51a120123dc87432b3d235ad5\">Nordstrom</a>:</strong> Last year, stores opened at 10 a.m. November 29 and online sales started on November 27.

The first ad will be released on October 29.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Walmart</strong></a>: Walmart is holding 'Black Friday Deals for Days' events this year. Three events are taking place starting as early as November 4 both online and in stores, with a few online-only sales.&#160;&#160;</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wayfair-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wayfair</a>:</strong> Last year, Wayfair sales began online at 9 a.m. ET November 22.&#160;</li></ul><h2>How long do Black Friday sales last?</h2><p>Don't be fooled by the name that suggests it's a single day. It's most definitely not. It's more like a shopping season that begins in early November.&#160;</p><p>Black Friday sales generally start days or weeks in advance of the actual shopping event and continue on until <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cyber-monday-deals\">Cyber Monday</a>. Better yet, some retailers hold their deals until well after both events to further boost the entire December shopping season.</p><h2>What should you buy on Black Friday?&#160;</h2><p>Since it falls a few weeks before the gift-giving season, Black Friday provides excellent opportunities to buy — and save on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-gift-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all your holiday gifts</a> &#160;— before the last-minute rush.&#160;</p><p>It's nearly guaranteed that you'll get great value for your money on certain products during Black Friday — but some tend to see better discounts at other times of the year. If you go in knowing what you're looking for, you're less likely to be ripped off by a fancy-looking coupon or to spend money on products you don't need.</p><p>Shoppers can expect tons of great deals — including so-called \"doorbusters\" — online before and the days following Black Friday. During the event, prices will drop to all-time lows, often beating out prices we see over the course of the year. The sale covers every product category: tech, home and kitchen, fashion, and smart home.&#160;</p><p>This Black Friday, shoppers should expect to see similar offers to the ones we saw on Amazon Prime Day, except more wide-ranging.</p><h3>We recommend focusing on the following product categories if you want the best deals:&#160;</h3><ul><li>TVs</li><li>Smart home devices</li><li>Gaming consoles and video games</li><li>Kitchen appliances</li></ul><p>Historically, Black Friday has been a great time to purchase big-ticket electronics — especially larger TVs. Whether you're looking for a top-of-the-line Samsung set or LG OLED, or a budget-friendly TCL or Hisense model, Black Friday will likely deliver several deals.</p><p>Much like Amazon Prime Day, we expect to see tons of discounts on smart home products. We'll likely see Amazon Echo products drop to their lowest prices ever, plus several discounts and bundles on Google's recently released products.</p><p>Black Friday happens&#160;<em>after</em> the latest Xbox and Playstation consoles are released. While we're unlikely to see any markdowns on the consoles, we may see a few bundles crop up. We will likely see modest discounts on games for all consoles, and huge bundles for last-generation consoles.&#160;</p><p>If you're looking for a kitchen upgrade, Black Friday is a great time to shop. We'll likely see discounts on Instant Pot pressure cookers, KitchenAid appliances, pots and pans, plus everything else you'll want for the upcoming holiday season.</p><p>Of course, the deals found during Black Friday are incredibly wide-ranging. While we expect there to be several deals on diapers, toilet paper, or other household essentials and toiletries, please be careful not to over-stock on supplies during a pandemic.</p><h2>Is Black Friday or Cyber Monday better?</h2><p>It's complicated, and it matters much less this year.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cyber-monday-deals\">Cyber Monday</a> traditionally comes three days after Black Friday, or the following Monday after. However, we've seen Black Friday and Cyber Monday slowly merge and expand to a weeklong, or even a monthlong affair. Different products receive better discounts on each day, and the deals that each retailer offers will vary.</p><p>This year, with most Americans shopping online, it's more critical for shoppers to know where and what time to shop, not what day.&#160;</p><p>A good rule of thumb to follow: If you think you see a good deal, (e.g. one we recommend) create the order as soon as possible. While you can always cancel or return a product, it's impossible to take advantage of an inactive, or expired deal.</p><p>Suppose you purchase a discounted product during Black Friday and see a more significant markdown at another retailer come Cyber Monday. Don't sweat it.</p><p>You can ask the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-that-price-match\">original storefront to match the price</a>&#160;(some automatically refund you the difference), or you can return or cancel the order, then place a new order with the better price. Some orders won't even ship during the weekend, which makes it easy to cancel orders.</p><p>For those who can shop in-person during Black Friday, we've found that it's better to shop on Black Friday in these situations:</p><ul><li>For expensive products</li><li>For major stores</li><li>For this year's products</li><li>If you plan to shop in stores (if it's available in your area)</li></ul><p>It should go without saying, but this year's in-store experience will be a lot different from the one last year. If you so choose to shop Black Friday in-person, make sure to read up on the safety guidelines provided by each storefront.</p><h2>What stores have Black Friday deals?&#160;</h2><p>Outside of a few notable exceptions like REI, nearly every major retailer and direct-to-consumer company will offer markdowns during the event. Shoppers should expect deals from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Ft.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721541128379073190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fen-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Dell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/196318/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2F%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51AE7LddV14xtL0lGSAfSvcpbcWy4wX4nZrXJJVGhn9ED7ZW6C03BZkaAvB4EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26utm_source%3Dnmpi-google-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Adorama</a>, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/196318/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2F%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51AE7LddV14xtL0lGSAfSvcpbcWy4wX4nZrXJJVGhn9ED7ZW6C03BZkaAvB4EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26utm_source%3Dnmpi-google-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Lowe's</a>, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Ft.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Home Depot</a>, and more.</p><p>As we do every Black Friday, we are sifting through all of the offers and rounding up the best deals from your favorite retailers.&#160;</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">Will there be Black Friday shipping delays?</strong></h2><p>Shipping delays and major shopping holidays go hand in hand, and this year is no exception.&#160;Experts suggest that consumers may see low inventory problems and shipping, during <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-shopping-2020-why-consumers-should-shop-early-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Friday and the weeks following</a>.&#160;</p><p>While we do expect shipping delays, several retailers, including Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, are hoping to alleviate some of that stress by offering in-store pickup and contactless curbside pickup. This means shoppers can grab their orders at a nearby location if the store has it in stock.&#160;</p><h2>When do Black Friday ads come out?</h2><p>Every year, shoppers eagerly await Black Friday advertising to get a sneak peek at the deals each retailer will over. Shoppers use these \"ad scans\" to help create their Black Friday game plan.</p><p>While there isn't a release schedule available, a smattering of retailers has already posted their advertising online, the most notable being Best Buy and Walmart. We'll update this section to include all of the available ad scans as soon as they become available.</p><p>Here are the most important ad scans currently available:&#160;</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2Fdirectoryirectory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Walmart</a></strong>: To find the ad scan, first find your local Walmart via the local directory.

When Trump officially launched his reelection bid in June 2019, his approval rating was around 43%, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/interactives/185273/presidential-job-approval-center.aspx\">according to Gallup</a>.

Though Adams wanted to remain president, he accepted the results of the election and stepped down, establishing an important precedent for the US. He did not attend Jefferson's inauguration.</p><p>Adams faced a foreign policy crisis with France during his presidency, known as the Qausi-War, and signed <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/adams-alien-and-seditions-act/\">the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts</a>.

He was defeated by Andrew Jackson.&#160;</p><p>Adams became president in 1824 despite Jackson receiving more electoral votes. No candidate had won a majority of the electoral votes, so the House of Representatives was left to decide. The House ultimately elected Adams.</p><p>Adams faced fierce opposition from Jacksonians (supporters of Jackson) in Congress while president, and had few major accomplishments during his tenure. He lost badly to Jackson in 1828.</p><p>His career in politics was far from over, however, and Adams would later serve as a congressman from 1831 to 1848.</p>\n\tMartin Van Buren (1837-1841)\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa0635b69331a0011bc6ce6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Martin Van Buren.\" height=\"3568\" width=\"4758\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Martin Van Buren.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Universal History Archive/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Martin Van Buren lost the 1840 election to William Henry Harrison.&#160;</p><p>Van Buren's tenure was plagued from the start by a financial crisis, and his unpopularity was compounded by an expensive war with the Seminole Indians in Florida.</p><p>He lost by a landslide in 1840, with Harrison winning <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1840\">234 electoral votes</a> and Van Buren just 60.</p>\n\tGrover Cleveland (1885-1889)\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa0668991178a0019b3dc26?format=jpeg\" alt=\"grover cleveland\" height=\"383\" width=\"510\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2014648289/\" target=\"_blank\">Library of Congress</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Grover Cleveland lost the election of 1888 to Benjamin Harrison.</p><p>Cleveland won the popular vote by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1888\">more than 100,000 votes</a> but ultimately lost to Harrison via the electoral college.

Dozens of hostages were taken by Iranian students at the US embassy in Tehran. The US launched a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Operation-Eagle-Claw\">disastrous military operation</a> meant to rescue the hostages in April 1980 that resulted in a helicopter crash and the deaths of eight service members.&#160;</p><p>The hostages were eventually released. The crisis lasted for 444 days, ending on January, 20, 1981, the same day Reagan was inaugurated.&#160;</p><p>Carter's handling of the hostage crisis is often cited as a major reason Reagan won an overwhelming victory in 1980.&#160;</p><p>Though he struggled as commander-in-chief, Carter has had a successful post-presidency and is widely admired.

Long story short, the southeastern United States became my COVID-19 sanctuary, with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel safety</a> becoming my biggest priority. To enjoy the fall season, I planned a trip to charming Asheville, North Carolina.</p><p>Like many travelers right now, I originally planned to stay in an Airbnb due to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experts recommending vacation rentals</a> because of reduced contact with other guests. Much to my surprise, however, the pandemic wasn't stopping high season in Asheville, and even cramped <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-rv-rentals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RVs</a> and lower-rated homes were going for $200 a night. In an effort to find more affordable and comfortable options, I turned to hotels.</p><p>However, I wanted to find a property I trusted to handle the pandemic safely. As a longtime fan of the Kessler brand, I was drawn to their Asheville haunt: the <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l8bes/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marriott.com%2Fhotels%2Ftravel%2Favlak-grand-bohemian-hotel-asheville-autograph-collection%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Grand Bohemian Hotel Asheville</a>.&#160;</p><p>Kessler is part of <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fautograph-hotels.marriott.com%2Ft.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Marriott's Autograph Collection</a> and pre-coronavirus, Kessler properties offered an ideal getaway for couples, girls trips, families, and even business travelers looking for a luxury hotel that comes in at a more affordable price point. The brand's art-driven hotels are always in charming destinations, and their inherent creativity feeds into everything from the food and drinks to the in-house art program, the decor, and even the brand's signature Poseidon Spa. I have stayed at Kessler properties in Savannah, St. Augustine, and Mountain Brook and they've always been a treat.&#160;</p><p>Having familiarity with Kessler properties and knowing their attention to detail helped ease my mind. Plus, this particular mainstay was in a coveted location in charming Biltmore Village, directly across the street from the iconic <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60742-d102846-Reviews-Biltmore-Asheville_North_Carolina.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Biltmore Estate</a>.

I drove around back and found the driveway, where drawn burgundy drapes added an air of luxury. I had found my slice of mountain paradise.</p><p>The hotel surrounded the valet area, so when I got out of my car and looked up, I saw four stories of hotel rooms on all sides and elegant light fixtures suspended from a covered deck above. In what otherwise gave off an Old English, Christmas-y vibe, there was an installation of a modern, funky, bright red cello, the first sign of the hotel's innovative art program.&#160;</p><p>The only parking option available to me was valet, and I was surprised there wasn't a self-park option in the age of a pandemic. While I wasn't fully comfortable with valet, I gave the hotel credit for ensuring the attendants were masked and practiced social distancing and reluctantly handed over my keys.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c588469331a0011bc669b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Bohemian mask signage\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Signage by the elevators reminded guests to follow COVID-19 protocols.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer Agress/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>I had stayed at a Marriott-Bonvoy property one other time during the pandemic, and was already comfortable with their COVID-19 protocols. Kessler is part of the Marriott-Bonvoy family, so the <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l8bes/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marriott.com%2Fhotels%2Ftravel%2Favlak-grand-bohemian-hotel-asheville-autograph-collection%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Grand Bohemian Hotel Asheville</a> adhered to the brand's&#160; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-precautions-coronavirus#marriott-bonvoy-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commitment to Clean program</a>.

The spacious lobby exuded an eclectic-chic, hunter lodge vibe. Details included carved wooden walls, hanging candelabra light fixtures, mounted deer heads, leather chairs, dark wooden desks with purple low-lighting, bear sculptures, and a statue of a wild hog wearing a tacky tourist hat.</p><p>The lobby was also scattered with colorful paintings and modern art pieces typical of Kessler hotels. Lights that looked like antlers hung from a limestone brick ceiling, hovering over seating areas of textured accent furniture below.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c5a8e69331a0011bc66b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Bohemian front desk reception\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>We checked in at the front desk, where everyone wore masks.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer Agress/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>When we went to check in, I noticed there was no plexiglass at the front desk. I was surprised by this since it's part of Marriott-Bonvoy's protocols. However, the website did say that the rollout of plexiglass dividers would be gradual. Luckily, masks were worn by all throughout the check-in process, and the desk was deep enough to feel like you didn't have to get too close to one another.&#160;</p><p>It's important to note that I could have had a completely contactless check-in through the Marriott Mobile App, but I didn't know about that at the time. Instead, I gave the hotel my credit card information over the phone in advance, so the only time we exchanged anything was when I signed for the room and collected our room keys.</p><p>As I headed to my room, I noticed an easel by the elevator with a mounted sign reminding guests to wear their masks, social distance, and wash hands. Right across from it was a hand sanitizing station.</p><p>Overall, the check-in process was smooth. The lobby was vacuous and there was no one else in there besides the friendly staff behind the desk, my guest, and myself. But not all guests were following the mask mandate and staff didn't seem to be enforcing it. Had there been more people, say during a weekend stay, I might have felt less comfortable.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d979264d831b2141f07abd1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2 Hotel Reviews Banner The room\" height=\"151\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c615b69331a0011bc66eb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Bohemian Asheville bedroom\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The King bed was plush, luxurious, and made for a comfortable night of sleep.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer Agress/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>I booked an entry-level <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l8bes/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marriott.com%2Fhotels%2Ftravel%2Favlak-grand-bohemian-hotel-asheville-autograph-collection%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Standard Room</a>, which comes with a King bed or two Queen beds and either city or mountain views. These rooms start at $158 in the winter low season, but can soar into the $600s on weekends during the fall high season, which is when I visited.</p><p>My room was $354 per night midweek, but it felt worthy of the high price thanks to being a spacious corner unit with a plush King bed and a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. If possible, ask ahead for a corner unit with mountain views to get the most value out of a Standard Room.</p><p>Walking into our room, I entered a small hallway lined by cabinets on one side and a bathroom on the other.&#160;</p><p>However, it was the King bed and its velvet teal headboard that immediately caught my eye and made the room pop. Two nightstands flanked either side of the bed, complete with lamps with bases that looked like antlers. An antler chandelier over the bed completed the look.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c64c169331a0011bc670d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Bohemian bedroom view\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This particular room had a beautiful view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, but only through a small square window.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer Agress/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>While there was one window to the left of the bed, I was surprised at how small it was for the going rate and the room being considered \"mountain view.\" I would have liked a bigger window, particularly because the Blue Ridge Mountains are especially beautiful during the fall.&#160;</p><p>Across from the bed, there was a mounted flatscreen TV, a six-drawer dresser, two leather accent chairs, and an alcove with a sleek white desk.&#160;The room also included a small closet with an iron, an ironing board, a luggage rack, and two plush robes wrapped in protective plastic.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c65656f5b3100117248e3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Bohemian room amenities\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The minibar included complimentary coffee, tea, and hand sanitizer packets, as well as bottled water and Kessler wine available for purchase.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer Agress/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The in-room bar had the standard offerings of a single-cup coffee machine, free coffee capsules, and tea bags.&#160;The only thing not standard about it was the bottle of Kessler red wine, which was available for $38 a bottle. I opted to buy it and was not disappointed.&#160;</p><p>There were also individual packets of hand sanitizer at the minibar, which was the only COVID-19 amenity in the room.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c67c069331a0011bc6727?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Bohemian bathroom entrance\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The bathroom was spacious and luxurious.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer Agress/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The bathroom was large and truly luxurious. Marble floors and a teal wall with candle sconces offset a quirky wood vanity, a large soaking tub, and separate toilet and spa shower areas.</p><p>In addition to the free Kessler-brand bath products, bath salts and aromatherapy bubble bath from Poseidon Spa were by the tub and available for $35. While I didn't take advantage of them on this trip, I have been to Poseidon Spa at other Kessler properties and can attest that their products are wonderful.&#160;</p><p>The only downside was that the bathroom only had curtains, rather than a true door, separating it from the bedroom.

Every time I walked into a room, I noticed something new.&#160;</p><p><strong>We think you should know:</strong> The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a thin curtain rather than an actual door. However, a few rooms do have actual doors that close off the bathtub and bathroom area, so make sure you request that ahead of time if that's a necessity.</p><p><strong>We'd do this differently next time: </strong>I was disappointed by my tiny room window.

For exceptional views, it may be worth upgrading to a Premium Room with a balcony.</p><p>Throughout my stay, all employees were masked, dining and common area furniture was spaced out, and there were signs demanding masks and social distancing everywhere. However, it's key to note that COVID-19 protocols could have been more strictly enforced for guests. While the hotel was largely empty during my midweek stay, during peak weekend days I may not have felt as comfortable since not all guests were always masked, and hotel staff did not comment on this.&#160;</p><p>That said, I am always an advocate for Kessler properties.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Sam Grady, 28, in Ohio, would be one of the youngest members of the Ohio Statehouse if elected. Grady said he decided to run as a write-in candidate in the primary race because he was frustrated local Democrats in Richland County, Ohio, had neglected to put up a candidate to compete against Republicans.</p><p>In April, Grady won the primary race and officially became the party's candidate for the District 2 seat in the Ohio House of Representatives.&#160;&#160;</p><p>But Grady, who is currently attending classes to finish his undergrad degree at a branch campus of The Ohio State University, said he has not received the support of the Richland County Democratic Party.</p><p>Local Democrats have rebuked him, he said.</p><p>Grady speculated their distance from him began in May when he used the hashtag \"IAmAntifa\" on a Facebook post. The hashtag was popular on social media at the time, he said. Antifa, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-antifa-movement-charlottesville-va-trump-news-2017-8#what-is-antifa-1\">short for \"anti-fascist,\" describes a decentralized, leaderless movement</a> dedicated to combatting right-wing authoritarianism and white supremacy.</p><p>The group has drawn the ire of Republicans and President Trump in particular, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-gop-present-antifa-major-threat-but-no-evidence-killings-2020-7\">who has threatened to classify it as a terrorist organization.&#160;</a></p><p>Not long after, Larry Weirich, the chairman of the Richland County Democratic Party, said in a news release the party did \"NOT and will NOT condone his actions or statements. Furthermore, we DO NOT and WILL NOT endorse his candidacy during the 2020 general election.\"</p><p>When the <a href=\"https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/2020/06/02/democrats-condemn-sam-grady-candidate/3126283001/\">Mansfield News Journal</a> requested clarification, Weirich said \"there's just a lot of things that we don't want to be associated with,\" pointing to Grady's social media posts but did not say which the party disagreed with. The Richland County Democratic Party did not return Business Insider's request for clarification.&#160;</p><p>Grady, who had refused to participate in the county party's vetting process earlier this year, said he felt local Democrats were \"completely shooting themselves in the foot\" in denouncing him.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"The local county party is basically a collection of 12 baby boomers who get around monthly and have dinner,\" Grady said. \"They're not serious about running or winning anything. But I think it's an interesting microcosm of the national Democratic Party.</p><p>Grady said he believes his beef with the local Democratic Party likely represents a microcosm of young people's general attitudes toward establishment politics.</p><p>\"All the young people I talk to in this district have either feelings of extreme anger of what the local party did or extreme apathy about it,\" he said. \"I'm sure local Democratic parties in other parts of the country are much younger, much more diverse, and much less afraid of being judged negatively by Republicans.\"&#160;</p><p>He added: \"Hopefully it's not a trend that's a rejection of the two parties, but a trend that's more about young people primarying establishment candidates and taking over their Democratic parties local and statewide.\"&#160;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/young-voters-biden-sanders.html\">The New York Times</a> reported in March, while they're poised to gain considerable electoral clout at the polls this year, young people have often felt that candidates don't speak to them, leading them to sit out the election.&#160;</p><p>While he acknowledged his region is largely red — Trump won 66% of the vote in Richland County in 2016 — he's also said met like-minded young people during the course of his campaign even in his \"very rural, very religious, conservative community.\"&#160;</p><p>\"I've met a lot of young, local activists in the community — like very left-wing activists — talking about things like wealth inequality, the militarization of police, and even stuff like normalizing sex work. It's been one of the few positive feelings in what's been a cynical and negative process.\"&#160;</p><h2>\"We're seeing that our representatives don't really look like us\"</h2><p>Four years ago, Christina Haswood cast a ballot for the first time. This week, she's hoping voters in Kansas 10th district will cast a vote for her.</p><p>At 26, Haswood, a Democrat and lifelong resident of Lawrence, is aiming to become one of the youngest members of the Kansas State Legislature. She hadn't always anticipated a career in politics, she told Business Insider, but as a Navajo woman with a background in public health, she was drawn toward one.</p><p>Her journey into politics had been sparked in high school. During a class her first year she realized all of her classmates, like her, had family members with Type 2 diabetes, a disease affecting more than 23% of the Native American population, according to the <a href=\"https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=33d=33\">Department of Health and Human Services</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"I knew there was work that needed to be done in Kansas,\" Haswood said.</p><p>In February, Haswood contacted Wichita Rep. Ponka-we Victors when she heard about legislation to address missing and murdered Indigenous people. The two kept in contact, and eventually, Victors recommended Haswood enter the race for the state legislature, she said.</p><p>She said her age created excitement but it was also used in attacks lobbed at her from her primary opponents, both of whom she beat in May, making her the presumptive winner as state Republicans did not put forth a challenger, the <a href=\"https://www2.ljworld.com/news/state-government/2020/aug/04/haswood-wins-contested-primary-will-become-third-native-american-in-history-of-kansas-legislature/\">Lawrence Jornal-World</a> reported.</p><p>\"I would go to roundtable talks and I would look around the room and see I was the only person of color, the only Indigenous person, and the only young person there,\" she said. \"The only young Indigenous woman, the only Navajo woman there. This list keeps going on.\"</p><p>Haswood&#160;brought on younger people to work for her campaign. In the primary, her campaign manager was 25, a year younger than her, and some staffers had only recently graduated high school. With the help of one high school volunteer, Haswood even crafted viral TikTok videos, the social-media app particularly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-and-trump-gen-z-tiktok-2020-9\">popular with young people and largely untapped by politicians</a>. The videos helped solicit donations and encouraged people to phone bank for her, she said.</p><p>\"With more younger people getting involved, we're seeing that our representatives don't really look like us,\" Haswood said. \"I think that brought a drive for change because I know during my campaign, issues such as criminal justice reform, police brutality, and racism came up.\"&#160;</p><h2>Ushering in a \"new generation of leadership\"</h2><p>Josh Holstein in Boone County, West Virginia didn't think he was ready to run for office in 2020 but said he wanted to bring \"a new generation of leadership\" to state politics. At 19, he'd be the youngest current member of the West Virginia House of Delegates.</p><p>Holstein, a Republican candidate for District 23, told Business Insider he didn't grow up in an overtly political household, but getting involved in local politics wasn't difficult.&#160;</p><p>\"Here in West Virginia, the Republican candidates really seem like a family,\" Holstein said. \"If people want to volunteer it doesn't matter — they all feel like we're family here working toward the same goal. They treated me like an adult. That's something I really admired.</p><p>\"They say this is a deeply red state, and that might seem true from the outside looking in, but I'm the first Republican in my entire family,\" he added. \"I remember there was a time when anyone mentioned Republican politics — not just my parents — but my extended family, it was like you were an outcast.\"</p><p>Like Haswood, Holstein's experience as a young candidate has been mixed.</p><p>His opponents, he said, have \"played on my lack of experience and holding office.\"</p><p>\"That's been the biggest obstacle. Some people say I'm too young, but then I have to talk about them about issues, and it alleviates their fears.\"</p><p>But his age has also presented opportunities, Holstein said.&#160;</p><p>\"People say hey we need somebody young, somebody, with energy, somebody with a fresh face, and somebody who wants to work and not just hold a title,\" he said. \"I would say that has resonated much better than the opposition.\"&#160;</p><p>Holstein told Business Insider he first planned to run in 2022, but because of local enthusiasm for President Donald Trump (<a href=\"http://services.sos.wv.gov/apps/elections/results/results.aspx?year=2016&eid=22&county=Boone&type=OFFICIALype=OFFICIAL\">the president won 86% of Boone County in 2016</a>), he decided to run this year. Holstein described himself as an \"anti-establishment\" candidate, which is bolstered by his new-on-the-scene status.</p><p>\"There's a shift happening here, and I decided to run because I'm supportive of that shift,\" he said.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-source=\"insider-voter-guide\" data-show-header=\"true\">Expanded Coverage Module:

Biden leads Trump by an average of <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/\">4.8 percentage points</a> in state polls, according to FiveThirtyEight, and <a href=\"https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/president/P2020PA\">DDHQ</a> predicts Biden has a 74.5% chance of winning the Keystone State given that lead.</p><p>While he still leads in many swing states, Biden's edge in Florida, a key swing state, is razor sharp. Florida possesses 29 electoral votes — the second most of any state — and was won by Trump in 2016 by just <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\">1.2 percentage points,</a> or nearly 113,000 votes. In an average of Florida polls, Biden currently leads Trump by <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/\">2.5 points</a> and <a href=\"https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/president/P2020FL\">DDHQ suggests</a> he has a 63% chance of winning in the Sunshine State.</p><h2>Could the polls be wrong?</h2><p>Yes. There is a very good chance that the polls are \"wrong\" and will not have precisely predicted the final election results. The biggest question on election night will be just \"how wrong\" the polls were.</p><p>Incorrect polling is one of the most common critiques of the 2016 presidential election, but in truth, the polls were not off by much. Trump, for example, outperformed the national polls in 2016 by only about <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/\">2 percentage points.</a> In fact, the polls were about as accurate as they've been in any presidential election since 1968, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-story-of-2016/\">according to Nate Silver</a>, founder of FiveThirtyEight.</p><p>While the polls were slightly off in 2016, the effects were magnified as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead in swing states was incredibly slim. Just a <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/2016-polls-clinton-trump/\">day before Election Day</a>, Clinton and Trump were in a deadlock in North Carolina and Florida. As November 3 approaches, Biden currently holds close to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/north-carolina/\">two</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/\">three percentage point</a> leads in those states and is in a better position than Clinton was.</p><h2>According to polling, which states are closest?</h2><p>According to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, the nine closest races are in Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Of these, Biden is currently leading in all but Iowa, Ohio, and Texas.</p><p>Polling in swing states on the eve of the election:</p><ul><li>An average of recent <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/\">polls in <strong>Texas</strong></a> estimate that Trump is leading in the Lone Star State by just one percentage points. If Biden can flip Texas Democratic for the <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/states/texas\">first time since 1976</a>, he is all but guaranteed an electoral college victory.</li><li>Biden is ahead in the polls by an <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/north-carolina/\">average of 2 percentage points</a> in <strong>North Carolina</strong>, a state that Trump desperately <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-needs-to-win-in-north-carolina-or-else-2020-10\">needs to bolster</a> his chances of reelection. A large proportion of the results in North Carolina will be known on the <a href=\"https://abc11.com/nc-absentee-ballot-vote-totals-north-carolina-early-voting-questions/7201452/\">night of the election</a>, as the state is on the east coast, whose voting centers are among the first to close. Additionally, absentee ballots in North Carolina are <a href=\"https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/vote-mail\">validated before Election Day</a> which allows them to be counted more quickly.</li><li><strong>Ohio</strong> continues to be a difficult state for Democrats to win over post-Obama, and Trump is currently leading in the state by an <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/ohio/\">average of 0.6 percentage points</a> in the polls.</li><li>In <strong>Georgia</strong>, Biden currently leads in the polls by about 1-1.2 percentage points, according to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/georgia/\">FiveThirtyEight.</a> Conversely, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ga/georgia_trump_vs_biden-6974.html\">RealClearPolitics</a> estimates that Trump is currently leading in the state by just 0.2 points. The state has not voted for a Democratic nominee since President <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/states/georgia\">Bill Clinton in 1992</a>.</li><li>In <strong>Iowa,</strong> an average of polls estimates Trump is in the lead by <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_biden-6787.html\">up to 1.2 percentage points</a> over Biden. Trump previously beat Clinton in the state by 9.5 percentage points in 2016.</li><li>Biden is currently leading in <strong>Arizona</strong> by an average of about <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/arizona/\">2.6 percentage points</a> in the polls. Trump won the state in 2016 by 3.5 points.&#160;</li><li>Trump currently trails Biden by an <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/\">average of 2.5 percentage points</a> in <strong>Florida</strong>, but the race may be even closer as <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_biden-6841.html\">RealClearPolitics</a> estimates Biden is up by just 1.7 percentage points.</li><li>In <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, Biden leads Trump by an average of <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/\">4.8 percentage points</a> in a state that Trump won by just <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/pennsylvania-president-clinton-trump\">44,292 votes</a> in 2016. The state is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-is-the-most-important-state-on-the-map-now-2020-10\">a must-win</a> for Biden.</li><li>Lastly, Biden holds an average lead of 8.2 percentage points in the polls in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, according to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>. Trump won the state in 2016 by less than one percentage point of the final vote.</li></ul><p>To win the election, a candidate must receive at least 270 electoral votes. The tipping-point state is the state which would provide the winner with the 270th electoral vote needed to win the election and is based on the victor's <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pennsylvania-could-be-an-electoral-tipping-point/\">margin of victory</a>.</p><p>FiveThirtyEight also predicts that the states <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/\">most likely to be the tipping point</a>&#160;in the presidential election are Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Minnesota, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia.</p><h2>Which polls should I trust?</h2><p>For the highest levels of accuracy, it's best to look to independent polls conducted by third parties that use a random sample. FiveThirtyEight has a helpful tool that <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/\">aggregates national polls</a> and grades each pollster on its <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeight-calculates-pollster-ratings/\">methodology</a> and historical accuracy.&#160;</p><p>Politicians and campaigns traditionally love to cite internal polls, but these polls should be approached with a <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/\">healthy amount of skepticism</a>. If an internal poll \"leaks,\" it could be done intentionally and purposefully.</p><p>With internal polls, campaigns are able to choose which questions are asked, the wording of the questions, and the order. Additionally, campaigns often neglect to release the polling methodology or the polls in their entirety. Without knowing these specifics, internal polls should not be given too much weight.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-source=\"insider-voter-guide\" data-show-header=\"false\">Expanded Coverage Module: insider-voter-guide</bi-shortcode><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-2020-election-polls-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/4jyFSg3Yr7w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 21:33:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f91d5edabcd0c0018d6926b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"1837d4d43c863aa4ee70545ff2762e3e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-37-873_7450ccd551c3d715.webp","destWidth":3742,"destHeight":2806,"sourceBytes":269522,"destBytes":269522,"author":"mhall@businessinsider.com (Madison Hall)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f91d5f421211300187403d0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_2/2020/11/03/05-31-38-819_93efa377787c9b3d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn37@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-55-293_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn94@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-37-755_97b6e1402bf927ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-57-562_5a77e9a359f8969a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=4jyFSg3Yr7w:FORIKKBP2-Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn66@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-45-837_6cab08147253fb6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/4jyFSg3Yr7w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn83@2020_2/2020/11/03/05-31-42-279_49a708d5eaafdcca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381490533},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:30","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:30","title":"Fargo, North Dakota, mayor clashes with governor over whether the state should require people to wear face masks as COVID-19 cases multiply in the state","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/north-dakota-governor-refuses-statewide-mask-mandate-covid-cases-surge-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa09dde1df1d50018218780?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages Doug Burgum\" height=\"512\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Stephen Yang/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Several cities in North Dakota have enacted mask mandates as COVID-19 cases in the state continue to rise.&#160;</li>\n<li>The state's governor has encouraged mask use but stopped short of enacting requirements, despite calls from some mayors.&#160;</li>\n<li>North Dakota was the first state to surpass 100 cases per 100,000 residents.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>COVID-19 cases in North Dakota continue to surge and while different cities have chosen to enact face mask requirements, Gov. Doug Burgum has been hesitant to order a statewide mandate.</p><p>In October, the city of Fargo mayor Dr. Tim Mahoney enacted a <a href=\"https://download.fargond.gov/0/mayoral_mask_mandate.pdf\">citywide rule</a> instructing everyone in the city to don a mask indoors and outdoors if they are with people who are not members of their own household.

So what's happened is the businesses now kind of blame the mayor for saying you got to wear a mask in their business so they don't really irritate their client,\" Mahoney told Business Insider. \"It's more that, well, the mayor says you got to do it, so you gotta do it.\"</p><p>Currently, the state encourages mask usage but has stopped short of requiring it, despite North Dakota becoming the first state to surpass 100 cases per 100,000 people, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/10/27/21534480/north-dakota-south-dakota-covid-coronavirus-pandemic-third-wave\">according to an October 27 report from Vox</a>.&#160;</p><p>Mahoney lamented what he described as a lack of leadership in North Dakota on measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus in the state. Gov. Doug Burgum has taken a hands-off approach to face mask regulations, arguing it \"is not a magic bullet to make this virus go away,\" <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-bismarck-doug-burgum-north-dakota-elections-0d2f470fe7a14a5ce156b6724de3bce7\">the Associated Press reported</a> in October.</p><p>Mahoney takes issue with that strategy.</p><p>\"So ... do I shut your businesses down, or do you do that? And early on the mayors pushed back and said, 'We want to have some ability to be part of the decision-making,'\" he said.&#160;</p><p>Other cities in North Dakota have since adopted rules for face masks. Mahoney said that should be a cue for leaders at the state level to act.</p><p>\"More of us feel it would be very helpful.

Others, like Blue Origin, want to build brand-new space accommodations so large and sophisticated that they could start to resemble life on Earth.&#160;</p><h2>The ISS is getting old</h2><p>The station has already outlived its life expectancy of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/shuttle/sts110/iss-qa.html#:~:text=V%20Well%2C%20on%20paper%20the,Fifteen%20times%20two%20is%2030.\">15 years</a>.

Then once the ISS retires, that module, along with any others that Axiom has added in the intervening years, would theoretically detach to become an independent orbital outpost.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f63df9c57b7da001ee12606?format=jpeg\" alt=\"axiom module 2\" height=\"1060\" width=\"1885\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An artist&#39;s rendering of Axiom&#39;s Earth Observatory, a section within its planned International Space Station module.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Axiom Space</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Another company with similar aspirations is Bigelow Aerospace, which was founded by real estate billionaire Robert Bigelow in 1999. The business has already sent a working prototype of its inflatable ISS module to space — the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, has been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bigelow-aerospace-mars-transporter-inside-interior-pictures-photos-2019-9#so-far-the-company-has-an-impressive-track-record-it-has-launched-several-working-prototypes-into-space-the-latest-of-which-is-the-bigelow-expandable-activity-module-or-beam-which-is-attached-to-the-international-space-station-4\">attached to the station</a> since 2016. It's currently used for storage.</p><p>But Bigelow is designing a new version of the habitat at its facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, that is far bigger and more ambitious than the first. The latest model, called the B330, has 11,650 cubic feet of internal volume (330 cubic meters, hence its name. That's <a href=\"https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/conversions/common/square-feet-cubic-feet.php\">roughly the size</a> of an 1,165-square-foot apartment with 10-foot ceilings.&#160;</p><p>\"Equipped with two galleys, two toilets, enormous cargo space, and two dissimilar propulsion systems, this is the ideal habitat for a long-duration space mission,\" Bigelow <a href=\"http://bigelowaerospace.com/pages/news/learnmore.php?story=b330_mars\">said in a statement in September 2019</a>. \"This large space station can accommodate four people indefinitely and five people for many months.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d7ac66e2e22af0b746a1194?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Bigelow space pod\" height=\"2026\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>NASA astronauts kneel inside a prototype of Bigelow Aerospace&#39;s space station module.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Bigelow Aerospace via Imgur</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Eventually, Bigelow hopes some version of the B330 could house astronauts journeying to Mars.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa090c41df1d5001821876d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sierra nevada inflatable gateway habitat\" height=\"354\" width=\"630\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sierra Nevada&#39;s inflatable space-station prototype.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Sierra Nevada Corporation</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>Yet another company, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, is working on a prototype of a three-story inflatable space habitat.

She told Business Insider the inflatable habitat could serve multiple purposes in space, including as \"a manufacturing facility, a hotel, which some people might be interested in, or an observatory.\"</p><p>The eventual goal, she added, is \"replacing the existing space station with a new capability.\"</p><h2><strong>Blue Origin envisions 'fundamentally different' space habitats</strong></h2><p>While corporations like Bigelow and Axiom are using the ISS as a starting point for space habitats that could eventually become independent stations, others, like Blue Origin, are already working on standalone orbital habitats.&#160;</p><p>That company, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, envisions habitats far roomier and more luxurious than the ISS. A job posting from Blue Origin in September suggested that even its early stations would be \"fundamentally different from 'exploration' habitats designed for small, professionally trained crews in deep space.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cd4db92021b4c07d4482473?format=jpeg\" alt=\"blue moon lunar lander BlueOrigin_Colony Four\" height=\"1687\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An artist&#39;s concept of an O&#39;Neill space colony, which could theoretically emulate Earth-like living conditions in space.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Origin</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In the long term, Bezos envisions massive habitats across the solar system that could house a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-space-mars-colonies-spacex-blue-origin-2019-6\">space-based economy of millions of workers</a>, allowing heavy industry to move off our planet.

years evaded efforts by security firms and governments to shut it down.</li>\n<li>The wave of attacks last week came after Microsoft announced last month that it majorly disrupted the bot network by working with the US military, taking 94% of its infrastructure offline &#8212; but cybercriminals rebuilt the botnet shortly after, analysts said.</li>\n<li>Cybersecurity experts say the events show the resiliency of ransomware hackers' tactics, and build on longstanding fears that the ransomware could be used to target local elections offices, potentially making it more difficult to count

month, Microsoft announced it had won a major victory in the fight against cybercrime. The company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-thwarts-massive-botnet-that-could-have-targeted-elections-2020-10\">said</a> in mid-October that it had thwarted Trickbot — a stubborn malware network that's been used to infect critical computer systems, often shutting them down for ransom. Experts were relieved by the announcement; Trickbot and other ransomware infrastructure, they had warned, could be used to target elections offices and cause chaos on Election Day.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But less than two weeks later, an unprecedented wave of ransomware attacks hit US hospitals — and US officials and cybersecurity experts said Trickbot's makers were to blame.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FBI said in a <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a\">warning</a> that cybercriminals used Trickbot in conjunction with other viruses to carry out <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hospitals-across-the-us-hit-with-ransomware-attacks-fbi-warns-2020-10\">a wave of attacks against US hospitals</a> last week, disrupting their computer systems and delaying surgeries. More attacks carried out by the same group could be looming, US officials added.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wave of ransomware attacks show that the cybercriminals who built Trickbot are undeterred and quickly adapting new tools to carry out similar attacks, according to Jeremy Kennelly, analysis manager at FireEye's Mandiant Threat Intelligence unit, which has been tracking the group's botnet activity.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft is now locked in a cat-and-mouse game with the makers of Trickbot, who quickly rebuilt the botnet but used other strains of malware in their arsenal to attack hospitals last week, Kennelly says. In those attacks, Trickbot makers deployed malware on behalf of other cybercriminals like the Russian speaking hacker group UNC 1878, according to security analysts and US officials.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security experts told Business Insider that the hackers' tenacity is a sign that their operations are unlikely to be completely thwarted by Election Day. It's is also another sign that hackers and their malware have grown more formidable, even against security giants like Microsoft.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Microsoft's disruption of the TrickBot botnet was highly successful, however there was evidence shortly thereafter suggesting that the botnet was quickly rebuilt. Despite this back and forth, it appears as though there are ongoing attempts to disrupt the TrickBot botnet's infrastructure which are proving successful, at least for the time being,\" Kennelly told Business Insider, adding that it's unknown whether Microsoft is behind the latest efforts.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft did not provide an on-the-record statement in response to Business Insider's request for comment. We will update this article if that changes.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resurgence of the group that made Trickbot raises concerns about Election Day — experts have long warned that ransomware could be used against local elections offices to cause chaos on Election Day, and Microsoft explicitly <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/20/trickbot-ransomware-disruption-update/\">said</a> that it aimed to disrupt Trickbot near to the election to fend off such attacks. The US Military's Cyber Command also assisted with the effort specifically to protect voting systems from Trickbot, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cyber-command-trickbot-disrupt/2020/10/09/19587aae-0a32-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html\">The Washington Post</a> reported.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Our disruption is intended to disable Trickbot's infrastructure and make it difficult for its operators to enable ransomware attacks, which have been identified as one of the biggest threats to the upcoming U.S. elections,\" Microsoft VP for security Tom Burt said in a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/20/trickbot-ransomware-disruption-update/\">blog post</a> last month, claiming that Microsoft disabled 94% of Trickbot's infrastructure globally.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burt also warned that even if Trickbot is handicapped, the botnet's developers could quickly find other tactics, noting that \"there is not always a straight line to success.\"</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some cybersecurity experts questioned whether Microsoft's announcement on disrupting Trickbot overstated their success at neutralizing the cybercriminals behind the bot network.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The Trickbot disruption efforts looked more like a PR stunt rather than a takedown operation. By now it's pretty clear to everyone that Trickbot is not going away anytime soon,\" Stefan Tanase, a cybercrime analyst, told Business Insider.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefant\" data-focusable=\"true\"></a></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other experts say they believe Microsoft's disruption of Trickbot was effective, but that the recent surge in attacks shows hackers' resourcefulness in evading such crackdowns. The FBI <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a\">said</a> cybercriminals behind the recent attacks on US hospitals used Trickbot in conjunction with a strain of ransomware called Ryuk and a different botnet called BazarLoader, which could ultimately replace long-established botnets like Trickbot.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"There is no doubt that the actions by Microsoft and US Cyber Command significantly disrupted Trickbot. The series of attacks on hospitals may have been the result of old and previously unexploded ordnance being detonated via Trickbot's&#160;remaining&#160;<wbr>infrastructure,\" Brett Callow, a researcher with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, told Business Insider.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hacker groups could also be retaliating against the attempted Trickbot takedown by Microsoft and the US government, according to Caleb Barlow, CEO of the security firm CynergisTek.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The timing of this threat raises many eyebrows, occurring just two weeks after an attempted takedown of TrickBot by the U.S. government and Microsoft and less than a week out from the Presidential election,\" Barlow said via email. \"TrickBot may have been significantly disrupted but it is also clearly resilient.\"</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These experts and others say they see ransomware as an Election Day threat because they could be used to cause chaos or force local governments to pay hefty ransoms.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ransomware works by handicapping victims' computer systems to extort them. Cybercriminals send their victims phishing links that appear to be trustworthy in order to get their login credentials; from there, they break into an organizations' computer systems and install the ransomware, which locks down the systems until victims pay a ransom.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There's no indication that hackers would be able to alter vote tallies with the ransomware; rather, cyberattacks could disrupt local elections offices' administrative processes to slow the counting of ballots or make it harder for officials to announce the results of elections. US officials <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-iran-media-social-media-elections-8cccec2bd393098f9fb39b955ae52bde\">said</a> last month that Russian hackers have targeted local elections offices, stealing voter data from at least two servers, possibly with the intent of disrupting their operations.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent string of ransomware attacks appear to be purely profit-motivated, experts said, but cybercriminals may see voting systems on Election Day as a highly profitable target given their crucial function.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The ransomware business is all about putting pressure on the victim to pay. The more critical the target is, the easier it is for cybercriminals to extort money,\" Tanase said.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefant\" data-focusable=\"true\"></a></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ransomware attacks have risen by 50% over the past three months, according to security firm Check Point, and experts say ransomware attacks will continue to proliferate as long as victims keep paying ransoms. Some firms have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ransomware-attacks-us-treasury-hackers-covid-2020-10\">called on lawmakers to ban ransom payments</a> in order to choke out incentives for criminals.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Updated Nov. 2, 2019 at 7:16 p.m.: </strong>This story was updated to include new details from security analysts about Microsoft's fight

serious complications, whether or not they were pregnant.&#160;</li>\n<li>The findings add to past research showing COVID-19 can increase the risk of pregnancy complications, though the overall risks are still low.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Most pregnant women with COVID-19 fare well, but they are still at increased risk for serious complications when compared to nonpregnant women with the disease, a large <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e3.htm?s_cid=mm6944e3_w\">report</a> out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found.&#160;</p><p>The analysis looked at data from about 400,000 15- to 44-year-old women who had symptomatic COVID-19 between late January and early October. They found that pregnant women were more likely to be admitted into the intensive care unit, put on ventilators, need life support, and even die than those who weren't pregnant.&#160;</p><p>Specifically, pregnant women with COVID-19 were nearly four times as likely to need ventilation and twice as likely to die than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 of the same age. Still, their overall risks for complications were low: 1.5% of pregnant women went to the ICU, 0.29% needed ventilation, 0.07 required life support, and 0.15% died.&#160;</p><p>The findings demonstrate how important it is for pregnant women and their families to take coronavirus transmission measures seriously. They could also inform how healthcare systems treat pregnant COVID-19 patients.&#160;</p><h2>Women of color were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and negative outcomes&#160;</h2><p>In 2019, 24% of pregnant women were Hispanic and 51% were white. In the current analysis, 30% of the COVID-19 positive pregnant women were Hispanic and only 24% were white. Like past research, this finding suggests people of color are disproportionately susceptible to contracting COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>The report illuminated other racial disparities too, with pregnant Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women seeming to be at disproportionate risk of ICU admission, and non-Hispanic Black women, whether or not they were pregnant, having higher rates of death from COVID-19.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Marian Knight, the lead author <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/half-pregnant-women-in-uk-coronavirus-black-ethnic-minorities-2020-6\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"86e7adc1423d6c7969479b485ea24799\">of a UK study</a> that found more than half of pregnant women who were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 were Black or from other minority ethnic groups, previously told Insider more qualitative research involving talking to women about their experiences is \"urgently needed.\"</p><p>That work, she said, will help discern what puts pregnant women of color at such risk for COVID-19, be it household arrangements, jobs that make physical distancing difficult, restricted access to healthcare, something else, or all of the above.&#160;</p><h2>In contrast to past research, the findings suggest pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to die than nonpregnant women with the illness&#160;</h2><p>The current report had some limitations, mostly related to incomplete data. For instance, providers may be more inclined to report more serious outcomes and some serious outcomes may not yet be seen.&#160;</p><p>Pregnant people's increased risk for serious outcomes could also be related to how pregnancy affects the body, for example by increasing heart rate and oxygen consumption, decreasing lung capacity, dampening the immune system, and raising the risk for blood clots, the authors write.</p><p>But the large number of women studied adds to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-pregnant-women-increased-risk-for-severe-coronavirus-cases-hospitalization-2020-6\">past research finding that pregnant women with COVID-1</a>9 are more likely to end up in the ICU and receive ventilation than nonpregnant women of the same age. It also finds pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to need life support and die than nonpregnant women, which past research didn't find.&#160;</p><p>pregnant women and their families should take precautions like limiting interactions with people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus, wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, frequently washing their hands, and staying up to date on their prenatal care visits, the authors write.&#160;</p><p>Because other research has shown pregnant women, whether or not they have COVID-19, are also <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/coronavirus-linked-high-rates-depression-anxiety-pregnant-women-new-moms-2020-6\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\"

and family, online support groups, or a mental health provider.&#160;</p><p>\"There are going to be a lot of emotions, some of which are sadness, grief and the unknown,\" Dr. Jane van Dis, an OB-GYN

government administration as opposed to a \"red wave\" administration, according to research by market strategist Ed Yardeni.</p><p>In a note to clients Monday, Yardeni highlighted the historical performance of the S&#38;P 500 since the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the six following periods when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House, the benchmark US equity index returned an average of 56%.</p><p>The best \"blue wave\" performance came from the FDR administration, with the S&#38;P 500 netting a return of 113%, and the worst came during the Bill Clinton administration of the early 1990's when the index returned just 4.6%.</p><p>However, during periods of Republican control, something that's only happened three times since 1932, Yardeni found that the S&#38;P 500 returned an average of 35%.&#160;</p><p>The best \"red wave\" performance came from the George W. Bush administration of 2001-2006, with the S&#38;P 500 returning 58%. The worst \"red wave\" performance came from the Donald Trump administration of 2017-2018, with the S&#38;P 500 returning 12.8%, Yardeni found.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong>&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-and-avoid-in-3-election-outcomes-stifel-2020-10?r=gr-sub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-position=\"4\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Stifel asked its analysts to identify stocks most likely to be positively or negatively affected by the election results. Here are the dozens of stocks to buy or avoid in each of the 3 outcomes.</a></em></p><p>Still, according to Yardeni, there's one scenario when the market historically performed better than both a \"blue wave\" and \"red wave\" scenario: when the government was divided amongst both Republicans and Democrats.&#160;</p><p>On average, since the election of FDR, the S&#38;P 500 returned an average of 60% when one party controlled either Congress or The White House, but not both.&#160;</p><p>\"This suggests that gridlock is more bullish than the two unified alternatives, which are also bullish, but less so with Blue Waves more bullish than Red Waves,\" Yardeni said,&#160;</p><p>The common notion is that a gridlocked government prevents less meddling of the government in business affairs, which allows businesses to do what they do best: create jobs.&#160;</p><p>Or, according to Yardeni, could it be that who occupies the White House and Congress do not matter as much to the stock market as does the Fed?</p><p>\"I think so,\" Yardeni concluded.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa0695691178a0019b3dc40?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Yardeni Research.JPG\" height=\"677\"

Equities ran \"far ahead of economic realities\" in 2019, a disconnect that only intensified during the COVID-19 crisis, Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said in an October 28 <a href=\"https://blog.principal.com/2020/10/28/short-and-sharp-2020-the-year-when-nothing-really-changed-for-markets/\">blog post</a>.</p><p>Last year's dislocation between growth and value stock performances also widened through 2020. Such gaps pose significant risks to stocks until they're addressed, Shah said.</p><p>\"2020 is the year we would all like to forget — and somehow, equity markets have already done just that,\" Shah said. \"Indeed, just as it was in late 2019, fundamentals and valuations appear to be of limited relevance in this market.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-and-avoid-in-3-election-outcomes-stifel-2020-10?r=gr-sub\" data-analytics-position=\"4\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Stifel asked its analysts to identify stocks most likely to be positively or negatively affected by the election results.

The central bank's asset purchases, credit-market backstop, and historically low rates helped pull investors back into the market and stave off bankruptcies expected to take place through the recession. Investors who stuck with the \"don't fight the Fed\" strategy should continue to do so in 2021, because monetary policy support is the \"key determinant\" for markets next year, Shah said.</p><p>But just as the central bank's support lifted markets, the unwinding of such aid could slam valuations. The Fed is expected to keep rates near zero for several years to aid the nation's recovery, but markets have grown unhealthily dependent on low rates, Shah said.</p><p>Once economic activity returns to pre-pandemic highs, the US will inevitably need to turn its focus to its massive debt pile. Markets are poised to face some turbulence as the Fed retracts its policy support and reins in the liquidity that helped pad the economy — and investors — from additional damage.</p><p>If the first part of the market's recovery came from the central bank's support, the Fed's withdrawal will kick off a new, more challenging climb, Shah said.</p><p>\"Part two of the story will involve dealing with the inevitable hangover of policy, debt levels, and dependency on low rates,\" Shah added. \"That's what things will get a whole lot tougher.\"</p><p><strong><em>Now read more markets coverage from

I'm no stranger to in-person tastings thanks to my background as a travel editor, and I remember the days of drinking Chianti in Tuscany, throwing back cava in Catalonia, and sipping Chardonnay in Sonoma. I was hesitant at first about doing a virtual class since wine tastings are such sensorial experiences. A huge part of the fun for me has always been looking out at a stunning vineyard view, chatting with whoever is pouring the wine, and sometimes even getting a chance to tour the cellars and learn about the winemaking process.</p>\n<h2>Enjoy more great virtual experiences:</h2>\n<ul class=\"summary-list\">\n <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-airbnb-virtual-experiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 hotels and Airbnbs around the world are currently offering virtual classes in lieu of their usual on-site activities and events — almost all of them are free</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/online-airbnb-experiences-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airbnb is now offering online experiences via Zoom video calls.

While the particular class we did was geared towards beginners, I still picked up quite a bit of new wine knowledge. My fiancé, who's typically more of a craft brew guy than a gentleman of fine wines, also enjoyed the introductory level and the interactive aspect to the class since he was able to ask questions as we went.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We opted for a group class so we didn't know who was joining in. If you really want the experience of having it just be your group, I suggest booking a private tasting, which many of the below options offer. We chose to connect more privately after instead, hopping on our own Zoom call over the last glass of our favorite wine from the class to discuss the tidbits we'd picked up.</p>\n<p>Despite my initial misgivings, it ended up making for a fun evening and I discovered a new favorite Sauvignon Blanc I'll definitely be drinking again in the future. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Here are 18 virtual wine tastings to try at home:</h2> \n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n  Wine Tasting: Sensory Techniques for Wine Analysis on Coursera \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ec2d9a2f0f41970df38b3a6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Wine Tasting Class\" height=\"819\" width=\"1092\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Coursera</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>For those who want to seriously up their wine tasting skills while quarantining, Coursera offers a free class from UC Davis to turn beginner sippers into pro sommeliers.
