He was also an assassin for the CIA. Okay, that&#8217;s more than likely not true – but Barris himself made those claims in his autobiography <strong><em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em></strong>. The CIA denied Barris was an agent – but that&#8217;s exactly what they <em>would</em> say, isn&#8217;t it? Of course, Barris himself also admitted he made the whole thing up. No matter – it was a good story, and it was turned into a twisted little film directed by George Clooney and starring Sam Rockwell as Barris. Now, the story is being adapted again – into an Apple TV+ series starring <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666079\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline is reporting that &#8220;Apple won an auction and acquired the script to develop an hour-long drama series&#8221; based on Chuck Barris&#8217;s fictionalized autobiography <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em>, with Justin Timberlake set to star. Barris, best known as the host of <em>The Gong Show </em>and creator of <em>The Dating Game</em> and <em>The Newlywed</em> <em>Game</em>, published <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em> in 1984. Rather than a standard showbiz autobiography, <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em> had a whopper of a claim: in addition to creating and hosting TV shows, Barris was <em>also</em> an assassin for the CIA.</p>\n<p>Barris didn&#8217;t let the rouse last very long – the same year the book was published, he also appeared on the <em>Today Show</em> and admitted: &#8220;No, I was never a CIA hitman. I never did those things. I once applied for the CIA, and while I was going through the process I got a job and went on television. But I had always wondered what would have happened if I had done both.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This story was turned into an excellent movie in 2002, directed by George Clooney and featuring a script by Charlie Kaufman (although Kaufman has gone on record saying he doesn&#8217;t like the film because Clooney changed much of his screenplay). Sam Rockwell starred as Barris, and he turned in a wonderful, weird, morose performance. Here&#8217;s a trailer.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EkARnq7XRE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>As for this new Apple TV+ series, I suppose it <em>could</em> be good, but I have to say: Timberlake feels completely wrong for this role. I think Timberlake can deliver a good performance – he&#8217;s memorable in his brief turn in <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>, and he&#8217;s pretty damn great in <em>The Social Network</em>. But going from Sam Rockwell to Justin Timberlake seems like a major step down.</p>\n<p>The series – which is untitled for now, but let&#8217;s be real, they&#8217;re probably going to use the <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em> title again – comes from Miramax and Paramount Television Studios. <strong>David Hollander</strong> will be executive producer and serve as showrunner. <strong>Jon Worley</strong>, who wrote the pilot, is also serving as executive producer.</p>\n<p>And now I&#8217;ll leave you with the final scene of the <em>Confessions of the Dangerous Mind</em> movie – a haunting, unsettling finale that I think about often, especially when I&#8217;m feeling particularly melancholy.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6HCOGj1lNI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

The film is set inside a gay conversion camp and is described as &#8220;a queer empowerment story.&#8221; Logan is writing the film as well.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666155\"></span></p>\n<p>Blumhouse announced the news that they&#8217;re teaming with John Logan for <em>Whistler Camp</em>, a horror movie described as a &#8220;queer empowerment story set at a gay conversion camp.&#8221; And that&#8217;s really all we know! I wish we had some more info, especially since I can&#8217;t just end the post right here. That said, this is a fascinating premise. Conversion therapy is a terrible and discredited practice – in the United States, 20 states, as well as the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 85 municipalities (primarily located in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Minnesota), have banned conversion therapy on minor clients (D.C. is the only U.S. jurisdiction whose ban also applies to adults). Using a conversion camp as the setting of a horror film sets the stage for something both disturbing and socially conscious.</p>\n<p>John Logan will direct the film, marking his feature directorial debut, and Deadline reports <em>Whistler Camp</em> is currently in the midst of casting. The official announcement doesn&#8217;t confirm who is handling the script for <em>Whistler Camp</em>, but I&#8217;ve confirmed with the good folks at Blumhouse that Logan is writing as well as directing the project. That makes sense since Logan has spent almost his entire career as a screenwriter. Not only did Logan create and write nearly every episode of the excellent and criminally underrated horror series <em>Penny Dreadful</em>, but he&#8217;s also responsible for the screenplays for movies such as <i>Skyfall, Spectre, Gladiator, The Aviator, Hugo, The Last Samurai, Sweeney Todd, Rango, Alien: Covenant, </i>and <i>Any Given Sunday</i>. Recently, Logan also created and wrote several episodes of<em> Penny Dreadful: City of Angels</em>, a spin-off of the original <em>Penny Dreadful</em> that wasn&#8217;t as well received.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason Blum</strong> will produce the film. <strong>Michael Aguilar</strong> (<em>Penny Dreadful</em>, <em>Kidding</em>) will also produce. <strong>Ryan Turek</strong> is the creative executive overseeing the film for Blumhouse. There&#8217;s no release date for <em>Whistler Camp</em> just yet, and it&#8217;s unclear when it will begin production. The film joins an ever-growing list of upcoming Blumhouse titles, including <em>The Forever Purge</em>, <em>Halloween Kills</em>, <em>The Black Phone</em>, and many, many more.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/whistler-camp/\">&#8216;Whistler Camp&#8217;, a Horror Film Set at a Gay Conversion Camp, Coming From Blumhouse and &#8216;Penny Dreadful&#8217; Creator John Logan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7N2DVMGbW9Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 21:30:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Whistler-Camp-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"1a7c463ae4f656a61b5dd9f1739aaaac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-24-072_076344f9a44105e7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":23132,"destBytes":11472,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Whistler-Camp-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-24-072_076344f9a44105e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn62@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-645_9fd07c75e72c11d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7N2DVMGbW9Q:HRnBQYuHWeI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-279_4e471f1e215fd12e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7N2DVMGbW9Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-197_737ceae22174316b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323396},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Episode 5 Will Have a Big Marvel Cameo – But It’s Not Who You Think It Is","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666133","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-662209\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-Review-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-Review.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-Review-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the fate of every Marvel Disney+ series so far to be flooded by theories and speculation each week. Who will the next character reveal be? What will be the latest twist? When will Mephisto appear? But the folks behind <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong> are getting ahead of the curve and teasing a major Marvel cameo that will appear in the upcoming fifth episode.</p>\n<p>However, this is the part where we kindly ask everyone to adjust their expectations.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666133\"></span></p>\n<p>When <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> first began airing in mid-March, showrunner and writer <strong>Malcolm Spellman</strong> teased a special cameo in episode 5, which he&#8217;s building up to be quite a doozy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hands down, [episode] five, it just gets real,&#8221; Spellman had said in an interview with <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/falcon-winter-soldier-malcolm-spellman-villains-captain-america/#4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ComicBook.com</a> in March. &#8220;And five, you&#8217;re going to cry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what of this cameo? Fans have already begun speculating that this Marvel character will be one of the beloved heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, come to reunite with their fellow Avengers. But in an interview with <a href=\"https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/anthony-mackie-sebastian-stan-and-creators-specter-of-cap-defines-falcon-and-winter-soldier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, Spellman had shut down the possibility that it would be an Avenger that we had previously met in the MCU (so you can toss aside your hopes of a <em>Black Panther</em> or a <em>Black Widow </em>character popping up). Instead Spellman described this episode 5 cameo as a &#8220;grounded character&#8221; who would make a nice contrast to &#8220;world-shakers&#8221; like Thor or Captain America. Spellman said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are characters in our series who I would love to see partnered with like — it’s a very, very grounded character — partnered with one of the big world-shakers like Thor or someone like that. The personality is so strong, it’s the episode five character. I’d love to see that character with Thor.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>/Film can confirm that this surprise character is not one that we&#8217;ve seen in the MCU before and not one who is primed to appear in an upcoming film. However, we have learned it is an existing Marvel Comics character who is played by a well-known performer. And this guest star must have knocked it out of the park for Spellman to hype up this upcoming episode so much.</p>\n<p>Episode 5 of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> debuts on Disney+ on Friday, April 16.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All eyes are on the shield, as Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, and Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier decide to team up—or rather, work together—when a new global threat launches them into an unexpected mission that may hit too close to home</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-cameo-episode-5/\">&#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8217;

Here&#8217;s the new lineup in order, starting off with the sole change today (so far) from Universal/Blumhouse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Forever Purge</em> – <strong>July 2</strong>, <strong>2021</strong> (previously July 9, 2021)</li>\n<li><em>Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins</em> – <strong>July 23</strong>, <strong>2021</strong> (previously October 22, 2021)</li>\n<li><em>Jackass 4</em> – <strong>October 22</strong>, <strong>2021</strong> (previously September 3, 2021)</li>\n<li><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> – <strong>November 19</strong>, <strong>2021</strong> (previously July 2, 2021)</li>\n<li><em>Mission: Impossible 7</em> – <strong>May 27</strong>, <strong>2022</strong> (previously November 19, 2021)</li>\n<li>Untitled Bee Gees movie – <strong>November 4</strong>, <strong>2022</strong></li>\n<li><em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons</em> – <strong>March 3</strong>, <strong>2023</strong> (previously May 27, 2022)</li>\n<li>Untitled <em>Star Trek</em> film – <strong>June 9</strong>, <strong>2023</strong></li>\n<li><em>Mission: Impossible 8</em> – <strong>July 7</strong>, <strong>2023</strong> (previously November 4, 2022)</li>\n<li><em>The Shrinking of Treehorn</em> – <strong>November 10</strong>, <strong>2023</strong></li>\n<li>Untitled Ryan Reynolds/John Krasinski Film – <strong>November 17</strong>, <strong>2023</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know what you&#8217;re probably thinking: &#8220;Wait a second, there&#8217;s a Jackie Treehorn biopic coming in a couple of years? I didn&#8217;t know a Lebowski Cinematic Universe was in the works!&#8221; I&#8217;m sorry to tell you that <em>The Shrinking of Treehorn</em> is actually an animated film that has nothing to do with the Coen Brothers&#8217; rich pornographer character. Instead, the film is based on a children&#8217;s book from 1971, and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-shrinking-of-treehorn-movie/\">last we heard</a> back in 2019, it had Ron Howard attached to make his animation directing debut.</p>\n<p>And after briefly getting excited that Ryan Reynolds and John Krasinski might be teaming up for a third <em>Quiet Place</em> movie, I remembered that they&#8217;re actually uniting for a movie called <em>Imaginary Friends</em>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/imaginary-friends-movie-starring-john-krasinski-and-ryan-reynolds/\">which we wrote about a couple of years ago</a>. The comedy, which will be written and directed by Krasinski, follows a man who can see and talk to people’s imaginary friends, and things take a turn when some of the imaginary friends who have lost their real pals start to turn to the dark side. Krasinski is also set to co-star.</p>\n<p>Aside from selfishly being disappointed that it will be longer until we get to see the new <em>Top Gun</em> and <em>Mission: Impossible</em> films, my other big reaction to this news is being curious about one of these titles.</p>\n<p>Paramount has been talking about making a new <em>Star Trek</em> movie for a long time&#8230;but which one is now dated for 2023? Is it the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-script-chris-pine/\">Quentin Tarantino Trek</a>? The <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/noah-hawley-star-trek-update/\">Noah Hawley Trek</a>? Or, more likely, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-trek-movie-kalinda-vazquez/\">the one that&#8217;s written by <em>Discovery</em> scribe Kalinda Vazquez</a>? I&#8217;m looking forward to learning more details about that very soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-next-star-trek-movie-has-a-stardate-in-2023-1846652498?rev=1617992911109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">io9</a> reports that &#8220;a source close to the project&#8221; revealed that &#8220;this is not the Vazquez script. It is, however, a separate J.J. Abrams-produced <em>Trek</em> film but all detail beyond that remains top secret.&#8221; The plot thickens!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/top-gun-maverick-release-date-shift/\">&#8216;Top Gun: Maverick&#8217;, &#8216;Mission: Impossible&#8217; Sequels Shift Release Dates, New &#8216;Star Trek&#8217; Movie Coming, and Much More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wLHsB8rOjZo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 18:36:31 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/top-gun-maverick-release-delay-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"e7cbc3a75c9eec74b0b808bea885e82d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-24-381_e8337b41091f57f1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":42216,"destBytes":27608,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/top-gun-maverick-release-delay-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-24-381_e8337b41091f57f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-03-929_0b8ce330eee577b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wLHsB8rOjZo:NOgmzbpkg_0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn100@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-217_84687f41c9761429.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wLHsB8rOjZo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-03-847_eb1533ff4f0d9e4e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323397},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"‘Hotel Transylvania’ Short Film Lands Online; Final Theatrical Sequel Coming Out Sooner Than Expected","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666085","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-666096 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hotel-Transylvania-short-film-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Transylvania short film\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hotel-Transylvania-short-film.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hotel-Transylvania-short-film-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a double dose of good news for the <strong><em>Hotel Transylvania</em></strong> fans out there. <em><strong>Monster Pets: A Hotel Transylvania Short</strong></em>, which is currently playing in Cinemark theaters, has made its way online in advance of this weekend&#8217;s Pets Day on April 11. (No, you&#8217;re not the only one who had no idea that Pets Day was a thing.)</p>\n<p>The other piece of good news is two-pronged and a bit more bittersweet. The fourth installment of the film franchise has received a new official title: <em><strong>Hotel Transylvania: Transformania</strong></em>, and its release date has moved up on the calendar, so fans won&#8217;t have to wait as long to see it. It will now debut on <strong>July 23</strong>, <strong>2021</strong> instead of August 6. For fans, the bittersweet part is that Sony Pictures Animation has confirmed this will indeed be the final entry in this franchise. Check out the new <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> short film below.<span id=\"more-666085\"></span></p>\n<h2>Hotel Transylvania Short Film</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZqPA6GfIqQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly never seen any of the <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> films, but this is pretty cute as far as tie-in shorts go. Something sounded slightly off about the voice of Drac, who is typically played by <strong>Adam Sandler</strong> in the feature-length movies, and a quick glance at this short&#8217;s credits confirm that the character is voiced by <strong>Brian Hull</strong> instead. (Couldn&#8217;t get Sandler to record his lines remotely for this one, eh? Weird.)</p>\n<p><strong>Genndy Tartakovsky</strong> executive produced this short alongside <strong>Michelle Murdocca</strong>, but it was written by <strong>Jennifer Kluska</strong> and directed by Kluska and <strong>Derek Drymon</strong>, the duo who will be taking over the directing reins from Tartakovsky on the upcoming theatrical sequel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What would it be like if the Drac Pack all owned pets? We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to jump back into the world of <i>Hotel Transylvania</i>, and explore all the fun and lovable frustrations of pets through a monster lens,&#8221; Kluska and Drymon said in a statement. &#8220;What happens when your golden retriever is 5 stories tall? Or your chihuahua breathes fire? Being able to introduce an all-new group of characters in <i>Monster Pets</i> who are just as funny and weird as the Drac Pack was an absolute blast. We hope audiences enjoy the short, and look forward to seeing the monster pets make an appearance in the upcoming <i>Hotel Transylvania: Transformania</i>!&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Hotel Transylvania: Transformania</em> (which, as the logo indicates in a post-credits reveal in the short, seems to have something to do with electricity) is the fourth and final entry into this franchise and will arrive in theaters on July 23, 2021.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hotel-transylvania-short-film/\">&#8216;Hotel Transylvania&#8217; Short Film Lands Online; Final Theatrical Sequel Coming Out Sooner Than Expected</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5n4gGOOVLnU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 19:30:03 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hotel-Transylvania-short-film-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e575d1601d451f9855044e92a1bcf196","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-54-220_8c16a1f2bb862c3b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":27647,"destBytes":14730,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hotel-Transylvania-short-film-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-54-220_8c16a1f2bb862c3b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-03-208_386523eae419b4fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5n4gGOOVLnU:OBzt7fMox4s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn87@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-03-265_db9f2a572feb5553.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5n4gGOOVLnU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-801_c940d08d5f6d27f6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323401},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"HBO Max Wants to Find ‘The Real Magic Mike’ in New Competition Series from Channing Tatum and Steven Soderbergh","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666083","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666098 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/magicmike-channingtatum-stage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/magicmike-channingtatum-stage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/magicmike-channingtatum-stage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Magic Mike</em> </strong>helped turn <strong>Channing Tatum</strong> into a huge star, and now the former male stripper will try to help another chiseled dancer find fame and fortune with a new competition series on HBO Max. Channing Tatum and director <strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong> are executive producing the tentatively titled <strong><em>The Real Magic Mike</em></strong>, a series that will turn a group of 10 men who have &#8220;lost their magic&#8221; into real-life Magic Mikes. <span id=\"more-666083\"></span></p>\n<p>HBO Max sent out a press release announcing the order of <em>The Real Magic Mike</em>, an unscripted competition series from Eureka Productions and Warner Bros. Unscripted Television in association with Warner Horizon. Magic Mike franchise producer Reid Carolin is also executive producing with <strong>Peter Kiernan</strong>, <strong>Gregory Jacobs</strong>, <strong>Nick Wechsler</strong>, <strong>Vincent Marini</strong>, <strong>Alycia Rossiter</strong>, <strong>Cassie Lambert Scalettar</strong>, <strong>Chris <wbr />Culvenor</strong>,<strong> Paul Franklin</strong>, <strong>Wes Dening</strong>, and <strong>David Tibballs</strong>, along with Kevin Boyer as co-executive producer.</p>\n<p>On <em>The Real Magic Mike</em>, HBO Max says 10 men will &#8220;bare their souls and more as they evolve their bodies, learn to perform spectacular routines, and develop a new level of self-confidence.&#8221; Not only will they strip themselves of their clothes but also their emotional baggage as they try to get their mojo back and become the one and only Real Magic Mike. The title also comes with a cash prize and an opportunity to perform on the Magic Mike Live stage in Las Vegas. A nationwide casting search for the contestants is currently underway.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Aubrey</strong>, Head of Original Content at HBO Max, said in a statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;From box office hits to sold-out live shows, Magic Mike has proven to be a pop culture juggernaut that continues to delight people across the globe. We’re excited to work with Channing, Steven and the team behind Magic Mike Live to continue this successful franchise that celebrates self-confidence and sexiness both inside and out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mike Darnell</strong>, President of Warner Bros. Unscripted Television, added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Magic Mike is one of Warner Bros.’ most iconic franchises. We couldn’t be more excited to be working with Channing, Steven and HBO Max on an all-new vision of this amazing and legendary brand. We’re looking forward to giving fans a front row seat as we search the country for undiscovered talent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s always dispiriting when studios refer to their titles as brands, but that&#8217;s what show business is all about. Even so, HBO Max has done a solid job capitalizing on the most recognizable titles that fall under the WarnerMedia banner, and they have much more on the way. Since another <em>Magic Mike</em> movie is probably out of the question without Steven Soderbergh and Channing Tatum signing off on it, this is probably the next best thing. Hopefully it actually does some good for these men rather than just being an excuse for showing off glistening muscular bodies in contest with each other.</p>\n<p><em>The Real Magic Mike</em> doesn&#8217;t have a specific release date yet, but it&#8217;s expected to arrive on HBO Max later this year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-real-magic-mike-series/\">HBO Max Wants to Find &#8216;The Real Magic Mike&#8217; in New Competition Series from Channing Tatum and Steven Soderbergh</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4rw3MB4K8Tg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 17:30:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/magicmike-channingtatum-stage-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"106c7af3510a3a501f066fadedf993e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-23-978_1d46dd195832bcbd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":40661,"destBytes":27536,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/magicmike-channingtatum-stage-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-23-978_1d46dd195832bcbd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-03-621_eeba616449ea7c1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4rw3MB4K8Tg:dd0PPN8a8Cw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn60@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-03-415_4a34eb7d7d25b76d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4rw3MB4K8Tg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-231_74c41e52fb952a69.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323402},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"Rare 1938 Superman Comic Sells for Record $3.25 Million","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665911","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665919\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"superman comic\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357-768x328.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bird, it&#8217;s a plane, it&#8217;s a sky-high record set by an iconic <strong>Superman</strong> comic. The very first, in fact. In 1938, <strong><em>Action Comics #1</em></strong> would change pop culture history, introducing the Man of Steel to the world. And now, a rare issue of <em>Action Comics #1</em> has made its own mark on history, setting an all-time record for a comic book sale.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665911\"></span></p>\n<p>There are only a few existing copies of the comic book that introduced Superman to the world. And it just sold for a whopping $3.25 million. The <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/man-a-steal-rare-superman-comic-sells-for-record-3-25m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Associated Press</a> reports that an issue of <em>Action Comics #1</em> set a new record when it sold for $3.25 million in a private sale, narrowly edging out the previous record set by another copy in 2014 for slightly over $3.2 million.</p>\n<p>The sale was announced by <span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">ComicConnect.com</span>, an online auction and consignment company. The 1938 comic &#8220;really is the beginning of the superhero genre,&#8221; said <span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">ComicConnect.com</span> COO Vincent Zurzolo, who brokered the sale. Below is an image of the copy that sold for the record-breaking amount.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665916\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/superman-700x394.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/superman-700x394.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/superman-360x203.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/superman-768x433.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/superman.jpeg 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Action Comics #1</em> is widely regarded to be the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of comic books, with few unrestored original copies believed to exist. The book&#8217;s first issue run in 1938 had a print run of just 200,000 copies and a cover price of just 10 cents. So it&#8217;s no surprise that one in as good condition as the one pictured above sold for as much as it did, making a nice profit for the seller of this issue, who bought the comic in 2018 for slightly more than $2 million.</p>\n<p>Zurzolo said that it&#8217;s estimated only about 100 exist today, and in varying conditions. He said this copy is among the best-kept ones.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no comic book that you could value higher in terms of a comic book than <em>Action Comics</em> #1,&#8221; Zurzolo said.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no underselling of how seminal a comic this is. <em>Action Comics #1</em> introduced the world to the very first modern superhero, in a story that detailed the origins of the alien hero, who came to Earth from another planet and forged a secret identity as newspaperman Clark Kent. It ushered in a new age for comics, with other heroes like Batman, Wonder Woman, and more following in his footsteps, and eventually paving the way for our superhero-dominated landscape we live in today. When you look at the overall impact that this comic had, it&#8217;s easy to see why it sold for a whopping $3.25 million.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/rare-superman-comic-sale-sets-record/\">Rare 1938 Superman Comic Sells for Record $3.25 Million</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_Lxsc0nnmf0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 23:00:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"b67b7041ace9ebb92dc643c5b1a7e249","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn17@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-24-134_074ec0f956098803.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":53943,"destBytes":40032,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/action-comics-1-e1617898235357-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn17@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-24-134_074ec0f956098803.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/superman-700x394.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-03-451_fe4a7d5fe0a805fc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-03-911_8a0bc64ed357893e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_Lxsc0nnmf0:RjwhbLgjAIE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn91@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-680_96dee9f3bdea9647.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_Lxsc0nnmf0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn56@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-03-198_365d0e01232bb6de.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323402},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"Watch: The Band is Back Together in a Virtual 20th Anniversary ‘Josie and the Pussycats’ Reunion","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666115","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666119\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"josie and the pussycats reunion\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591-768x328.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The band is back together, and ready for a reunion tour. Though that reunion tour mostly comprises of a (very cheery) Zoom chat. <strong>Rachael Leigh Cook</strong>, <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong>, and <strong>Tara Reid</strong> met up for a virtual <strong><em>Josie and the Pussycats</em></strong> reunion on the comedy-musical&#8217;s 20th anniversary.

But as stars Cook, Reid, and Dawson noted in their virtual <em>Josie and the Pussycats</em> reunion, the movie was ahead of its time. The film, inspired by the Archie Comics series and Hanna-Barbera cartoon of the same name, has become a bonafide cult classic, with fans embracing the film&#8217;s satire of consumerism and cutting-edge fashion.</p>\n<p>In the 20th anniversary reunion over Zoom, the stars reminisced about making the film, and the legacy that it&#8217;s left in the two decades since it hit theaters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You watch it now and it so resonates with the time that we&#8217;re in, but at the time it was hard to totally appreciate the satire that it was,&#8221; said Dawson, who played Valerie Brown in the movie.</p>\n<p>Tara Reid, who played Melody Valentine, added, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how many places I&#8217;ve gone [where I&#8217;m told], &#8216;My favorite movie that you&#8217;ve done is <em>Josie and the Pussycats</em>. And I get interviewed all the time, of all the movies I&#8217;ve done. It means so much to me how much they love it, because it meant so much to us. When we made this film, we had the best time ever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And Cook points out that the film — despite being 20 years old — has gained a strong cult following.</p>\n<p>In <em>Josie and the Pussycats</em>, which was directed and co-written by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, &#8220;Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook), Melody (Tara Reid) and Val (Rosario Dawson) are three small-town girl musicians determined to take their rock band out of their garage and straight to the top, while remaining true to their look, style and sound. They get a record deal which brings fame and fortune but soon realize they are pawns of two people who want to control the youth of America. They must clear their names, even if it means losing fame and fortune.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/josie-and-the-pussycats-reunion-20th-anniversary/\">Watch: The Band is Back Together in a Virtual 20th Anniversary &#8216;Josie and the Pussycats&#8217; Reunion</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/zNCC-KYyAeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 22:00:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"428e2da90ca8fddb602bb3c77b7ea6f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-51-108_bda75da379d079dd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":59316,"destBytes":45720,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/josie-and-the-pussycats-e1617988399591-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-51-108_bda75da379d079dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn43@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-03-527_1b51c1d171783fde.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zNCC-KYyAeQ:aMS-dcAbqCM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-10-947_9cf91b0784a26a09.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/zNCC-KYyAeQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-289_ea9dcaaf44c01ffe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323401},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"Watch: This $700 Optimus Prime Toy is More Than Meets the Eye (Because It Self-Transforms)","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666148","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-666161 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Optimus-Prime-self-transforms-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Optimus Prime self-transforms\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Optimus-Prime-self-transforms.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Optimus-Prime-self-transforms-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Every kid who played with Transformers toys probably wished that they could sit back and watch their Optimus Prime transform on its own.

And yes, I am aware that I am genuinely doing a &#8220;won&#8217;t somebody think of the children?&#8221; thing here.)

One of which is an age-old technique that has only been refined as modern technologies improve: filming mirror scenes. Reflective surfaces are the enemy of the camera, catching equipment and crew members on the screen when they don&#8217;t want to be, and calling attention to the artifice of it all. So how do filmmakers go about making cameras disappear? An astute video essay by YouTuber <strong>Paul E.T.</strong> dives into the intricacies of the techniques to shoot mirror scenes. Watch it below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666169\"></span></p>\n<h2>Video Essay: Making Cameras Disappear</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VASwKZAUVSo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Paul E.T. describes how watching a scene from the Netflix crime procedural drama <strong><em>Criminal U.K.</em></strong> in which a camera dolly shot captures both the actors and their reflections on a two-way mirror before circling around to the other side of the glass piqued his curiosity. What techniques did the filmmaking crew use to hide the camera in this shot? The answer is a little complicated. But very fascinating to learn.</p>\n<p>Paul E.T. then goes into detail about the different techniques filmmakers have employed over the years mirror shots, citing scenes from <em>Contact, Sucker Punch</em>, <em>Peggy Sue Got Married, Force Majeure</em>, and others to examine the use of duplicated sets and compositing. Many writers have gone in-depth on the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/contact-mirror-scene/\">famous mirror scene in <em>Contact</em></a>, but Paul E.T. approaches this topic with a cheeky sense of humor and enough new information that it feels innovative and fresh. Specifically, fresh in his journey to find out more about the scene in <em>Criminal U.K.</em> becomes his white whale, as he&#8217;s unable to find out more information on a — let&#8217;s face it — little-seen show outside of a few YouTube video essayists, apparently. (I&#8217;m joking, I&#8217;m sure many people have watched <em>Criminal</em>.)</p>\n<p>Film video essays are a dime a dozen on YouTube, but we wanted to highlight this one because it&#8217;s a smart, well-researched video that has gone viral in recent weeks (it was released over two months ago). And Paul E.T. seems like a channel who could be on the up-and-up, with his fun format and voice. Be sure to check out his other videos too after you watch his take on the (literal) smoke-and-mirrors that filmmakers have used over the years to make cameras disappear from mirror shots.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/votd-making-cameras-disappear/\">VOTD: Video Essay Examines How Filmmakers Make Cameras Disappear</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/6pgJZvRpH48\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 00:00:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/contact-700x289.jpg","linkMd5":"a7d11603201d295a4198d06e9f76d495","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-24-261_5619a0880be7cf87.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":289,"sourceBytes":20295,"destBytes":10218,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/contact-700x289.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-24-261_5619a0880be7cf87.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn7@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-03-211_3e4b979a4fcc880e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6pgJZvRpH48:D455t2cubT4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn21@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-03-209_32b6ad685585c559.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/6pgJZvRpH48":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-04-025_61b3f6653238af15.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323402},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"‘The Crime of the Century’ Trailer: HBO Documentary Tackles the Opioid Crisis","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665872","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665877\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-crime-of-the-century-e1617890073991-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"the crime of the century trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-crime-of-the-century-e1617890073991-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-crime-of-the-century-e1617890073991-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-crime-of-the-century-e1617890073991-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-crime-of-the-century-e1617890073991.jpg 1439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>How did opioids become the center of one of the worst public health crises in U.S. history? That&#8217;s what the new HBO documentary <strong><em>The Crime of the Century</em></strong> aims to find out. Directed by <strong>Alex Gibney</strong> — who won three Emmys in 2015 for his thorough Scientology doc <em>Going Clear</em> and an Oscar for his 2008 look at the U.S. torture and interrogation techniques in Afghanistan, <em>Taxi to the Dark Side</em> — <em>The Crime of the Century</em> is a new two-part documentary that examines how Big Pharma, political operatives, and government regulations led to the opioid crisis claiming half a million lives in this century.

The worst of which comes from <strong>Alec Burlakoff</strong>, the former VP of sales for Insys, a defunct opioid manufacturer, who at the beginning of the trailer, remorselessly says, &#8220;You can make a lot of money getting doctors to prescribe a medication to people who don’t need it. The doctor—he’s a businessman. I gotta show him the WIFM: what’s in it for me? &#8230;It&#8217;s about you prescribing the medication and me paying you as a direct result. Are you in or are you out?&#8221; All this over footage of pills, cash, and body bags.</p>\n<p>Produced in association with <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>The Crime of the Century</em> features interviews with medical professionals, insiders, and victims of opioid addiction. One of the first patients who was prescribed OxyContin, <strong>Gary Blinn</strong> describes how a Purdue Pharma representative told him to take as much OxyContin as he needed. &#8220;It would take me 15 minutes just to eat ‘em all,” Blinn says in the trailer. &#8220;It was like sitting down to a bowl of Cheerios.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gibney is no stranger to controversial topics, having tackled Scientology, U.S. torture in Afghanistan, and another corporate scandal, <em><strong>Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room</strong></em>, which won him an Oscar nomination in 2006.

The book was previously adapted into a beloved movie by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935. Netflix has scored the rights to the new series adaptation, which has <strong>Mark L. Smith</strong> (<em>The Revenant</em>) writing the scripts and <strong>Edward Berger</strong>, who previously worked with Cumberbatch on the Showtime series <em>Patrick Melrose</em>, directing every episode.<span id=\"more-666114\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Cumberbatch will star in a new version of Buchan&#8217;s <em>The 39 Steps</em>, which has been adapted into a play, a video game, and four movies since its publication in 1915. This new iteration is described as &#8220;a provocative, action-packed conspiracy thriller series that updates the classic novel for relevance in contemporary times. An ordinary man, Richard Hannay, becomes an unwitting pawn in a vast, global conspiracy to reset the world order: 39 Steps that will change the world as we know it, with only Hannay standing in the way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hitchcock&#8217;s adaptation veered away from the book, but still has the same &#8220;wrong man on the run&#8221; vibe that many of his most famous American films would later have. (It also features a scene of the lead character being chased by a plane, which Hitchcock would famously use again in the Cary Grant-led <em>North by Northwest</em>.) In the story, the &#8220;39 Steps&#8221; is the name of a mysterious organization of spies, and the Hannay character is the archetypal frazzled hero who must figure out what&#8217;s going on while the police and a band of international assassins are hunting him.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a trailer for Hitchcock&#8217;s adaptation, which starred Robert Donat as Hannay:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4qQJMZdHhc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s plenty of potential in a modern version of this story, although I chafe a little at the idea of Hollywood producing any stories right now that give credence to conspiracy theories. Real world conspiracy theories have become more dangerous than ever, so the idea of a film or television show helping us sympathize with someone who buys into one and then proving them correct gets my personal hackles up at the moment – but your mileage may vary on that front.</p>\n<p>Deadline says there will be &#8220;six or more hourlong episodes&#8221; in this Netflix version, and the production is &#8220;most likely to shoot next year in Europe when schedules clear.&#8221; Cumberbatch and his producing partner <strong>Adam Ackland</strong> will executive produce alongside Smith, Berger, <strong>Sophie Gardiner</strong>, <strong>Cliff Roberts</strong>, and <strong>Keith Redmon</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-39-steps-cumberbatch/\">Benedict Cumberbatch to Star in &#8216;The 39 Steps&#8217; Limited Series for Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xVwbirTR3js\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 19:00:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-39-Steps-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"4c133dbd26b75934a64a2fda83b94aaa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn48@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-27-196_bafa2ca25b6f8ce2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":43251,"destBytes":31768,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-39-Steps-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn48@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-27-196_bafa2ca25b6f8ce2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-325_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn47@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-03-491_7c7357a248a76caf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-03-931_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xVwbirTR3js:68tV8LW4Zic:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-538_55a8dfcdf273a9eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xVwbirTR3js":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn93@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-03-062_561e9c5f838a442e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026323401},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:23","title":"‘Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar’ Music Video Has Jamie Dornan Belting Out “Edgar’s Prayer”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665981","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665985 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/barbandstar-edgarsprayer-jamiedornan-tree-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar Music Video\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/barbandstar-edgarsprayer-jamiedornan-tree.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/barbandstar-edgarsprayer-jamiedornan-tree-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>If <strong><em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em></strong> was able to be released safely in theaters, we&#8217;re betting it would have become a sleeper comedy hit.

One such piece of pure silliness is <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> star <strong>Jamie Dornan</strong> hamming it up as he gets his own ballad to sing in a breakout musical moment.

Thankfully, they didn&#8217;t need the shirt for too long since he had to rip through it with his bare hands.</p>\n<p><em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em> had already won be over before this musical sequence came along. But as soon as it became clear Jamie Dornan was getting his own sad song, not only did I fall even deeper in love with the movie, but I found myself warming up to the Irish actor. He clearly had a blast making this movie, and I hope we get to see him doing more wacky stuff like this.

Using actual low resolution video footage, B-movie actors, and shoestring budget sets, the intention was to create a game that offered a little more realism than your average 32-bit cartridge game. It never really caught on, but now the producer and cast of Shudder&#8217;s hit horror movie <strong><em>Host</em></strong> are trying to bring it back with a new horror video game called <strong><em>Ghosts</em></strong>. And they&#8217;re going to get a little help from Jim Henson&#8217;s Creature Shop to make it happen.<span id=\"more-665871\"></span></p>\n<p>Shepherd, Limited Run Games, and Visible Games are working with <em>Host</em> writer/executive producer <strong>Jed Shepherd</strong> and cast members <strong>Haley Bishop</strong>, <strong>Radina Drandova</strong>, <strong>Jemma Moore</strong>, <strong>Caroline Ward</strong>, and <strong>Emma Louise Webb</strong> on the live-action <em>Ghosts</em> video game. While bringing back a video game format like this is interesting in itself, even more fascinating is that the video game will be played out in real time, only available to be played at a specific time.</p>\n<p>But we&#8217;re getting a head of ourselves. For the uninitiated, let&#8217;s look back at what full-motion video games were back in the 1990s. Here&#8217;s a rundown of some of the weirder titles utilizing the format:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0GW91vKtxQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><i><a title=\"Night Trap\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Trap\">Night Trap</a></i> is probably the most infamous full-motion video game, since it was brought before congress as an example of violent video games plaguing the nation&#8217;s youth. Other key titles included <i><a title=\"The 7th Guest\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Guest\">The 7th Guest</a></i>, <i><a title=\"Voyeur (video game)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeur_(video_game)\">Voyeur</a></i>, <i><a title=\"Phantasmagoria (video game)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria_(video_game)\">Phantasmagoria</a></i>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Switch_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Double Switch</em></a>, and <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SWAT series\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT_series\">Daryl F. Gates&#8217; Police Quest: SWAT</a></i>. All utilized live-action video with bad acting and allowed players to control how the story unfolded in a sort of choose-your-own-adventure movie. So you can see how this can be utilized for a horror video game.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <em>Ghosts</em>, players will control a TV producer camping out in the broadcast van for a failing cable channel while a presenter and some ghost hunters explore a haunted building. Your task is to monitor activity in and outside the building to keep you and your cohorts safe. As the title indicates, there are ghosts roaming about, with creatures designed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slimyswampghost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trevor Henderson</a> and brought to life by Jim Henson&#8217;s Creature Shop. But the major threat is an entity known as The Long Lady, and if you make eye contact with her, you&#8217;re dead.</p>\n<p>Writer/director Jed Shepherd, who wrote and directed <em>Ghosts</em>, said in a press release (via <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/ghosts-is-a-real-time-live-action-horror-game-from-the-makers-of-zoom-horror-movie-host/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GamesRadar</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Last Halloween, frustrated by the neverending lockdown situation in the UK, like a lot of people I turned to video games for escapism. Looking specifically for horror games to freak me out, I re-discovered the live-action video games (FMV) of the &#8217;90s&#8230; Games that dared to try something a bit different and really pushed the capabilities of the game systems of their time. It suddenly dawned on me what I had to do &#8211; I had to make a live-action video game starring my friends Emma, Haley, Jemma, Radina, and Caroline and make it as scary as hell. I want to make you afraid of even looking at your Nintendo Switch but feel absolutely compelled to play the game anyway to help the ladies survive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So how does the real time aspect of this game work? Well, it&#8217;s only going to be available to be played at 10:00 P.M. local time. It will not be accessible at any other time, meaning you&#8217;ll be playing with everyone else in your time zone, making for a cool shared experience. We&#8217;re not entirely sure how the live-action format works in real-time, but modern technology likely allows for full-motion video to be utilized to much greater effect nowadays, so this should be a rather interesting experiment.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, the artwork for the game has been created by <em>Evil Dead</em> and <em>Night of the Creeps</em> poster artist Graham Humphreys, and it will be revealed sometime in the near future. Fans will also be able to snag t-shirts from <a href=\"https://www.fright-rags.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fright Rags</a> featuring the video game&#8217;s art.</p>\n<p>Check out the full announcement video featuring the cast of <em>Host</em> below, and get ready for a little scare:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited to announce that I&#39;m making a REAL-TIME, live-action HORROR video game w/ creature design by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slimyswampghost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@slimyswampghost</a> &#38; made by Jim Henson&#39;s Creature Shop! </p>\n<p>Released by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LimitedRunGames</a> &#38; starring Haley, Jemma, Emma, Radina and Caroline.

Joe</em> originated as a toy series it only makes sense to give us our first glimpse of the new <em>G.I. Joe</em> movie in toy form. Perhaps not. In any case, if you&#8217;re interested in seeing tiny plastic effigies of <strong>Henry Golding</strong>, <strong>Andrew Koji</strong>, <strong>Samara Weaving</strong>, and more, please keep on reading.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666124\"></span></p>\n<p>There have been numerous times where we accidentally get our first look at an upcoming blockbuster via a leaked image of some toys. But that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s happening here – the images you&#8217;re about to see aren&#8217;t leaked; they&#8217;re official, and presented directly to Entertainment Weekly. But it&#8217;s downright strange that the folks behind the upcoming <em>Snake Eyes</em> would prefer to give us our first real glimpse of the film&#8217;s characters in tiny toy form (to be fair, we <em>did</em> get an early production image that showed <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/snake-eyes-first-look/\">Henry Golding walking up some stairs</a>, but that wasn&#8217;t exactly a great representation of the film). Why not release some official images from the production? The film has already wrapped, so I imagine it&#8217;s not very hard to scrounge up some pics. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re getting – we&#8217;re getting toys instead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snake-Eyes-Figure.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-666143 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snake-Eyes-Figure-700x700.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snake-Eyes-Figure-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snake-Eyes-Figure-360x360.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snake-Eyes-Figure-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snake-Eyes-Figure.jpeg 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>First up, here&#8217;s a toy version of Henry Golding as the titular character, Snake Eyes. &#8220;I think the heart of the story really is who Snake is and his journey as a person, really. Understanding his motivations,&#8221; Golding told <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/snake-eyes-henry-golding-samurai-film-influences/\">EW</a>. &#8220;I can&#8217;t give away too much, but it really focuses on the one person instead of having 20 people on screen and understanding background. We start from the beginning. And, hopefully, this launches an amazing franchise.&#8221; In <em>G.I. Joe</em> lore, Snake Eyes is a silent ninja – but I think it&#8217;s safe to assume the movie is going to have him speak, otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t have cast an actor of Golding&#8217;s caliber.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-11.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666145\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-11-700x700.jpeg\" alt=\"Storm Shadow figure\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-11-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-11-360x360.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-11-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-11.jpeg 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next, here&#8217;s a toy featuring a likeness of Andrew Koji as Storm Shadow, the arch-enemy of Snake Eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-1-7.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666149\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-1-7-700x700.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-1-7-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-1-7-360x360.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-1-7-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/image-1-7.jpeg 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is Scarlett, who is played in the movie by Samara Weaving, and I <em>guess</em> this kind of looks like Weaving.

You can hear the rebooted <em>Mortal Kombat</em> theme below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666058\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Mortal Kombat Reboot Theme</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7XvA9gOCxQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Released in 1994, <em>Mortal Kombat: The Album</em> featured music from the video game composed by The Immortals, a band that featured Belgian electronic musicians Maurice &#8220;Praga Khan&#8221; Engelen and Olivier Adams. The band was technically a side project created specifically for the game, but the music became a big hit, especially after the theme &#8220;Techno Syndrome (Mortal Kombat)&#8221; ended up in the 1995 <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie. Now, the theme has been recreated by Benjamin Wallfisch, who is handling the soundtrack for the new <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie. The new version, titled &#8220;Techno Syndrome 2021 (Mortal Kombat),&#8221;  is above, and for comparison&#8217;s sake, here&#8217;s the version used in the 1995 movie.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aidem5-kheE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I like a lot of Wallfisch&#8217;s work (he scored <em>IT</em>, <em>IT Chapter 2</em>, and worked on <em>Blade Runner: 2049</em> with Hans Zimmer), but I have to say: I&#8217;m not a big fan of the rebooted theme. I&#8217;m not a big techno fan in general, but I love how loud and unrelenting the original theme is, while this new version comes across as strangely lacking. Back in the &#8217;90s, the original theme made me want to run around punching and kicking the air. This new theme barely gets a head-bob out of me. It&#8217;s a touch disappointing, but maybe it&#8217;ll work better in the context of the film.</p>\n<p>WaterTower Music will release the new <em>Mortal Kombat</em> soundtrack on April 16. The notes for the album call this new version of &#8220;Techno Syndrome&#8221; &#8220;composer Benjamin Wallfisch&#8217;s musical homage to the music, fans, and enduring lineage of Mortal Kombat.&#8221; The track was produced and performed by Wallfisch and mixed and mastered by Tom Norris.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was invited to come on board <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, I was very aware of the responsibility that comes with scoring a franchise so deeply embedded in pop culture and with such a passionate fanbase,&#8221; Wallfisch said. &#8220;My first question was what can we do with <em>Techno Syndrome</em>, a piece of music so much part of the DNA of the game and the original movies? What motifs could be reinvented and blown up to a full-scale symphonic sound world in the score, and might there be room for a full reinvention of the whole song as an EDM single in 2021? A huge thank you to The Immortals for giving us their blessing to reimagine their classic track in this way, as a celebration of the world of Mortal Kombat and its fans, and of the uplifting power of Electronic Dance Music, which the original did so much to light the fuse of 30 years ago.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Director <strong>Simon McQuoid</strong> added: &#8220;Ben and I both knew that we needed to use the classic Immortals track ‘Techno Syndrome’ as source material for the entire score of ‘Mortal Kombat.’ But along with that, we knew that an updated, elevated version of the song also needed to be created, and Ben certainly delivered. I am so excited by this new 2021 version of the track; when I first heard it, it blew my mind. Actually, Ben kind of blew my mind on a daily basis through the making of this film, so we can all thank Benjamin Wallfisch for his genius and passion in creating &#8216;Techno Syndrome 2021.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The full tracklist for the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> soundtrack is below. <em>Mortal Kombat</em> hits theaters and HBO Max on <strong>April 23</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Techno Syndrome 2021 (Mortal Kombat)</li>\n<li>Hanzo Hasashi</li>\n<li>Lord Raiden</li>\n<li>Bi-Han</li>\n<li>Shang Tsung</li>\n<li>Cole Young</li>\n<li>Birthmark</li>\n<li>Sonya Blade</li>\n<li>Kano v Reptile</li>\n<li>Liu Kang</li>\n<li>The Great Protector</li>\n<li>Sub-Zero</li>\n<li>Kung Lao</li>\n<li>Origins</li>\n<li>Kabal</li>\n<li>Goro</li>\n<li>Arcana</li>\n<li>Jax Briggs</li>\n<li>The Void</li>\n<li>The Tournament</li>\n<li>Sub-Zero v Cole Young</li>\n<li>I Am Scorpion</li>\n<li>We Fight as One</li>\n<li>Get Over Here</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mortal-kombat-reboot-theme/\">Listen to the New &#8216;Mortal Kombat&#8217;
