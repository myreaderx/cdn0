For most marketers, it makes sense to experiment with GA4 while continuing with your current GA setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(According to <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new-way-unify-app-and-website-measurement-google-analytics/\">Google</a>, “If you use Google Tag Manager or the global site tag for Google Analytics today, there’s no re-tagging required for your website.”)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three major differences between the two.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-1-out-of-the-box-event-tracking\">1. Out-of-the-box event tracking&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, GA tracks only pageviews across your properties. While you can customize it to track additional interactions, doing so requires more advanced knowledge of event tracking and <a href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/google-tag-manager-beginner-guide/\">Google Tag Manager</a>.<br><br>GA4 on the other hand, comes out-of-the-box ready to collect additional data. With “Enhanced measurement,” you automatically collect data on scrolling, outbound clicks, video engagement, file downloads, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image15-3-1024x946.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced measurement. \" class=\"wp-image-57114\" width=\"768\" height=\"710\" srcset=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image15-3-1024x946.jpg 1024w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image15-3-461x426.jpg 461w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image15-3-768x709.jpg 768w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image15-3.jpg 1336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can continue to customize your event data based on your specific needs.

Downloads, link clicks, form submissions, and video plays are often measured as events. Events in Universal Analytics have a Category, Action, Label and sometimes a Value, and are displayed with these fields in your Analytics reports.<br><br>In Google Analytics 4 properties, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/app-web/events\">events</a> are user interactions with a website or app that can be measured concurrently or independently from a webpage/screen load. Examples of events include page views, button clicks, user actions, and system events.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image4-3.jpg\" alt=\"Hit types in Google Analytics 4. \" class=\"wp-image-57116\" width=\"554\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image4-3.jpg 738w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image4-3-568x373.jpg 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" /><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://www.trackify.co.nz/blog/google-analytics-4-ga4-vs-universal-analytics\">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-web-and-mobile-analytics-under-one-roof\">2. Web and mobile analytics under one roof&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major difference between GA4 and its predecessor is the focus on combining both your mobile and web data—you can view, track, and manage all in one platform.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_JYcRJmp3hhPFLvYIG4qyAI4FRfs8MuqjTfP4OZv-UKwA5cGDuR3uhChckPp6BzilLE0PydqLXrJB-BbbiRx5GTItYXzhPN_6F39VssWhunKBMs9dtUI0S1unRxA4QA8s9ZKAU4t\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>HIstorically, tracking mobile and app data relied on integrations between Firebase and GA, and it was often difficult to understand how your web and app data fit together. GA4, built on the back of Firebase, allows for seamless app and web tracking.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you are an analyst who manages both website and mobile applications, you will finally have the ability to roll up your data across web and mobile.&#160; This is far more powerful than the rollup properties you may have used in the past because the data under the hood for each platform will use the same schema.  </p><cite><a href=\"http://Senior Data Engineer @ Search Discovery\">Ken Williams</a> Senior Data Engineer @ Search Discovery</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-4-1024x494.jpg\" alt=\"Differences between GA4 and GA.\" class=\"wp-image-57118\" width=\"768\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-4-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-4-568x274.jpg 568w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-4-768x370.jpg 768w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-4-1536x741.jpg 1536w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-4.jpg 1696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/google-analytics-4-update/\">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re already using Firebase, historical data will be carried over; however, because GA4 operates on a different data model, a new GA4 setup won’t pull in historical data from a Universal Analytics setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, you may want to add the global tag in GA4 and begin collecting as much data as possible now, even if you don’t plan to switch to GA4 for analysis and reporting for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">They are completely different data models, so &#39;merging&#39; data between the two will not likely be possible.

Enhanced measurement of time-based actions&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With GA4, you’re able to temporarily and permanently exclude users based on certain behaviors and conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/ppc-retargeting-case-studies/\">retargeting</a>, notes Charles Farina, Head of Innovation at <a href=\"https://adswerve.com/\">Adswerve</a>, this can be incredibly helpful:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When someone purchases we want to stop showing ads to users… but do you want to stop showing ads temporarily or permanently?

If you want to answer questions on how long it takes your users to watch a video, or complete a survey, time is extremely challenging to use in GA,” says Farina.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the “elapsed time” feature, GA4 can show you how long, on average, it takes your users to complete a defined set of steps. For example, you may want to see how long it takes a user to complete a survey, or how long they read your blog before moving to your product page.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image10-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image10-2-1024x459.jpg\" alt=\"Funnel analysis. \" class=\"wp-image-57122\" width=\"768\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image10-2-1024x459.jpg 1024w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image10-2-568x255.jpg 568w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image10-2-768x345.jpg 768w, https://cxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image10-2.jpg 1266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></a><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://app.livestorm.co/conversionxl/google-analytics-4-properties/live?s=d48afffe-a20d-430a-9c02-9163feb018dd#/chat\">Image source</a>)&#160;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-else-is-new-in-google-analytics-4\">What else is new in Google Analytics 4?&#160;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While GA4 and GA have many similarities, there are a few unique updates, including a new debugging mode, UI changes, funnel builder, and simplified export to BigQuery.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-an-improved-debugging-experience\">An improved debugging experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Debugging in the current version of Google Analytics has long been a challenge.

Google also ensured the export works with the BigQuery sandbox, allowing you to get started for free.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Khrystyna Grynko previously wrote for <a href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/bigquery/\">CXL</a>, “When you work with Google Analytics or other digital analytics tools, you usually have control only over data collection and analysis. With a tool like BigQuery, you have more control over every stage of the analytics infrastructure.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-so-should-you-switch-over-completely-to-ga4-right-now\">So should you switch over completely to GA4&#8230;right now?&#160;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GA4 is still very much in its infancy.

Many of the default reports that marketers have come to rely on have been removed or replaced. Popular dimensions and metrics such as “medium” and “bounces” no longer exist.&#160;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For GA360 users, <a href=\"https://cxl.com/agency/\">CXL Agency</a> CTO, Silver Ringvee, had this to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you are an enterprise marketer, working with Google Analytics 360, then you should keep in mind that there is still very little information on the 360 version of GA4.<br><br>Google has confirmed there will be SLAs (long-awaited feature by many) and advanced integrations with tools like <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new_google_analytics/\">BigQuery</a>, but we&#8217;ll have to wait to see what the exact features and limits/quotas will be to differentiate it from the free version.<br><br>I would still recommend giving GA4 a try on a portion of your sites or in staging environment, but it&#8217;s important to know the limitations—some of the critical features currently in development include things like data governance components for managing user permissions and data deletion tools.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as recommended earlier, start collecting data <em>now. </em>But you don’t have to make an immediate jump in analysis and reporting just yet.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So you can build up a historical data set and get used to how the data looks and feels before a hard switch is necessary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ppcchat?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ppcchat</a></p>&#8212; Krista Seiden (@kristaseiden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kristaseiden/status/1328752581024174080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion&#160;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GA4 is, at the very least, months away from becoming the default Google Analytics platform. But it will get there eventually. Now is the time to begin learning more about GA4—and collecting the data you’ll need to make year-over-year comparisons in the future.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automatic event tracking will make it easier to capture more aspects of user behavior, and the shift of two GA360 features—customizable funnels and BigQuery exports—to the free version of Analytics should excite analysts who have long envied those with the budget for the paid version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s never too early to start learning (or collecting historical data). GA4 won’t be an exception.&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"ttr_end\"></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/ga4/\">GA4 Is Here: Here’s What You Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a
