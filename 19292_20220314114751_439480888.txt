Outreach programmes are also a great way to tell people about what you do, especially young people, but this usually only involves speaking with tens, or maybe hundreds of people at a time.</p>\n<p>This week I have had the rare opportunity to talk to millions of people from all over the world, because I was asked to contribute to the show <em>‘Science in Action’ </em>for the BBC World Service as well as <em>‘Inside Science’</em> for BBC Radio 4.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Before the broadcast</u></strong></p>\n<p><em>I wrote this first section a few days after the recording, but a few days before the programme goes out.</em></p>\n<p>I think this story is a great example of the power of social media in modern science. It all started a week or so ago when I made a GIF of the captivating <a href=\"https://milleronmaterials.wordpress.com/2017/10/11/pharaohs-serpents/\">Pharaoh’s serpents reaction</a> to publicise a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.201700268/abstract\">paper</a> colleagues and I had published. As well as putting the GIF on the departmental website and including it in a <a href=\"https://milleronmaterials.wordpress.com/2017/10/11/pharaohs-serpents/\">blog post</a>, it also went up on Twitter via my colleague and Twitter mega-fan Prof. Andrea Sella (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SellaTheChemist\">@Sellathechemist</a>). Among enthusiastic replies such as, “OMG my favourite reaction” was the a message that read, “Burning mercury thiocyanate. Sounds like my kind of fun. Wld love to see” from someone with the Twitter handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeaseRoland\">@PeaseRoland</a>.  This turned out to be from the science writer and broadcaster Roland Pease (who’d have guessed!), who among other things is the presenter of ‘Science in Action’, a weekly science show on the BBC World Service.</p>\n<p>A few days later, after some toing and froing, Roland was in our labs ready to talk carbon nitride. Andrea has known Roland for some time and is no stranger himself to appearing in the media, but the process of recording was entirely new to me. We made a plan to talk about the Pharaoh’s serpents reaction and the history, characters and science behind it, before linking to our recent creation of <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b01353\">2D carbon nitride nanosheets</a>; I was still wondering how we’d make a visual demonstration accessible to the listeners. Nonetheless after a cup of tea and a quick chat, Roland assembled his recorder (which looked a bit like an old car stereo), pressed the go button and we got started.</p>\n<p>A big surprise was that the recording was much more spontaneous than I’d have expected. My assumption was that the interviews you hear are largely staged, recorded several times in a stop-and-start fashion, and based on prepared or polished answers. The truth is quite different. Roland began recording immediately and kept his equipment going until we were done. His style was to just keep the conversation going, gently moving it towards the topics he wanted to cover and encouraging you with facial expressions and nods when you were giving him what he wanted. This appears to be how you get interviewees to sound like real people and not like robots.</p>\n<p>My impression of my ‘performance’ was that I was a bit too technical, talked too fast and probably rambled on too much. It’s really interesting to see a pro like Andrea at work on the microphone. Apart from technical things, like pausing and going back a couple of words when a door slams in the middle of a soundbite, the ability to take complicated and technical science and make it understandable to a general audience is a real skill. I had a few lines I was pleased with, including one analogy involving chicken wire and a tractor, but as the ~45 minutes of recording will need to be edited to a ~ 6 minute section, it’ll likely end up on the cutting room floor.</p>\n<p>I have been on the radio (Radio Leicester) once before, talking about a Christmas tree decorating competition held in my village when I was about 13 years old, but this time feels a little more noteworthy. Let’s see how I do…fingers crossed.</p>\n<p>You can listen to the whole episode of Inside Science <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09bxkf2\">here</a>, and Science in Action <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvrgq\">here.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"47\" data-permalink=\"https://milleronmaterials.wordpress.com/2017/10/11/pharaohs-serpents/ps-compressed/\" data-orig-file=\"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ps-compressed.gif\" data-orig-size=\"544,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"PS compressed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ps-compressed.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ps-compressed.gif?w=544\" class=\"  wp-image-47 aligncenter\" src=\"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ps-compressed.gif?w=494&#038;h=490\" alt=\"PS compressed\" width=\"494\" height=\"490\" /></p>\n<p><strong><u>After the broadcast</u></strong></p>\n<p><em>I wrote this section after I’ve listened to the show.</em></p>\n<p>Roland didn’t make me say poo on the radio! Possibly not the introduction you were expecting, but one story about the Pharaoh’s serpents reaction is that it was once used as a dinner table attraction; the precursor pellets were often put in a little ceramic statue of a person bent over with their trousers round their ankles and the snakes would emerge humorously&#8230; During the recording I told this story, but got stuck looking for a BBC appropriate word and ended up meekly bleating …poo.</p>\n<p>I thought the piece was great. It’s amazing how much you can squeeze into such a short time. We scientists should remember this when we’re next writing papers and doing presentations. It was also really interesting to hear how with a bit of editing magic they were able to nip, tuck and rearrange the conversation to fit their narrative. The snake charmer music was a particularly inspired choice</p>\n<p>Thanks to Roland and his team for helping us tell this story. Now back to the lab to find the next one.</p>\n<p>TSM</p>\n<p>P.S. Just after our section started I got a text from my dad asking if it was me on the radio. I’d intended to listen first before telling him to catch up on iPlayer. Best laid plans…</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 19:59:08 +0000","feedId":19292,"bgimg":"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/radio1.jpg","linkMd5":"c66f690748db1b8ee6512e832ab8818f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn21@2020_2/2022/03/14/11-45-50-858_720f2e6f8e0474f6.webp","destWidth":960,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":168247,"destBytes":58620,"author":"milleronmaterials","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ps-compressed.gif?w=494&h=490":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647258349806}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 19:45:49","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 19:45:49","feedId":19292,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 11:45:49 +0000","fetchMs":123,"handleMs":6,"totalMs":121649,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":8,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-033*","requestId":"9f3382e163634faaa7db84c6b7085033_19292","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx7":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:54:20","id":19292,"name":"Miller on Materials","url":"https://milleronmaterials.wordpress.com/feed/","subscriber":172,"website":null,"icon":"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cropped-picture32.jpg?w=32","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn28@2020_3/2020/09/06/18-54-17-511_e6101bc88ead8c12.webp","description":"Materials, Electrochemistry and Energy Research by EPSRC Fellow Dr Tom Miller","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 19:47:51","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 19:47:51","id":null,"feedId":19292,"linkMd5":"c66f690748db1b8ee6512e832ab8818f"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1647258349676,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":124,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":6,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":1370,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":121517,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe69.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-034.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://milleronmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/radio1.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":960,"destHeight":640,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn21@2020_2/2022/03/14/11-45-50-858_720f2e6f8e0474f6.webp","sourceBytes":168247,"destBytes":58620,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":19292,"totalSpendMs":1359,"convertSpendMs":96,"createdTime":"2022-03-14 19:45:49","host":"us-035*","referer":"http://milleronmaterials.wordpress.com/?p=88","linkMd5ListStr":"c66f690748db1b8ee6512e832ab8818f","githubUser":"myreaderx7","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"164.3 KB","destSize":"57.2 KB","compressRate":"34.8%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx7":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
