So when I discovered that you can now rent by the hour massive instances within Google Compute Cloud that support 224 virtual cores based on AMD EPYC 2 Rome processors, I had to jump at the opportunity to see what kind low hanging fruit might be out there. Low and behold I found it! The record for MySQL on a single server stands at <a href=\"http://dimitrik.free.fr/blog/posts/mysql-performance-21m-qps-on-80rc.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2.1M QPS without using Unix sockets</a>, and <a href=\"http://dimitrik.free.fr/blog/posts/mysql-performance-80-ga-ip-port-vs-unix-socket-impact.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2.25M QPS with Unix sockets</a>. Seeing that was published 3 years ago on Broadwell based CPUs, I suspected this record was ripe for the taking on one of these instances, especially if we put Dynimize to work. The following post describes the journey to 3.6 million queries per second with MySQL 8.0 using one of these servers.</p>\n<p>The MySQL Server Team has done a fantastic job at getting newer versions of MySQL to scale to more and more cores, and the MySQL 8.0 release was no exception. At 96 physical cores, they've shown the world how MySQL 8.0 easily scales to take advantage of the parallelism you can now get a hold of on the most powerful x86-64 based servers. However, I've been dying to know what kind of record QPS is possible if we put <a href=\"https://dynimize.com/product\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CPU performance virtualization</a> to use through Dynimize, which can significantly <a href=\"https://dynimize.com/blog/tutorials/reducing-cpu-stalls-with-dynimize/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increase the instructions per cycle (IPC)</a> or programs like MySQL.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 20:40:46 +0000","feedId":34612,"bgimg":"https://dzone.com/thumbnail?fid=13964916&w=600","linkMd5":"9fa5bf6821fd27f9cfeb82a7d29f6df4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn85@2020_5/2020/10/13/14-23-49-786_fc299f4ebe734f0b.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":375,"sourceBytes":41128,"destBytes":10146,"author":"David Yeager","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602599004900}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 22:23:24","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 22:23:24","feedId":34612,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:23:24 +0000","fetchMs":294,"handleMs":19,"totalMs":26085,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"2d9ee6966ced9af6b2eb83b140aeb899","hostName":"us-039*","requestId":"50b4b4a50bbc429b9202b25f10b018e1_34612","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx2":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:02:06","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:14:05","id":34612,"name":"DZone Performance Zone","url":"http://feeds.dzone.com/performance","subscriber":93,"website":null,"icon":"https://dzone.com/themes/dz20/images/favicon.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn79@2020_5/2020/09/06/21-14-03-845_b540a11648b59e3a.png","description":"Recent posts in Performance on DZone.com","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602599004586,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":295,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":19,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":1,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":25746,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://dzone.com/thumbnail?fid=13964916&w=600","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":600,"destHeight":375,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn85@2020_5/2020/10/13/14-23-49-786_fc299f4ebe734f0b.webp","sourceBytes":41128,"destBytes":10146,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":34612,"totalSpendMs":25705,"convertSpendMs":21,"createdTime":"2020-10-13 22:23:24","host":"us-52*","referer":"https://dzone.com/articles/3029638","linkMd5ListStr":"9fa5bf6821fd27f9cfeb82a7d29f6df4","githubUser":"myreaderx2","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"destSize":"9.9 KB","compressRate":"24.7%","sourceSize":"40.2 KB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx2":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
