Larry Kudlow, a top Trump economic advisor, told reporters on Friday the new plan would contain another round of direct payments, federal unemployment benefits, small business aid, and an airline rescue without elaborating further.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ends-stimulus-negotiations-until-after-presidential-election-economic-recovery-2020-10\">abruptly ended the talks</a> with a series of tweets on Tuesday, three days after he urged Congress to pass a stimulus bill. It set off several days of headspinning developments with the White House cutting off talks, only to restart them shortly after and aggressively push for a new federal rescue pacakge.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-stimulus-plan-congress-unemployment-economy-pass-vote-bill-2020-9\">The Democratic economic aid bill</a> includes another round of $1,200 stimulus checks to taxpayers and a revival of the $600 in weekly federal unemployment benefits through the end of January. It also provides aid to cash-strapped state and local governments, as well as small businesses.</p><p>But Trump's demands for a larger package collide with the economic inclinations of many Republicans. Many GOP senators opposed a $1 trillion spending plan earlier this summer, citing their concern over the swelling deficit. It's not clear how much support a deal struck between Pelosi and Mnuchin would draw from Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p><p>\"I've got a significant percentage of my members who think we've done enough and who are alarmed by the amount of national debt,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said at a campaign event in Kentucky Thursday. He threw cold water on Friday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-stimulus-package-unlikely-three-weeks-trump-economy-odds-2020-10\">regarding the prospect of a stimulus package</a> before the election.</p><p>Many experts are urging lawmakers to approve more federal spending as the economy shows signs of slowing down. The US still hasn't recovered half the jobs it lost in March and April, and permanent layoffs are rising. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bigger-stimulus-package-republicans-democrats-congress-amount-more-checks-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/uk4mn3szuAc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 18:47:18 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f35bd91e89ebf001f04479c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"3c3ca00193c82c926e0b3dc6942dd891","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-12-46-049_cc2cb8109573486d.webp","destWidth":1843,"destHeight":1382,"sourceBytes":111532,"destBytes":111532,"author":"jzeballos@businessinsider.com (Joseph Zeballos-Roig)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f35bd6fb4bb1c001df53365?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn69@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-54-362_50a73fd45e5529c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-53-792_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-47-112_4d591c8715ecfd93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn81@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-51-121_fe35bac82ae4dceb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-50-625_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=uk4mn3szuAc:rB-8xe-wwgI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_2/2020/10/09/19-12-55-853_ffa9f2ce7b50c40f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/uk4mn3szuAc":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270691431},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:31","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:31","title":"Lauren Boebert and Diane Mitsch Bush battle to represent Colorado's 3rd Congressional District in November","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/colorado-3rd-district-house-election-diane-mitsch-bush-lauren-boebert-2020","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5fbbe3323fc4001e0d616a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Diane Mitsch Bush\" height=\"1532\" width=\"3064\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Former Routt County Commissioner Diane Mitsch Bush asks a question of keynote speaker U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood during the Q&#38;A portion of the &#34;Putting Colorado to Work&#34; jobs forum at the University of Denver.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Joe Amon/The Denver Post/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Republican Lauren Boebert will face Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush to represent Colorado's 3rd Congressional District.</li>\n<li>The district is located in western Colorado and fully covers the state's western border and parts of the borders with Wyoming and New Mexico.</li>\n<li>Boebert defeated sitting-Rep.

Tipton in the Republican primary by about 10 percentage points despite a cash disadvantage. In June 2020, she came under scrutiny for her apparent embrace of the QAnon conspiracy theory which has quickly spread across the United States.</p><p>\"Everything that I've heard of Q, I hope that this is real because it only means that America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values,\" she said <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2020/07/01/lauren-boebert-qanon-gop-colorado/\">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p><p>While she expressed interest in mid-2020, Boebert is currently attempting to distance herself from the conspiracy theory as her campaign gained interest and came under the spotlight.&#160;</p><p>\"We are attempting to put this stupid [QAnon] thing to bed, but it's all some of [Boebert's opponents] have because they are looking for how are they are going to say that she is so popular out there with ordinary people, how are they going to go against her, and they're choosing stuff like this,\" her spokeswoman Laura Carno said in an interview with the <a href=\"https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2020/08/boebert-trying-to-back-away-from-qanon/29048/\">Colorado Times Recorder</a>.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl0f9uFE5lU&feature=youtu.beu.be\">her campaign ads</a>, Boebert emphasizes wanting to serve in Congress to fight against socialism, protect Americans' 2nd Amendment rights, and create jobs in Colorado.&#160;</p><p>Bush is a former tenured professor and Routt County Commissioner. From 2013 to 2017, Bush served in the Colorado House of Representatives for the state's 26th district.</p><p>She defeated seafood executive James Iacino in the 2020 Democratic primary election for the district to move onto the November ballot. Her <a href=\"https://dianeforcolorado.com/on-the-issues/\">campaign is centered on</a> protecting Colorado's environment and access to clean water, lowering prescription drug costs, passing DACA into federal law with congressional action, and ensure reproductive freedoms.</p><p>Bush previously ran against Rep. Tipton in the general election in 2018 where she lost by a margin of <a href=\"https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/91808/Web02-state.222648/#/\">7.9 percentage points</a>.</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Colorado's <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CO/3\">3rd Congressional District</a> is located on the western side of the state, fully covering the western border and parts of the state's borders with Wyoming and New Mexico. It includes the cities of Grand Junction, Steamboat Springs, Pueblo, and Durango, as well as the upscale ski resort towns of Aspen and Telluride.&#160;</p><p>For the 2016 presidential election, the district voted for President Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in a 52-40 percentage point split of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts\">according to the Daily Kos</a>.</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=CO03&spec=Np;spec=N\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Bush has raised $1.1 million for her campaign, spent $900,000, and currently has $201,000 in cash on hand remaining. Boebert has raised only $151,000 and has spent about $142,000. She has just over $10,000 to spend on her campaign as the November election approaches.</p><h2>What experts say</h2><p>The race between Bush and Boebert is rated as \"leans Republican\" by <a

According to <a href=\"https://www.keinteriorsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donna McMahon</a>, there are three main types:</p><ul><li><strong>Natural fabric:</strong> These are your cotton, linen, canvas, hemp, and bamboo blends. A good quality cotton curtain is a top choice for most people, according to McMahon. Simply toss it in the wash on laundry day to keep it in good shape (other fabrics may have specific care instructions, though). The drawback is that they can be expensive &#8212; up to $60 and sometimes more &#8212; and cannot be used without a liner. All-natural cloth curtains need a protective liner to stay dry and mildew-free.</li><li><strong>Polyester and polyblend:</strong> If you're on a budget, curtains made out of polyester are another long-lasting and low-maintenance choice. They're machine washable, quick-drying, and water-repellant, which means they don't need a liner though they can double as one.</li><li><strong>Plastic:</strong> Plastic curtains shouldn't go in the wash and instead must be regularly wiped and scrubbed clean. They're the cheapest option (most are under $20) and tend to be replaced frequently. They're the most waterproof material of the bunch, so they're usually used as liners but can work as standalone curtains too. Be sure to steer away from PVC (polyvinyl chloride), cautions McMahon, which contains a mix of chlorine, phthalates, and other chemicals that give vinyl plastic curtains that pungent headache-inducing smell. Plastic curtains made with PE (polyethylene), PEVA (polyethylene vinyl acetate), and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) are safer alternatives, but when in doubt, \"search for 'PVC free' in product descriptions,\" says McMahon.&#160;</li></ul><p>The rest is a matter of your personal taste. Natural fabric curtains drape beautifully and have a more elevated look, and polyester curtains can have a similar soft, woven-fabric feel.</p><p>In terms of colors, patterns, and prints, go with what makes you happy. If you really don't know where to start, McMahon said, \"Pick a curtain design that has a touch of the prominent color in your bathroom tile or other finishes to tie it all together. And if the tones of your bathroom are soft and subtle, a curtain that's bolder in color can be the perfect contrast too.\"</p><p>Keeping it simple with white though will never go out of style &#8212; just think of every hotel bathroom you've ever seen.&#160;&#160;</p><h2>How to measure shower curtains&#160;</h2><p>The standard size that fits most built-in tubs is 72 x 72 inches, but before you add your brand new curtain to your cart, break out the tape measure to make sure you're getting the proper size.&#160;</p><ul><li><strong>Width:</strong> Measure along the entire length of the curtain rod and add 12 inches so the curtain can drape and extend nicely. For reference, the standard bathtub is about 60-inches long. Shower stalls will be narrower and clawfoot tubs will be longer because the curtain needs to fit around a full circular rod, says McMahon. For this, look for 180 x 70, or you can use two 72 x 72-inch curtains.&#160;</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> The curtain height will also vary depending on what kind of shower you have, but generally the bottom hem should float at least one to two inches above the floor. \"This allows air to circulate and prevent mold and mildew growth,\" says McMahon. Measure from below the rod &#8212; or end of the shower curtain hooks &#8212; to the floor, then subtract at least two inches.&#160;</li></ul>\n\tCheck out other bathroom-related guides\n\t\n\t<ul

The company said it will start testing this feature for some Twitter users on Friday.</p><p>Twitter will also start preventing tweets that were liked by people you don't follow from showing up on your timeline on the site. \"This will likely slow down how quickly Tweets from accounts and topics you don't follow can reach you, which we believe is a worthwhile sacrifice to encourage more thoughtful and explicit amplification,\" the company said in the blog post.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/updating-our-approach-to-misleading-information.html\">In May</a>, Twitter said it would add warning labels to tweets that contain potentially harmful misleading information.

Twitter has already rolled out a series of moves to crack down on false information on its site. The platform announced it was banning political ads on its site <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-political-ads-ban-new-details-2019-11\">in late 2019</a>, and has added election labels to the accounts of political candidates, among <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-changes.html\">other changes.</a></p><p>Other tech companies like Facebook are also making changes to prevent the spread of misleading information. Facebook, for example, said it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-says-it-will-ban-all-political-ads-after-election-2020-10\">would stop accepting political ads</a> starting the day after the election.

Following his career playing and coaching baseball, Williams was a fundraiser for then-Gov. George W. Bush.</p><p>He worked as the North Texas chairman for Bush's presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004, later becoming the campaign's national grassroots fundraising chairman in 2004. Additionally, Williams was appointed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2004 to become <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article244385977.html\">Texas' secretary of state</a>, a position he served in until 2007.&#160;</p><p>Wiliams, elected in 2012, is the first Republican to represent the 25th District since its creation in 1983. In Congress, he serves on the House Committee on Financial Services.&#160;</p><p>Oliver, Williams' challenger, spent much of her career in the healthcare industry working on healthcare finance and taxation, including recently on <a href=\"https://www.julieoliver.org/about\">Austin City Council's board of Central Health</a>. Her <a href=\"https://www.julieoliver.org/issues\">campaign platform</a> is centered around implementing a Medicare for All universal healthcare systen, criminal justice reform, including abolishing for-profit prisons, and expanding voting rights.</p><p>Williams and Oliver originally squared off to represent the 25th District in 2018, where Williams defeated Oliver challenger by <a href=\"https://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist331_state.htm\">8.7 percentage points</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsW0PTv_M3_y-7F58NM7povZiq8ilhf9/view\">An internal poll</a> conducted for Oliver's campaign from September 2-5 showed Williams leading her by two points, 43% to 41%. An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1301917394710007812\">internal poll conducted for Williams' campaign</a> by Remington Research Group from Septmber 1-2 showed the congressman leading by a much larger margin of 12 points, 52% to 40%.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Texas' 25th Congressional District is located in the center of the state, encompassing a stretch of Texas' Hill Country between Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth area.&#160;</p><p>The district contains part of the city of Austin itself, including the University of Texas' flagship Austin campus, and the counties of Bosque, Burnet, Coryell, Hamilton, Hill, Johnson, Lampasas, and Somervell as well as portions of Bell, Erath, Hays, Tarrant, and Travis counties.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\"></sup></p><p>In the 2016 presidential election, the 25th District voted for President Donald Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 15 points in a 55-40 percentage point split of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/07/09/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts\">according to Daily Kos</a>.&#160;</p><p>In <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W_GTNylAZfboZkDeMsJPGlir3aQB64SzlVHjY9Xdnkk/edit#gid=562073942\">Texas' 2018 US Senate election</a>, the district backed GOP Sen.

for \"The Boys\" season two finale.</strong></em></p><p>Amazon Prime Video's \"The Boys\" is a massive hit.</p><p>With its second season, which concluded on Friday, the mature superhero series became Amazon's biggest launch for an original series yet and has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nielsen-viewership-data-amazons-the-boys-a-major-hit-2020-10\">cracked Nielsen's weekly lists of most-watched streaming titles</a>, the only non-Netflix series to do so.</p><p>This season, episodes were released on a weekly basis, as opposed to the first season when they dropped all at once like Netflix's binge model. Did the new release schedule help spread the word?</p><p>\"Five weeks later, we're still at the forefront of pop culture, which was always the goal,\" showrunner Eric Kripke told Business Insider during a recent interview. \"I do think it turned out to be a good thing in terms of how much longer people are talking about the show.\"</p><p>But Kripke said that the format isn't set in stone for season three, which was greenlit in July, two months before the second season's debut on September 4. A spinoff series about a college for superheroes is also in the works.&#160;</p><p>Kripke also talked to Business Insider about how working on a streaming series differs from a network series like The CW's \"Supernatural,\" which he created; the fate of the Nazi \"superhero\" Stormfront, played by Aya Cash; and why Fresca became a running joke in season two.</p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5a50f27ed0ee001e25e88c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the boys 201 homelander\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Antony Starr as Homelander.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jasper Savage/Amazon Studios</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p><strong>The show seems to be a massive hit, even moreso than last year. Why do you think the show has gained such a larger audience with season two?</strong></p><p>What we've noticed is that a lot of people have been finding season one as so many other people talk about season two. They see so many comments on social media about how crazy the show is which makes others want to catch up. We see a lot of people say they slept on the show for so long but they're watching it now and loving it.</p><p>I'm really grateful. This is the project I've worked on that I'm having the most fun on and think I might love the most. It's the one that most closely represents my sensibilities, so to see it get the reaction that it's getting is really gratifying.&#160;</p><p><strong>What about it makes you love it more than even \"Supernatural\"? I'm sure \"Supernatural\" fans will be upset about that.</strong></p><p><em>[laughs]</em> I love all my children, but I don't have the network restrictions on this that I have on \"Supernatural.\" Anyone who has spent time in the writers room with me can tell you I have a pretty filthy sense of humor and I really enjoy dark comedy and satire. I think it's important to also have a lot of emotion and heart, which \"Supernatural\" does have.</p><p>But those three things really represent what I love: real heart and emotion, satire and dark comedy, and filthiness. I'm allowed to put all of those things in \"The Boys\" in a way I wasn't allowed to with \"Supernatural.\"</p><p><strong>With \"Supernatural,\" you're working in this network framework of 20 episodes. With \"The Boys,\" do you ever find that you're too confined with fewer episodes?</strong></p><p>Dude, it's so much better. When you have eight episodes, you can tell a tighter story. \"Supernatural\" works as a network show because it's ultimately a procedural. In it's own weird way it's a cop show. On \"The Boys,\" you can have every episode move the football forward. It's harder to wrap your head around a 20-episode story.&#160;</p><p>I actually don't work any less on \"The Boys\" than I did on \"Supernatural.\" It's not like it's a vacation. I spend all that extra time on the scripts and making sure the emotions are right versus \"Supernatural,\" which was, lovingly, endless triage. Always racing to write things and throwing it out the door to shoot it. If people knew how chaotic it was to make that show they would be horrified. <em>[laughs]</em></p><p><em><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f68e8bb323fc4001e0d786b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the boys 204 hq stormfront\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Aya Cash as Stormfront.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jasper Savage/Amazon Studios</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></em></p><p><strong>When season two first premiered, some fans were upset they couldn't binge the whole series all at once. Now that the whole season is out, are you still glad the episodes were released on a weekly basis? Do you think that helped in driving word of mouth?</strong></p><p>I am glad, but I get why people would be disappointed. We're going to look at the [viewership] data and we'll look at whether it was a good idea or not. That will determine what we do next season.</p><p>Five weeks later, we're still at the forefront of pop culture, which was always the goal. I do think it turned out to be a good thing in terms of how much longer people are talking about the show. I know this may sound selfish, but I spent two years of my life creating this thing and the thought that it would premiere on a weekend and get watched in a week makes me sad. This was a much more gratifying experience for me that people would be able to obsess over all the details we worked so hard on.</p><p><strong>But that format isn't locked in yet for next season?</strong></p><p>No, not yet.&#160;</p><p><strong>How would you define The Church of the Collective and how will it play a factor in season three? And can you describe the obsession with Fresca?</strong></p><p><em>[laughs]&nbsp;</em>I don't want to give too much away but Deep will have a very different relationship with the Church but it will still be a part of the story.</p><p>As far as Fresca, the thing with the show is that it's sometimes really random. We enjoy that. At the beginning of the season, we were talking about what drink the Church would be into. It wouldn't be beer. Then someone said Fresca and we just started laughing. It seems like the proper drink for cult members for no good reason and then we just kept running and running and running with that joke. That will be Fresca's new marketing slogan, they're really excited about that. [<em>laughs]</em></p><p><strong>In the finale, Homelander says that Stormfront is being held in some facility. Is that a lie to cover up that she's dead? Is there a chance we could see more Stormfront?</strong></p><p>She is not dead but no comment about whether we see her again or not. But she's not dead and she's now Stumpfront. It felt like the best punishment for our stumpy little Nazi was not death but for her to end up mutilated for potentially centuries since she ages so slowly. That felt like the best punishment for that character.

But the stock market <em>has</em> borrowed one bit of lingo from casinos and card games: blue-chip stocks.</p><p>Just as blue chips in poker hold the highest value, so do blue-chip stocks in the stock market. They represent the crème de la crème of equities — the biggest, richest companies. Many of them are household names.&#160;</p><p>Blue-chip stocks provide a way to invest in stable, good-performing corporations with minimal risk. Plus, they usually pay good dividends.</p><h2>What are blue-chip stocks?&#160;</h2><p>Blue-chip stocks occupy the most venerated strata of the stock market. As leaders in their industries, these companies have strong histories — some are over 100 years old — and deliver consistently strong performance. Whether the market overall is up or down, blue chips prove themselves as steady and reliable investments. As a result, their share prices tend to be high.</p><p>The blue-chip term came into financial parlance in the early 1920s. According to Wall Street lore, it was coined by a journalist for Dow Jones, Oliver Gingold, as he watched a stock tape ticker reporting trades of shares valued at $200 or more. He promptly dubbed these companies \"blue-chip stocks.\"</p><h2>What makes a stock a blue chip?&#160;</h2><p>No official guidelines exist around the size and value of blue-chip companies. But they do share some characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Large market capitalization</strong>: Blue chips tend to be huge, well-financed corporations. Their market capitalization — that is, the total market value of all their outstanding shares — is in the high billions, putting them in the category of large-capitalization (or large-cap) stocks. The cheapest of these large caps enjoy a value of at least $5 billion; most are north of $10 billion.</li><li><strong>Growth history</strong>: Blue-chip companies display years, sometimes decades, of sustained growth and ongoing prospects. Their share prices rarely jump dramatically, but they can show steady appreciation over time.&#160;</li><li><strong>Stock index</strong>: Blue chips occupy positions in the major market indexes: the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the S&#38;P 500, the Nasdaq 100. A company is often seen to have \"made it,\" blue-chip status-wise, if on one of these lists, which act as bellwethers for the stock market itself.</li><li><strong>Dividends</strong>: While not always a feature, many blue chips pay shareholders a good, steady dividend. As mature companies, blue chips focus less on growth than start-ups and other businesses that need to continually seed development. For blue-chips, the freed up cash flow allows companies to share profits with stock owners through dividend payments. As profit margins grow, the dividends often increase as well.&#160;</li></ul><h2>Blue-chip stock list&#160;</h2><p>Blue-chip stocks include notable names familiar to almost everyone, a trait attributable either to their long histories or to their positions as industry leaders (or both). Some of them include:&#160;</p><ul><li>Alphabet (GOOGL)</li><li>Amazon (AMZN)</li><li>American Express (AXP)</li><li>Apple (AAPL)</li><li>Bank of America (BAC)</li><li>Coca-Cola (KO)</li><li>Costco (COST)</li><li>Home Depot (HD)</li><li>IBM (IBM)</li><li>Johnson &#38; Johnson (JNJ)</li><li>McDonald's (MCD)</li><li>Microsoft (MSFT)</li><li>Starbucks (SBUX)</li><li>Visa (V)</li><li>Walmart (WMT)</li></ul><h2>Benefits of blue-chip stocks&#160;</h2><p>Investors find a number of benefits in buying shares of blue-chip companies. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Low volatility</strong>: As big corporations, blue-chip companies benefit from economies of scale and also enjoy revenue streams from multiple products and services. While not immune from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">economic downturns</a>, well-established blue chips are not easily shaken, even in times of market volatility.</li><li><strong>Dependability and transparency</strong>: With their long histories and status as industry leaders, blue chips operate with seasoned management teams. The companies' fame and high profiles tend to keep their operations transparent.</li><li><strong>Rich income</strong>: Steady earnings without a need to invest heavily in growth means blue chips can provide steady, strong dividend payments. Next to US Treasuries, blue-chip dividends are the most reliable go-to for income-oriented investors.</li></ul><h2>Drawbacks of blue-chip stocks</h2><p>On the flip side, the blue-chip features that work as benefits for some investors act as deterrents for others.</p><ul><li><strong>Low growth</strong>: Unless you invested in one decades ago, you won't make a killing in blue-chip stocks. These are mature companies, for the most part — their big-growth days are behind them. They appreciate steadily, but not dramatically. That's the trade-off for their low risk.&#160;</li><li><strong>Expensive: </strong>No bargains here — blue-chip stocks have been discovered. Because blue chips play in the large-market cap sandbox, the price to buy in on a single share often runs a couple hundred dollars or more. For many younger investors, the share cost far exceeds the level needed to acquire a stock position of any significant size.&#160;</li><li><strong>Strong but not invulnerable: </strong>Sometimes a sterling reputation can hide the fact that a blue chip is resting on its laurels and failing to innovate. Monolithic corporations can be slow to respond to changing times, consumer demands, and industry trends. Though it happens rarely, blue chips can and do go bankrupt: General Motors and Lehman Brothers are two recent examples.&#160;&#160;</li></ul><h2>What is the blue-chip index?</h2><p>Investors seeking exposure to those companies considered most valuable often turn to indexes as a way to slice a piece of the blue-chip pie. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/etf-vs-mutual-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exchange-traded funds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-index-funds-explained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">index (mutual) funds</a> focus provide an entry point into blue-chip investing without the cost-prohibitive price.</p><p>These funds basically track \"blue-chip indexes\" — that is, the major stock exchange indexes that include individual blue-chip stocks: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&#38;P 500, and the Nasdaq-100. The funds cherry-pick from the exchanges to populate their portfolios with industry blue chips.&#160;</p><p>Across the pond, the New Europe Blue Chip Index tracks 30 of the top stocks traded on the Continent. The DAX Index tracks the top 30 companies on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>The security of blue chips ranks at the top of their appeal to investors. Blue chips' history of weathering even the stormiest of times puts them in a kind of safe-haven category. This gives investors comfort in knowing these stocks emerge less scathed than their counterparts in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-bear-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rocky times</a>.&#160;</p><p>These stock-market stalwarts look especially attractive to older investors, who are often risk-averse, dislike volatility, and seek income from their investments. More often than not, younger investors, who want bigger growth and can take chances, avoid blue chips for these very reasons: the lack of flash and hype, and the high price of their shares.&#160;</p><p>Still, while the weighting varies based on their goals and risk tolerance, all investors can rely on blue-chip stocks as a means to add strength and stability to their portfolios.&#160;</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/why-invest-stock-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why invest in the stock market?

He is also the co-chairman of the House Army Caucus.</p><p>The nine-term incumbent, Carter, is the only person to ever represent the 31st District since its creation after the 2000 US Census.</p><p>Imam, Carter's Democratic challenger, is an entrepreneur and engineer. She currently works for ProductCamp Austin, an education nonprofit. Her campaign <a href=\"https://votefordonna.com/#solutions\">platform is centered around</a> expanding healthcare access for all, education access for all, and a path to citizenship for DACA recipients.</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Texas' 31st Congressional District is located in central Texas. The district is home to Williamson County and a part of Bell county. It includes the northern Austin suburbs as well as the Fort Hood United States Army post.&#160;</p><p>The 31st District was formed in 2003 and is one of two districts in the state of Texas which has never been represented by a Democrat.</p><p>In the 2016 presidential election, the district voted for President Donald Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a 54-41 percent split of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/07/09/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts\">according to Daily Kos Elections</a>.</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=TX31TX31\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Carter has raised about $1.6 million for his campaign so far, or over six times more than Imam's $249,000. Carter also holds a substantial cash on hand advantage over his opponent. He has $922,000 left to spend on his campaign as the November election approaches, or close to $880,000 more than Imam with just $42,099 remaining.</p><h2>What experts say</h2><p>The race between Carter and Imam is rated as \"safe Republican\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a> and \"likely Republican\" by <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">the Cook Political Report</a> and <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-house/\">Sabato's Crystal Ball</a> at the

Think about it — when was the last time you looked forward to showing off your underarms during summer? Probably never.</p><p>That's because, aside from being totally unexciting, underarms are often ignored, under-pampered, and in less-than-peak condition. That's exactly why <a href=\"https://ulta.ztk5.net/c/196318/164999/3037?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fhealthy-underarm-detox-mask%3FproductId%3DxlsImpprod17441013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Lavanila's The Healthy Underarm Detox Mask</a> is such a unique find.</p><p>The all-natural mask is designed to remove buildup from traditional antiperspirants and deodorants, brighten dull or uneven skin tone, and help shorten the transitional period between traditional (read: chemical) antiperspirants to more natural picks. &#160;</p><h2>The ingredients</h2><p>There are three major natural ingredients at play in this product — active charcoal, malic acid, and silica.</p><p>Active charcoal exfoliates to remove toxins and impurities, brightening the skin. Malic acid then works like a magnet, binding to and removing aluminum and metal ions — which are ingredients found in traditional antiperspirants. Finally, silica steps in to absorb sweat molecules while nourishing skin, so rough, bumpy skin becomes more touchable.&#160;&#160;</p><h2>My experience with the mask</h2><p>There are a lot of ways a beauty company can mess up the packaging of a product regardless of where it goes on your body. It can be messy. It can be hard to scoop out the product. It can be hard to apply on your skin. It can be even harder to wash off.&#160;</p><p>It seemed like Lavanila knew all this because there are none of those issues here. The mask comes in an upside-down bottle (so there's no awkward squeezing or shaking to get the last of the product out) with a wide brush that applies the mask smoothly onto your underarms with absolutely no weird angling.</p><p>Seriously, the first time I used it, I was ready to spend about 15 minutes just applying the mask onto my skin. It took all of 90 seconds for both arms — and that's me being <em>really</em> slow.</p><p>But perhaps the most awkward part is waiting while the mask does its work on your skin. It only needs to sit for five minutes, but you have to spend that time with your arms awkwardly raised above your head or behind your back. I took this time to do some much-needed post-work meditation instead. Seriously, it's the perfect excuse to lie down for five whole minutes and literally do nothing because you don't want to mess up the mask.&#160;</p><p>Clean up was also surprisingly easy. Just as the directions say, all you need is a washcloth with warm water to wipe the mask off your skin. I mention this in awe because there are so many masks that claim to be easy to rinse and remove, but I find myself needing to hop in the shower in an effort to remove all of the dried out remains. No shower needed here though.</p><p><a href=\"https://ulta.ztk5.net/c/196318/164999/3037?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fhealthy-underarm-detox-mask%3FproductId%3DxlsImpprod17441013\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The upside-down squeeze tube includes a wide applicator brush to apply the mask on underarm skin smoothly.

I noticed that with each use, I sweated less and less. The skin on my underarms also became noticeably softer. It's a weird thing to think about, but for some reason, softer, smoother underarms gave me a tiny confidence boost.</p><p>Now, let's get to the real results I was looking for — brightening. Throughout the years, my underarm skin had become a bit discolored — something I knew stemmed from the buildup from my traditional antiperspirant — and had some less-than-desirable bumps. The one hope I had was for the mask to restore my skin to a happier state.</p><p>While my skin was not celebrity-level clean — seriously, how do stars get their underarms looking so smooth and even anyway? — I did see a noticeable difference after about two weeks of using the mask. It wasn't a night and day difference, but it was enough to give me a pretty good confidence boost, which is essential since I'll soon be trading in my long-sleeves for tank tops.</p><h2>Would I keep using it?</h2><p>In a word — yes. I plan to keep using the mask for the rest of the spring and summer. Its ability to minimize my sweating and brighten my underarm skin gave me a self-esteem boost I never knew I needed. Who knew I can be so emotionally affected by my underarms?&#160;</p><p>But at $26 for 1.5 oz., it's still a pretty steep price to pay several times a year, so I'll categorize this mask under must-have <em>summer</em> beauty products instead of year-round. I'll use it when I want to flaunt around in my favorite sleeveless sundress and bathing suit, and then save it when the cool weather sets in. It's not like anyone's going to stare at my underarms while I pick apples in the fall.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5eb1c0ad204ad30fa414c857\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5eb1c0ad204ad30fa414c857&type=button&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/lavanila-the-healthy-underarm-detox-review'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/HtDb6vogJRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 18:39:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5cdb06f1021b4c6f354dc105?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"fa9c447372bb42060f45f0b1c04091bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn19@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-11-51-320_c7c025d410f95a6f.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":63994,"destBytes":63994,"author":"jwong@businessinsider.com (Laurie Espino)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5ce70c6b828ac14f95153156?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn54@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-51-360_40cc3fb05b542107.webp","https://i.insider.com/5cdb06f1021b4c6f354dc105?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn19@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-11-51-320_c7c025d410f95a6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-53-792_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn1@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-51-054_09ac17364e4c3435.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn48@2020_2/2020/10/09/19-12-48-561_42cded2785e510ad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-50-625_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=HtDb6vogJRQ:5cU6VJC3Vxk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn40@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-53-434_b7704399e904cfdb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/HtDb6vogJRQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-53-246_aef8fae4eef5c4c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270691400},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:31","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:31","title":"First-term Rep.

He won his 2016 reelection by 6.6 points.&#160;</p><p>Cooper has focused his 2020 bid on how he would continue to handle COVID-19, including fighting for Medicaid expansion, an unsuccessful battle against the Republican-controlled state legislature during his tenure so far.&#160;</p><p>Forest has launched attacks at his opponent's leadership during the public health crisis and revolves around addressing the pandemic differently, such as an in-person schools reopening versus remote, echoing President Donald Trump's approach.</p><p>Trump threw his support behind Forest after blaming Cooper's event capacity limits as preventing him from hosting the Republican National Convention in Charlotte. The event, a mix of in-person and virtual gatherings, is still being held there, though Trump plans to accept his nomination from the White House.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Donald J.

Duncan Hunter represented the district for nearly four terms in Congress but became embroiled in a scandal when federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/duncan-hunter-guilty-plea.html\">charged him and his wife Margaret</a> with over 60 counts of embezzling campaign funds, wire fraud, falsification of campaign finance records, and conspiracy.</p><p>Duncan lost his committee assignments upon being indicted, and submitted <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-rep-duncan-hunter-announces-resignation-2020-1\">letters of resignation</a> to both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Gov. Gavin Newsom a month after pleading guilty. Hunter resigned too late for Newsom to call a special election, leaving the seat vacant. In March, Hunter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/duncan-hunter-sentencing.html\">was sentenced to 11 months in federal prison.</a></p><p>California currently has a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/primary-elections-california/\">\"top-two primary\"</a> system, meaning that the top two winners of the primary election go on the final ballot, regardless of their political party.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Issa is a former US House representative who once represented the 48th and 49th districts, which both include portions of Orange County and are now represented by Democrats.</p><p>He is the co-founder and former CEO of Directed Electronics, one of the largest automobile security companies in the U.S. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Issa was the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/03/30/congress-money-entrepreneur/#50bdfd713c5a\">richest member of Congress</a> during his tenure. <a href=\"https://www.darrellissa.com/issues/\">His 2020 campaign platform</a> emphasizes building on a wall on the southern border, opposing illegal immigration and sanctuary cities, and creating fairer trade policies.&#160;</p><p>In late 2018, several months after announcing he was not seeking reelection, Issa was nominated by President Donald Trump to become the director of the United States Trade and Development Agency. In California's \"top-two primary\" in March, Issa <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/california/\">placed second behind Campa-Najjar</a>.</p><p>Campa-Najjar is the deputy regional field director for President Barack Obama's reelection campaign and served a role in the Executive Office of the President.</p><p>He later became the <a href=\"https://www.campacampaign.com/meet-ammar\">communications and marketing director</a>&#160;for the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and led the Office of Public Affairs for the Employment and Training Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p>In 2018, Campa-Najjar ran against Rep. Hunter and narrowly <a href=\"https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2018-general/sov/2018-complete-sov.pdf\">lost by a margin of 3.4 percentage points</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.campacampaign.com/\">2020 campaign platform</a> focuses on helping Southern California recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding access to affordable healthcare, and increasing economic opportunity and supporting small businesses in the district.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p>California's 50th Congressional District is located in the state's southern region and is home to the northeastern and central regions of San Diego County as well as a portion of Riverside County.&#160;</p><p>The district has traditionally been solidly Republican. For the 2016 presidential election, the 50th Congressional District voted for President Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in a 55-40 percentage point split of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts\">according to the Daily Kos</a>.</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=CA50&spec=Np;spec=N\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Issa has raised about $5.5 million, spent $5 million, and currently has $515,000 in cash on hand as the November election approaches. Campa-Najjar has raised approximately $3 million for his campaign, spent $2 million, and has $890,000 left to spend.&#160;</p><h2>What experts say</h2><p>The race between Issa and Campa-Najjar is rated as \"likely Republican\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a>, the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">Cook Political Report</a>, and <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-house/\">Sabato's Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\"

It will encompass far more than the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-los-angeles-office-wooden-airplane-hangar-photos-2019-11\">quirky office style</a> that Google is known for: there are plans for up to 5,900 residencies, retail spaces, pop-up events, and publicly accessible nature through trails and paths.&#160;</p><p>The design seems to consciously base itself off of aspects of San Jose that already exist. The Los Gatos Creek is highlighted in a larger nature area, and Google details plans to follow San Jose's climate change initiative by designing large open spaces to combat urban heat islands, accessible public transportation, and a possible onsite wastewater collection and recycling facility. Now, Google is asking for resident feedback before the plan is considered for approval by the San Jose city council in the spring.</p><p>Some big tech companies aren't slowing down their real estate plans this year, despite the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-just-bought-reis-abandoned-seattle-area-hq-2020-9\">Facebook paid $376.6 million for REI's former unfinished Seattle-era headquarters</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/real-hq2-amazon-add-another-10000-jobs-bellevue-wash-nearby-downtown-seattle-hq/\">Amazon just leased two million additional square feet of office space</a> in Bellevue.</p><p>Meanwhile, as more work shifts remote <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Pinterest-cancels-huge-SF-office-lease-in-unbuilt-15523170.php\">Pinterest canceled a large San Francisco lease</a>, and Twitter is trying to sublet parts of its San Francisco headquarters after telling workers <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-subleasing-san-francisco-headquarters-employees-work-from-home-2020-9\">they can work from home indefinitely</a>.</p><p>Take a look inside Google's plans here.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe 79-acre campus would be a workplace for 25,000 employees.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f80842fea74820019ca6352?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google San Jose\" height=\"721\" width=\"961\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Google San Jose campus.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Google</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tGoogle's plan is to integrate the campus into the city, and make it \"mixed-use, inclusive, and of San José.\"\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f808c984c3b2e0019bba2d0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google San Jose\" height=\"699\" width=\"932\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Google San Jose campus.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Google</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tThe campus wouldn't be just offices, it would include about 15 acres of open space, including nature walks, creeks, and bike trails.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8084bf4c3b2e0019bba255?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google San Jose\" height=\"710\" width=\"946\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Google San Jose campus.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Google</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tThe area would be divided primarily by experience.

Ben Ray Luján</strong> is facing off against Republican&#160;<strong>Mark Ronchetti&#160;</strong>for US Senate in New Mexico.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The candidates:</strong></h2><p>Luján has represented New Mexico's 3rd Congressional District, which includes the Northern part of the state and the state's capital of Santa Fe, for over a decade since 2009. He previously served on New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission.&#160;</p><p>In the House, Luján has taken on leadership positions as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House' Democrats campaign arm, from 2015 to 2019, and now as the House Assistant Democratic Leader, making him currently the highest-ranking Hispanic member of the House.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Luján announced his candidacy for US Senate in 2019 shortly after current&#160;<strong>Sen. Mark Udall&#160;</strong>announced his retirement, and quickly cleared the field to secure the Democratic nomination.&#160;</p><p>His <a href=\"https://benraylujan.com/priorities/\">campaign platform emphasizes</a> investing in New Mexico families and improving opportunities and outcomes for children, strengthening New Mexico's economy, especially at New Mexico's bases and National Labs, and protecting New Mexico's natural resources and public lands.&#160;</p><p>Ronchetti, the Republican candidate, is a former TV news reporter and meteorologist in Albuquerque. <a href=\"https://www.markronchetti.com/issues\">His campaign platform</a> emphasizes lowering taxes and bringing more economic development to New Mexico, protecting 2nd Amendment rights, and bolstering security along the US' southern border.&#160;</p><h2>The stakes:</h2><p>In addition to winning back the White House, regaining control of the US Senate for the first time since 2015 is a top priority for Democrats and would be a major accomplishment towards either delivering on a future president Joe Biden's policy goals or thwarting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda.</p><p>Currently, the US Senate is made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents that caucus with Democrats, winning that Democrats need to win back a net total of four seats to have a 51-seat majority (if Biden wins, his vice president would also serve as president of the Senate and would be a tie-breaker vote).&#160;</p><p>New Mexico is a largely Democratic state, and Luján is currently favored to win election to the seat.</p><p>In the 2018 midterm elections as Luján was leading the DCCC, Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small flipped New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District back into Democratic hands, and is facing a tough reelection rematch against Republican Yvette Herrell.&#160;</p><p><strong>The money race:&#160;</strong>Lujan has outraised Ronchetti by a nearly five-to-one-ratio, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=NMS2NMS2\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</a> Lujan has brought in $6.1 million, spent $3.2 million, and has over $3.3 million cash on hand. Ronchetti has raised $1.38 million, spent over $809,000, and has $570,000 in cash on hand.&#160;</p><p><strong>What the polling says: </strong>The most recent poll of the race <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1493963/journal-poll-lujan-leads-ronchetti-in-us-senate-race.html\">conducted by the Albuquerque Journal and Research &#38; Polling Inc</a>. between August 26 and September 2 found Lujan leading Ronchetti by nine points, 49% to 40%.&#160;</p><p><strong>What some of the experts say:</strong> The <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Cook Political Report</a> and <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/senate\">Inside Elections</a> rate the race between Smith and Lewis as \"safe Democratic\" while <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-senate/\">Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics</a> rates it \"likely Democratic.\"&#160;</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/new-mexico/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, Luján has a 95% chance of defeating Ronchetti in November and is expected to receive 14.6% more of the popular vote than his opponents.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/new-mexico-us-senate-election-preview-ben-ray-lujn-vs-mark-ronchetti-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/kCI8p6R-mOg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 19:03:40 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f5b9003e6ff30001d4e84b2?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"393aaa79f8839046676419da2fa91131","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-12-45-876_b146a3f841b55a16.webp","destWidth":1780,"destHeight":1335,"sourceBytes":57504,"destBytes":57504,"author":"gpanetta@businessinsider.com (Grace Panetta)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f5b90b07ed0ee001e25ec67?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn47@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-53-006_b4bcf597f7b08cab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-53-792_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-51-401_4932c54d4b5e15dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn94@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-54-477_a64a0fa946b71be7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-50-625_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kCI8p6R-mOg:LNK7bcHxGNo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/kCI8p6R-mOg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn5@2020_2/2020/10/09/19-12-51-084_5cadc8543513e4f0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270691383},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:31","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:31","title":"Stocks face a turbulent path forward if Democrats sweep in November, Morgan Stanley says","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-election-fuel-turbulent-swings-volatility-morgan-stanley-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f809c4cea74820019ca6429?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Former Vice President Joe Biden\" height=\"750\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Former Vice President Joe Biden\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mark Makela/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>A Democratic sweep in November would place stocks on a rollercoaster ride through the end of the year, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ms-stock\">Morgan Stanley</a> strategists said Friday.</strong></li><li><strong>US equities are among the few assets poised for a \"detour\" should a so-called blue wave take place.

Yet US equities are among the few assets poised for a \"detour\" should such a sweep take place, the bank said in a note to clients.</p><p>While some assets such as Treasurys and oil would face a steady decline, an overwhelming Democratic victory would form a temporary deviation from stocks' upward trajectory, they added.</p><p>The market's immediate reaction will likely be negative, according to the firm. Fears of tax hikes will drive initial selling and lower earnings outlooks. The continued economic recovery would drive some derating of earnings-per-share multiples, posing a short-term risk until profit growth catches up with the updated forecasts. Uncertainty around future stimulus can also cloud initial hopes for fresh relief, the bank said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-strategy-and-stock-picks-from-fund-manager-brandon-nelson-2020-10\" data-analytics-position=\"3\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Fund manager Brandon Nelson is tripling his benchmark in 2020 with 'less-discovered' companies that become big winners.

The continuation of economic recovery will revive spending and drive earnings growth. A follow-up to the March CARES Act will lift bullishness, and Morgan Stanley expects the tax scare to give way to a smaller-than-expected increase.&#160;</p><p>\"Our base case is to buy any dip on a blue wave as we think tax policy is difficult to enact and think the legislative focus will lean toward CARES 2 as a top priority,\" the team said.</p><p>As for other outcomes, the bank views a divided government as having less of an up-front slump but a longer struggle with passing new stimulus.

Tina Smith&#160;</strong>is running for a full term in the US Senate against Republican&#160;<strong>Jason Lewis.&#160;</strong></p><h2><strong>The candidates:</strong></h2><p>Smith, Minnesota's former lieutenant governor, was appointed to former&#160;<strong>Sen. Al Franken</strong>'s US Senate seat when he resigned from office in December 2017 and won a 2018 special election to serve out the rest of Franken's term until 2021.&#160;</p><p>This fall, Smith is running for her first full term for the seat. She currently serves on four US Senate committees including the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP).&#160;</p><p>In the Senate,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-fierce-advocate-minnesota\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\">she's heavily focused on healthcare issues,</a>&#160;including expanding coverage, reducing prescription drug costs, and combatting the opioid crisis in Minnesota.&#160;</p><p>Smith's opponent, Lewis, is a former talk radio host who previously represented Minnesota's 2nd Congressional District in the suburbs southeast of the Twin Cities area for one term from 2017 to 2019. He was unseated in 2018 by Democratic challenger&#160;<strong>Rep. Angie Craig.&#160;</strong></p><p>Lewis' campaign message has focused on revitalizing Minnesota's economy, particularly the mining communities in the state's Iron Range, protecting the 2nd Amendment, and supporting law enforcement.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The stakes:</strong></h2><p>In addition to winning back the White House, regaining control of the US Senate for the first time since 2015 is a top priority for Democrats and would be a major accomplishment towards either delivering on a future president Joe Biden's policy goals or thwarting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda.</p><p>Currently, the US Senate is made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents that caucus with Democrats, winning that Democrats need to win back a net total of four seats to have a 51-seat majority (if Biden wins, his vice president would also serve as president of the Senate and would be a tie-breaker vote).&#160;</p><p>In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats flipped two Republican-controlled seats, the 2nd and 3rd Districts, in the Twin Cities seats, but lost control of two seats in rural Minnesota, the 1st District in the Southern part of the state and the 8th District in the mountainous Iron Range region in Northern Minnesota.&#160;</p><p>This year, Republicans hoping to build on their gains in 2018 in rural areas and are aiming to target Minnesota in both the electoral college and the Senate, but the state is still expected to favor Democrats. Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads Trump by over six percentage points on average in polls of the state, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/minnesota/\">according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average.&#160;</a></p><p><strong>The money race:&#160;</strong>Smith has substantially outraised and outspent Lewis in the cycle so far, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=MNS1MNS1\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>. She's brought in $10 million, spent $4.6 million, and has $5.8 million in cash on hand compared to $2.4 million raised, $1.5 million spent, and $992,607 in cash on hand for Lewis.&#160;</p><p><strong>What the polling says:&#160;</strong>The most recent poll of the race conducted by The New York Times and Siena College showed Smith <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/crosstabs-mn-nh-nv-wi/aefa3a3ec36370e9/full.pdf\">ahead of Lewis by nine points</a>, 49% to 40%. Another survey <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=cc902191-9d67-498a-aa9c-d59233e2c85b\">conducted by SurveyUSA</a> from September 4 to 7 showed Smith leading Lewis by 11 points, 47% to 36%. A previous poll <a href=\"https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MinnesotaPoll9420.pdf\">conducted by Public Policy Polling</a> September 3 to 4 showed Smith leading Lewis by eight points, 49% to 41%.&#160;</p><p><strong>What some of the experts say:</strong> The <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Cook Political Report</a> and <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/senate\">Inside Elections</a> rate the race between Smith and Lewis as \"safe Democratic\" while <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-senate/\">Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics</a> rates it \"likely Democratic.\"&#160;</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/minnesota/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, Smith has a 92% chance of winning her reelection bid in November. Smith is expected to receive 55% of the popular vote, or 13% more than Lewis.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

that candidates of all party affiliations compete in the primary on the same ballot and the top two winners of the primary election go on the final ballot, regardless of their political

poverty in San Diego. She is also the founder of <a href=\"https://www.projectconnect.world/about\">Project Connect</a>, an education nonprofit which maps schools around the world.

Carol Shea-Porter. He formerly served as a member of the New Hampshire Executive Council, which essentially functions as an advisory board to the governor's office, and helped run his family's small business.&#160;</p><p>In Congress, he serves on the Committee on Veterans Affairs and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.

the power of an interim <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-basic-income-2016-8\">universal basic income</a> to lift people out of poverty.

Spending on \"temptation goods,\" such as drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol declined by 39%, on average. And recipients were able to keep an average of $1,000 in savings, according to Canadian news outlet <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714\">CBC</a>.&#160;</p><p>The cash payment saved the shelter system $8,100 per person over the course of the year, a total savings of $405,000.</p><p>It also gave some participants the chance to update their job skills.&#160;</p><p>\"When I found out I had been accepted to receive the cash transfer, I was living in an emergency shelter, trying to find a way forward,\" a New Leaf project participant whose identity was kept anonymous said in a press release. \"The money gave me the resources I needed to get out of the shelter and push for the social programs and the computer class I needed.

Something for astronomy will be heavier, as you'll want higher magnification to see farther into the night sky.

That's because larger lenses can draw in more light.</p><p>Magnification is also key for proper viewing. While some binoculars start at 10x, images appear even larger with 25x magnification, naturally. When it comes to specifications, some astronomers want to know all the details. These binoculars have a linear field of view of 141 feet (47 meters) and a 2.8mm exit pupil. There's also 13mm eye relief and a 75-foot close focus.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://garyseronik.com/understanding-binocular-exit-pupils/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> by Gary Seronik, an astronomy expert, explores the advantages of smaller exit pupils in more powerful binoculars such as these. Smaller exit pupils, such as the 2.8mm in these binoculars, results in a darker sky background and enhanced contrast among stars.</p><p>While these binoculars are designed to be versatile, you're probably going to spend the majority of your time looking up at the sky. That's one reason why many astronomers are willing to put up with the relatively hefty <a href=\"https://www.celestron.com/products/skymaster-25x70-binocular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.25-pound weight</a>. Such an intense magnification also essentially requires a tripod to ensure images are as still as possible.</p><p>Additionally, adjusting these binoculars may not be the most intuitive or fastest process.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Ideal for sky and land viewing, long eye-relief ideal for those who wear glasses, powerful magnification</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Needs a tripod for stable images, heavy, focusing can be tedious</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-budget-binoculars'>Business

We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.\"</p><p>\"The word 'democracy' appears nowhere in the Constitution, perhaps because our form of government is not a democracy. It's a constitutional republic,\" Lee added. \"To me it matters. It should matter to anyone who worries about the excessive accumulation of power in the hands of the few.\"</p><p>The Utah Republican's tweets on the matter are linked to a long history of Republicans rejecting the notion that the US political system is a democracy. The GOP's objection to calling the US a democracy is tied to the fact Republicans have reason to fear a system in which a majority of Americans have more say. The Republican party's platform is increasingly at odds with the perspectives of most voters on an array of issues.&#160;</p><p>But Lee's portrayal of democracy as something that can hinder progress in the US could also be viewed in a more chilling light given the Republican senator is an ally of a president who has rapidly eroded democratic norms during his tenure and is actively working to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-is-trying-to-undermine-legitimacy-of-the-2020-election-2020-7\">undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election</a>.</p><p>President Donald Trump has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, for example, and has essentially <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/07/trump-demands-barr-arrest-foes-427389\">called for his political rivals to be jailed.</a> The president has baselessly claimed that the election is \"rigged\" against him as he trails former Vice President Joe Biden in the polls.

Now a member of Congress is urging us to join them. I wonder what made you hate America so much.\"</p><p>\"Every despot in the world has promised liberty, peace, and prosperity,\" Brian Klaas, Brian Klaas, a political scientist at the University College London, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/1314192852398858241?s=20\">said</a> via Twitter in response to Lee. \"The problem is that without democracy, you can't get rid of them when they don't actually deliver. And then you're stuck with a dictator who provides none of the above.\"</p><p>The Utah senator, who was democratically elected to the Senate in 2011, was echoing an oft-repeated line from US conservatives that <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/american-founders/report/america-republic-not-democracy\">\"the US is a republic, not a democracy.\"</a>&#160;</p><p>This is a misleading slogan. The US is not a direct democracy, in which citizens play a direct role in voting on policy or laws, but it is a representative democracy, in which representatives are elected by citizens to be their voice in government. It is also a constitutional democracy, in which the Constitution provides for a system of checks and balances (co-equal branches of government) and therefore presents restraints on the majority.&#160;</p><p>Technically, the US is a constitutional republic. But a republic is, by definition, a type of democracy.</p><p>\"Both democracy and republic have more than a single meaning, and one of the definitions we provide for democracy closely resembles the definition of republic,\" <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic\">according to Merriam-Webster</a>, which defines a republic as \"a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections.\"</p><p>In other words, the US is both a republic AND a democracy.</p><p>Lee painted a false dichotomy and he could not have done it at a worse moment, as many in the US feel that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/21/supreme-court-fight-highlights-new-political-reality-america-under-minority-rule/\">the GOP has already instituted minority rule</a> and democracy watchdogs warn that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/18/united-states-is-backsliding-into-autocracy-under-trump-scholars-warn/\">America is becoming increasingly autocratic under Trump.</a></p><p>\"Authoritarianism in a nutshell,\" Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian and expert on authoritarianism at New York University, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruthbenghiat/status/1314217006682402817?s=20\">said</a> in response to Lee. \"Same words said from Mussolini to Orbán. GOP has judged the time right to come out and say it.\"</p><p>\"The escalation of GOP and WH rhetoric about protestors being a mob and Dems being 'too dangerous to rule' is very serious,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruthbenghiat/status/1048964002167095296?s=20\">Ben-Ghiat said</a>, warning that such talk \"often precedes\" authoritarian government actions.</p><p>Like many congressional Republicans, Lee went from being a fierce critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign season to an ally after the former reality TV star won the election. Back in 2016, Lee questioned whether Trump would be an authoritarian if elected.&#160;</p><p>\"I would like some assurances that he is going to be a vigorous defender of the U.S. Constitution, that he is not going to be an autocrat, that he is not going to be an authoritarian,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/politics/mike-lee-donald-trump.html\">Lee said</a> at the time. \"That is not an unreasonable demand.\"</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020 and Lee is at the forefront of GOP efforts to confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee prior to the election, despite the fact polling has shown a majority of Americans believe that seat should remain vacant until after Election Day.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

So when your GPS is having a hard time identifying your location, things can get frustrating — fast.&#160;</p><p>If you use <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google-maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Maps</a>, there are ways to improve the accuracy: calibrating the compass so it points in the correct direction, for instance, or turning on high-accuracy mode on your Android phone.&#160;</p><p>There are several ways to get better directions and results while using the Google Maps app on your Android&#160;phone, as we detail below.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you have an iPhone, however, the below methods won't work, so you should try restarting your phone or enabling Wi-Fi to improve the accuracy of your Google Maps app.</p><h2>How to calibrate Google Maps with settings on an Android phone</h2><h3>Compass calibration</h3><p>If you open your Google Maps app and see that the blue dot is pointing in the wrong direction, or is in the wrong location, calibration can help you get a more accurate reading. Here's how to do it on an Android&#160;phone:</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Go into your Google Maps app, if it's not already open.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>While holding your phone, move your hand in a figure eight motion — you should see the beam narrow as you go. Keep in mind it may take a few times for this to work.</p><h3>Turning on high-accuracy mode</h3><p>High-accuracy mode is a helpful tool in getting your Google Maps app up to speed. But keep in mind that this method only works if you have an Android:</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Open your device's Settings app.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Tap \"Location.\" Depending on your device, it may also be labeled as \"Security and Location\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d8a82012e22af17431bc025?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2 HOW TO CALIBRATE GOOGLE MAPS\" height=\"1920\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Open your device&#39;s &#34;Location&#34; menu.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Devon Delfino/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>5. </strong>Switch on the location setting, if necessary.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d8a822b2e22af166b3c1b46?format=jpeg\" alt=\"3 HOW TO CALIBRATE GOOGLE MAPS\" height=\"1920\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Make sure that location services are turned on.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Devon Delfino/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>6. </strong>Tap \"Mode.\"</p><p><strong>7. </strong>Select \"High Accuracy.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d8a824d2e22af17431bc028?format=jpeg\" alt=\"4 HOW TO CALIBRATE GOOGLE MAPS\" height=\"1920\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Activate the highest accuracy location mode.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Devon Delfino/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>How to calibrate Google Maps on an iPhone or Android with other basic fixes</h2><p>There aren't as many fancy tricks to fix Google Maps on an iPhone.</p><p>First, you should turn on Wi-Fi on your phone. You don't need to connect to a network, you just need to turn on the setting. On both iPhone and Android, turning on Wi-Fi will make Google Maps more accurate, as it scans nearby Wi-Fi signals to locate you.</p><p>If that doesn't work, try restarting your iPhone or Android. Your phone's GPS sensors may simply need to be rebooted. For more information on how to restart an iPhone, see our article, \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-restart-iphone-7-8-x-xs-xr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to restart and force-restart any iPhone model</a>.\"</p><p>Finally, on an iPhone specifically, make sure that location services are turned on. To do this:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Open your Settings app and go to the \"Privacy\" tab.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>At the top of the Privacy screen, tap \"Location Services.\"</p><p><strong>3.&#160;</strong>Make sure that the switch at the top of the next screen is flipped to the right, and is colored green. If it's not, tap it.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Scroll down to your list of apps until you find Google Maps, and tap on it.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> On the next screen, select either \"While Using the App\" or \"Always.\" This will allow the Google Maps app to access your precise location faster.</p><h2><strong>Related coverage from&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\"

But not everybody wants to give up their home, and SpaceX has now made what it calls a final attempt to take over the last dozen or so houses that remain outside its possession — including financial offers and warnings to residents that \"it's not safe\" and it's \"too dangerous\" to live there anymore.&#160;</p><p>If this push doesn't work — and it appears to be a long shot — the company has hinted it may \"pursue alternative approaches\" to realize its ambitions. To get the full story, we talked to Boca Chicans who see SpaceX's warnings as threats and don't intend to cave into the pressure.

Plus: how much Rivian pays its engineers, a battery-recycling venture from a Tesla veteran, and Mercedes' new plan for an electric future.&#160;</p><p>Read about all that and more below, and if you haven't yet, <a href=\"http://newsletter.businessinsider.com/join/4np/shiftinggears\">sign up here to get this newsletter in your inbox every week</a>.</p><h2>JB Straubel's big new bet</h2><p>Throughout most of Tesla's long rise to its current status as the world's most valuable automaker, JB Straubel served as Elon Musk's right-hand man, creating many of the cars, powertrains, batteries, and even entire factories that fueled Tesla's wild growth. Now, Straubel has his own venture and CEO title at Redwood Materials, where he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jb-straubel-is-building-redwood-to-recycle-old-ev-batteries-2020-10\">wants to chase the big money</a> in recycling old EV batteries.&#160;</p><p>\"A huge missing piece of the remanufacturing economy is how all the batteries and materials get unmanufactured and are looped back into the supply chain,\" he told us. \"It could be a massive, massive industry.\"</p><h2>Rivian offers six-figure salaries amid a rising talent war</h2><p>So many electric vehicle startups, not so many engineers to make them all go. The war for talent in a burgeoning space is on, and we pulled the data to get a look at <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rivian-salaries-revealed-from-engineer-to-financial-analyst-2020-10\">how much Rivian pays its employees</a>, from engineers to financial analysts.

Just about every expert on the planet sees the laser sensor as key to making cars drive themselves, and the 25-year-old CEO of Luminar — a company he started at age 17 — is making it work not just for research vehicles, but for regular consumer cars.

The government's attempt at instating its first part of the ban is already being stymied by a temporary injunction granted last month, which the Trump administration appealed on Thursday.</p><p>But the impending calendar date is still a month away, meaning there's ample time for TikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance to make further moves to ensure the app's future in the US. The delay gives TikTok even further leeway as it grapples to survive in a months-long battle characterized by political jockeying and back-and-forth negotiations.</p><p>But come November 4, a federal judge will be tasked with deciding whether to block the US government's planned ban, which would take place on November 12 without obstruction. The next phase of the two-part TikTok ban intends to be a complete ban, targeting internet hosting services and content delivery networks.</p><p>Holding the hearing after November 3 is significant because the election's outcome could change how ByteDance or the Trump administration approach their arguments. But the winner of the 2020 presidential election won't be sworn in until Jan. 20, and a winner <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/america-likely-wont-know-presidential-race-winner-on-election-night-2020-5\">may not be known</a> until several days after the election, meaning the judge presiding over the TikTok case will still have to make a decision on the Nov. 12 injunction.</p><p>The future looks bright for TikTok, however. TikTok already saw the court rule in its favor when it temporarily blocked the Trump administration's first executive order to stop new downloads and software updates of the app on September 27. In the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-ban-injunction-federal-judge-says-donald-trump-exceeds-ieepa-2020-9\">decision to grant the injunction</a>, US Judge Carl Nichols called into question the government's authority to issue such a ban, writing that the TikTok ban \"likely exceeds\" the administration's \"lawful bounds.\"</p><p>It remains unclear what will happen to the US government's planned TikTok ban if a deal to settle the company's ownership in the US — in the works for months, as it hits snags and pushback — is finalized. The current proposal would break off TikTok's global business into a new US-based company, in which Oracle, Walmart and US investors would have substantial stakes. However, there's still disagreement over whether the deal would give majority ownership to US investors, or whether TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance would maintain its majority ownership.</p><p>The calls from Donald Trump and government officials to push for a ban of TikTok over its ties with China have been mounting for months.

Ron Kind</strong> looks to defend his House seat against Republican challenger <strong>Derrick Van Orden</strong> in Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Kind is an <a href=\"https://ronkind.org/about/\">attorney and former special prosecutor</a> for the La Crosse County prosecutor's office. He has held his position in the House of Representatives since 1996, now for 12 consecutive terms.</p><p>He currently sits on the House Committee on Ways and Means, and previously sat in the Natural Resources Committee for 14 years. Kind's <a href=\"https://ronkind.org/issues/\">2020 campaign platform</a> is centered around providing affordable healthcare to Americans, restoring fiscal accountability in Congress, and lowering the costs of education.&#160;</p><p>Kind is currently chairman of the House New Democrat Coalition, a group of moderate Democrats that support fiscally responsible policies and bipartisanship in Congress, and voted against Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid for Speaker of the House in 2019.&#160;</p><p>Van Orden is a military veteran and Navy SEAL of 26 years. Since retiring from the military, Van Orden has spent time acting and writing a book about his experiences in the military. He was <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/04/12/derrick-van-orden-ron-kinds-duplicitous-track-record-inspired-run-congress/\">inspired to run</a> for office after Rep. Kind voted for President Donald Trump's impeachment in December 2016.&#160;</p><p>Van Orden's <a href=\"https://vanordenforcongress.com/the-issues/\">campaign platform is focused on</a> rebuilding Wisconsin's economy, fully funding police forces, and protecting farming and agricultural communities in Wisconsin and around the country.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District is located in the southwestern region of the state along its border with Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois. The 3rd District most notably includes the cities of La Crosse, Eau Claire, and much of the Wisconsin-side of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan region.</p><p>The district is also home to the counties of Adams, Buffalo, Crawford, Dunn, Eau Claire, Grant, La Crosse, Pepin, Pierce, Portage, Trempealeau, and Vernon as well as portions of Chippewa, Jackson, Juneau, Monroe, Richland, and Wood counties.</p><p>The 3rd District flipped from voting for former President Barack Obama by 11 points over GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 to backing Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by four points in a 49-45 percentage point split of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/07/09/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts\">according to Daily Kos</a>.</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=WI03&spec=Np;spec=N\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Kind has raised $1.6 million, more than double than Van Orden with $707,000. Kind also has a substantial cash on hand advantage over his challenger. He has over $3 million left to spend as the November election approaches, or over ten times more than Van Orden's $288,000.</p><h2>What some of the experts say</h2><p>The race between Kind and Van Orden is rated as \"safe Democratic\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a>, \"likely Democratic\" by <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-house/\">Sabato's Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, and \"leans Democratic\" by the <a

We don't know what specific models will be discounted just yet, but we can anticipate some likely candidates based on last year's sale.</p><p>During Amazon's Prime Day event last year, various <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wireless-earbuds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earbuds</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-over-ear-headphones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over-ear headphones</a>, wireless headphones, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-gaming-headset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gaming headsets</a> were discounted, including sets from brands like Apple, Sony, Bose, Beats, Jabra, HyperX, and more. It's likely that Prime Day 2020 will offer a similar assortment of deals.&#160;</p><p>Apple's popular AirPods were among the items on sale last year, and it's possible that the newer <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods Pro</a> will be included for Prime Day 2020. Other popular earbuds, like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T81554H/?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sony's WF-1000XM3</a>, are also likely candidates since they've already seen frequent discounts throughout the year. In fact, the 1000Xm3 are $52 off their full price right now. This is a common sale price for this particular model, however, so a better deal could be offered on Prime Day.</p><p>More new headphone models that weren't available on Prime Day last year could make the cut this year as well. Bose has its new <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q9MJKBV?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">700 noise-cancelling headphones</a> and Sony has its new <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0863TXGM3/?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">WH-1000XM4</a>. With that said, it's more likely that Sony's previous-generation <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">WH-1000XM3</a> could get discounted to help clear out older stock.&#160;</p><h2>True wireless earbud deals we saw last year</h2><p>True wireless headphones have gotten increasingly popular over the last few years. These convenient headphones feature a compact design with separate left and right buds that connect wirelessly and are completely free from cables.</p><p>Apple's AirPods are among the most popular earbuds on the market, and the standard versions with wired and wireless cases were discounted during last year's Prime Day event. Both of those models are actually on sale for even less right now, so it's possible a better deal could be offered once Prime Day 2020 begins.

A nice pair of over-ear or on-ear wireless headphones can be better fit for buyers who prioritize sound quality.&#160;</p><p>Wireless headphones from Beats, Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, Jabra, and Cowin were all on sale during last year's Prime Day event. The previous-generation Beats Solo3 were marked down to $140 so a similar discount on the new model is possible. Meanwhile, the Bose SoundLink II were $70 off their full price.&#160;Sony's WH-CH700N were just $90 on Prime Day last year, so new discounts on Sony headphones are also likely.&#160;</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5dc430a43afd3752c93ac609\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5dc430a43afd3752c93ac609&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5f7b6a562c44cc506e22f544\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f7b6a562c44cc506e22f544&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5e6fbfbac4854040ed076033\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5e6fbfbac4854040ed076033&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5f80947b514672640406e9a7\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f80947b514672640406e9a7&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><h2>Wired headphone deals we saw last year</h2><p>Wireless headphones have a ton to offer but, if you're an audiophile, then it's likely you prefer to keep the fidelity that wires bring. Non-audiophile wired headphones have some great things to offer, too — namely the fact that they're generally quite a bit cheaper than their wireless counterparts.&#160;</p><p>The limited edition blue version of Audio-Technica's ATH-M50x headphones were on sale for $99 on Prime Day last year. The blue model is no longer available, but a deal on other colors or similar headphones could be offered this year.</p><p>Another notable wired headphone deal offered last year was on Sennheiser's HD 599. These high-end headphones feature an open-back design which, while not ideal for noise isolation, provides impressive audio performance. The HD 599 were $100 on Prime Day last year, so a new deal on this model or other Sennheiser headphones could be in store for Prime Day 2020.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5d28adfda17d6c75d500202b\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5d28adfda17d6c75d500202b&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5f8091e5e155cf623b3ad9d5\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f8091e5e155cf623b3ad9d5&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><h2>Gaming headset deals we saw last year</h2><p>A reliable gaming headset can enhance your multiplayer experience, offering immersive audio and an integrated microphone for online voice chat.

Some buyers might prefer a model that emphasizes accurate sound quality, while others may opt for a pair that prioritizes portability.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-over-ear-headphones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Over-ear headphones</a> are larger than other styles and feature earcups that cover your ears to create a seal. This style of headphone is a good fit for people who want the best audio performance and noise isolation. On-ear headphones are similar, but their earcups simply rest on your ear rather than create a seal over them. This allows on-ear models to be a bit more compact, but they're less ideal for blocking outside noise. Gaming headsets can be either over-ear or on-ear, but they usually add an integrated boom microphone for online voice chat.</p><p>Meanwhile, if portability is your main priority, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-earbuds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earbuds</a> are the best option since they feature separate buds designed to rest just outside or within your ear canal. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wireless-earbuds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">True wireless models</a> are even more convenient since they're completely free from cables.&#160;</p><p>For more headphone recommendations and deals all year long, check out our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/headphone-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"

Gov. Mike Cooney is seeking to replace term-limited Democratic <strong>Gov. Steve Bullock</strong>, who is running for Senate.</p><p>Cooney has <a href=\"http://governor.mt.gov/About/Lieutenant-Governor\">decades of experience</a> in Montana's political sphere, previously serving as state senator, legislator and secretary of state. He has been lieutenant governor since 2016.</p><p>The lifelong Montanan has made affordable healthcare a top priority of his campaign, hinging off of the coronavirus pandemic. Cooney pledges to lower the cost of prescription drugs and continue expanding <a href=\"https://www.mtpr.org/post/gubernatorial-candidate-mike-cooney-public-service-health-care-and-energy\">access to Medicaid</a> should he win.&#160;</p><p>His Republican challenger Gianforte's campaign centers around boosting the economy.&#160;</p><p>Gianforte, whose background is in business, became one of the <a href=\"https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-news/gov-candidate-gianforte-releases-10-yrs-of-income-tax-returns\">state's wealthiest people</a> when software behemoth Oracle bought his tech startup for $1.8 billion in 2011, which he co-founded in the late 1990s with his wife in Bozeman, Montana.</p><p>Five years later, Gianforte unsuccessfully tried to launch his political career in a largely self-financed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/montana-governor-bullock-gianforte\">bid against Bullock</a> for the governorship. He lost by a slim 3.8 percentage points.</p><p>Gianforte then pursued a legislative opening in 2017 and won the special election for the state's sole congressional seat after the Trump administration appointed then-Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior Secretary.</p><p>The candidate made national headlines on the eve of his victory when he allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/may/25/republican-greg-gianforte-body-slams-guardian-reporter-in-montana-video\">bodyslammed a reporter</a>, which he later <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBoYzpV0ds\">apologized for</a> and was charged with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/24/republican-candidate-in-montana-race-body-slams-reporter-prompting-police-investigation/\">misdemeanor assault.&#160;</a></p><p>President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/trump-greg-gianforte-montana.html\">praised the congressman</a> at a rally in Montana a year later: \"Anybody that can do a body-slam,\" he said, \"that's my kind of guy.\"</p><p>Gianforte has boasted about <a href=\"https://gregformontana.com/issues/standing-with-trump/\">working with Trump</a> to cut taxes and roll back \"unnecessary burdensome regulations\" — policies he vows to implement in Montana if elected and has <a href=\"https://www.rga.org/rga-releases-new-video-career-politician-mike-cooney/\">slammed Cooney</a> as a \"career politician\" who pushes for more \"government red tape.\"</p><h3><strong>The stakes:</strong></h3><p>The 2020 gubernatorial contests are unlike recent election cycles considering the ongoing public health crisis. Eight out of the 11 races feature <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2020-governors-races-update/\">incumbents seeking reelection</a>, who may have their fates decided based on their respective coronavirus responses. Still, some safe predictions have been casted, for example, Washington state will go blue and North Dakota will go red.</p><p>Montana, however, is a slightly different ballgame: the race is open, the competition is decidedly close and voters historically do not plainly side with one party over the other.&#160;</p><p>Montana went to Trump in 2016 and has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections. The state's legislature is also GOP-controlled. Yet Democrats have held the state's highest office since 2005, and the elections have been won by narrow margins.&#160;</p><p>A Gianforte victory over Cooney would bolster Republicans nationally, and would tip the party's currently held 26 out of 50 governorships further in its favor.&#160;</p><p>Other major elections in Montana include the open US House race between <strong>Democrat Kathleen Williams</strong> and Republican State Auditor <strong>Matt Rosendale</strong> and the Senate race between Gov.

Before running for a position in the U.S. House of Representatives, McClintock ran for the office of state controller in 1994 and 1992, governor in the 2003 recall gubernatorial election, and lieutenant governor in the 2006 gubernatorial election, losing in every single one.&#160;</p><p>In Congress, McClintock serves on the House Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Natural Resources, focusing many of his efforts on natural resource issues important to California.

Her <a href=\"https://brynneforcongress.com/issues/\">campaign is focused on</a> strengthening the Affordable Care Act, combatting wildfire threats, and modernizing the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p>In 2018, McClintock defeated Democratic challenger Jessica Morse by eight percentage points, 54% to 46%, in the general election.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p>California's <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CA/4\">4th Congressional District</a> is located in an entirely inland part of east-central California, stretching down from Truckee and South Lake Tahoe in Northern California down to the area outside of Fresno.&#160;</p><p>It is home to all of the counties of Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, El Dorado, Mariposa, and Tuolumne as well as parts of Placer, Fresno, Madera, and Nevada counties. The district is home to some of California's finest scenery and natural beauty, containing the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Sequoia National Forest.</p><p>In the 2016 presidential election, the 4th District voted for Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in a 54-39 percentage point split of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts\">according to the Daily Kos</a>.</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>Kennedy has narrowly outraised and outspent McClintock, according to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=CA04CA04\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. Kennedy has brought in $1.4 million, spent $1.1 million, and has over $356,000 in cash on hand. McClintock has raised $1.35 million, spent $932,000, and currently has about $646,000 left to spend as the November election approaches.&#160;</p><h2>What experts say</h2><p>The race between McClintock and Kennedy is rated as \"safe Republican\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a> and \"likely Republican\" by the <a

health, safety, and quality of life. One small way you can contribute to this ongoing movement is by encouraging your children to talk and think about race. My family lives in a diverse city, but I still feel day-to-day as though we are not always exposed to or doing our most to talk about diversity or racism. This is why I make sure my children's library is full of books that feature protagonists of color, so they see and hear the things that make us similar and different.</p><p>This list includes some of the books that my children — almost 2 and 5 years old — enjoy reading. Sometimes a character's background is central to the story. Other times, it's not a focus at all.</p><p>The value of representation in your child's library is substantial. These stories frequently explore salient themes like empowerment, sharing, empathy, mental health, and cultural pride. Unlike other popular children's books, the main characters in these stories are more likely to be portrayed in STEM or leadership roles. And these books give voice to authors and illustrators of color who are <a href=\"https://blog.leeandlow.com/2018/05/10/the-diversity-gap-in-childrens-book-publishing-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.leeandlow.com/2018/05/10/the-diversity-gap-in-childrens-book-publishing-2018/&source=gmail&ust=1581090025731000&usg=AFQjCNFROhfPgIxA0e-m5n9fPmFBdg-_5A9fPmFBdg-_5A\">typically underrepresented in the literary world</a>. There are 11 and 5 on this list, respectively.&#160;</p><p>The books below are diverse, informative, and vividly illustrated — all the best things a picture book for children can be. Some of the titles came into our lives organically and have been enjoyed over and over. Some are new acquisitions that were thoroughly researched based on recommendations by teachers. They were all chosen because of the beauty of their characters, inside and out.

Texas' 2nd Congressional District, located in the Houston area.&#160;</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL and congressional staffer, won the 2018 election to replace former <strong>Rep. Ted Poe.&#160;</strong></p><p>Crenshaw is a native Houstonian who served in Afghanistan as a Lieutenant Commander on SEAL Team 3 and was wounded in action in Afghanistan, losing all vision in his right eye and having his sight in his left eye severely damaged. After a tough recovery, Crenshaw completed two more deployments with the SEALs before retiring in 2016, receiving a Purple Heart and numerous other awards.&#160;</p><p>In Congress, Crenshaw serves on the powerful House Budget and House Homeland Security Committees. He's also a staunch conservative and ally of President Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://crenshawforcongress.com/policies_issues/\">with his campaign platform</a> emphasizing protecting gun rights, border security, and promoting free-market economic and healthcare policies.&#160;</p><p>Crenshaw is widely considered a rising star in the Republican party. An adept user of social media, he boasts approximately 3.5 million followers between his Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts, is the author of \"Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage,\" and recently spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention.&#160;</p><p>Ladjevardian immigrated to the United States from Iran as a child, is an attorney, breast cancer survivor, and Democratic political strategist. She worked as a Senior Advisor and the Finance Chair for former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's 2018 US Senate campaign against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.&#160;</p><p>Her <a href=\"https://www.simafortx.com/issues\">campaign platform</a> highlights expanding access to affordable healthcare, including creating a public option to allow Americans to buy into Medicare, combatting climate change and protecting the Houston area from flooding, and improving the US immigration system.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/TX/2\">Located entirely within Harris County</a>, the 2nd district snakes around the city of Houston from the suburbs northeast of the city, including Kingwood, Humble, and Spring, and then hooks down to encompass some of the areas in western and downtown Houston, including the neighborhood where Rice University is located.&#160;</p><p>The district has shown signs of trending towards Democrats in the past several cycles.</p><p>The district, under its current lines, voted for 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney by a margin of 27 percentage points, 63% to 36%, but voted for Trump in 2016 by a considerably smaller margin of nine points, 52% to 43%, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections\">according to the Daily Kos</a>, making it the only Houston-area district to vote for Trump.&#160;</p><p>And in 2018, Cruz carried the district by a margin of just one percentage point, 50% to 49%, over O'Rourke <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W_GTNylAZfboZkDeMsJPGlir3aQB64SzlVHjY9Xdnkk/edit#gid=562073942\">in his reelection campaign that&#160;</a>year as Crenshaw won his first election by seven points over his Democratic opponent.&#160;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Sima Ladjevardian  (@SimaforTX) <a
