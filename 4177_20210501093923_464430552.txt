Still, planning a road trip with charge stops on route can feel like solving a puzzle. With an EV, you need to find recharging stations within range that also have your specific plug type and can recharge you as quickly as you need. </p><p>To take the guesswork out of trip planning and recharging, we’re rolling out three new features for EVs with Google Maps built in.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Taking the stress out of EV route planning<br/></h2><p>Newly developed <a href=\"http://ai.googleblog.com/2021/01/addressing-range-anxiety-with-smart.html\">routing algorithms</a> that use a type of math called graph theory serve up stress-free routes and charging stop recommendations in the latest release of Google Maps that’s built into participating EVs, including the Polestar 2 and Volvo XC40 Recharge. </p><p>Now when you enter a destination that requires two or more recharge stops, algorithms in Maps will search and filter through tens to thousands of public charging stations to find the most efficient route — all in less than 10 seconds. You can see how long each charge will take and your updated total trip time, so your final ETA will never again be a mystery.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Image of Google Maps built in to an electric vehicle showing that you can add a stop to charge the vehicle on route to Yosemite Falls Trailhead.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/dc_v6_full_size.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p> Add a charging stop to your route before you start your journey.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Hit the road with confidence</h2><p>For shorter trips where only one charge is needed, like a Saturday hike or weekend getaway, you can select a charging station that best fits your needs from a list of recharge points in Google Maps.</p><p>You can see which charging stations are the fastest and select specific stations if you have a membership.
