The new wireless MAX Mini, developed for pediatric, orthopedic, and trauma applications, is 10 x 14 x 0.6&#8243; in size and weighs 3.5 lbs.  Finally, a static 17 x 17” MAX is a general purpose detector that can be used for a wide variety of exam types and patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help clinicians achieve optimal images with minimal frustration and effort, features such as MAXalign display the live detector angle making X-ray tube alignment quick and easy. Siemens believes this can help prevent unnecessary radiation exposure, keeping patients safer and lowering the associated costs of longer exams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The on-board touch display that&#8217;s right on the X-ray tube provides all the important information on one screen and tunable parameters can be changed quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ysio Max&#8217;s smaller wireless detectors noted above can be used with existing Siemens radiography, fluoroscopy, and urology systems such as the Luminos dRF Max, Luminos Agile Max, and UROSKOP Omnia Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500798\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO-252x300.png 252w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO-768x914.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/news/fda-clears-ysio-max-digi-radiography-02-26-2014.html\">Siemens</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=jvpa-iOGeJ0:tA43w5MvQxE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=jvpa-iOGeJ0:tA43w5MvQxE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=jvpa-iOGeJ0:tA43w5MvQxE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=jvpa-iOGeJ0:tA43w5MvQxE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/jvpa-iOGeJ0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 18:05:38 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO-2.jpg","linkMd5":"09f6df068833a19836659a0d20fd8acd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn31@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-23-522_94488d651ede6526.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":617,"sourceBytes":155079,"destBytes":27068,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn31@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-23-522_94488d651ede6526.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YSIO.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-06-147_c01f35625d1fc980.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-58-624_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-43-922_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=jvpa-iOGeJ0:tA43w5MvQxE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn43@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-43-989_9693493ce6db9f4a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/jvpa-iOGeJ0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn12@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-43-987_4a9b6ed0b3cebcf5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817603132},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","title":"Smartphone Test for Quick Stroke Diagnosis","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1500786","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stroke-screening.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500791\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stroke-screening.jpg 730w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stroke-screening-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Penn State and Houston Methodist Hospital have developed a tool to aid doctors in rapidly diagnosing strokes. The technology uses a smartphone to record a patient’s speech and facial movements, and a machine-learning algorithm then processes these data to identify whether a stroke probably occured. The researchers have shown that their system is as accurate as an ER clinician in diagnosing stroke, and that it can provide accurate answers within minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screening-app-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500795\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screening-app-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screening-app-1-211x300.jpg 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When a patient experiences symptoms of a stroke, every minute counts,&#8221; said James Wang, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;But when it comes to diagnosing a stroke, emergency room physicians have limited options: send the patient for often expensive and time-consuming radioactivity-based scans or call a neurologist – a specialist who may not be immediately available – to perform clinical diagnostic tests.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapidly diagnosing and beginning treatment for a stroke is vitally important to limit long-term damage. However, in some cases, the subtle signs can be missed by clinicians, meaning that treatment is delayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are millions of neurons dying every minute during a stroke,&#8221; said John Volpi, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;In severe strokes it is obvious to our providers from the moment the patient enters the emergency department, but studies suggest that in the majority of strokes, which have mild to moderate symptoms, that a diagnosis can be delayed by hours and by then a patient may not be eligible for the best possible treatments.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new system involves using a smartphone to record someone with a suspected stroke and observe their facial movements. It is designed to detect things that may indicate a stroke, such as slurred words or a drooping facial muscle. To allow the system to do this, the researchers trained the machine learning algorithm, powering it using a dataset of over 80 patients who were experiencing stroke symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have shown that their technology is approximately 79% accurate in diagnosing stroke, which is similar to the accuracy of ER doctors. As the system takes only a few minutes to provide an answer, it may prove to be a useful addition to the ER doctor’s toolset. Moreover, if a larger dataset is used to train the system, it may be possible to achieve an even greater degree of accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research was presented at the virtual <a href=\"https://www.miccai2020.org/en/\">International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)</a> under the title &#8220;Toward Rapid Stroke Diagnosis with Multimodal Deep Learning.&#8221;<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.psu.edu/story/636014/2020/10/20/research/new-tool-can-diagnose-strokes-smartphone\">Penn State</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=M0UnSHYrvpc:MuQz6eXPNwA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=M0UnSHYrvpc:MuQz6eXPNwA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=M0UnSHYrvpc:MuQz6eXPNwA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=M0UnSHYrvpc:MuQz6eXPNwA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/M0UnSHYrvpc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 15:01:19 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stroke-screening.jpg","linkMd5":"a2b099afbde29abe113f24703cf6c3d1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-42-400_ac7f61cb8a699c71.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":548,"sourceBytes":203191,"destBytes":46938,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stroke-screening.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-42-400_ac7f61cb8a699c71.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screening-app-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-43-959_0f608b98ea2c6a6a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-58-624_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-43-922_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=M0UnSHYrvpc:MuQz6eXPNwA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-44-237_2297c021e8bc5163.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/M0UnSHYrvpc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-43-894_3ebcd234564ff668.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817603133},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","title":"Flexible Skin Sensor to Help ALS Patients Communicate","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1500687","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sensor-als.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500699\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sensor-als.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sensor-als-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sensor-als-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at MIT have developed a wearable sensor that can detect small deformations of the skin, potentially serving as a way to help amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients to communicate through facial movements. The low-cost sensors are much cheaper and may be more effective than current assistive communication technologies for ALS patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canan Dagdeviren, the lead researcher on the project, and who has been <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2019/07/decoding-physical-patterns-of-our-bodies-via-conformable-devices-interview-with-canan-dagdeviren-mit.html\">previously interviewed by <em>Medgadget</em></a>, became inspired to develop technology to assist those with ALS to communicate after meeting Professor Stephen Hawking in 2016, and noting that the technology he used to communicate was not optimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/als-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500700\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/als-sensor.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/als-sensor-300x218.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Hawking, who passed away in 2018, used an infrared sensor to detect twitches in his cheek, which he used to select letters on a computer screen. The method worked, but was slow. Other techniques involve measuring the activity of the facial nerves in ALS patients, but these can suffer from poor accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These devices are very hard, planar, and boxy, and reliability is a big issue,” said Dagdeviren. “You may not get consistent results, even from the same patients within the same day.” To address these issues, Dagdeviren and colleagues have designed a simpler system that relies on a wearable skin-like sensor that an ALS patient can wear on their face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wearable includes a silicone film that contains four piezoelectric sensors. The sensors can detect deformation of the underlying skin and convert this to an electrical signal. This could mean that gentle facial expressions, such as a smile or twitch, could be registered as specific messages, such as “I’m hungry”. These facial movements, alone or in combination, could correspond to a library of phrases, aiding rapid communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We can create customizable messages based on the movements that you can do,&#8221; said Dagdeviren. &#8220;You can technically create thousands of messages that right now no other technology is available to do. It all depends on your library configuration, which can be designed for a particular patient or group of patients.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video about the project below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"conformable Facial Code Extrapolation Sensor (cFaCES)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkzsVW9VT6s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00612-w\">Decoding of facial strains via conformable piezoelectric interfaces</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/sensor-als-communicate-1022\">MIT</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=n4meSEIaUDw:QQCyRNMXUeU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=n4meSEIaUDw:QQCyRNMXUeU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=n4meSEIaUDw:QQCyRNMXUeU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=n4meSEIaUDw:QQCyRNMXUeU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/n4meSEIaUDw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 14:31:02 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sensor-als.jpg","linkMd5":"b05682f6c8399301f6e1abaaabeddc54","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-28-497_d4611d483bfdb015.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":301095,"destBytes":28050,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sensor-als.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-28-497_d4611d483bfdb015.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/als-sensor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn54@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-43-992_0b9f7ff734712021.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-58-624_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-43-922_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=n4meSEIaUDw:QQCyRNMXUeU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn24@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-44-070_8c09f3c6d81c3779.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/n4meSEIaUDw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn48@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-43-793_fbd0ba29d4fb10fb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817603133},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","title":"Stryker Unveils Wireless Hospital Bed with Smart Monitoring Features","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1500586","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-bed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500587\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-bed.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-bed-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-bed-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stryker has announced a new completely wireless hospital bed that sports a number of smart patient monitoring features. The ProCuity, which is actually a series of beds that have somewhat varying capabilities, was developed to minimize patient falls, help clinicians to efficiently monitor those that are bedridden, and to maintain connectivity when the bed is on the move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ProCuity beds include Stryker&#8217;s Secure Connect technology that provides a wireless way to connect to nurse call systems. When connected, the beds will stream parameters such as bed configuration, including the position of side rails, exit alarms, and movement to hospital information systems so that important events can be noticed and recorded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients get the benefit of a USB port and cradle, built into the bedside, so that they can use their mobile phones and tablets without worrying about power and where to store the devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-on-patient-bed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500589\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-on-patient-bed.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-on-patient-bed-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>“Patient safety is at the foundation of everything we do at Stryker. With rising acuity rates leading to increased bed demand, coupled with the continuing challenge of in-hospital falls, we needed to find a solution to further enhance our response to some of today’s most pressing healthcare challenges,” said Jessica Mathieson, VP/GM of Acute Care, Stryker, in the announcement. “Leveraging our long history in innovation, ProCuity is the culmination of years of extensive research and feedback from nurses and other healthcare professionals to create what is truly a ‘brilliance in a bed’ solution. It was designed to improve patient outcomes and assist caregivers for years to come.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beds are set at 11.5 inches off the ground, a notably low height for hospital beds. Secure Assist side rails help patients to get in and out, and once the rails are up they stay out of the way so that they minimize interference with other equipment nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To monitor patients, the ProCuity relies on load cell technology to measure patient weight and notify clinicians if there&#8217;s unusual movement or positioning, or if the patient has left the bed altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The higher end models of the ProCuity bed series include a powered fifth wheel and a motorcycle-like throttle for intuitive navigation of the bed through a hospital. There are even electric brakes that help to maintain safety. Perhaps there will be bed racing leagues forming soon in hospitals throughout the land.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500588\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-300x86.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-768x220.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Product info page: <a href=\"https://www.stryker.com/us/en/acute-care/products/procuity/index.html\">ProCuity bed series&#8230;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/news/2020/stryker-launches-industry-s-first-completely-wireless-hospital-b.html\">Stryker</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=srBU6HHvbAA:NxPo_TMJVBw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=srBU6HHvbAA:NxPo_TMJVBw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=srBU6HHvbAA:NxPo_TMJVBw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=srBU6HHvbAA:NxPo_TMJVBw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/srBU6HHvbAA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:22:35 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-bed.jpg","linkMd5":"09f39071efb180dab5bed225dba1c1ec","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-23-501_7711e77652a329c8.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":511,"sourceBytes":163444,"destBytes":30792,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour-bed.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-23-501_7711e77652a329c8.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-on-patient-bed.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn71@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-44-033_608207c999f19b0a.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IsoTour.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-44-021_a8aed5019e8398ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-58-624_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-43-922_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=srBU6HHvbAA:NxPo_TMJVBw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-44-061_1c53ac115d95e8f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/srBU6HHvbAA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-43-788_73e85467d2460a77.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817603132},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:23","title":"High Resolution Ultrasound for Precise Tumor Ablation","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1500398","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ultrasound-projector.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500433\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ultrasound-projector.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ultrasound-projector-300x199.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ultrasound-projector-768x511.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the Max Planck Institute and the University of Stuttgart in Germany have developed a method to create high-resolution ultrasound fields, a capability which may improve the effectiveness of ultrasound therapies and tailor them for individual patients. The technique involves passing ultrasonic waves through water, where hydrogen bubbles help to transform the waves into desired shapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-power ultrasound therapy is currently used to destroy tumor tissues, including prostate and uterine tumors. However, the technique can also damage healthy tissue, since it generates a great deal of heat, so the ultrasound field must be tightly controlled to restrict it to the tumor as much as possible. This is particularly difficult for brain tumors, as the skull distorts the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current methods to control ultrasound fields involve creating several individual sound sources, which are then shifted to strengthen or weaken each other. However, this technique is limited and can only produce about 1,000 pixels. The newly invented approach, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18347-2\">published </a>in journal <em>Nature Communications</em>, can generate as many as 10,000 individual pixels. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A-and-B.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500435\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A-and-B.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A-and-B-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A-and-B-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In order to modulate the sound pressure profile, we take advantage of the different acoustic properties of water and air,&#8221; said Zhichao Ma, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;While an ultrasonic wave passes through a liquid unhindered, it is completely reflected by air bubbles&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers developed a thumbnail-sized chip on which they can split water to form hydrogen bubbles in a specific pattern. They can then send an ultrasonic wave through the chip, and when it encounters the bubbles it transforms to form a desired shape. Creating a different profile is as simple as wiping the hydrogen bubbles away and producing a different pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In this way, we can use much more powerful ultrasonic transducers&#8221;, said Kai Melde, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;Thanks to a chip with 10,000 pixels that modulates the ultrasonic wave, we can generate a much finer-resolved profile.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers have demonstrated the precision of their new system by arranging microparticles into different letters.
