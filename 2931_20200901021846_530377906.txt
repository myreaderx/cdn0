And, they're also the most affordable ones we've found (and enjoyed).</h3><p>I didn't love every flavor of these pods, but after tasting almost all of them, I was delightfully surprised by several. We all have different tastes, and it's hard to pin down any single brew, blend, or flavor for all, but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EIA2YXI/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=62&#38;imprToken=d8ba22e2-65b5-689f-441&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_011119_best-espresso-pods-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01EIA2YXI&#38;linkId=ab1ad3615e76351baf568e631d49f6fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Bestpresso</a> was able to delight my picky palate, which is no small feat.

Because coffee doesn't require pressure to brew, a loosely-filled mesh pod will do the trick. You could probably make one yourself without much hassle, but then <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LGEKOMS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipg_011119_best-espresso-pods-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00LGEKOMS&#38;linkId=7aa378ab0b29433cc1560942ca2afcc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">IParts Plus More Coffee</a> has four-packs on offer for about $10, which is worth saving your time fiddling with wire and pliers on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>This is the answer for just about any coffee-lover who wants a pod machine. You're not beholden to whichever companies produce Keurig-machine-specific pods for their own coffee. And while packing espresso pods for Nespresso machines is a meticulous exercise, you can just pile a couple of spoons-full of coarse grounds into these reusable K-Cups without much attention because their only job is to facilitate steeping.</p><p>The beauty of these contraptions is their simplicity &#8212; not a whole lot can go wrong with them &#8212; and pods, whether they're espresso or coffee, are not cheap.

Those of us who don't have enough time to make a coffee in the first place is not likely to be the ones taking time out of the day or week to hit FedEx or UPS on the way to work or school.

The company charges you $15 for a recycling kit, which comes with a prepaid (by you) shipping label. If you're a member of Illy Casa (a pod delivery service), the recycling is included, but it's an expensive commitment in and of itself, and if you're not set on having at least a capsule a day, it's probably not worth it unless you have a lot of spare storage. Someone has, it turns out, ingeniously discovered that you can open and reuse an Illy capsule with a can opener.

<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-slams-ex-ceo-steve-easterbrook-motion-to-dismiss-lawsuit-2020-8\">as the fast-food giant sues it ex-CEO Steve Easterbrook.&#160;</a></p><p>According to notes from the town hall viewed by Business Insider, McDonald's head of HR Heidi Capozzi said that she and CEO Chris Kempczinski are committed \"to the idea of transparency.\" While Capozzi said she is limited in some ways due to privacy concerns, she could share that Fairhurst was fired for cause based on an internal investigation.&#160;</p><p>Fairhurst was fired after making female McDonald's employees feel \"uncomfortable on numerous occasions at business events,\" Capozzi said during the meeting as first reported by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-hr-chief-a-focus-of-mcdonalds-investigation-11598824305\">The Wall Street Journal,</a>&#160;</p><p>Fairhurst left McDonald's in November, shortly after Easterbrook was terminated by the company.&#160;</p><p>Easterbrook and Fairhurst both started their careers in McDonald's UK office. Both were known for drinking with McDonald's employees after work, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-looks-beyond-party-culture-11578243600\">reported</a> in January.</p><p>Stories about Fairhurst drinking with employees &#8212; including younger female staffers &#8212; sparked rumors and ethical concerns, current and former employees and franchisees told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>One holiday party in late 2018 prompted an investigation into Fairhurst's behavior. The head of HR was spotted pulling a female employee onto his lap, internal sources told Business Insider. The Journal reports that McDonald's investigated the incident, ultimately telling employees that such excessive drinking was inappropriate.</p><p>Fairhurst did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. McDonald's declined to comment further on Fairhurst's exit.&#160;</p><h2>When the head of HR is misbehaving, how can employees report concerns?&#160;</h2><p>Personal experiences as well as recent reporting about Fairhurst have made current and former McDonald's employees and franchisees question the work of McDonald's HR department in recent years.&#160;</p><p>A former franchisee questioned how McDonald's HR team could have carried out corporate restructuring in a fair manner when the department was led by Fairhurst.</p><p>The Journal recently <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-probe-into-ex-ceo-investigates-hr-department-cover-ups-11598398673?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">reported</a> some former employees said HR leaders under Fairhurst ignored internal complaints, and that employees feared retaliation if they reported others' actions to HR. These reports of misconduct, a former franchisee told Business Insider, now color his view of McDonald's 2018 corporate restructuring.&#160;</p><p>One former corporate staffer told Business Insider he was disturbed by what he saw as Fairhurst's \"gross and dirty\" behavior while drinking, which he saw first hand. If the head of HR was getting drunk with female staffers, he asked, how could anyone expect HR complaints to be taken seriously?&#160;</p><p>A current corporate employee said that, while Fairhurst was known for partying with subordinates several levels below him at the company, it was seen as more \"sad\" than \"gross.\" Prior to his departure, he was widely respected within the company, she said, even if he was seen as a bit pompous. This employee said she was not worried about Fairhurst's behavior impeding HR reports, in part because it would be rare for Fairhurst to handle a complaint alone.&#160;</p><p>\"We just thought he was a sad man who drank too much and weirdly didn't have friends outside of people who worked for him,\" she said.&#160;</p><h2>Executive shakeups continue on McDonald's HR team</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dc03531e0ee7e45eb2be925?format=jpeg\" alt=\"McDonald&#39;s CEO Steve Easterbrook\" height=\"1334\" width=\"1778\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>McDonald&#39;s ex-CEO Steve Easterbrook.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Concerns about McDonald's HR department carry extra weight as<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-slams-ex-ceo-steve-easterbrook-motion-to-dismiss-lawsuit-2020-8\"> McDonald's recently filed a lawsuit claiming that Easterbrook</a> engaged in multiple sexual relationships with employees during his time as CEO.&#160;</p><p>McDonald's sued Easterbrook earlier in August, claiming the CEO covered up sexual relationships with three employees at McDonald's during his last year leading the company. According to McDonald's complaint, investigators found dozens of sexually explicit photos of these employees attached to an email Easterbrook sent himself, after receiving an anonymous tip in July.&#160;</p><p>McDonald's terminated Easterbrook \"without cause\" in November 2019, after investigating a consensual relationship between the CEO and another female staffer.</p><p>Investigators said McDonald's did not know of any other inappropriate relationships at the time and that Easterbrook denied having sexual relationships with other employees. The company is now suing Easterbrook to claw back his multi-million dollar severance package.</p><p>McDonald's said last week it is also investigating if Easterbrook covered up other executives' misconduct, as well as allegations into the HR department during Easterbrook's time as CEO. McDonald's said in a statement that, \"The Board will follow the facts wherever they may lead.\"&#160;</p><p>McDonald's announced in March that Heidi Capozzi, formerly head of HR at Boeing Company, would replace Fairhurst as the new global chief people officer.&#160;</p><p>Melissa Kersey, who served as the&#160;head of HR in the US, left the company in late June. With Kersey's departure, McDonald's announced Melanie Steinbach would be promoted to the position of chief people officer in the US and Shammara Howell would take Steinbach's place as chief talent officer.</p><p>A month after she was promoted to the head of US HR and shortly after McDonald's filed its lawsuit against Easterbrook, Steinbach abruptly parted ways with the company. Prior to her departure earlier in August, her corporate email auto-reply indicated she was on \"medical leave.\" She did not respond to Business Insider's multiple requests for comment. McDonald's declined to comment on her departure.&#160;</p><p>Capozzi began a \"top-to-bottom\" review of the HR department after starting a global chief people officer in April, according to an executive.</p><p>When McDonald's filed its lawsuit against Easterbrook, Capozzi sent out a reminder on how employees can report \"concerns about behavior that is not in line with our values,\" according to a message viewed by Business Insider. In last week's town hall, Capozzi again told employees to share any concerns they might have and that the company has policies to prevent discrimination.&#160;</p><p><em>If you work or worked at

out the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-golf-clubs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right clubs</a>, choosing which golf ball to use for a day spent on the links is an important decision &#8212; and not all are created equal.</strong></li><li><strong>Whether you're just learning the game of golf or have several years of the sport under your belt, you'll want to make sure you find a ball suited to your play style and preference &#8212; and just because you like the balls the pros use on the weekends, doesn't mean you'll have the same outcome they do.&#160;</strong></li><li><strong>To help, we've tested a variety of the top golf balls currently available from brands like Titleist, TaylorMade, and Callaway to find the best for a variety of golfers.&#160;</strong></li><li><strong>Our top pick, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2HW4X7i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Titleist Tour Soft golf ball</a>, delivers outstanding performance and feel, and has a distance that'll work nicely for any mid- to low-handicap players.</strong></li></ul><p>One of the best things about the game of golf is that you can test yourself on many of the same courses and hole distances the pros you watch on television play. Better yet, you're even able to use some of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-golf-shoes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">same equipment</a> they use to make the weekend cut.&#160;</p><p>Of course, once you take a look at the cost of some of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-golf-driver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the drivers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-golf-irons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">irons</a> the pros use, you may want to seek out a cheaper way of copying your favorite pro's game. One way to do that is to pick up a pack of the same golf balls they use. No matter if it's Tiger's signature Bridgestone ball or Jordan Spieth's Titelists, picking up a pack of the same brand or style takes little more than a simple Google search.</p><p>And perhaps the golf skill to pull off using a ball intended for elite golfers.&#160;</p><h3>How to shop for golf balls</h3><p>Even though it may feel cool to use the same ball as whoever just won the Masters, you're highly unlikely to receive the same performance from that pro-level golf ball as the pro does. Pro-level balls react differently to the skills professional players have versus the talent of the occasional weekend golfer's skill level.&#160;</p><p>This means that those balls are often fine-tuned to respond exactly as that golfer sees fit. If they favor a fade shot while driving on the fairway, then a golfer who tends to draw will likely have a far different experience. The contact sweet spot which allows for greater driving distances can also be much smaller which may produce more off-the-mark strikes for less accurate golfers.&#160;</p><p>But even if you aren't yet cut out for the PGA Tour, it doesn't mean you have to ditch seeking out your favorite golfer's preferred ball altogether. Different levels of golf balls are available to meet the needs of different players, both in terms of skill and in terms of price.

The rubber has a different consistency and thickness in each layer, too. Balls with more layers tend to cost more, as they're aimed at experienced players looking to gain more spin control. Designers can affect the distance and spin of the ball by making slight adjustments to the layers.&#160;</li><li><strong>Spin: </strong>The design of the ball can lead to a high, average, or low level of spin. Balls that generate more spin off the clubface give low-handicap golfer more control around the green. Such balls typically have more layers but with a higher level of spin, mis-hit balls can slice or hook more severely than low-spin balls, which are aimed at beginning players.</li></ul><p>Most golf balls are white, but you also can find bright yellow, orange, and pink golf balls.&#160;Color doesn't really affect the performance of the ball, but some people find it easier to follow the track of a yellow or orange ball in the sky.</p><p>You also may have an easier time finding a brightly colored ball in the rough or in the trees versus a white ball, should you spend a lot of your golf round in those areas.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-golf-ball'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

They both use an LED mouthpiece to reportedly act as a catalyst for hydrogen peroxide, but SmileDirectClub is a better value at half the cost. We still recommend strips over gel and mouth trays over LED light options, though.</li></ul>\n\tCommon FAQs about teeth whitening\n\t\n\t<h3>What types of teeth whitening products exist?</h3><p>There are essentially two types of kits: ones that bleach your teeth to take stains off and ones that physically scrape off the stains. Whitening trays and strips have been the standard for decades and generally rely on carbamide or hydrogen peroxide. Activated charcoal powders had a spike in popularity recently, but the dentists we interviewed would tell you to nix the powders. Dr. Handschuh and Dr. Mohelicki told Business Insider that they don't recommend these because they can be abrasive and only remove surface stains.&#160;</p><p>There is a third type of teeth whitening product that simply blasts your teeth with LED light, which typically claims to speed up the process and achieve more intense results. However, most of the dentists we interviewed agreed that any gains from this treatment are short-lived or nonexistent. \"Most studies show some difference detected by computers, but no visual difference detected by the human eye. For the studies conducted in actual patients (in vivo), most found no added benefit for light-activated systems,\" says Dr. Sutera.</p><p>Only the SmileDirectClub system in our guide uses this technology, but it is used in conjunction with a whitening gel and a mouthguard that may offer better control over your placement and avoid increased gum sensitivity in comparison to strips.&#160;</p><h3>Which teeth whitening products are most effective?</h3><p>\"Shopping for teeth whitening products is very simple.\" Dr. Sutera explained. \"There is only one active ingredient in all teeth whitening products: hydrogen peroxide. It's the same agent whether it's prescription use or over the counter. Any other ingredients in the product are inactive fillers needed to create the right consistency of the product.\" If you see carbamide peroxide on your ingredient list, it's just a derivative of hydrogen peroxide.&#160;</p><p>\"The key is to understand that whitening can be effective at any percentage, but what differs is the time of use. A high percentage of hydrogen peroxide typically is only kept on the teeth for 20 minutes maximum, while a lower percentage can be worn for 6 hours or overnight.\" Dr. Sutera explains. \"Much of the selection comes down to personal preference. If you have a tendency to develop tooth sensitivity or if you want to minimize the risks of irritating your gums, that's when you'd select a lower concentration.\"</p><h3>A few warnings about teeth whitening kits</h3><p>Peroxide is effective, but it comes with several warnings. Pregnant or nursing women may want to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/revamp-your-pregnancy-beauty-regimen#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stop using peroxide-based whitening products</a>. It also isn't suitable for children under 14 years old. And, you should not use peroxide for longer than two weeks of daily use without the supervision of a dentist.</p><p>The FDA does not recommend using any whitening gels with a peroxide concentration of higher than 18%. Two of the kits we recommend use peroxide (Crest Whitestrips and SmileDirectClub) but they should be safe for most people.</p><p>Again, you should always consult with your dentist before starting a course of treatment. For instance, if your darkened teeth are due to the natural thinning of tooth enamel that comes with aging, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/tooth-whitening-at-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whitening kits will not help you</a>. Also, they cannot whiten fillings, dentures, veneers, crowns, or caps.</p><p>Most importantly, Dr. Mohelicki says the biggest concern is wearing whitening kits for the right amount of time. \"Over-the-counter options are inexpensive when compared to in-office whitening, but they offer no gum protection. With no gum protection, users can experience increased sensitivity and even burns in severe cases.\"&#160;</p><h3>How to use teeth whitening kits effectively</h3><p>Before using a teeth whitening kit, brush your teeth so your whitening agent can make contact with the surface of your teeth to improve efficacy, and so it doesn't accidentally create an uneven white. \"Any buildup of plaque or food debris will not allow for the whitening agent to contact the tooth and therefore not allow the whitening agent to do its job,\" Dr. Campbell explained. \"You could end up with a speckled, uneven whitened appearance.\"&#160;</p><p>And, after you've whitened, try to avoid food and drinks that stain your teeth.\"I recommend that my patients stick to a 'colorless diet' just after whitening,\" Dr. Handschuh told Business Insider. \"Meaning, avoid highly-staining food and drink such as coffee, red wine, tea, sauces, etc.\" But, if you really want to, he recommends using a straw to bypass your teeth a bit.&#160;</p><p>As Dr. Sutera explained, whitening your teeth and then having a glass of red wine is like \"two people in a canoe paddling in different directions. The whitening products open the pores and clean them out. If you have coffee, tea, or red wine within 72 hours of whitening your teeth, your teeth are more likely to absorb dark stains and adversely impact your whitening results.\"</p><h3>Does teeth-whitening damage your enamel?</h3><p>\"Most studies show that whitening does not damage enamel,\" Dr. Sutera said. Though, there has been recent research that shows teeth whitening can affect proteins deeper in the tooth, though researchers are not currently sure if the damage is temporary or permanent, according to Dr. Sutera.</p><h3>How can you prevent tooth sensitivity?</h3><p>\"It is common for the majority of people to experience increased tooth sensitivity after having teeth whitening done.\" Dr. Mohelicki says. \"However, for those who already have sensitive teeth, I recommend starting out by trying a whitening toothpaste. This takes significantly longer than trying an over-the-counter product or having teeth bleached in-office, but it can be significantly less painful.\"</p><p>For whitening toothpaste, Dr. Sutera recommends patients with sensitive teeth use a toothpaste with potassium nitrate and fluoride and also use a fluoride mouth rinse. According to Dr. Sutera, potassium nitrate is the primary ingredient that helps with sensitive teeth, and fluoride a secondary option that has also been shown to help.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you have sensitive teeth and want to use a teeth whitening agent, you may just want to avoid higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. \"The suggestion I would make is to use a lower concentration of whitening agent to get their desired whitening outcome while minimizing the risk of tooth sensitivity.\" Dr. Campbell said. \"Although anecdotal, I've found that brushing with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sensodyne-Sensitivity-whitening-toothpaste-Ounce/dp/B084ZJ6541/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&#38;keywords=sensodyne&#38;qid=1595625370&#38;s=beauty&#38;sr=1-11&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_121117_best-teeth-whitening-kits-20&#38;linkId=e952e8f66dff800d6256c23e8241d37b&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Sensodyne toothpaste</a> before and after whitening has helped me avoid sensitivity.\"&#160;&#160;</p><h3>Why do you feel increased sensitivity after you whiten?</h3><p>The bleaching temporarily weakens your enamel so the bleach can pass through it and further lift those stains, explained Dr. Mohelicki. \"When [our enamel] is weakened during the bleaching treatment, many patients find that it can be hard to consume hot beverages, ice-cold beverages, or even eat certain foods. This typically wears off within 72 hours of ending treatment.\"&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

back as the Pony Express. Messenger bags are an extremely popular alternative to backpacks, partly because they can usually carry the same amount of gear, but they are easier to access since you can simply shift the bag to your side or front. I prefer it on the subway, too, for the same reason. If it's crowded, I can just shift it in front of me, rather than having to take it off and hold it.</p><p>Just like backpacks, there are lots of different designs, qualities, and price points among messenger bags, enough to fit any budget or need. We've looked at a ton of bags to find the best options, and we've narrowed them down here. Read on to check out our top picks.

This timeless bag was designed for biking, and it has an iconic, durable design with space, space, and more space.</p><p>When you open the bag, there's one huge main compartment that takes up most of the bag. There's no padded laptop pocket, no internal dividers, and nothing else to take up space. Even though the contents of that main section are less organized, there's more room for all your gear. You can use a laptop sleeve to protect your computer and pouches or other sleeves to organize smaller items.</p><p>A larger slash pocket on the front of the bag can fit a bicycle U-lock or other items, while a slightly smaller slash pocket in front of the bag closes with a zipper and sits next to a few pen and pencil pockets. The bag is large enough to carry a laptop up to 17 inches, notebooks, pens, documents, chargers, maybe a change of clothes, and just about anything else you might need.</p><p>The main compartment is lined with a removable water-resistant tarp that's held in place with velcro, in case you need to dry it later. You can actually use this as a makeshift divider, putting items between the bag's outer shell and the tarp. It's a great way to keep dirty gym clothes separate from the rest of your stuff. The outer portion of the bag is built with an abrasion-resistant fabric and comes in a ton of color options.</p><p>The shoulder strap has a seatbelt buckle so that rather than having to swing the bag over your head, you can just pull it around your body and click the buckle into place. You can keep the strap adjusted shorter, which makes it easier to carry heavy loads or ride a bike. There's also a quick-adjust strap which makes changing the length a breeze. Importantly, the strap is well-padded and very comfortable to carry.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Lots of space, comfortable to carry, very durable</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Doesn't come in multiple sizes, may be bigger than some are looking for, wouldn't work well for a formal office</p>\n\tThe best for laptops\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59949942b0e0b526008b5789?format=jpeg\" alt=\"timbuk2 command\" height=\"638\" width=\"850\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Timbuk2/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X9NVMRU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00X9NVMRU&#38;linkId=5d18fd625684c618a4a103b7767c0422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Timbuk2 Command Messenger Bag</a> is a well-designed bag that's built to manage any commute, from bicycle to subway to airplane.</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X9NVMRU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00X9NVMRU&#38;linkId=5d18fd625684c618a4a103b7767c0422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Timbuk2</a> was founded in 1989 when a San Francisco bike courier set out to design a new, efficient messenger bag. Since then, the company has perfected its original model and built a number of variations and other kinds of bags, like backpacks and luggage.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X9NVMRU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00X9NVMRU&#38;linkId=5d18fd625684c618a4a103b7767c0422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Command messenger bag</a> was built for organization. The bag is generously endowed with pockets, buckles, and zippers for all your needs. When the bag is closed, there are three side entry pockets on the front that you can still access, and each one is closed securely with zippers. One smaller pocket is felt-lined, making it perfect for a smartphone or other electronics. The largest side pocket sits behind it, and is big enough for a bicycle U-lock, a magazine or newspaper, or a tablet, while the third pocket is on the other side of the flap and fits items like a power adapter or sunglasses.</p><p>Spinning the Command around, the laptop pocket is accessible through a zipper on the back of the bag, completely isolating it from the main compartment underneath the flap. The pocket is well padded, and there's a second pocket for a tablet. You can also separate the laptop to conform with TSA standards when traveling. On the back of the bag, outside of the laptop section, a luggage handle pass-through lets you place the bag securely on top of a roller bag.</p><p>The inside of the bag is extremely organized, which is always a welcome feature for a bag you're commuting with. Interior zip pockets keep smaller items accessible, while pockets for pens, pencils, and other supplies keep the essentials handy.</p><p>There's an exterior pocket for a water bottle, which can fit just about any type of bottle. At the top of the bag, a padded handle makes carrying the bag by hand a breeze. Like many Timbuk2 bags, the shoulder strap has a quick-release buckle, which lets you lengthen and shorten the strap with one easy motion. It's a real help if you're biking or carrying a heavy bag.</p><p>The bag is lined with a weather-resistant material to keep your belongings safe whatever the day may hold. There are many color options and multiple sizes of the Command bag available, so make sure to check the dimensions to see which one you need.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Padded handle, adjustable strap, tons of pockets and organization</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Some reviewers have suggested the laptop sleeve is thinly padded</p>\n\tThe best classic messenger bag\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/599499a5b0e0b51c008b579b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Timbuk2 classic\" height=\"1364\" width=\"1819\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timbuk2/photos/a.78447976920.86686.25386426920/10154120880371921/?type=3&#38;theater\" target=\"_blank\">Timbuk2/Facebook</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Based on Timbuk2's original design, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IXT9TEM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01IXT9TEM&#38;linkId=5aa5869040998035d3a885b0b6026d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Classic Messenger Bag</a> has a traditional look with updated extras.</h3><p>That's right, we've chosen a second Timbuk2 bag for this list. With more than 25 years in the business, the brand has managed to figure some things out and design great products.</p><p>Compared to the Command bag, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IXT9TEM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01IXT9TEM&#38;linkId=5aa5869040998035d3a885b0b6026d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Classic</a> is relatively minimalist. It manages to be more compact with a simple design and it keeps more inside the bag under the flap. There's no real handle, save for a small loop of fabric in the back. Although this works for quick carrying, it's not sturdy enough for much more than picking up the bag. There's only one pocket you can access while the bag is closed. This side entry pocket has a zipper&#160;and is deep and wide enough for a few essential items like a work ID, a phone, a commuter pass, or maybe a wallet.</p><p>Once you open the bag, you'll notice that there isn't really a padded laptop pocket &#8212; rather, there's a divider running the length of the interior to bisect the main compartment into two sections. While that does create a section you can use for a laptop, you may want to put your computer in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dagne-dover-laptop-sleeve-tech-pouch-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">laptop sleeve</a> to make sure it's adequately protected.</p><p>Inside, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IXT9TEM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01IXT9TEM&#38;linkId=5aa5869040998035d3a885b0b6026d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Classic messenger bag</a> has a bunch of pockets to help organize gear and keep weight evenly distributed. An interior water bottle pocket up against one side keeps a bottle or thermos upright and in place, while a similar pocket on the other side can hold an umbrella.</p><p>A slash pocket near the front can hold relatively quick-access items like earbuds, while a zippered pocket on the outside of the bag that's covered by the flap has a key strap and hook. A hard-to-spot zippered pocket inside the bag and near the front is almost a \"secret\" compartment and has plenty of room for a wallet, a passport, or anything else you want to keep safe. Like the Command bag, the Classic also has a few pockets for pens and pencils, as well as other small office items.</p><p>The Classic is lined with weather-resistant material and has a quick-adjust shoulder strap. It also comes in a ton of colors and sizes. For cyclists, all sizes except for XS come with an optional, removable crossbody strap for added stability.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Clean, classic design, well-organized with great weight distribution, holds a lot</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Poorly padded laptop area means you should use a laptop sleeve</p>\n\tThe for the office\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59949c56b0e0b5901a8b54c8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"j Crew\" height=\"1050\" width=\"1400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">J.

The <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens_category/bags/messengers_totes/abingdon-messenger-bag/AG970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\">Abingdon Messenger</a> is built from a waxed cotton canvas with leather trim and pulls off a clean look that hides a handful of useful features.</p><p>Outside the bag on the front side, there are two mid-sized pockets which can hold any range of quick-access essentials. The bag's flap just covers the top of those pockets, which use hidden magnetic snaps to keep closed. At the back of the bag, a wide slash pocket also closes with a magnetic snap. The back pocket is perfect for a magazine or tablet &#8212; that way you can access it during a commute without opening the whole bag. Rounding out the exterior pockets are two small pouches on the sides. They seem to be designed for a rolled-up newspaper or a water bottle, but they're too narrow for most reusable ones. They work well for a compact umbrella, though.</p><p>Inside the bag, there are a few open pockets at the front &#8212; two medium-sized slip pockets can hold plenty of everyday items, with a few pockets for pens next to them. Against the rear of the main compartment, a medium-sized zippered pocket is good for loose items you want to keep more secure. A leather strap and buckle holds the bag closed, while the flap folds down and is secured by two more buckles with quick release loops. Rather than undoing the whole buckles, you can just slip the strap off a brass hook.</p><p>J.Crew has been making the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens_category/bags/messengers_totes/abingdon-messenger-bag/AG970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\">Abingdon Messenger Bag</a> for a few years and has been tweaking it since. While reviews in past years suggested that the strap could break or fray if you were carrying heavy items in the bag, J.Crew seems to have fixed that problem &#8212; I've used the bag to carry some pretty heavy stuff without any issue.</p><p>The bag is great because of its flexibility, both in terms of functionality and style. The bag is softer and less structured than many alternatives, which makes it easy to under-fill or overstuff depending on what you need for the day.</p><p>As far as style goes, the bag, which is available in two colors, is like a lot of J.Crew's clothing collection &#8212; it can dress up or dress down equally well. I've felt comfortable carrying it to a job interview while wearing a suit, as well as bringing it on&#160;an overnight trip wearing sneakers and jeans.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Stylish, functional, flexible, lately well-constructed</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: No padded laptop pocket, strap is long so can be annoying for shorter people</p>\n\tThe best leather messenger bag\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59949e55f1a8501d008b5746?format=jpeg\" alt=\"kenneth cole\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kenneth Cole Reaction/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QI2RHAU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00QI2RHAU&#38;linkId=947356f67149970041a1cb47b51883b0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Kenneth Cole Reaction Show Business Messenger Bag</a> is affordable and stylish, but it can also hold your laptop and other essentials.</h3><p>There are a lot of leather messenger bags out there, which made this category a hard one to pick. In the end, though, once I factored in price and value, it became an easy choice. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QI2RHAU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081817_best-messenger-bags-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00QI2RHAU&#38;linkId=947356f67149970041a1cb47b51883b0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Kenneth Cole Reaction Show Business bag</a>&#160;thoughtfully designed and a fantastic bag for the price.</p><p>The bag looks a little more like a traditional briefcase than some other messenger bags, but the benefit of this is a structured, protective laptop pocket. Because the bag holds its shape, you&#160;can easily carry folders and documents without worrying about them getting bent &#8212; a possibility with less-structured bags like the J.Crew Abingdon.</p><p>A front pocket runs the length of the bag and has organizer loops and pockets for pens, a cell phone, business cards, and more. There's also a zippered pocket within that section. The main pocket has the padded laptop pouch, plus two extra open-top padded pockets &#8212; these are great for a tablet or a charger. There's room left over for any other items, too. Finally, there's a full zippered section on the back of the bag. Big enough for files, folders or magazines, it can also be used as a quick-access pocket, which you can get to while the rest of the bag is closed.</p><p>The bag has a sturdy handle on top and the shoulder strap is removable, so if you ever wanted to carry it as a briefcase you have that option. The flap has two buckles with quick-release clasps so that you don't have to undo them every time you want to access the bag. It's available in four different colors and is a steal for the price.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Great laptop protection, removable shoulder strap, good for carrying folders or documents.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: More formal than most messenger bags, stiff.</p>\n\tCheck out our other great travel gear guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e629670fee23d58f316a5e4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dagne Dover Dakota\" height=\"634\" width=\"845\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dagne Dover</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best backpacks</a></h3><p>Backpacks are perfect for anyone who commutes to work every day or just tends to carry a lot of gear with them when they go out.

the 21st century is just now being formed.

Mackinder made an important observation in his book, \"Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction,\" published in 1919: While geography may not change much over time, the way people perceive and interact with it does.</p><p>Technology, economic structures, and evolving social and ideological concepts all play a major role in our interaction with the physical world. The shift from wind to coal to oil had a major impact on not only the perception of distance, but the relative importance of certain geographical locations and routes. As we work to define the 21st-century geography, it is useful to look at the past, recognizing that it is the human interaction that provides perspective and defines the significance of geography at any given time.</p><p>Writing at the close of World War I, Mackinder defined the geography of the newly dawned 20th century as one centered on the \"Heartland\" of Eurasia, and on a contest of power between that continental heartland and the insular maritime powers around its periphery.</p><p>Mackinder argued that technological innovation, particularly rail, would allow a heartland power to tie together the resources and population of what he termed the World Island (Europe, Asia and Africa). With its internal lines of communication protected from seapower, the heartland would then rally its resources to outproduce and outcompete the maritime powers.</p><p>The ambitions of Germany and the Axis powers in World War II, and the Soviet Union in the Cold War, both seemed to confirm Mackinder's assessment and thus defined the geopolitical contours of the 20th century.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5672cd572340f826018b654d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"fdr stalin churchill yalta\" height=\"2209\" width=\"2912\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference in February 1945.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/File</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The defining geographic characteristic of the 19th century was the impact of the industrial revolution on socio-economic patterns and international trade, with a surge in urbanization, the specialization of production and expanding supply lines for raw materials and markets.</p><p>But the groundwork for the global cataclysms of the 21st century was also being set in motion. Continental-maritime rivalries between the United Kingdom and Russia played out in the Great Game, and global exploration filled in much of the remaining empty space on maps, leaving little buffer space between nations.</p><p>As the century drew to a close, early signs of a future challenge to Europe's centrality were appearing. The United States shifted radically from a continentalist to an internationalist position, highlighted in the 1898 Spanish-American War, and Japan overturned the old continental order, supplanting a waning China as the central power in Asia.</p><p>We could walk back further, seeing the massive surge in trans-Atlantic trade in the 18th century as defining a new center to an emerging world system, with vast Atlantic replacing the closed Mediterranean as the central connector.</p><p>What preceded was the 17th century, defined by the Peace of Westphalia treaties and the emergence of the modern state, with sovereignty over people, economics and territory. And before that was the 16th century, which saw the emergence of the interconnected world writ large &#8212; made manifest not so much in European conquest, as perhaps in the massive Japanese invasion force trying to push through Korea at the end of the century, armed with European arquebuses in an attempt to overturn a Chinese world order.</p><h2>Influences on 21st-century geography</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/546f7e9ceab8eafa0665ad2d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"putin xi\" height=\"1956\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Russian President Vladimir Putin with Xi at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The United States and China will sit at the forefront of the 21st-century geography, with the United States remaining a traditional maritime power, as China works <a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/revisiting-geopolitics-china\">to bridge a continental and maritime role</a>. Europe and Russia will both retain power and influence, though to a lesser degree, and while they may lean toward the larger poles, they will not fall into locked alliances.</p><p>Russia may align with China, but Chinese initiatives in the Arctic, Central Asia and into the Indian Ocean and Middle East are all encroaching on areas of traditional Russian interests. While Europe and the United States may align on many issues, Europe is also increasingly integrated into transcontinental land-based trade routes and at odds with the United States on regulatory fronts, from taxation to cyberspace to environmental regulations.</p><p>The formative technologies of the 21st century will also include another shift in energy, leaving some areas less important, and others emerging as the center of resource competition, <a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/us-looks-mine-moon-its-own-terms-space-race-china-lunar-resources-exploration\">including on the seafloor and potentially in space</a>.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c0053d7dde8676d7d051cd9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump china\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Donald Trump\n<p class=\"copyright\">Andy Wong/AP Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Localized power production, whether through wind and solar or through nuclear microreactors, will open opportunities in disconnected areas, from the Arctic to the highlands of Indochina.</p><p>Agricultural sciences will further change the relationship between populations and land, adapting to changing climatic patterns and urbanization trends. Biomedical technologies will mitigate some of the demographic challenges of aging populations, overturning traditional economic models that preference the continued enlargement of labor pools.</p><p>Space will become the new battleground for competing routes of information flow, and competition will extend into the physical infrastructure and the ethereal concepts of cyberspace. Hypersonics will further decimate the impact of distance, and the expansion of autonomous weapon systems will again alter the geography of war.</p><p>This emerging geographical perspective of the 21st century is still slightly out of focus. But what is certain is that it will revolve around China and the United States, locked in competition for that pivotal position in the world system.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

But aspects of the ride-hailing experience &#8212; from arranging your pick-up location to retrieving a phone you may have left in the car &#8212; require that you be in contact with your driver even when you aren't face-to-face.&#160;</p><p>Luckily, the Uber app offers several ways to get connected before and after your trip, with a process that's exactly the same on both the iPhone and Android app.&#160;</p><p>Once you've been paired with a driver, you can send them notes through the app's message feature, or call them directly.</p><p>And if you need to get back in touch with an Uber driver after a trip has been completed, the ride-hailing company offers a way to safely and securely communicate with your driver to retrieve an item. When a driver returns an item to you, you'll be charged a $15 fee.&#160;</p><p>Here's how to contact your Uber driver before and after your trip.&#160;</p><h3><strong>Check out the products mentioned in this article:</strong></h3><h4><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?subId1=biipg_091817_best-iphone&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-11e-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iPhone 11 (From $699.99 at Apple)</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-G973-128GB-Unlocked-GSM-LTE-Phone-with-Triple-12MP-12MP-16MP-Rear-Camera-Prism-Black/104597743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Samsung Galaxy S10 (From $699.99 at Walmart)</a></h4><h2><strong>How to contact your Uber driver before your pick-up</strong></h2><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the Uber app.&#160;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Enter your destination.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Select the car type and tap Confirm.&#160;</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Confirm your pick-up location.&#160;</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Tap the bottom menu to bring up your trip menu.&#160;</p><p><strong>6.</strong> To send your driver a quick text message, tap the \"Any pickup notes?\" bar.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d4ae4d6100a2412fb4f7f25?format=jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_5050\" height=\"2208\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Before you get picked up, you can contact your Uber driver right from the app.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steven John/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>7.</strong> You can either type your own message out or select from any of the pre-written responses provided by the Uber app.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d57727ffa48002894d399?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to contact Uber driver before trip 1\" height=\"1334\" width=\"750\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Most of the pre-written responses are based on communication with your Uber drive once they&#39;ve arrived.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Abbey White/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>8.</strong> If you'd rather call your driver, you can select the phone icon.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d583160bf1f00280798e4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to contact Uber driver before trip 2\" height=\"1334\" width=\"750\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This is now to the right of the app messaging box.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Abbey White/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>9.</strong> This will bring up the automatically generated app number for your driver.

dinner every night. However, is it an enjoyable, relaxing process? Not always. He's a typical 2-year-old, and most of the time, he's begging for dinner to be ready, throwing a tantrum, and I'm exhausted by the time the food hits the table.</p><p>So when I was introduced to <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a>, a prepared meal service for kids, I was immediately intrigued. While <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-meal-kit-delivery-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meal kit services</a> have grown in popularity, kids' services have been decidedly limited. Yumble was founded in 2017&#160; by a mom of three who wanted to take the frustration out of meal planning and prepping by offering fresh, nutritious microwavable meals for kids who are 12 months to 12 years old. The meals are delivered weekly, and shipping is free.</p><p>Having dinner ready in less than 90 seconds seemed like a dream. &#160;Out of personal preference, I've never microwaved a meal for my son before, so this would be a whole new experience for us. &#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a> set me up with a one-week complimentary subscription. I ordered six meals for the week, and then served one to my son for dinner six days in a row.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tHow Yumble works\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e457f284b661b43bd299ea2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"YumbleOnline\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Yumble&#39;s weekly menu includes 20 meals that can be filtered by dietary preferences and age.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Yumble</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a> is available on the East Coast and in Texas, California, and parts of the Midwest. To start my order, I entered my email and zip code. Then I selected the six-meals plan at $7.99 per meal. There is also a 12-meals plan, which is ideal for two children, at $7.49 per meal.</p><p>After selecting the six meals plan, I picked from Yumble's weekly menu with 20 options to choose from. Most were ideal for lunch or dinner, but a breakfast and a snack option were also offered.</p><p>Each menu option included a photo of the meal and a basic description. By clicking on an item, I could also review nutritional information and ingredients in a popup window. I added items to my box by selecting the \"+\" icon.</p><p>There is also a filter to narrow down meal options, including \"gluten-free,\" \"no milk,\" \"no soy,\" \"no eggs,\" and \"vegetarian.\" Although these options exist, Yumble meals are prepared in kitchens where dairy, soy, and meat ingredients are used, so the company is unable to guarantee cross-contamination has not occurred.</p><p>Yumble does not use peanuts or tree nuts in their recipes, with the exception of coconut. But because meals are not prepared in a certified nut-free kitchen, this service is not suitable for children with nut allergies.&#160;</p><p>You can also filter by age range. Yumble said these recommendations are determined through taste tests of new menu items.</p><p>On the order page, <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Yumble</a> listed the weekday my box would be delivered via FedEx. Once I placed my order, I received delivery status updates by email. I ordered on a Thursday, and my meals were delivered the following Tuesday afternoon. Delivery days cannot be customized at this time and are determined by zip code. Depending on a carrier's guidelines, deliveries are made by 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.&#160;</p>\n\tAll meals are delivered fresh in a sustainable box for free\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e457fdd3b62b73ef402fc14?format=jpeg\" alt=\"YumbleBox\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The eco-friendly packaging keeps food at a safe temperature.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Michelle Piccolo/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The box was insulated and packed with frozen nontoxic gel packs to keep the meals at a safe temperature during transit. I was impressed by how much could be recycled since there were a lot of components of the package: The meal trays, paper sleeves, and shipping box were all recyclable. The ice packs could be reused, or snipped, drained, rinsed, and recycled. Also in the box was a place mat, set of stickers, and deck of table discussion cards.</p><p>I placed the meals in the refrigerator immediately and made sure to cook them within seven days for peak freshness, per Yumble's instructions. The company advises against freezing meals as they may not taste as fresh.</p>\n\tHow to prepare the meals\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e4580742dae5c450c155146?format=jpeg\" alt=\"YumbleFood\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>I heated each meal in the microwave for 90 seconds, but they can also be warmed up in the stove using an oven-safe dish.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Michelle Piccolo/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a> kids' meals come fully prepared and can be eaten cold, at room temperature, or heated in their microwave-safe containers within 45 to 90 seconds.&#160;</p><p>I normally cook or warm my son's food on the stove. If you prefer to heat one of the meals in the oven, <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a>&#160;said you can transfer the meal components to an oven-safe dish and heat at 350 degrees for 8 to 15 minutes. But at 15 minutes, I could just make a homemade dinner after having already done some weekend meal prep work.&#160;I opted to really test Yumble the way it is intended.&#160;</p><p>On our first day, we came home from a playdate and I popped one of the meals in the microwave, then transferred it to my son's favorite dinner plate. He was ready to eat in less than two minutes. You could always cut down on cleanup and serve the meal in its food tray, but <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/munchkin-raise-toddler-fork-spoon-set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">my son is particular about what he eats from</a>.</p><p>That weekend, he stayed with my parents, and it was nice to send two of the meals with him so they wouldn't have to cook as many meals for him.</p><p>My only issue with the prep was that the plastic wrap on top of each meal was very hard to pull off. By the end of the week, I resorted to cutting it off with a knife. My mother had the same experience with the two meals she prepared.</p>\n\tSome hits and misses with our menu selection\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e4580e82dae5c45b20613c3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"YumbleTrays\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The meals I selected included vegetarian, gluten-free, and organic options.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Michelle Piccolo/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Out of the available options, we tried the following <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble meals</a>:</p><ul><li>Pizza Pocket and Broccoli Parm: vegetarian pizza empanada with parmesan-sprinkled broccoli</li><li>Creamy Mac N Trees: gluten-free mac and cheese with parmesan broccoli</li><li>Daisy Bolognesy: cheese ravioli with vegetable and beef bolognese</li><li>Chick N Casserole: organic chicken meatballs, wheat pasta, broccoli, and cheese</li><li>Chicken Marinara and Alfredo: gluten-free chicken nuggets and pasta</li><li>Chili Mac: vegetarian chili with gluten-free mac and cheese</li></ul><p>For the most part, my son ate everything except the Daisy Bolognesy. He didn't touch it, but he is going through a picky phase with sauce, so that could have been the reason.</p><p>The Pizza Pocket was extremely doughy and almost tasted raw, but I was pleased with the chicken nuggets and meatballs. They had good flavor and texture. The pasta wasn't mushy, and the chili had good flavor. I thought the broccoli was okay. I prefer the taste of roasted broccoli, so this wasn't something I loved, but my son ate a little bit of it.</p><p>Overall, my son ate about half of each meal (each is a pretty healthy serving), his favorite being the Chicken Marinara and Alfredo. I typically make him a main dish with two sides that he usually finishes, and there was no problem here not having enough food to give him for dinner.</p>\n\tNotes on ingredients and nutrition\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e710c97c4854074fb7d1336?format=jpeg\" alt=\"chicken marina alfredo yumble\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Yumble recipes are reviewed by a childhood nutritionist.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Yumble</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>I was happy to read that <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a> chooses a variety of seasonal, fresh, and natural ingredients when making their meals. Organic foods are used whenever possible and noted on the ingredients list when applicable. Yumble also strives to use humanely raised, antibiotic- and hormone-free meats and is transparent about which meals include those.</p><p>The recipes are designed by an in-house professional chef and youth nutrition specialist and are reviewed by a childhood nutritionist and nutritional consultant, according to Yumble. Through taste tests with local families (both customers and non-customers), it gathers feedback on the look, smell, and taste of its meals before launching. It also monitors customer's meal ratings to remove options from the website that don't score well.&#160;</p><p>When reviewing the nutritional information for the meals I received, the sodium levels in some of the meals stood out &#8212; the highest from what I ordered was the Chicken Marinara and Alfredo (690 mg) and the Chili Mac (740mg). I try to pay attention to the amount of sodium and sugar in my son's foods and checked with an expert about these levels.</p><p>\"[S]odium is often added to enhance palatability and extend shelf-life,\" said Malina Malkani, a registered dietitian nutritionist and media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Malkani noted that dietary reference intakes for sodium for kids are no more than 1,500 mg sodium per day for children ages 1 to 3 and less than 2,200 mg for those between 4 and 13 years old.</p><p>While Yumble's sodium levels fall within a safe range, if you give your child packaged, processed, and other high-sodium foods throughout the day, you'll want to keep an eye on their overall sodium intake. For context, an Annie's Cheddar Bunnies 28-gram snack pouch contains 240 mg of sodium and one Organic Valley's Stringles Organic String Cheese contains 210 mg. My son only ate about half of the aforementioned Yumble meals, so ultimately, it wasn't an issue for us.</p>\n\tThe bottom line\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e4581574b661b46ac560e34?format=jpeg\" alt=\"YumbleBottomLine\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The service is ideal for busy parents who don&#39;t have time to shop and cook.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Michelle Piccolo/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Did <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/SENKSE9KS0pDR0lJTEhOQ0dNS0tHSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">Yumble</a> save me time and energy? Yes. Did my son enjoy it? For the most part. Would I continue to order? Not necessarily.</p><p>Luckily, Yumble lets you skip a week or pause your subscription. I would order again if I knew a week was going to be super busy or if my son was going to stay with my parents for a few days. If I could freeze some meals for random days here and there, I would order more.</p><p>I have the time to make dinner most nights, but for many families that don't, Yumble is definitely a great option to check out if you're looking to getting a balanced meal with good ingredients on the table quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Easy ordering process, delivered fresh, variety of meals to choose from, good ingredients, uses organic whenever possible</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Plastic wrap difficult to remove; need to keep an eye on sodium levels; not suitable for children with

retail companies can't deny the power and influence that customers can have over the product development process.&#160;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trending-products-and-startups-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agile startups</a> are often able to quickly spot and address customer demands for a new product or style.&#160;</li><li>When they work collaboratively with customers to bring them what they want, the final product is inevitably a success.&#160;</li></ul><p>Though retail companies have dedicated product developers and marketers to determine what products to release next, they do often take into consideration the feedback and requests of their loyal customers. After all, without customers, these brands wouldn't be able to succeed as they do, so it behooves them to listen with open ears.&#160;</p><p>For startups, the timeline between noticing a common customer demand and bringing it to market is sped up. Unshackled by the bureaucracies of a legacy company, the small teams tend to be able to move more nimbly and interact with their fans in more creative, efficient ways.&#160;</p><p>These conversations between brand and customer strengthen loyalties and make customers feel more like active collaborators instead of passive bystanders in the product development process. In the end, both parties win: customer gets exactly what they want, and startup is rewarded with sales.&#160;</p><h2><strong>See 7 popular startup products that were created as a direct result of customer demand below &#8212; unsurprisingly, they were hits.&#160;</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tTommy John women's underwear\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cf6ba8711e205480a579632?format=jpeg\" alt=\"customer demand products\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tommy John/Instagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://tommyjohn.evyy.net/JY7Xq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Shop women's underwear at Tommy John, starting at $20</a></h3><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tommy-john-new-womens-underwear-review-2018-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our review of Tommy John women's underwear here</a></h3><p>Since launching in 2008 with ultra-comfortable men's underwear and undershirts, Tommy John has been fielding requests for women's underwear.

But as part of their training process, again, they are inculcated&#160;with the values of the particular service.\"</p><p>\"We teach them what things are appropriate and inappropriate because at the end of the day, being in the military means you might have to use deadly force against people,\" Lapan added. \"You might be faced with very difficult and life-altering decisions at 17, 18, 19 years old.\"</p><p>The military has struggled with the proliferation of unflattering TikTok videos that have emerged on numerous social media apps, many of them containing service members wearing a uniform, or half-dressed in one. In one recent TikTok <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2020/08/27/cardi-bs-wap-causes-controversy-on-military-tiktok/\">video</a>, two US Army soldiers appeared to dance to rapper Cardi B's song \"WAP,\" prompting fierce backlash from a predominately male audience.</p><p>The US military officially banned the use of the app for its troops, regardless of whether they appeared in videos wearing a uniform, citing concerns with its ownership of the China-based technology firm, ByteDance. President Donald Trump has railed against TikTok and claimed that ByteDance \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"</p><p>In 2019, Gen. David Berger, the US Marine Corps commandant, said that criticism for a service members' use of Chinese-owned apps like TikTok should be directed against the military's leadership, rather than the individual troops. Berger added that the younger generation of troops had a \"clearer view\" of the technology \"than most people give them credit for.\"</p><p>\"That said, I'd give us a 'C-minus' or a 'D' in educating the force on the threat of even technology,\" Berger said. \"Because they view it as two pieces of gear, 'I don't see what the big deal is.'\"</p><p>\"That's not their fault. That's on us,\" Berger added. \"Once they begin to understand the risks, what the impact to them is tactically &#8230; then it becomes clear. I don't blame them for that. This is a training and education that we have to do.\"</p><p><em>Madison Hall contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Some of the peaceful protests in the following days turned violent as people looted and defaced nearby businesses.</p><p>Armed citizens took to the streets in response to the demonstrations, which has fatal results. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, has been accused of opening fire during a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha and killing two people in the process.&#160;</p><p>Trump on Sunday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1299327274710437888\">liked a tweet</a> that spoke positively of Rittenhouse. \"Kyle Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump,\" the tweet said.</p><p>The president has given a platform to conspiracy theorists, including those who claim ongoing anti-racism demonstrations represent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OANN/status/1299045185758703616\">a \"coup attempt\" against Trump</a>, and people who've threatened protesters exercising their First Amendment rights with violence.&#160;</p><p>Experts on authoritarianism and fascism have warned that Trump's behavior bears <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruthbenghiat/status/1300091306933391360?s=20\">unsettling parallels</a> to autocratic leaders of both the past and present.</p><p>\"Trumpism is something akin to a fascist social and political movement,\" Jason Stanley, author of \"How Fascism Works,\" <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/30/media/trump-fascism-reliable/index.html\">told CNN on Sunday.</a> \"We've got militias roaming the street. We have one of our political parties turning into a cult of the leader.\"</p><p>The president is moving ahead with a visit to Kenosha on Tuesday, despite the fact local leaders have made it clear they don't want him there.</p><p>\"I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing. I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together,\" Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, wrote in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/0f8b184872f489a75548914049e41b13\">a letter</a> to Trump.&#160;</p><p>The Kenosha shooting came just one night after a St. Louis couple who made headlines for pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters earlier this summer <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/first-night-of-rnc-was-dark-all-about-spreading-fear-2020-8\">spoke at the Republican National Convention</a>. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the gun-toting couple, in their remarks for the GOP convention said Democrats \"are not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities\" and want to \"abolish the suburbs all together.\"</p><p>Trump and his allies have repeatedly pushed the false narrative that US cities led by Democrats are consumed by crime and destruction amid nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. While there has been rioting and violence on the fringes of these demonstrations, they've primarily been peaceful and Trump's rhetoric on this is at odds with reality. Crime in the US <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/nyregion/trump-rnc-urban-crime.html\">remains historically low</a>.&#160;</p><p>The president is trying to convince white, suburban voters that they're in danger of being overrun by anarchists if he loses the election, so he's going full-steam ahead with painting former Vice President Joe Biden as weak on crime and unwilling to condemn violence. Meanwhile, Trump <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/08/29/post-rnc-poll-trump-bounce/\">trails Biden</a> in the polls.&#160;</p><h2>'Rioting is not protesting'</h2><p>Biden has a fairly hardline record when it comes to crime, which is part of the reason he's not particularly popular with the progressive wing of the Democratic party, and he's taken to the campaign trail to forcefully decry recent incidents of violence.</p><p>\"Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting ... And those who do it should be prosecuted,\" Biden said in Pittsburgh on Monday, during a speech in which he also condemned \"unwarranted police shootings.\"&#160;</p><p>The Democratic presidential nominee also slammed the president for his \"failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Aaron Rupar  (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1300492092192559105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 31, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>To Biden's point, the White House has openly stated that \"violence and chaos\" is good for Trump and his \"law and order\" messaging.&#160;</p><p>\"The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public safety and law and order,\" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kellyanne-conway-chaos-and-violence-is-good-for-trumps-reelection-2020-8?utmSource=twitter&utmContent=referral&utmTerm=topbar&referrer=twitterrrer=twitter\">said during an interview on \"Fox and Friends\"</a> last week.&#160;</p><p>By fueling violence and disarray, Trump also distracts from his disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It's easy to just coast along when it's boring but not terrible. Meal planning is something I hate, like emptying a dishwasher.

By the end of May, I was burnt out. I was cooking our meals, plus for my clients and my blog. It was a lot. Finally, I had to take a break and really just let someone else cook and so we ordered our first takeout meal.&#160; Let me tell you, it was glorious. Eating someone else's cooking was a breath of fresh air. After that meal, I had to get out of my head and just look for inspiration. Honestly, from someone that is always in the kitchen, the best way to get out of a cooking rut is to not cook. <strong>&#8212;Rezel Kealoha, recipe developer</strong></p><p>&#160;</p>\n\tConsult a trusty cookbook.

Replacing the microwave with a skillet will go a long way in making them more fun and flavorful. Few meals will not taste good reheated in a skillet with a fried egg on top. Or dipped cold in aioli. Or on top of white beans cooked in olive oil.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For instance, I always roast a whole chicken for dinner, and make chicken salad with the leftovers, and broth with the bones and my leftover vegetables. Later, I just add some noodles to them for chicken soup. <strong>&#8212;Melanie Masarin, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://drinkghia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Ghia</a></strong></p><p>My all time favorite for this hack is to roast a whole chicken, which honestly, could not be easier. A 3-3.5-pound chicken will roast at 450&#176;F for 75 minutes. Stuff the cavity with lemons and garlic heads and boom, you're done. The first night you have roast chicken. Any leftover meat can be picked and mixed with celery, pickles, and yogurt for chicken salad sandwiches the next day. Save the bones and you have chicken noodle soup for dinner or lunch another day. It's about a $15 investment for three meals.<strong>&#8212;Paul C.

As it turns out, staying cooped up all the time isn't good for you. \"Having a sedentary lifestyle and not doing something for your own mental well-being &#8211; all these things can affect your immunity,\" Summit Health Group primary care physician Dr. Jessica Natale told me.&#160;</p><p>In other words, it's not a bad idea to safely get out of your house now and then. But that's when taking precautions, not jetting off to Europe, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/europe-travel-ban-americans-official-eu-coronavirus-covid-19-2020-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">where we're banned anyway</a>. Or even states like New York, where we're on the quarantine list.</p><p>Besides, as someone with an autoimmune disease and a dysfunctional immune system, flying doesn't seem like a good idea.&#160;</p><p>So, day trips and weekend road trips it is. And after interviewing many public health experts and physicians about how to take a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/safe-socially-distanced-road-trip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">safe, socially distanced road trip</a>, as well as how to do so in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/safe-road-trip-florida-keys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Florida Keys specifically</a>, I felt confident I could responsibly leave my house for a staycation within my state, so long as I adhered to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certain guidelines</a>. After all, my car is where I can control the situation, keep sanitized, and have as little contact with others as possible.&#160;</p><p>I decided on <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Islander Resort</a> for my first trip, located on Islamorada in the upper part of the Florida Keys. It generally appeals to travelers who head to the Keys for that Jimmy Buffett vibe, family groups who want to fish and relax, and South Floridians who like to bring down their own boats (there are 14 boat slips on the property).&#160;</p><p>In the past, I've seen it get a little boisterous, but it's also been updated since my last visit, and management is aiming for a bit more elegance. I also checked the <a href=\"https://www.islanderfloridakeys.com/policies-procedures-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19 policies</a> and was reassured that the room would be sanitized, housekeeping would not interrupt our stay, and no one was allowed on property except guests.&#160;</p><p>Plus, there are no interior elevators or hallways. Each room or suite, equipped with a balcony or screened porch, opens out onto the 1,100-foot coral beach, a pool path, or worst case, a parking lot (my luck). Most are single-story, row-style or fashioned like villas and rooms start at just $189.</p><p>Value-wise, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Islander Resort</a> was well worth it, and offered the respite I needed, so long as the hotel and my fellow guests were following pandemic procedures. As it turned out, not everyone approached things as conservatively as I did, and the hotel did not fully deliver on all their cleaning promises. But my stay did impart some key wisdom on COVID safety to consider when traveling during the pandemic.</p><p>Of course, without a vaccine, there is no firm guarantee with regard to safety. It's crucial to follow guidelines and advice from organizations such as the CDC and WHO, and practice safety measures including wearing a mask, washing your hands, and maintaining social distancing. Additionally, consider your own level of risk, and whether you're traveling from or to a hotspot, so as not to increase the rate of infection.</p><p>In other words, if you're not currently living in Florida, it's probably best to consider this hotel for a visit down the line.</p><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-1\" rel=\"noopener\">The first impression</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-5\">The room</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-9\">On-site amenities</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-13\">What's nearby</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-14\">What others say</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-15\">What you need to know</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-16\">COVID-19 policies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/islander-resort-hotel-review-islamorada#-17\">The bottom line</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Book a room at Islander Resort starting at $189 per night </a></li></ul><h2><strong>Keep reading to see why I was so impressed by <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Islander Resort</a><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fhotel-park-mgm.en-gb.html%3F.html%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">.</a></strong></h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d966d8de94e8657cd26713f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Hotel Reviews Banner first impression\" height=\"151\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d1aaf7ffa48002894d231?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Islander Resort entrance\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The soothing fountain at the front of the Islander Resort is the first thing visitors see after stopping to check in at the guard house.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Karetnick/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>A marquee sign on the west side of the Overseas Highway alerted my husband and me to the presence of <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the resort</a> and <a href=\"https://www.islanderfloridakeys.com/florida-keys-history-discovery-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Florida Keys History &#38; Discovery Center</a>, a museum-aquarium (and more) that's located on-site.</p><p>We pulled in and stopped at the guardhouse, where masked employees reminded us about COVID-19 policies and directed us to the lobby.

Our friends who traveled to the hotel for the same weekend booked earlier and stayed in a villa-style beachside suite with two separate rooms. It was also about the same size. Suite views are variable, ranging from courtyard to ocean, but the size can blossom up to 1,070 square feet for a two-bedroom.&#160;</p><p>Although our single-story, motel-style Tropical View King room was standard, it felt large with a kitchen with a full-size refrigerator, coffee fixings, and a microwave. It struck me as especially handy for families and longer-term stays.&#160;</p><p>There was also a closet &#8212; more like a wardrobe &#8212; and the bureau aligned with that, which was where the 50\" smart TV sat.&#160;</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d1cbf60bf1f0028079784?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Islander Resort Steam Shower and Toilet\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The bathroom is small but clean, and little touches went a long way.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Karetnick/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>A small bathroom was clean and updated with a steam shower. I appreciated how nicely the towels were folded, and the large-format Paul Mitchell bath amenities felt like an indulgence. Everything was visibly clean.</p><p>The sink, however, is on the outside of the bathroom, across from the little kitchen area. This made the entrance way a little tight. There's not a lot of space to unpack toiletries, either.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d1c3b7ffa48002894d239?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hotel room\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A standard guest room offers plenty of space for two and includes a screened lanai.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Karetnick/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The King-sized bed, covered in blue-and-white linens, took up about half the room. I loved how wide the bed was, and my husband appreciated the firm mattress. With plantation shutters keeping out the sun and good, strong air-conditioning, the room was a comfortable place to hang out, day or night. We knew we had left our anxieties at home when we gave in to the urge for a late afternoon nap.</p><p>The rest of the space was comprised of a small table that could serve as a desk or a spot to dine, plus a love seat. A door at the end of the room opened to a screened porch with patio furniture and a ceiling fan to cut the humidity. When we weren't sleeping or in the water, we hung out on the terrace, sipping wine we brought and chilled in the fridge, or reading under the fan's lazy breeze.</p><p>While I found the heavy, dark furniture dated and out of its tropical element, the tile floor, sea-themed artwork, and blue-and-green color scheme lightened up the room.</p><p>With modern minimalist design, it was hard to tell if anything extraneous had been removed for the sake of COVID. Robes hung in the wardrobe (slippers aren't supplied regardless), and two decorative pillows rested on the love seat. While no paper flyers for activities, magazines, or menus were in the room, the sugar and creamer were filled for a few days' stay.</p><p>In fact, staying at <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the resort</a> didn't feel much different than it did before the pandemic, aside from the obvious design updates. While I was nervous prior to arrival, once I entered the room I felt fine. The obvious cleanliness helped, and the privacy was reassuring. We couldn't hear anything from neighbors, and doors, which you approach from outside, were far enough apart that even if people weren't wearing masks, we didn't&#160;come within six feet of each other.&#160;</p><p>As a bonus, while I usually find it difficult to sleep in a hotel the first night, the pandemic has had the opposite effect on me. Staying at <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the Islander</a> was the only time I've felt rested since February.</p><p>Still, while I enjoyed my stay &#8212; and clearly needed a change of scenery &#8212; I would have been uneasy had it been at full capacity. Another friend who went for a long weekend after I returned reported staff wearing inefficient neck gaiters, no visible cleaning, and too-crowded pools. I'd return, but if the pandemic is still raging, only during weekdays in the low season.&#160;</p><p>I'd also upgrade to a suite with a beachside view, which can cost about $120 more for a room that is roughly the same size as mine, with a much better vantage point. The view determines the price, with rooms and <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">beachside suites</a> on the ocean side (where we were staying) starting at $189 and <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">townhouses on the bayside</a> at $260.&#160;</p><p>Prices rise in peak season and mandatory minimum stays are often required.

The pools can be quiet and peaceful or occupied by interconnected family groups and occasionally rowdy tourists who don't control their children.&#160;</p><p>Several times, we had to remind children about maintaining their distance from us, at which point they'd swim closer on purpose and mock us.</p><p>I also saw a young boy do a front somersault into the pool, which has a depth of four feet. Neither the pool staff, who wear neck gaiter and bandanas as opposed to masks, nor beer-in-hand parents do a good job of watching for danger.&#160;</p><p>It's worth noting that masks aren't required for guests at the pool, but wristbands are. You'll be stopped at the gate and asked for your room number, then handed a towel.</p><p>As a mom of two and a former teacher of 15 years, I found it irritating to take matters into my own hands. But given the number of adults who won't follow guidelines, it was not entirely surprising. At the end of the day, I also had to consider where I was: The Conch Republic, where everyone is in a Sovereign State of Mind (this is the Keys' actual motto) and everything is laissez-faire. Even during a pandemic, you're apparently expected to roll with it.&#160;&#160;</p><p>And, it should be noted, the beach lounges and cabanas were completely deserted, and lounge chairs at both pool and the beach were grouped and rearranged to provide maximum separation.</p><p>Hanging out on the sand was a wiser decision, albeit a hotter one. Plus, taking a socially distanced stroll on the beach, pier, and grounds, day or night, was a nice change of pace from walking around the same neighborhood block at home.</p><p>Still, make sure you inspect the beach towels, which were handed out at the pool. Despite the claims of a costly renovation, we found several stained beyond repair, visible even when rolled up in the bin. And though I handed one back to an attendant and mentioned that it looked so bad that it should be taken out of circulation, I saw her throw it in the dirty towel bin.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d1edf7ffa48002894d250?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Islander Resort Directional Signs\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Masks aren&#39;t required for guests at the pool, but wristbands are.

You can still fish off the pier, however.</p><p>In addition, you can use kayaks, paddleboards, and water bicycles. The guidelines for use are one hour per person per day, which is covered by a $30 daily resort fee. We thought we would take advantage of this, but the days were too hot to engage in exercise. Given that swimming and water sports are the only activities available, management might also want to rethink charging such a steep resort fee, especially since some of the resort's facilities are closed.&#160;</p><p>For instance, Elements Lounge &#38; Fine Dining was not in operation. Instead, Tides Beachside Bar &#38; Grill was open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Much of the fare was refreshing, well-prepared, and evocative of the region. We felt fine lunching on a less-crowded mid-afternoon, but a strict noon rush kept us in a suddenly abandoned pool instead.</p><p>While things seemed clean, we didn't see any increased sanitization going on aside from the staff wiping down tables at the restaurant.</p><p>You can also place orders to go and get ice cream at a pick-up window framed by plexiglass.

It looks like they're overflowing, with waits for dinner, when they really just have less, socially distanced room to host visitors. I recommend making reservations even if you think you don't need them, even if you've been to places in the past where you haven't required them.</p><p>Also keep in mind that while masks are mandatory, the folks who live in the Keys are used to doing what they please. Big government is not their kind of thing. Thus masking is not something a lot of them willingly follow.&#160;</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.expedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Check flight prices to Florida on Expedia</a></h2>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d966d8ee94e8657cd26714a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Hotel Reviews Banner What others say\" height=\"151\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Islander Resort has a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34346-d231957-Reviews-Islander_Resort-Islamorada_Florida_Keys_Florida.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">4.5 rating on Trip Advisor</a> and a 9.4 out of 10 on <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.hotels.com/ho172823/?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Hotels.com</a>, where guests often comment about the unusual beauty of the wide, shady beach, the exceptional landscaping, and the comfort of the rooms with porches or screened lanais.&#160;</p><p>Guests also praise the amenities, which range from ping pong to fishing to kayaking.

The in-room kitchen also allows you to tend to picky family members, long-term stays, and for those that want to take out food rather than eat at restaurants.&#160;</p><p>But you do need to watch the pool and beach public areas, which can become dense at times with people, especially children, not keeping enough distance. The staff doesn't pay attention to that, although you can see why. They're stretched thin, and it didn't look like some of them were happy to be working in the hospitality industry.</p><p>Still, the bandanas and neck gaiters they're wearing are simply not good enough, although since they're outside, we felt it was safer than it would have been. I also recommend a few more sanitizing stations placed around the property, or stockpiling your own, and would like to see more actual cleaning of high-touch surfaces, not just paying lip service to cleaning.</p><p>Crowded public spaces, lack of attention to guests breaking social distancing rules, staff members themselves not practicing the best mask policies, and not enough visible cleaning might give you pause, though, if you're high-risk or ultra-cautious.&#160;</p><p>But the positives outweighed the negatives, and for the sake of my mental health, I'd personally return to the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fislander-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Islander</a> and places like it during the pandemic at low-volume times, such as early autumn weekdays while kids are in school.

is pushing the White House to adopt a \"herd immunity\" strategy that would allow the disease to spread through most of the population to build resistance, five sources <a

Monday.</p><p>Scott Atlas, a healthcare policy fellow at Stanford University's conservative Hoover Institution think tank, joined the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-atlas-new-medical-adviser-anti-lockdown-pro-schools-reopening-2020-8#:~:text=Scott%20Atlas%20as%20a%20coronavirus,not%20an%20infectious%2Ddiseases%20expert.\">earlier this month</a> as a top pandemic adviser. His expertise is in neuroradiology, and he \"does not have a background in infectious diseases or epidemiology,\" The Post said.</p><p>The Post's sources said Atlas had proposed that the US adopt Sweden's pandemic response, which relies on keeping the economy open so healthy people can build immunity to the disease through the spread of infection.</p><p>At the onset of the outbreak, the Nordic country decided against imposing strict lockdown measures &#8212; a far different approach from its European neighbors. Instead, it advised people to behave responsibly and told vulnerable populations, such as older people, to self-isolate if they had symptoms. The Post noted that Sweden now has among the highest COVID-19 infection and death rates in the world.</p><p>The approach has received mixed responses. Many public-health experts have described it as a reckless strategy that could result in hundreds of thousands more deaths. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/who-special-envoy-heaps-praise-on-sweden-s-covid-strategy\">Others are considering</a> its feasibility as a long-term solution.</p><p>It's unclear exactly how many people would need to become infected to achieve herd immunity; estimates have ranged from 20% to 70% of the population, according to The Post.</p><p>The Post reported that Atlas had also suggested that an increased case count would not lead to more deaths if vulnerable people were protected, a claim that most infectious-disease experts strongly dispute. More than 25,000 people under age 65 have died of the virus in the US so far, the report said.</p><p>Before joining the coronavirus task force, Atlas regularly advocated reopening schools and businesses. He frequently appeared on Fox News to share his opinions, many of which aligned with those expressed by President Donald Trump's. Atlas now meets with Trump more than any other health official, The Post said.</p><p>\"When younger, healthier people get the disease, they don't have a problem with the disease,\" Atlas said in a Fox News interview in July. \"I'm not sure why that's so difficult for everyone to acknowledge.\"</p><p>Atlas has clashed with other officials, including Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US's top infectious-disease expert. A senior administration official told The Post that Atlas had positioned himself as an \"anti-Dr. Fauci.\"</p><p>Shortly after The Post published its report on Monday, Atlas released a statement denying any push for a herd-immunity strategy. \"There is no policy of the President or this administration of achieving herd immunity,\" he said. \"There never has been any such policy recommended to the President or to anyone else from me.\"</p><p>A White House representative also said there was no change to its approach.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

video:&#160;</p><pre>&#160;</pre><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> <br >After the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, people protested in at least 140 cities across the nation. Here in Indiana, a protestor lost an eye from a tear gas container hitting him in the face.</p><p>In North Carolina, protesters were trapped by a cloud of tear gas on both ends of a street. In Kentucky, an officer attacked a newscaster and camera crew with pepper bullets.</p><p>And here in Detroit, police backed by armored vehicles marched down the streets. To date, the US has spent over $15 billion on the militarization of police.</p><p>All of these weapons, vehicles, and equipment are acquired by the police through a military program called 1033.</p><p>It's like eBay for cops with leftover war equipment, except everything is free and you only pay for shipping and handling. Up until 2017, police couldn't be in the program unless they used equipment within a year of receiving it.</p><p>So how did local police acquire all of these military weapons? And why do they even need them? To answer this question, we're going to examine four moments in history.</p><p><strong>Clip:</strong> From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.</p><p>Narrator: In the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Congress signed the Safe Streets Act into law in June of 1968.</p><p>Through that act, in an effort to crack down on organized crime and gun violence, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration was created.</p><p>LEAA guaranteed the distribution of federal money to fight organized crime. This funded what we know as SWAT, and it ensured SWAT received searchlights, emergency radios, bullhorns, nightsticks, body armor, face shields, and special weapons like M79 grenade launchers.</p><p>Prior to 1968, SWAT teams were used sparingly, only in volatile, high-risk situations like bank robberies or hostage situations. SWAT's first test as a militarized front came when the LAPD used a tank on loan from the California National Guard on the Southern California Black Panther Party.</p><p><strong>Clip:</strong> The intermittent warfare between the Black Panthers and police erupted today in Los Angeles. There, a group of them barricaded themselves in their headquarters and fought police with automatic weapons and hand grenades.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The US Department of State granted the LAPD authorization to use tear gas and sniper rifles. With national coverage, SWAT grew in popularity across the US and with other local law enforcement, creating a demand for military equipment.</p><p>LEAA's budget was a total of $7.5 billion, with a good portion going towards the militarization of US local law-enforcement agencies. After nearly a decade of extremely high budgets and spending, LEAA began to receive criticism because it had not shown success in decreasing crime rates.</p><p>On April 15, 1982, LEAA was abolished when Congress failed to fund it. But by that time, SWAT teams and their militaristic approach had already become the norm.</p><p>In 1986, Ronald Reagan's Anti-Drug Abuse Act expanded the use of no-knock or quick-knock warrants and assistance of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines in drug-related searches and seizures.</p><p>It allowed for members of SWAT to arrive at suspected locations of criminal activities and enter without knocking or announcing themselves, pointing guns at anyone inside.</p><p>They often used diversionary tactics like flash grenades, rendering their victims deaf and blind. In some cases, individuals believe they're experiencing a home invasion, to which they grab a gun. Like Jose Guerena, a former US Marine who was suspected of selling marijuana. What you're about to see and hear might upset you. He pulled a gun because he believed his home was being invaded, and the police shot him 60 times in seven seconds. No drugs were found.</p><p>In the early 1980s, there was on average about 3,000 recorded SWAT incidents per year. By the mid 1990s, that number grew to about 45,000 SWAT incidents per year. 75.9% were drug raids.</p><p>Of those raids, SWAT officers fired 342 times. They injured 61 and killed 139 citizens.</p><p>In 1989, George H. W. Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act.</p><p>This act allowed for surplus DOD equipment from the Cold War to be transferred to US law enforcement. Sections 1207 and 1208 allowed for the following: \"the procurement of services and leasing of equipment\" and the transfer to federal and state agencies personal property, \"including small arms and ammunition.\"</p><p>And from those two sections, eight years later, the 1033 program was born. Under Bill Clinton's administration, the use of military surplus trade continued with the introduction of the Law Enforcement Support Office, LESO, which enacted US code title 10, section 2576a, also known as the 1033 program.</p><p>Much like National Defense Authorization Act 1208, the 1033 program expanded into other areas, including counterterrorism. This line states that surplus military equipment can be used for counter-drugs and counterterrorism efforts. This line states that surplus military equipment is free of charge minus shipping and handling.</p><p>Over $7.4 billion worth of property has been transferred since the program's inception. More than 8,000 law-enforcement agencies have enrolled. Items shipped include boots, radios, shields, M16 assault rifles, tanks, and silencers.</p><p>For every one qualified officer, one M1911 pistol, M16 rifle, or M14 rifle is allocated. For every three officers, a department can get a Humvee, and every law-enforcement agency has the ability if they apply to receive one MRAP.</p><p>And then, three days after 9/11, George W. Bush signed the Patriot Act.</p><p>It created a gray zone where law-enforcement agencies were able to perform more searches and seizures with access to delayed warrants, wiretaps, email, and web search surveillance, all in the name of fighting terrorism. But in reality, the liberties given to police were often used in drug-related cases. Only 1% of sneak and peek searches in 2010 were terrorism related. 76% were drug related.</p><p>And the United States' international actions also impacted law enforcement at home. As a result of an increase and then decrease of US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the years, there's been more military surplus equipment available to law enforcement, creating a spike in tactical items distributed by the 1033 program.</p><p>The Department of Defense does not provide training for law-enforcement agencies that receive military weapons. Instead, it's left to recipients to certify their own training each year. Because there is no federal mandate that police agencies report on SWAT operations, there's no real way to tell or quantify the effect of SWAT-related incidents.</p><p>In an effort to access the program's productivity and safety protocols, the Government Accountability Office created a fake federal agency. After acquiring more than 100 items worth over $1.2 million, the office recommended a process to implement fraud prevention in addition to a website that can track the equipment and the agencies it was sent to.</p><p>Prior to the investigation, there was very little record keeping and tracking of weapons after transfer. There were several instances where the agencies did not report lost weapons or disposal of excess equipment.</p><p><strong>Clip:</strong> And San Mateo and Napa counties were not the only departments in the nation to have lost equipment. About 200, in fact, have military equipment missing at this hour, and that includes, actually, some Humvees.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> 184 state and local police departments were suspended from the 1033 program. In 2014, sparked by the murder of Michael Brown, civil unrest rolled through the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. Americans watching from home were shocked to see what looked like an army descending on such a small town.</p><p>On January 16, 2015, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13688.</p><p><strong>Barack Obama:</strong> You know, we've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there's an occupying force as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The order prohibited a list of equipment from being transferred to law enforcement through the 1033 program: tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, firearms of .50 caliber or higher, ammunition of .50 caliber or higher, grenade launchers, bayonets, camouflage uniforms. That executive order did not last long before being revoked in 2017 by President Donald Trump.</p><p><strong> Jeff Sessions:</strong> These restrictions that had been opposed went too far. We will not put superficial concerns above public safety.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Today, in 2020, in the wake of George Floyd's killing, protesters are being met with militarized police armed with 1033 program war surplus. No-knock warrants still result in the deaths of innocent citizens, like 26-year-old emergency medical technician Breonna Taylor.</p><p>Tear gas is still legal for domestic use on protesters but has been banned for use in war since 1993. And studies on rubber bullets, like the ones used here, show that 3% of those injured by rubber bullets died as a result of their injuries. 15.5% suffered permanent disabilities like eye loss, and nearly 50% of those who were struck on the head or neck were killed.</p><p>In the US, law enforcement kills over 900 people a year. Compare that to Norway, where there have been only four police-related killing since 2002.</p><p>Norway credits these numbers to its face-to-face community-building approach and believes it has created more trust between citizens and their police department. And we've seen similar changes stateside.</p><p>In 2001, a Cincinnati police officer shot and killed 19-year-old Timothy Thomas after he resisted arrest over minor crimes. After riots and protests, in fear of more unrest, the city began to reform its police department in collaboration with the Department of Justice.</p><p>They standardized procedures, making civilian-officer interactions more transparent. They also created a training program focused on mental health.</p><p>The reforms were met with pushback from city officials and a hostile police union, but the result was a 50% decrease in use of force from 2001 to 2007.</p><p>Data shows that building trust within the community may be a better solution to saving lives than using military weapons against them.</p><div

class=\"summary-list\"><li>United, American, and Delta Air Lines are all doing away with change fees and select other optional fees.</li><li>United and American will also allow passengers to fly stand-by on earlier flights for free and offer other complimentary perks for elite status holders.</li><li>The US airline industry is still falling short of 1 million daily passengers with the summer only seeing a moderate increase in passengers compared to spring.&#160;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>Less than 24 hours after United Airlines announced that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/united-airlines-ends-most-ticket-change-fees-not-basic-economy-2020-8\">it's eliminating change fees</a> for passengers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have followed suit. The country's two largest airlines each announced their latest attempts to win back pandemic-wary travelers within an hour of each other on Monday, marking the latest sign that the industry is struggling to return to normal following a <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput\">disastrous summer</a>.</p><p>These airlines and many others started charging passengers who changed their plans in the early 2000s, part of a wave of ancillary fees for things like checking bags and priority boarding. The additional revenue from those add-ons is untaxed and can often be more lucrative than the fare itself.</p><p>But with no end in sight to the pandemic that has decimated travel demand and&#160;put the entire <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-furloughs-layoffs-coronavirus-2020-8\">industry in desperate financial straits</a>, airlines appear willing to sacrifice the most sacred of cash cows to win over those few folk willing to climb aboard.&#160;</p><p>Each airline, of course, has its own particular mix of incentives. United and American, for example, are also allowing customers to change to earlier flights on a stand-by basis for free.&#160;</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the changes each of the big three is making to its policies.</p><h2>United Airlines</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d64d27ffa48002894d407?format=jpeg\" alt=\"United Airlines 777\" height=\"3066\" width=\"4088\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>United was the first airline to announce the elimination of change fees for domestic flights.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><a href=\"https://hub.united.com/2020-08-30-united-airlines-permanently-eliminates-change-fees-2647406401.html\">United became the first of the big three airlines to permanently get rid of change fees on Sunday</a>, dropping the $200 charge for domestic flight changes that includes travel to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Passengers with most fares can make unlimited changes to the ticket and only pay the fare difference each time.&#160;</p><p>Basic economy will remain restrictive with United still not allowing changes to those with the fare but the airline's current travel waiver includes free changes for all tickets, basic economy and international included, booked until the end of the year.</p><p>Members of United's MileagePlus frequent flyer program will also be able to cancel their award tickets and have their miles redeposited for free if they cancel at least 30 days from departure. Elite status holders will also be able get on an earlier flight to their destination, if there's a seat available.&#160;</p><h2>American Airlines</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d64ea60bf1f0028079952?format=jpeg\" alt=\"American Airlines Airbus A319\" height=\"1665\" width=\"2220\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>American is not only removing change fees but also giving elite status holders perks when booking basic economy tickets.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alex Tai/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>American is removing change fees for domestic and certain international flights on all fares except basic economy.. Travelers flying domestically or between the US and Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean will no longer be subject to the $200 fee for domestic flights and up to $750 fee for international, according to its <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/optional-service-fees.jsp#ticketing\">fee schedule</a>.&#160;</p><p>The airline is also allowing customers the option to fly stand-by on earlier flights regardless of the fare or destination book, whether it be international or domestic, without paying a fee beginning on October 1. The charge for doing so was previously $75 for domestic flights, according to the airline's <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/i18n/plan-travel/extras/same-day-travel.jsp\">website</a>, with exceptions for international destinations.</p><p>United is also making basic economy less egalitarian, giving elite status holders expanded benefits when booking the fare. The airline's top frequent flyers will receive complimentary same-day confirmed flight changes and upgrades to first class and premium seats in economy when available.&#160;</p><p>In 2021, however, basic economy fares won't earn miles that can be used for accruing elite status.&#160;</p><h2>Delta Air Lines</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d64fc7ffa48002894d408?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Delta Air Lines Airbus A321\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Delta is doing the least out of the big three, just removing flight changes while making no other changes.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Bruce Bennett/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Delta <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/building-its-demonstrated-commitment-flexibility-customers-delta-eliminates-change-fees\">announced</a> on Monday the removal change fees for travelers in all classes except for basic economy on domestic flights including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Customers formerly had to pay $200 to make changes to domestic tickets, according to the <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/us/en/change-cancel/change-flight\">airline</a>, including those to and from US territories in the Caribbean.</p><p>Basic economy or international fares will not be affected by the change, but Delta will allow free ticket changes for both under its existing waiver until the end of the year.

over the past few decades. Gone are the days when you had to buy CDs, vinyl records, or cassette tapes. You don't even have to buy digital downloads anymore. These days, you can simply sign up to a music streaming service and have access to all the music you'll ever need on a device that sits in your pocket.</p><p>Of course, there are quite a few music streaming services out there, and they're all a little different. Because of that, it can be hard to find the service that's perfect for your needs.</p><p>When deciding which streaming service to get, it's worth considering a few things. For starters, you'll want to make sure that there's an app for your chosen streaming service on every device you use for music listening.&#160;</p><p>You'll also want to consider things like streaming audio quality and support for platforms like digital assistants. Voice assistants are getting better at working with third-party services, but they're still not great at it &#8212; especially when it comes to Siri.&#160;</p><p>Still figuring out which streaming service is for you?

Spotify is the original big music streaming service, and it has apps for all major platforms &#8212; including iOS, Android, and your preferred web browser.&#160;</p><p>One of the best things about <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a> is that you can try it out without having to subscribe. There's a free, ad-based version of Spotify that you can use for as long as you like, as long as you're fine with hearing ads every now and then.&#160;</p><p>While on a desktop, many streaming services only work through web-based apps, <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a> has native apps for everything. In other words, if you're on a Mac or PC and prefer a dedicated app, then you can get an app for Spotify. The service also has podcasts and video content, plus it streams music in up to a 320Kbps resolution, which should be good enough for the majority of listeners.</p><p>Of course, there are a few downsides to consider. For example, there's no live programming or lossless audio plan, like there is on some other music streaming services. Apart from that, however, <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a> is a great streaming service that any music-lover will enjoy.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The ad-free version of Spotify starts at $9.99 per month for one account. There's also a Duo plan that supports two accounts for $12.99 month, and a Family plan that includes support for up to six accounts for $14.99 per month. Students can sign up for a discounted $4.99 per month plan as well.</p><p>New subscribers to the Spotify Individual Premium, Duo Premium, or Family Premium plans can currently receive a two-month free trial period. New Student Premium members can receive a free three-month trial.</p><p>For a detailed rundown of how Spotify stacks up to one of our other top picks, Amazon Music, check out our <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-music-vs-spotify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full comparison of both services</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Highly compatible, has a ton of content, audio quality is good enough for most listeners, free version available</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No live content, no lossless audio option</p>\n\tThe best for Apple fans\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d113b35e3ecba054c7607f2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple Music\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?subId1=biipgf_062419_best-music-streaming-services&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Music</a> works beautifully on Apple devices, plus there's an app for it across a range of platforms, including Android.</h3><p>If you use an iPhone and other Apple products, then it's worth considering <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?subId1=biipgf_062419_best-music-streaming-services&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Music</a>.

Apart from the songs available on Apple Music, the service also offers the Beats 1 radio station and some exclusive music.</p><p>Though Apple Music was initially missing a web browser option, Apple now allows subscribers to use the service through internet browsers on computers and laptops without having to install a separate app.&#160;</p><p>Apple Music starts at $9.99 per month for one account. A Family plan with support for six people is available for $14.99 per month, and a discounted Student plan is available for $4.99 per month. New members can receive a free three-month trial. That's one month longer than the trial period that Spotify currently offers for its comparable plans.</p><p>Unlike Spotify, however, <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?subId1=biipgf_062419_best-music-streaming-services&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Music</a> does not offer a free version with ads, so you will need to subscribe to enjoy the service's selection of songs.&#160;&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Huge selection of content, live radio, excellent integration with Apple devices, three-month trial</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No free version, no lossless audio option</p>\n\tThe best for audiophiles\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d113e49e3ecba15104e39b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tidal\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tidal</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Tidal</a> is available on a range of platforms, plus it offers much better audio quality than the majority of other music streaming services out there.</h3><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Tidal</a> is a little different from other music streaming services in that it's targeted toward those who want a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hd-audio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher resolution audio experience</a> &#8212; and as such, it provides excellent sound performance.&#160;</p><p>While Tidal offers a Premium plan that uses the same 320Kbps bitrate that services like Spotify use, Tidal also has a HiFi plan that steps things up to a whopping 1,411Kbps in the lossless FLAC format.

earnings soared past Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom line.</p>\n<p>Zoom's business has grown tremendously this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent remote work mandates, and its revenue in Q2 grew a stunning 355% from a year prior. The second quarter's beat follows <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-doubled-guidance-earnings-growth-risks-competition-analysts-2020-6\">Zoom's blockbuster first quarter earnings report in June</a>, and blows past the 169% year-over-year revenue growth it reported in Q1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zoom reported revenue of $663.5 million in its second quarter, much higher than the $500.2 million analysts forecasted. Meanwhile, it reported earnings per share of $0.92, surpassing analyst expectations of $0.45. Zoom also raised its full-year revenue guidance by about $590 million, to between $2.37 billion and $2.39 billion. It previously forecasted between $1.78 billion and $1.80 billion in full-year revenue. The new guidance takes into account the increase in remote work and the likelihood of a higher number of customers paying on a monthly basis in the second half of the year, Zoom said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Its number of large customers also increased, with 988 customers paying over $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. In the first quarter, Zoom reported 769 large customers. CEO Eric Yuan called out new deals with ExxonMobil and Activision Blizzard as new customer wins in a call with analysts. 81% of the revenue growth can be attributed to new customer subscriptions in the quarter, CFO Kelly Steckelberg said on the call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Organizations are shifting from addressing their immediate business continuity needs to supporting a future of working anywhere, learning anywhere, and connecting anywhere on Zoom's video-first platform,\" Yuan said in an earnings release.</p>\n<p>Zoom's valuation has surged this year: Even before the earnings on Monday, its stock was up more than 340% for the year to-date.</p>\n<p>Still, it hasn't been all good news. After <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-facing-multiple-reported-security-issues-amid-coronavirus-crisis-2020-4\">a spat of security blunders in the spring</a>, Zoom faced backlash earlier this summer over its initial plan to only provide end-to-end encryption to paid users. It eventually <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-update-all-free-paid-users-2020-6\">revised those plans to provide it to all users</a>.</p>\n<p>Then, in August, it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-stop-direct-sales-mainland-china-partner-only-model-2020-8\">halted direct sales of its video conferencing products in mainland China</a>, and decided to only offer its technology through a few third-party partners. The decision came as Zoom's surge in popularity has led to scrutiny of its ties to China, though Zoom didn't cite that as the reason for the change. When asked on the earnings call what impact this would have on the company, Yuan said that it has had almost no impact on revenue, and that the decision was tied to simplifying its go-to-market model in China. Zoom also has a large research and development team in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zoom also brought on some <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-power-players-eric-yuan-security-hiring-2020-6\">new leaders in the second quarter</a>, including Jason Lee as its new chief information security officer, VMware veteran Velchamy Sankarlingam as its new president of engineering and product, and Damien Hooper-Campbell as its chief diversity officer. Zoom also acquired secure messaging startup Keybase in early May to help it build end-to-end encryption into its product, with cofounder and CEO Max Krohn becoming Zoom's new head of security engineering. Earlier this month it also hired Jeff True as its new general counsel after promoting Aparna Bawa to chief operating officer in May.</p>\n<p>In May, it also announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-cfo-hiring-500-engineers-phoenix-pittsburgh-remote-work-2020-5\">build two new R&amp;D centers in Phoenix and Pittsburgh</a>, to hire a combined 500 new engineers over the next several years.&nbsp;It has also been expanding its hardware offerings, including a new $600 screen dedicated for Zoom calls, and plans to add Zoom capabilities to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-for-home-smart-display-device-facebook-amazon-google-2020-8\">smart devices like Amazon Echo Shows and Facebook Portals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Here are the most important numbers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>Revenue: $663.5 million.

Summer came, and in a flash, will be gone again. And while that trend is nothing new, it certainly looked a lot different this year.&#160;</p><p>Not only did our habits around <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/work-from-home-revolution-pandemic-us-economy-covid-19-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">working</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/post-coronavirus-more-americans-will-shop-online-for-groceries-2020-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shopping</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-habits-during-covid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eating</a> change, but so did summer travel. Instead of international trips, many stuck close to home for getaways accessible by car. Indeed, rather than<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-travel-places\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> attempt my canceled spring trip</a> to Greece, I opted <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-travel-this-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for a long weekend in Cape Cod</a>.</p><p>And while summer may be winding down, and the novel coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-records-4-million-covid-cases-2-weeks-3-million-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">continues to hit the US with record force</a>, the desire to escape the confines of our home &#8212; safely &#8212; is seemingly here to stay in one form or another. Just as many embarked on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/safe-vacations-during-covid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">safer summer travel during COVID-19</a>, travelers will likely book <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-labor-day-hotel-deals-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last-minute summer deals</a>, socially distant <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hotels-fall-foliage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaf peeping this fall</a>, ski trips for winter, and take advantage of discounted, flexible packages into next year.</p><p>But before you rush to hit book, you may want to keep reading to heed timely advice from Insider Reviews travel writers.

Also, check whether you're leaving from or traveling to a hotspot, so as not to contribute to infection spikes, be aware of local mandates, and follow guidelines from the CDC and WHO such as wearing a mask, washing your hands, and social distancing, no matter where you go.</p><p>If you do choose to travel in the weeks and months ahead, consider making some of these modifications, proceed with caution, and remember that this is a fast-evolving situation.

We weren't comfortable flying, staying in large hotels, or planning a long road trip that required multiple stops and encounters with others. With <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-book-vacation-homes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vacation rentals either booked up or too expensive</a>, we selected a small property with standalone accommodations and private exterior entrances.&#160;</p><p>While I was initially nervous, I ultimately enjoyed my decision. I'm someone who loves hotels and I was able to enjoy the amenities only a hotel can provide (super clean renovated room, a pool) in a smaller setting akin to a private home.&#160;</p><p>My nerves weren't quelled immediately, but here's how I eased them: I opted for contactless check-in, brought my own pillow, and upon entering my room, wiped down high-touch surfaces, opened all the windows, and promptly left for three hours to air it out.</p><p>Heeding <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">these tips from experts</a> made us feel much more comfortable. More importantly, we knew our limits and established boundaries. We wanted to avoid restaurants, so we brought takeout back to the hotel's spaced out picnic tables. We limited our time at the beach to the morning when it was less crowded, and returned to the hotel to avoid public restrooms and use the small hotel pool when everyone else was still by the ocean. In doing so, we took advantage of on-site amenities we may not have otherwise and were able to still enjoy our vacation.</p><p>Next time though, I'm booking farther in advance with a generous cancellation policy so I can widen my scope of lodging choices. Many hotels offer significantly more flexible policies and fewer fees than you'll find on vacation rental platforms &#8212; take advantage of these deals. <strong><em>&#8212; Emily Hochberg, Insider Reviews travel editor</em></strong></p>\n\t2. Opt for multiple, short getaways to gauge your comfort with resuming travel.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d35cd60bf1f0028079814?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Camping road trip\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Thomas Barwick/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h2><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.expedia.com/?pwaLob=wizard-car-pwa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Book car rentals for your weekend getaway</a></h2><p>As a travel editor, I'm used to frequent global trips and typically go for flights over road trips and hotels over vacation rentals. But all that was upended in 2020.&#160;</p><p>This year, I opted for a few domestic trips, all within easy driving distance and social distancing in mind. Like many New Yorkers, I don't own a car, but after reading expert advice, I felt <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-rental-cars-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">safer renting a car</a> for short road trips than taking flights or trains. Similarly, I followed recommendations to stay in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/which-is-safer-airbnb-hotels-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vacation rentals</a> since there is less contact with others.</p><p>My first trip post-pandemic trip was to Cape Cod. I stuck to socially distant activities like biking and beach picnics in uncrowded areas. After I felt comfortable with that, I planned a short weekend trip to a campsite on Long Island since camping in your own designated area feels especially safe. Now, for the fall, I'm eyeing a similarly remote-but-nearby getaway to catch the fall foliage the Northeast is famous for.</p><p>While the pandemic often makes it hard to plan in advance, I've learned it's best to look for vacation rentals and car rentals as far out as possible. Both are becoming increasingly popular and booking up fast. If you can, opt for rentals that come with flexible cancellation policies so you have your bases covered, especially if you aren't sure how you feel about resuming travel. <strong><em>&#8212; Hannah Freedman, Insider Reviews associate travel editor</em></strong></p>\n\t3.

But with COVID-19, the idea of communal spaces like hallways and lobbies made me anxious. For my 2020 summer vacation, I decided to try Airbnb. The idea of having an entire house for just my family felt much safer.&#160;</p><p>But beyond just picking a home within driving distance, I looked for one with a Superhost, stellar reviews, and followed <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-new-cleaning-protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airbnb Enhanced Clean guidelines</a>.&#160;</p><p>I found that in this <a href=\"https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/196318/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F9795682%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1598881239_9BCykQgVccYAc21D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">restored sawmill</a>. My Superhosts not only followed the Airbnb Enhanced Clean program, they also chose to leave the property empty for three days between guests.&#160;</p><p>Also, living in a house in a small town gave us a true taste of local life and after a few days, we no longer felt like tourists. The overall experience was more immersive than staying in a hotel, and we felt the right balance of privacy and togetherness.</p><p>I liked my experience so much, I came back a few weeks later and rented another property from the same hosts, an <a href=\"https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/196318/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F25269850%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1598881364_rNhv97z0lFKIwUNZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">airy apartment at an old boarding house</a>.

Speak to the hotel before you arrive to discuss concerns and ask questions about impacted services.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d13fd7ffa48002894d207?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The Landing Lake Tahoe Resort &#38; Spa\" height=\"800\" width=\"1066\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Booking.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h2><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Book hotels on Booking.com</a></h2><p>My biggest tip for traveling during COVID-19 is to speak to the hotel before you book. The majority have reopened with limited amenities, meaning, the pool, spa, gym, and restaurants may be partially or completely closed.&#160;</p><p>Beyond that, try to get as much information as possible regarding how they're handling social distancing and protocols. If the hotel pool is open and your plan is to spend the day there, make sure there isn't a time limit per guest, which some hotels are doing, or if there is food and drink service available by the pool.</p><p>For example, on my recent weekend getaway to the Catskills, I didn't know the pool had a limit of only 10 people at a time and was with five other girls. We had to make sure we got to the pool extra early to ensure we had spots, which forced us to alter our morning plans.&#160;</p><p>Next time, I will check beforehand to plan accordingly. Plus, when you learn of the details before you book, you'll know how to adjust your expectations and still enjoy the experience. &#160;<strong><em>&#8212; Lindsay Paige Stein, freelance travel writer</em></strong></p>\n\t5.

COVID restrictions, including social distancing, mask requirements, and even lockdowns, are constantly shifting, from one country to another, and sometimes even within a single country.</p><p>I'm generally a DIY-er when it comes to planning travel, but with Europe's COVID restrictions constantly in flux, it might be wise for Americans to use a travel agent when they can once again visit Europe.</p><p>An experienced agent can respond quickly to any COVID-related issue, whether it's arranging alternative destinations due to a lockdown or managing flights should any problems arise. You may recall in mid-March, following sweeping travel restrictions on Europe, Americans abroad were desperately seeking flights and spending thousands of dollars on return tickets. Hopefully, this won't occur again, but a travel agent is far better positioned to work with airlines to get you home. <strong><em>&#8212; Jennifer Ceaser, freelance travel writer</em></strong></p>\n\t6. Wake up early and do what makes you the most comfortable.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d36277ffa48002894d2c4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"croatia tourist face mask\" height=\"800\" width=\"1066\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&#38;photographer=Marko&#43;Klaric&#43;%2F&#43;EyeEm\" target=\"_blank\">Marko Klaric/EyeEm/Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/safe-vacations-during-covid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our tips on how to plan for safe vacations during COVID-19</a></h2><p>Wake up early. Even when there's not a pandemic, I always try to avoid the crowds while traveling. During a recent trip to the Jersey Shore, I felt much freer to go for a run on the beach or bike down the boardwalk in the morning when there were fewer people.</p><p>And don't let yourself feel silly. If your vacation destination is more crowded than you anticipated, you might see a lot of people walking around without a mask. It's even possible that you'll be the only one following the rules. While no one will tell you to take your mask off, the pressure to fit in is real and can be strong. Be aware that this feeling might come up and be prepared to stick to your guns. <strong><em>&#8212; Jamie Ditaranto, freelance travel writer</em></strong></p>\n\t7.

Plus, not having to deal with airports is a real bonus right now. Taking a train requires a little more time flexibility, but you'll have Wi-Fi and meals available on board so it's easy to work, relax, and watch movies. You'll also arrive right in a city center for added convenience without having to look for parking.</p><p>I hadn't traveled much by train prior to the pandemic, but I'm an absolute convert. The new Amtrak booking engine also shows you how full each service is, making it easier to book with social distancing in mind. <strong><em>&#8212; Paul Oswell, freelance travel writer</em></strong></p>\n\tFor more reporting on safe travel, click a link below to jump directly to related coverage:\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\">Is travel safe?

piece of your swim kit. Besides allowing you to see clearly underwater, goggles protect your eyes from pool water, dirt, chlorine, and other cleaning chemicals. According to the <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/swimming-contacts-your-eyes\">American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>, chlorine washes away your eyes' protective layers of tears, leaving them vulnerable to irritating chemicals and harmful bacteria.

Even worse, clearing them up means having to full stop, only to see them fog up again by the next lap. As gross (and potentially conjunctivitis-causing) as is sounds, I used to spit in my goggles, spread saliva on the inner lenses, and rinse them to prevent fogging. Then my competitive swimmer daughter shared her hack of using baby shampoo. But who's actually toting along baby shampoo and tissues (which you need to keep dry)?</p>\n <p>Instead, opt for the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=41206&amp;u1=biipf_101819_swim-gear-for-workout&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.swimoutlet.com%2Fp%2Fjaws-quick-spit-antifog-6788%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JAWS Quick Spit Antifog Spray</a>.

A cap also helps retain heat, which you lose quickly through your head. Some swimmers even wear two caps for extra warmth.</p>\n <p>Whether you wear one or two caps, you'll have a choice between going for silicone or latex. Silicone caps work well in avoiding pulling on your hair and are thicker than their latex counterparts. Though latex caps are thinner and more likely to pull your hair, they are more economical.&nbsp;</p> A kickboard to build core and leg strength \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5da9fd684af9096eb369e077?format=jpeg\" alt=\"14 important pieces of swim gear\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A7HTE5I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipf_101819_swim-gear-for-workout-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00A7HTE5I&amp;linkId=367c6959040d79ed6d56b3fe8785cc96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">FINIS Alignment Kickboard, $19.99, available on Amazon</a></h3>\n <p>A kickboard is key for honing proper kicking.

But it's actually a 3D-printed steak.</p><p>It's made by the Israeli alternative meat startup <a href=\"https://www.redefinemeat.com/\">Redefine Meat</a>, and the technology behind it is one of many contenders in today's sizzling hot, international race to capitalize on the growing faux-meat market.</p><p>Redefine Meat isn't focusing on alternatives to ground beef or sausages, but whole-cut steaks &#8212; an area of the market that has yet to hit the mainstream.</p><p>\"There is an amazing industry of alternative meat that is focused on minced meat. And actually the meat industry is driven by the whole muscle cuts,\" CEO Eshchar Ben-Shitrit told Reuters. \"Steaks, roast, slow-cooking, grilling &#8212; everything that an animal can do we want to do the same or even better.\"</p><p>Ben-Shitrit is focused on creating industrial-level 3D printers that would ultimately be sold to meat distributors around the globe and become part of the meat supply chain.</p><p>\"The idea is to replace a cow. So each of our machines produce in a day exactly like a cow, up to 250 [kilograms] in a single day,\" he said.</p><p>Faux meat is believed to be significantly better for the environment, requiring less water and energy and releasing fewer fossil fuels than livestock &#8212; the CEO calls it \"the best way to fight climate change, to deliver healthier solutions and food to the entire population of the planet.\"</p><p>At this stage in development, Redefine Meat is not disclosing how much the printers will cost. The plan is to keep the price of their 3D-printed steaks comparable to traditional ones, which can range from $5 to $12 per pound.</p><p>The company aims to debut the steaks at high-end restaurants in Israel, Switzerland, and Germany by the end of 2020.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d64787ffa48002894d405?format=jpeg\" alt=\"3d steak\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Israeli company hopes to release machines that can print 44 pounds of faux steak an hour.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But it will be a while before the printers are part of the meat-industrial complex. Currently the machines only produce up to 13 pounds of meat an hour, and next year, the company plans to release a new generation of machines that will print 44 pounds an hour.&#160;</p><p>By comparison, American slaughterhouses can collectively process over 100,000 cows a day, each of which yields hundreds of pounds of beef.</p><p>In the meat industry, profit margins are greatest on whole-animal cuts, like steaks. The key to those profits is creating a product with the same taste and texture as traditional meat, Redefine Meat food engineer Alexey Tomsov said.</p><p>\"We analyzed the different components that make those beautiful cuts and and &#8230; we identified three main components &#8212; the muscle, the blood, and the fat,\" he said. \"These are the components that we need to mimic in order to reach the perfect, beautiful steak.\"</p><p>Redefine Meat's recipe contains soy and pea proteins, coconut fat, and sunflower oil, among other ingredients. Although the full list is secret, the company says all ingredients are plant-based and vegan.</p><p>The company has some competition.&#160;Israel is a hotspot for alternative meat companies, developing both lab-grown and 3D-printed food. In Spain, the startup Novameat is also working on 3D-printed steaks, and also recently developed a whole-muscle version of pork.

In addition, New York City and other municipalities have imposed a tax on shoppers who need single-use paper bags.</p><p>The easiest way to avoid this inconvenience and fees is to bring your own reusable bags. But there are also added benefits: Reusable shopping bags are stronger than the plastic bags that stores distribute, and they are environmentally friendly since they help cut down on waste and lessen your carbon footprint. Even in many where there aren't any bans on plastic bags, some retailers encourage shoppers to use their own bags.</p><p>Most reusable shopping bags are made of nylon or canvas and come in all shapes and sizes. Though they look similar on the surface, there are subtle differences that make some reusable shopping bags perform better than others. Some, like our top pick, come with their own storage solutions, and others are just cuter and sturdier than the competition.</p><h2>The best reusable shopping and tote bags:</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong>Best reusable overall: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QJA52KS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_031119_best-reusable-shopping-bags-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00QJA52KS&linkId=273b4cc6b47999c7a2dd55b836db21afb47999c7a2dd55b836db21af\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BagPodz Reusable Bag and Storage System</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best canvas: <a href=\"http://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRkpMRUJGSEhLR01CRkpMTUlO?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbaggu.com%2Fcollections%2Fduck-bag&sid=biipgf_031119_best-reusable-shopping-bagsbags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Baggu Duck Bag</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best waxed: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075963J6Z/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_031119_best-reusable-shopping-bags-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B075963J6Z&linkId=4c11321dec99f1ea8f770feb0bf0defeec99f1ea8f770feb0bf0defe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Colony Co.
