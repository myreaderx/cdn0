The Emulator UI is a <strong><em>local</em></strong> web app that allows you to manage <strong><em>local</em></strong> emulators that make up the Firebase Local Emulator Suite.  </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--RWJAFRNnAM/Xsa7rh2ksFI/AAAAAAAAEvw/RlVRiDv70ZEdZ3H1XQ_liq3-y3jWzPLhQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Overview2x.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--RWJAFRNnAM/Xsa7rh2ksFI/AAAAAAAAEvw/RlVRiDv70ZEdZ3H1XQ_liq3-y3jWzPLhQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Overview2x.png\" alt= \"image of Emulator Suite overview\" id=”imgFull” data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"767\" /></a></div></p><p>Last year we released the Emulator Suite to simplify Firebase debugging and development. Until now, the Emulator Suite has only been exposed through the Firebase CLI. Today, the Emulator UI makes it even easier to develop locally with Firebase. </p><h3><strong>Why a local first UI?</strong></h3>  <p>The Emulator UI aims to give you the freedom to develop on Firebase without concerns about billing or breaking a shared environment.  </p><p>Need to create a function that triggers on the creation of a Firestore document? You can write that code, run it locally, and then create a document in the Emulator UI and see the trigger fire. What's better is that you can even see the logs of the local function to help with any debugging or even just to ensure a successful invocation. The goal is to provide you the safety of developing and testing your code without interfering with shared environments, waiting on deploys, or incurring billing costs.  </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nk8E0ir3gf4/Xsa8nNv8A9I/AAAAAAAAEv4/p9UHdkWZNqUz2EHyJ-ovkyIEJ8B03JrhQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/EmulatorSuiteScreenshot.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nk8E0ir3gf4/Xsa8nNv8A9I/AAAAAAAAEv4/p9UHdkWZNqUz2EHyJ-ovkyIEJ8B03JrhQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/EmulatorSuiteScreenshot.png\" alt= \"screenshot of function that triggers on creation of Firestore document\" id=”imgFull” data-original-width=\"512\" data-original-height=\"277\" /></a></div></p><p>The Emulator Suite doesn't just help with developer productivity, it also aims to help with team productivity as well. Having a local first environment also allows you to onboard new developers to your team without them needing to manage a cloud-connected Firebase project. Just run a few CLI commands and the Emulator Suite is up and running with local instances of Firebase services. </p><h3><strong>Local first development</strong></h3>  <p>One of the biggest goals of the Emulator UI is to provide you with a local first workflow. Firebase has always been an online connected service. Most development required managing multiple projects, usually one for production and several others for prototyping, staging and development. The Emulator UI allows you to shift away from needing the online connected project and lets you start your development workflow with local instances. </p><h3><strong>Features to boost productivity</strong></h3>  <p>The Emulator UI is not an exact copy of the online Firebase console. It's tailored for the functionality you need while developing. Here's just a small list of capabilities of the Emulator UI: </p><ul> <li>Boots up in seconds  <li>Advanced data editing in Firestore and Realtime Database  </li></ul><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ko64TCzvVQ4/Xsa9EDNi5tI/AAAAAAAAEwE/LaqNFC6dV4com0eEc3IR-DC0xRq4XfgOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/rtdb-filtering.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ko64TCzvVQ4/Xsa9EDNi5tI/AAAAAAAAEwE/LaqNFC6dV4com0eEc3IR-DC0xRq4XfgOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/rtdb-filtering.gif\" alt= \"gif of advanced data editing in Firestore and Realtime Database\" id=”imgFull” data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1000\" /></a></div></p><ul> <li>Clear all data in Firestore with just one click!

We have plenty of features to simplify development planned for the future. </p><h3><strong>New design for local development</strong></h3>  <p>The emulators were designed to run locally. This means it has a looser set of restrictions on managing your data. We want to provide you the freedom to quickly delete and restore data without having to click through a million prompts. But we also don't want you to confuse a local environment with a production one. We took steps to clarify that you are operating in a local environment. </p><p>The Emulator UI introduces a new color into the Firebase palette. You'll notice as you navigate around, purple is the new primary color for all buttons, hover and selected states, and other primary actions in UI components. Even the favicon is purple! The online Firebase console uses a blue as the main active state color. With just a quick glance you'll be able to see the difference. </p> <p>We also moved the navbar to the top for quick navigation. The Overview page displays the local ports of each instance as a reminder as well. We also provide a link to get your production/managed Firebase project, to help establish you are in a local environment versus a production one. </p><p><em>pssst… </em>If you spend enough time in the Emulator UI, you also might find some new features in the Realtime Database data viewer.  </p><h3><strong>Getting started</strong></h3>  <p>Make sure you update the Firebase CLI to version 8.4.0 and run the following command: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">firebase init</pre>  <p>Select the products you need to initialize. Which means if this is a first time setup, you'll need to set up each Firebase product you need, such as Cloud Functions, Firestore and Realtime Database rules, as well as Hosting sites. Once everything you need is initialized, run the following command: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">firebase emulators:start</pre>  <p>This will start the Emulator UI on <code>localhost:4000</code> by default. Open your browser to that URL and you'll see the Emulator UI up and running. </p><h3><strong>Let us know what you need!</strong></h3>  <p>We are so excited to see the community use the Emulator UI.

For the past year, we've been releasing Firebase Kotlin extension (KTX) libraries alongside our Android Java SDKs to give Kotlin developers the best of both worlds. </p><p><strong>Today, we're happy to announce that these KTX libraries are out of Beta and recommended for all Firebase developers using Kotlin in their Android apps!</strong></p><p>So what does this mean for you? </p><ul> <li>Full <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/kotlin/packages\">reference docs</a> for all of our KTX libraries  <li>Kotlin snippets in our <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides\">documentation</a> will now use KTX syntax  <li>Kotlin code in our <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android\">samples</a> will now use KTX syntax  </li></ul><p>To get started with our KTX libraries, look for the <code>-ktx</code> suffix in the \"Kotlin+KTX\" section of our <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android\">available Android libraries</a>.  As an example, let's see what it looks like to set up Remote Config with and without the KTX library. </p><p><strong>app/build.gradle (before)</strong></p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-config:19.1.2'</pre>  <p><strong>MainActivity.kt (before)</strong></p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val remoteConfig = FirebaseRemoteConfig.getInstance()<br /><br />val configSettings = FirebaseRemoteConfigSettings.Builder()<br />        .setMinimumFetchIntervalInSeconds(3600)<br />        .setFetchTimeoutInSeconds(60)<br />        .build()<br />remoteConfig.setConfigSettingsAsync(configSettings)</pre>  <p><strong>app/build.gradle (after)</strong></p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// The -ktx library has a dependency on the firebase-config library<br />implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-config-ktx:19.1.2'</pre>  <p><strong>MainActivity.kt (after)</strong></p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// New global \"Firebase\" class<br />val remoteConfig = Firebase.remoteConfig<br /><br />// New settings builder syntax<br />val configSettings = remoteConfigSettings {<br />    minimumFetchIntervalInSeconds = 3600<br />    fetchTimeoutInSeconds = 60<br />}<br />remoteConfig.setConfigSettingsAsync(configSettings)</pre>  <p>And the KTX libraries that we have available today are just the beginning, as we're working hard to add coverage for all Firebase products and add new Kotlin-focused features in the near future! </p><p>We wouldn't have been able to release these KTX libraries without the help of all the Kotlin enthusiasts in the Firebase community.  We'd like to give a special shout out to <a href=\"https://github.com/rosariopfernandes\">Rosário Pereira Fernandes</a> who contributed so much excellent code and documentation to the KTX effort. </p><p>If you have feedback or want to contribute, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk\">find us on GitHub</a>. </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/9zvkJ2eRNoU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 16:18:00 +0000","feedId":10592,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Anwf6yuljg/XnOeisJJhSI/AAAAAAAAEsQ/3hFsXU3KmawsUZcHGa_zGDiKZrzIb5olwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sam%2Bstern.jpeg","linkMd5":"bc7c71b64082e57271e8f25839618756","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn37@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-34-637_57a0a36438c9877a.webp","destWidth":320,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":21217,"destBytes":9196,"author":"Firebase","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Anwf6yuljg/XnOeisJJhSI/AAAAAAAAEsQ/3hFsXU3KmawsUZcHGa_zGDiKZrzIb5olwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sam%2Bstern.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn37@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-34-637_57a0a36438c9877a.webp","https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZVF6MGMGzhk/XnpStE1N1EI/AAAAAAAAEtc/a0GA8nmG2bcnBfuiTG9LiKz-2pqkXAuNQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Firebase_KTX.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-58-42-154_9f4f933f4a7154c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/9zvkJ2eRNoU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-58-42-114_cb17d27348e4f4bd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317114229},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","title":"Firebase Compatibility with Unity 2020.1 and Later","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~3/wWixEp6CKYA/firebase-compatibility-with-unity-20201.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XAe_-wD8fRs/XzbOu7yG3XI/AAAAAAAAE8Q/ZXsKyOCaKgYrdH20iNXPv6rlTWLkXg11gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Firebase%2B.jpg\"><img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XAe_-wD8fRs/XzbOu7yG3XI/AAAAAAAAE8Q/ZXsKyOCaKgYrdH20iNXPv6rlTWLkXg11gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Firebase%2B.jpg\"> <figure class=\"profile\"> <div class=\"profile-picture\">    <img style=\"margin:0;\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qr_GjsVjC_A/Xza1nzp-ayI/AAAAAAAAE8E/M7vo2W74yY88UDcIoYH-3yrRBgr9v5Q7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Patrick%2BMartin%2B.webp\" />  </div><figcaption>    <strong><div> Patrick Martin</div></strong>      <em>Developer Advocate</em>  </figcaption></figure> <p>Firebase is committed to building an easy to use and robust backend service for Unity developers. Recent changes in the build system accompanying Unity 2020.1 have caused some of the integrations that the Firebase games team built for Unity to stop functioning correctly. Our team is aware of this, and is working hard to rectify the situation. Until then, we recommend that you continue to use Unity 2019 for the best developer experience. For those of you that are on Unity 2020.1, the rest of this post details the workarounds needed to get things up and running. </p><h1>What happened?</h1>  <p>The Firebase SDK for Unity includes native C++ code and Android specific logic. It also  requires some build time operations for all of its products to function properly. Because of this, we have written a number of tools and custom routines that make strong assumptions about Unity’s build process. These continue to work to simplify integration back to Unity version 5, but in Unity 2020.1 the engine overhauled its build system invalidating our previous assumptions. This means that the mechanism by which <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx\">AndroidX</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier\">Jetifier</a> are integrated no longer functions as well as the mechanism by which the information in <code>google-services.json</code> is transmitted to your final Android game. This is required to initialize the Android side of Firebase and to properly hook it up to the Firebase backend. </p><p>Further, components that the Crashlytics SDK requires to function are no longer generated. In the worst case scenario, this manifests in a crash on launch. </p><h1>Can I use Firebase with Unity 2020.1 now?</h1>  <p>Although we recommend sticking with the 2019 branch of Unity for the best experience, Unity’s new build system is very similar to a typical Android Java project. This simplifies the workaround we will highlight below, and will mirror some steps in the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup\">getting started with Android guide</a>. </p><p>Note that because you are performing operations that the Firebase SDK would typically handle automatically, you may have to undo any changes when a full fix is rolled out by our team. </p><h2>Getting Firebase Running</h2>  <p>The first fix is to help Firebase find your <code>google-services.json</code> file. Normally the Firebase Unity Plugin would do this automatically, replicating the work of the Google Services plugin Android developers may be familiar with. When you add or update your <code>google-services.json</code> file, the plugin creates a version that Android reads as a “<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources\">resource</a>” at <code>Assets/Plugins/Android/Firebase/res/values/google-services.xml</code>. Typically this would get copied into your final project automatically, but we can do a little manual work to ensure it gets included! </p><p>First generate a custom <code>mainTemplate.gradle</code> and <code>gradleTemplate.properties</code> (which we’ll need in a moment) via <code>Project Settings/Player/Publishing Settings</code> if you haven’t already: </p> <center> <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aj9qfVQUWwc/XzahoLfIQjI/AAAAAAAAE7o/nJIaH8SXEzIa93kiwyfimWXpBrpqvDeRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style= \"width: 500px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aj9qfVQUWwc/XzahoLfIQjI/AAAAAAAAE7o/nJIaH8SXEzIa93kiwyfimWXpBrpqvDeRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25281%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"952\" data-original-height=\"897\" alt= image of project settings /></a> </center>  <p>If you’ve disabled EDM4U’s integration or you just want to be extra careful, now is a great time to also force resolve your Android dependencies from <code>Assets/External Dependency Manager/Android Resolver/Force Resolve</code>. This will update <code>mainTemplate.gradle</code> in a manner that still cuts back on most of the work we’ll have to do: </p> <center> <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IMO9tfskWVs/Xzah_F-wh4I/AAAAAAAAE7w/aKNluf_GYY4sd8pie_s5gEKowB5OdH6cgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25282%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style= \"width:500px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IMO9tfskWVs/Xzah_F-wh4I/AAAAAAAAE7w/aKNluf_GYY4sd8pie_s5gEKowB5OdH6cgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25282%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"758\" data-original-height=\"712\" alt= image of assets settings /></a> </center> <p>Now you need to tell gradle where to find the <code>google-services.xml</code> file by adding this to the very bottom of your <code>mainTemplate.gradle</code>: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">android {<br />    sourceSets {<br />        main {<br />            def unityProjectPath = $/file:///**DIR_UNITYPROJECT**/$.replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")<br />            res.srcDirs += (unityProjectPath +  '/Assets/Plugins/Android/Firebase/res/values/google-services.xml')<br />        }<br />    }<br />}</pre>  <p>There’s one more fix to get base functionality working in Unity, you’ll see that towards the top of <code>mainTemplate.gradle</code> there are some lines like: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Android Resolver Repos Start<br />([rootProject] + (rootProject.subprojects as List)).each {<br />    ext {<br />        it.setProperty(\"android.useAndroidX\", true)<br />        it.setProperty(\"android.enableJetifier\", true)<br />    }<br />}</pre>  <p>This code used to go through every project in the build and enable AndroidX and Jetifier. Although we could perform a similar modification via gradle, Android developers are generally encouraged to use <code>gradleTemplate.properties</code> - which is supported via Unity’s new build pipeline. </p><p>So if you remembered to generate it earlier in the tutorial, add the following lines to the end of <code>gradleTemplate.properties</code>: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">android.useAndroidX=true<br />android.enableJetifier=true</pre>  <p>At this point, most of Firebase should function. This includes your ability to measure your game’s performance with <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics\">Google Analytics</a>, use that to customize your player’s experience with <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config\">Remote Config</a>, and  to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/auth\">Authenticate</a> you user to begin your game’s connection social experience. </p><h2>Crashlytics Support</h2>  <p>Crashlytics needs a little more work to get operational since it has to embed itself a little deeper into the build process. To continue, you will need the <code>baseProjectTemplate.gradle</code> (the “project level gradle file”). You’ll also need <code>launcherTemplate.gradle</code> since we need an “Application” for Crashlytics (<code>mainTemplate.gradle</code> is technically a “Library”): </p> <center> <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s0Sd14HG8sQ/XzaiaxshPJI/AAAAAAAAE74/EqgcK4cAkeo_Osf_N2cMm9bPVQFQQSe4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/play%2Bsettings%2B2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width: 500px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s0Sd14HG8sQ/XzaiaxshPJI/AAAAAAAAE74/EqgcK4cAkeo_Osf_N2cMm9bPVQFQQSe4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/play%2Bsettings%2B2.png\" data-original-width=\"512\" data-original-height=\"482\"  alt= image of player settings/></a> </center> <p>There’s no need to Force Resolve dependencies again since EDM4U doesn’t know about these files yet! But you can always do it to be safe (the way I modified <code>mainTemplate.gradle</code> purposely avoids bits of the file that would get updated). </p><p>Now open <code>baseProjectTemplate.gradle</code> and look for something that looks roughly like: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">allprojects {<br />    buildscript {<br />        repositories {**ARTIFACTORYREPOSITORY**<br />            google()<br />            jcenter()<br />        }<br /><br />        dependencies {</pre>  <p>Inside <code>allprojects.buildscript.dependencies</code> (the <code>dependencies {</code> bit in this example), add this code to tell gradle about Crashlytics: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Add the Crashlytics Gradle plugin.<br />classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.2.0'</pre>  <p>and this line of code to the very end of <code>launcherTemplate.gradle</code> to add the Crashlytics plugin to your Application: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Apply the Crashlytics Gradle plugin<br />apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'</pre>  <h1>Wrap Up</h1>  <p>We are working hard to resolve these issues  as soon as possible so you can go back to building games quickly, easily, and confidently, with Firebase and Unity.

</div><figcaption>    <strong><div>Todd Kerpelman</div></strong>      <em>Developer Advocate</em>  </figcaption></figure> <p>Hello, game developers! </p><p>Well, this has certainly been a challenging couple of months. We had been looking forward to meeting you in person last week at the Game Developers Conference, sharing some updates, and hearing directly from all of you. But, obviously, plans change, and we're committed to doing whatever it takes to keep everybody safe. Even if it means recording session videos from our kid's bedroom and hoping the cat doesn't wander into the scene. </p><p>Still, our teams have been working hard to ensure you have all the tools and resources you need to build great games. This year at our digital Google for Games Developer Summit (which you can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIKArZgMoMHQCSzQm2imLKy4\">find here</a> if you missed it), we announced some new features that will help you spend less time on infrastructure work, and more time on making your game fun and unique. Let's take a look at some of these now, shall we? </p><h2>Cloud Firestore for game developers in open alpha</h2><p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore\">Cloud Firestore</a> is our next generation, scalable NoSQL database in the cloud. It offers features that database aficionados love, like multi-region reliability (for five 9s of uptime), atomic transactions, robust offline support, and realtime listeners that let you build some really great gameplay experiences. And we're happy to announce that alpha versions of our SDKs are now available for C++ and Unity developers.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NB2VrCD8N3E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Cloud Firestore can be used in many different situations. You could use it to simply save your users' game state to the cloud. Or save a shared game state to be viewed by several different clients in a multiplayer game. Use it to post daily challenges or user-generated content that can be easily queried and viewed by millions of clients. Or build a sophisticated caching layer on top of your existing game server, so you can share your latest gameplay data from your role-playing game or collectible card game with millions of clients, without having to worry about them hitting your server directly.</p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-se1maP9B4Mw/XnfKIZM-SAI/AAAAAAAAEs8/UMMES1YihigSI9d-E2M6i9HizPDbOBLoACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cloudfirestore.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-se1maP9B4Mw/XnfKIZM-SAI/AAAAAAAAEs8/UMMES1YihigSI9d-E2M6i9HizPDbOBLoACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cloudfirestore.png\" data-original-width=\"1218\" data-original-height=\"773\" alt=\"cloud firestore animation\" /></a><p>Cloud Firestore for C++/Unity is open for anybody to download and use as an open <em>alpha</em> release. This alpha tag means it still has some rough edges here and there. Specifically, the Unity version of the SDK is missing some of the more advanced querying features. And there's a good chance the API will change in the coming months, which means you'll need to change your method names in the future. But we wanted to give you a chance to try it out, see what cool stuff you can build, and let us know how we can make it better. </p><p>And none of this is to say that the Realtime Database is going away -- it's still a great option for many situations. In fact, the Google Doodle team just used it to power the <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/01/google-loteria-realtime-database.html\">Loteria Google Doodle</a> that ran on the Google homepage in December. But if you're a game developer who's been pining away for all the great new features that Cloud Firestore has available, you can stop all that pining and start building. </p><h2>Improved package management in Unity</h2><p>The Firebase Unity SDKs are now compatible with the Unity Package Manager. This means that in supported versions of Unity, Firebase will be easier to keep up to date and the Firebase plugin will no longer have to be mixed in with the rest of your game’s assets. The process of doing this is automated with an open source tool that used to be known as the Play Services Resolver, but is now known as the External Dependency Manager for Unity, or what we've been calling \"EDM4U\" around the office.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0x_5dmEq3M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Note, of course, that using these tools are completely optional. We know that many of you prefer having manual control over all of your libraries, and if you want to keep managing them yourselves, you're more than welcome.</p><h2>New Analytics reports</h2><p>Our friends over at <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics\">Google Analytics</a> have built a number of new reports that will be of interest to game developers, business analysts, or anybody who wants to grow a successful gaming business.</p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tOqmT9NIWHc/XnfKtLyxKBI/AAAAAAAAEtA/iI-1WshEcuYUsy6THsJgmfFO8uw1SbkPQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/new%2Banalytics%2Breports.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tOqmT9NIWHc/XnfKtLyxKBI/AAAAAAAAEtA/iI-1WshEcuYUsy6THsJgmfFO8uw1SbkPQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/new%2Banalytics%2Breports.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"836\" alt=\"Google Analytics dashboard\"/></a><p>They've added new dashboards centered around user acquisition, retention, user engagement, and monetization, along with some new reports and visualizations that you've been asking for, like First-time Buyers, Revenue Heartbeat, User Engagement (in game days), and trending DAU / MAU (a good measure of \"stickiness\"). </p><p>These new reports are available for all Firebase developers if you've <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/07/firebase-google-analytics-upgrade.html\">linked your Firebase project</a> to a GA account. You'll just need to head on over to the Google Analytics console to see these reports in detail.

Cloud Logging, previously known as Stackdriver Logging, makes it easy to view, search, and filter logs. You can learn from where and when you have visits to your site, your site's response statuses, the latency of end user requests, and more. </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OKZHP7mzl-U/Xz7JTIXDLLI/AAAAAAAAE9I/GpRPVyvCf70w8COWT4-QJf8Ya4UObhqmwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ReportLogging.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OKZHP7mzl-U/Xz7JTIXDLLI/AAAAAAAAE9I/GpRPVyvCf70w8COWT4-QJf8Ya4UObhqmwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ReportLogging.gif\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1000\" alt=\"Report Logging\"/></a></p><p>To get started, link your Firebase project to Cloud Logging in the <em><a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/integrations/cloudlogging\">Cloud Logging integration card</a></em> in the Firebase console or visit the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/web-request-logs-and-metrics\">Hosting docs</a> to learn more. </p><p><h2>Better compression with Brotli</h2></p><p>Hosting will now compress your assets with Brotli encoding. We’ll automatically serve the smallest, best-compressed version of your content, based on what your user's client is able to handle. </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ujXuhw4sh5A/Xz7Lbt-D7XI/AAAAAAAAE9U/hkYWVwjMoPQMpuZyAhNYmDBDZwfHsu36gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/FirebaseBrotli.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ujXuhw4sh5A/Xz7Lbt-D7XI/AAAAAAAAE9U/hkYWVwjMoPQMpuZyAhNYmDBDZwfHsu36gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/FirebaseBrotli.gif\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1000\" alt=\"Firebase Brotli\" /></a></p><p>Brotli compression gives you a boost in performance because assets are smaller, use less bandwidth, and are delivered more quickly to your end users. This means you’ll have lower bandwidth costs, while your end users will enjoy faster sites. </p><p>The best part? You’ll get this automatically the next time you deploy. <br></p><p><h2>Easier internationalization</h2></p><p>We know it’s important to you to provide a great experience for your users everywhere. Firebase Hosting now supports serving country and language specific content, backed by the power of our global CDN. Previously, the best strategy was to use Cloud Functions to look at the country and/or language code and reply with a redirect as necessary. </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oDtsRJ5tyd4/Xz7LluPkTTI/AAAAAAAAE9Y/AKXexZt635QKeIBKlE-FydFxbULhWUqfQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/i18n.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oDtsRJ5tyd4/Xz7LluPkTTI/AAAAAAAAE9Y/AKXexZt635QKeIBKlE-FydFxbULhWUqfQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/i18n.png\" data-original-width=\"814\" data-original-height=\"507\" a;t=\"i18n\" /></a></p><p>Firebase Hosting’s i18n rewrites allow developers to serve different content, depending on a user's language preferences or country location. In your public directory, create an i18n directory containing separate folders for each language/country combination, then add the <code>i18n</code> field to your project's <code>firebase.json</code> config. I18n rewrites also work for localized 404 pages.

Since then, tens of thousands of apps have adopted the Beta SDK, and several hundreds of millions of end-users are using apps that include the SDK. Thank you to the adopters of our Beta SDKs; with your help, we have been able to polish and debug our SDK so we could ship it in its best possible launch state. </p><p>We are excited to announce that the Firebase Crashlytics SDK is now publicly available!  Whether your app was migrated from Fabric or created in Firebase, we encourage you to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/upgrade-sdk\">upgrade to the official version of the Firebase Crashlytics SDK</a>. </p><p>Now that the Firebase Crashlytics SDK is publicly available, we are deprecating the legacy Fabric SDK. The Fabric SDK will continue reporting your app's crashes until November 15, 2020. On this date, the Fabric SDK, and beta versions of the Firebase Crashlytics SDK, will no longer send crashes to your Firebase dashboard. To continue getting crash reports in the Firebase console, make sure your app has the following versions of the Firebase Crashlytics SDK, or newer: 17.0.0+ for Android, 4.0.0+ for iOS, and 6.15.0+ for Unity. Developers new to Crashlytics should begin with our <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started-new-sdk\">getting started docs</a>. </p><p>As always, we’d love to hear your feedback!

It is used in many of Google’s major mobile apps, as well as applications by third-party developers. When deploying TensorFlow Lite models in production, you may come across situations where you need some support features that are not provided out-of-the-box by the framework, such as: </p><ul> <li>over-the-air deployment of TensorFlow Lite models  <li>measure model inference speed in user devices  <li>A/B test multiple model versions in production </li></ul><p>In these cases, instead of building your own solutions, you can leverage Firebase to quickly implement these features in just a few lines of code. </p><p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> is the comprehensive app development platform by Google, which provides you infrastructure and libraries to make app development easier for both Android and iOS. <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml\">Firebase Machine Learning</a> offers multiple solutions for using machine learning in mobile applications.  </p><p>In this blog post, we show you how to leverage Firebase to enhance your deployment of TensorFlow Lite models in production. We also have codelabs for both <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/digitclassifier-android/index.html\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/digitclassifier-ios/index.html\">iOS</a> to show you step-by-step of how to integrate the Firebase features into your TensorFlow Lite app. </p><h2>Deploy model over-the-air instantly</h2>  <p>You may want to deploy your machine learning model over-the-air to your users instead of bundling it into your app binary. For example, the machine learning team who builds the model has a different release cycle with the mobile app team and they want to release new models independently with the mobile app release. In another example, you may want to lazy-load machine learning models, to save device storage for users who don’t need the ML-powered feature and reduce your app size for faster download from Play Store and App Store. </p><p>With Firebase Machine Learning, you can deploy models instantly. You can upload your TensorFlow Lite model to Firebase from the Firebase Console.  </p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R-LYYOeaK7k/XvVH3SASOlI/AAAAAAAAE0o/Dl4UXcTu-Kc95KyrvtpoiGbJ2XxgIOFFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/machinelearning.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R-LYYOeaK7k/XvVH3SASOlI/AAAAAAAAE0o/Dl4UXcTu-Kc95KyrvtpoiGbJ2XxgIOFFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/machinelearning.png\" data-original-width=\"1239\" data-original-height=\"743\" /></a><p>You can also upload your model to Firebase using the Firebase ML <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml/manage-hosted-models\">Model Management API</a>. This is especially useful when you have a machine learning pipeline that automatically retrains models with new data and uploads them directly to Firebase. Here is a code snippet in Python to upload a TensorFlow Lite model to Firebase ML.  </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\"># Load a tflite file and upload it to Cloud Storage.<br />source = ml.TFLiteGCSModelSource.from_tflite_model_file('example.tflite')<br /><br /># Create the model object.<br />tflite_format = ml.TFLiteFormat(tflite_source=source)<br />model = ml.Model(display_name=\"example_model\", model_format=tflite_format)<br /><br /># Add the model to your Firebase project and publish it.<br />new_model = ml.create_model(model)<br />ml.publish_model(new_model.model_id)</pre>  <p>Once your TensorFlow Lite model has been uploaded to Firebase, you can download it in your mobile app at any time and initialize a TensorFlow Lite interpreter with the downloaded model. Here is how you do it on Android. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val remoteModel = FirebaseCustomRemoteModel.Builder(\"example_model\").build()<br /><br />// Get the last/cached model file.<br />FirebaseModelManager.getInstance().getLatestModelFile(remoteModel)<br />  .addOnCompleteListener { task -><br />    val modelFile = task.result<br />    if (modelFile != null) {<br />      // Initialize a TF Lite interpreter with the downloaded model.<br />      interpreter = Interpreter(modelFile)<br />    }<br />  }</pre>  <h2>Measure inference speed on user devices</h2>  <p>There is a diverse range of mobile devices available in the market nowadays, from flagship devices with powerful chips optimized to run machine learning models to cheap devices with low-end CPUs. Therefore, your model inference speed on your users’ devices may vary largely across your user base, leaving you wondering if your model is too slow or even unusable for some of your users with low-end devices. </p><p>You can use Performance Monitoring to measure how long your model inference takes across all of your user devices. As it is impractical to have all devices available in the market for testing in advance, the best way to find out about your model performance in production is to directly measure it on user devices. Firebase Performance Monitoring is a general purpose tool for measuring performance of mobile apps, so you also can measure any arbitrary process in your app, such as pre-processing or post-processing code. Here is how you do it on Android. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Initialize a Firebase Performance Monitoring trace<br />val modelInferenceTrace = firebasePerformance.newTrace(\"model_inference\")<br /><br />// Run inference with TensorFlow Lite<br />interpreter.run(...)<br /><br />// End the Firebase Performance Monitoring trace<br />modelInferenceTrace.stop()</pre>  <p>Performance data measured on each user device is uploaded to Firebase server and aggregated to provide a big picture of your model performance across your user base. From the Firebase console, you can easily identify devices that demonstrate slow inference, or see how inference speed differs between OS versions. </p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XMutFj1xbb0/XvVICzL7E0I/AAAAAAAAE0s/gwe7n2fMHQc7ErjXU_IbCIf2z6vv45ggQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/inferencespeeds.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XMutFj1xbb0/XvVICzL7E0I/AAAAAAAAE0s/gwe7n2fMHQc7ErjXU_IbCIf2z6vv45ggQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/inferencespeeds.png\" data-original-width=\"923\" data-original-height=\"828\" /></a> <h2>A/B test multiple model versions</h2>  <p>When you iterate on your machine learning model and come up with an improved model, you may feel very eager to release it to a production right away. However, it is not rare that a model may perform well on test data but fail badly in production. Therefore, the best practice is to roll out your model to a smaller set of users, A/B test it with the original model and closely monitor how it affects your important business metrics before releasing it to all of your users. </p><p>Firebase A/B Testing enables you to run this kind of A/B testing with minimal effort. The steps required are: </p><ol> <li>Upload all TensorFlow Lite model versions that you want to test to Firebase, giving each one a different name.  <li>Setup Firebase Remote Config in the Firebase console to manage the TensorFlow Lite model name used in the app.   <ul>  <li>Update the client app to fetch TensorFlow Lite model name from Remote Config and download the corresponding TensorFlow Lite model from Firebase. </li>  </ul> <li>Setup A/B testing in the Firebase console.  <ul>  <li>Decide the testing plan (e.g. how many percent of your user base to test each model version).   <li>Decide the metric(s) that you want to optimize for (e.g. number of conversions, user retention etc.). </li>  </ul></li>  </ol><p>Here is an example of setting up an A/B test with TensorFlow Lite models. We deliver each of two versions of our model to 50% of our user base and with the goal of optimizing for multiple metrics. </p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7Ql2cCC_9o/XvVINSAFWWI/AAAAAAAAE00/40oEWia7vhggsRKGhjAKbk5eCObooO4VACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/experimentoverview.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7Ql2cCC_9o/XvVINSAFWWI/AAAAAAAAE00/40oEWia7vhggsRKGhjAKbk5eCObooO4VACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/experimentoverview.png\" data-original-width=\"902\" data-original-height=\"715\" /></a><p>Then we change our app to fetch the model name from Firebase and use it to download the TensorFlow Lite model assigned to each device. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val remoteConfig = Firebase.remoteConfig<br />remoteConfig.fetchAndActivate()<br />  .addOnCompleteListener(this) { task -><br />      // Get the model name from Firebase Remote Config<br />      val modelName = remoteConfig[\"model_name\"].asString()<br />      <br />      // Download the model from Firebase ML<br />      val remoteModel = FirebaseCustomRemoteModel.Builder(modelName).build()<br />      val manager = FirebaseModelManager.getInstance()<br />      manager.download(remoteModel).addOnCompleteListener {<br />        // Initialize a TF Lite interpreter with the downloaded model<br />        interpreter = Interpreter(modelFile)<br />      }<br />  }</pre>  <p>After you have started the A/B test, Firebase will automatically aggregate the metrics on how your users react to different versions of your model and show you which version performs better. Once you are confident with the A/B test result, you can roll out the better version to all of your users with just one click. </p><a

data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"476\" />  <p>Our team is driven by the belief that apps have drastically improved the way we live, work, learn, and socialize, keeping us connected to each other and plugged into the information we need. Now more than ever, we understand the importance of supporting our developer community by ensuring you have the technology and resources you need to keep your business up and running. Whether you’re a high-growth startup or a global enterprise, we’re still here to help you build and operate your app. </p><a name='more'></a><p>While we aren’t able to meet in person, last month we launched <a href=\"http://firebase.google.com/live\">Firebase Live</a>, a month-long web series consisting of talks, tips, and technical tutorials aimed at increasing your <strong>productivity, knowledge, and connectivity</strong>. During Firebase Live, we released 5 videos, 4 codelab walkthrough videos, an interactive demo, tons of product updates, and answered hundreds of questions from the thousands of developers that joined us live. If you missed the online event - or if you simply want a refresher - here’s a recap of everything we announced plus highlights of our recent launches. </p><h2>Firebase tools for boosting productivity </h2>  <p>We know first-hand that when you’re working from home, you face a new set of distractions. With the following Firebase tools, you can accelerate app development, create efficient workflows, and ship your app faster so you remain productive.  </p><h3><strong>Introducing the new emulator UI for local development</strong></h3>  <p>Last year, we launched the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite\">Firebase Emulator Suite</a> to let you run emulated versions of our backend products for a faster and safer development experience. We heard from you that you also wanted a visual tool that could help you develop locally and do things like filter through logs and test your data structures.  </p><p>That’s why we recently launched the <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/05/local-firebase-emulator-ui.html\">new local emulator UI</a> into beta, which makes  it possible to run services <em>locally</em> on your machine via a web app with a distinguishable UI. Now, you can develop and test your code in a safe sandbox environment without interfering with shared environments, waiting on deploys, or incurring billing costs. Not only does the emulator UI boost developer productivity with features like advanced data editing and searching, it also increases <em>team</em> productivity because you can onboard new developers with just a handful of CLI commands that create local instances of Firebase services in minutes. By shifting to a local-first developer workflow, you get the freedom to experiment and rapidly iterate, without the fear of breaking anything.  </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1_HnklDBkA8/XxfR3VFUFEI/AAAAAAAAE2o/BdcwwvDORdkuZvQvqMdIHX2pEMvjQQ8CACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/01-%2BEmulator%2BSuite.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1_HnklDBkA8/XxfR3VFUFEI/AAAAAAAAE2o/BdcwwvDORdkuZvQvqMdIHX2pEMvjQQ8CACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/01-%2BEmulator%2BSuite.png\" data-original-width=\"1309\" data-original-height=\"627\" /></a></div></p><p>You can learn how to set up these emulators to quickly prototype and develop, create better unit and integration tests, and get a walkthrough of the new emulator UI in the below video from Firebase Live. </p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkgvFNPdiEs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h3><strong>Simplifying the process of writing and testing security rules</strong></h3>  <p>One of the new features of the Emulator Suite is that it supports instant code reload of <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules\">security rules</a>, which are the main line of defense between your database and untrustworthy clients. In addition, we’ve recently made <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/06/new-firestore-security-rules-features.html\">several other improvements</a> to the tools for writing, debugging, and monitoring security rules, including making the rules language itself more expressive, streamlining rule logic, and adding local variables - a highly requested feature now available with functions! </p><p>Traditionally, security rules haven’t been the most straightforward thing to develop or test. Our goal with these updates is to significantly improve this process and make a lot of formerly difficult tasks easier. In the following video from Firebase Live, you can learn how to efficiently unit test your security rules using helpful libraries and the latest Firebase Emulator Suite so you can feel confident that the rules will work as you expect when deployed.  </p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDulvfBpzZE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><strong><h3>Painless user authentication with Sign in with Apple</strong></h3>  <p><strong></strong>Authenticating your users is the first step in giving them a personalized app experience. But building and maintaining your own authentication system can take months. <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/auth\">Firebase Authentication</a> offers you a complete, customizable, end-to-end identity solution that can be set up in under 10 lines of code. It makes it quick and easy to sign in and verify your users using a variety of popular identity providers, including email and password, phone authentication, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and more. During our last release, we added <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/11/sign-in-with-apple-auth.html\">beta support for Sign in with Apple</a> which allows users to log into your mobile apps, web apps, and games using their Apple ID.  </p><p>On top of updating our<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/apple\"> comprehensive docs and code samples</a>, we used Firebase Live as an opportunity to create a new video showing you how to implement Sign in with Apple using Firebase Authentication. Check it out below.  </p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxQsdhglZtE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h3><strong>New Stripe extensions for payment processing</strong></h3>  <p>Since launching <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions\">Extensions</a>, which are pre-packaged bundles of code that automate common tasks in your projects to save you time, at Firebase Summit last year, we’ve received tons of requests for more extensions doing even more useful things. We recently unveiled two brand new extensions built in partnership with our friends at <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a>. The first one, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/firestore-invoice-stripe\">Send Invoices with Stripe,</a> lets you programmatically create and send branded customer invoices using the Stripe payments platform. The second extension, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/firestore-stripe-subscriptions\">Run Subscription Payments with Stripe</a>, can be used to create and sync subscriptions for your web users with Stripe, as well as control access to subscription content via Firebase Authentication. You don’t need to learn Stripe’s API or figure out how to integrate Stripe with Firebase, simply install these extensions and you’re ready to go.  </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5GhR0KpW7a0/XxfR8eR0q4I/AAAAAAAAE2s/GCUtDEe9yOAXYWI0nvF8pXCEs0IhcF0IQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/02-%2Btypographic%2Binvoice.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5GhR0KpW7a0/XxfR8eR0q4I/AAAAAAAAE2s/GCUtDEe9yOAXYWI0nvF8pXCEs0IhcF0IQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/02-%2Btypographic%2Binvoice.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"900\" /></a></div></p><h3><strong>Enhancing TensorFlow Lite model deployment with Firebase</strong></h3>  <p>We know many of you are looking to, or have already, started adding ML capabilities to your apps. Whether you are starting with an existing <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models\">TensorFlow Lite model</a> or training your own, you can use <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/ml\">Firebase ML</a> model deployment to distribute models to your users over the air. This reduces initial app installation size, since models are downloaded by the device only when needed, and allows you to A/B test multiple models, evaluate their performance, and update models regularly without having to republish your entire app.  </p><p>We recently released the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml/manage-hosted-models\">ML Model Management API</a> to deploy models programmatically instead of going through the console. This is especially useful when you have a machine learning pipeline that automatically retrains models with new data, since you can now upload the updated models to Firebase programmatically. You can read more on how to <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/06/enhance-your-tensorflow-lite-deployment-with-firebase.html\">use Firebase to enhance your TensorFlow Lite deployments</a> and try out our new codelabs (<a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/digitclassifier-android/index.html\">Android</a> version or <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/digitclassifier-ios/index.html\">iOS</a> version) to learn step by step how to deploy and experiment with multiple models. </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gDD7wIm1zLE/XxfSA66drjI/AAAAAAAAE2w/8FYN4jR4SyIAXRE6oy61UxbYF_jjU-gFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/03-%2BFirebase%2Bscreenshot.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gDD7wIm1zLE/XxfSA66drjI/AAAAAAAAE2w/8FYN4jR4SyIAXRE6oy61UxbYF_jjU-gFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/03-%2BFirebase%2Bscreenshot.png\" data-original-width=\"1348\" data-original-height=\"742\" /></a></div></p><h2>Firebase tools to stay connected </h2>  <p>In this era of social distancing and remote work, Firebase can keep you connected to the things that matter most to your business. We want to help you stay attuned to your app’s analytics and performance data, meaningfully adapt your apps’ features and UI to the current climate, and continue to delight users with personalized experiences.  </p><h3><strong>New organizational and targeting tools for your app config</strong></h3>  <p>Changing your app config can be risky and complicated. With <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config\">Firebase Remote Config</a>, you can dynamically alter the behavior and appearance of your app with confidence - without having to publish a new version of your app. Over the past few months, we’ve been adding new features to Remote Config to give you a greater understanding of your active app configuration and better organizational and targeting tools so you can focus on the parameters you care about most.  </p><p>Earlier this year, we brought information about your A/B tests into the Remote Config panel giving you insight into how currently running experiments are impacting your app configuration. Then, we launched parameter groups, making it easy to classify, change, and delineate key params. These new Remote Config features give teams the power to structure and divide their params in a way that suits their needs, minimizes risk, and makes their app config more manageable.  </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cY9PjBpSXgo/XxfSImiHE8I/AAAAAAAAE20/t3OPexX8UgQN9kh8FbuocR3yLfeokYc2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/04-%2Bremote%2Bconfig.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cY9PjBpSXgo/XxfSImiHE8I/AAAAAAAAE20/t3OPexX8UgQN9kh8FbuocR3yLfeokYc2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/04-%2Bremote%2Bconfig.png\" data-original-width=\"1440\" data-original-height=\"789\" /></a></div></p><h3><strong>Introducing Crashlytics BigQuery streaming</strong></h3>  <p>When your app runs into stability issues, you want to be told as soon as possible - even if you’re away from your desk. Now, you can stream your <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics\">Firebase Crashlytics</a> data into BigQuery for better logging, analysis, and troubleshooting. This is really useful for setting up a realtime alerting infrastructure that notifies members of your team when issues arise. Crashlytics BigQuery streaming enables development teams to automate a lot of the work needed for release monitoring so they can stay on top of stability - no matter where they are. To enable this capability, head over to the Integrations tab within your Project Settings. </p><p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4zgVlYvxqLQ/XxfSM6TCH3I/AAAAAAAAE28/vlOYYZBSl2wQUiTacxCIjcgsWf3fF-qygCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/04-crashlytics.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4zgVlYvxqLQ/XxfSM6TCH3I/AAAAAAAAE28/vlOYYZBSl2wQUiTacxCIjcgsWf3fF-qygCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/04-crashlytics.gif\" data-original-width=\"595\" data-original-height=\"295\" /></a></div></p><h3><strong>Getting the most out of Google Analytics</strong></h3>  <p>If you created your Firebase project after August 2019, your analytics data is available in both Firebase <em>and</em> Google Analytics. What we’ve found is that even though most developers have looked at their analytics data in the Firebase console, not everyone has explored the additional features available in Google Analytics, such as <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9269518\">comparisons</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/9266525\">analysis</a>, and closed funnels.  </p><p>That’s why during Firebase Live, we debuted two videos that walk you through <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new-way-unify-app-and-website-measurement-google-analytics/\">Google Analytics</a>.  </p><p>In the first video below, you’ll get an overview of the Google Analytics console and learn how to get the most out of its advanced features so you can effectively understand your users and personalize their app experiences. </p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2F2XhgMt8Dg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>In the second video, created specifically for game developers, you’ll learn how to extract timely insights about player engagement and what can be improved in your gameplay.  </p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JDxXiarsrHk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h2>Our commitment to you</h2>  <p>2020 has been a challenging year in many ways, but our commitment to you is unwavering: we will continue to make Firebase a helpful platform that simplifies, speeds up, and scales your app development so you can focus on building and strengthening your business.

Firebase Authentication helps you meet this requirement by providing libraries and services that you can use to quickly build a new sign-in system for your app.  </p><p>But what if your organization already uses a service such as Okta to handle user identity? With Firebase Custom Authentication, you can use any user identity service (including Okta) to authenticate with Firebase, and this post will show you how. </p><p>You’ll learn how to build a Firebase and Okta integration, which will have two components: </p><ul> <li>A Node.js backend that “exchanges” Okta access tokens for Firebase custom authentication tokens. The backend is an Express.js app that you can deploy as a Cloud Function or run on your own infrastructure.  <li>A web frontend that signs users in with Okta, gets a Firebase custom authentication token from your backend, and authenticates with Firebase using the custom token. </li></ul><p>By the way, this approach can also be used with some modification for other identity services, such as Auth0, Azure Active Directory, or your own custom system. </p><p>Ready to get started? Great! But, before you write any code, you’ll need to set up your Okta and Firebase projects. </p><h2>I hope you like consoles</h2><p>First, set up an Okta project on the <a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/\">Okta Developer</a> site: </p><ol><li>Sign in or sign up for a new account. <li>Take note of your <strong>Org URL</strong> (top-right of the dashboard) for later. <li>On the <strong>Applications</strong> page, add a Single-Page App. <p>    Set the <strong>Base URIs</strong> and <strong>Login redirect URIs</strong> to the location where you plan to host your web frontend (<code>http://localhost:5000</code> if you’re using the Firebase Hosting emulator) and enable the <strong>Authorization Code</strong> grant type. </p><p>    When you’re done, take note of the app's <strong>Client ID</strong> for later. </p><li>In <strong>API > Trusted Origins</strong>, confirm that the base URI you set above is listed, with <strong>CORS</strong> and <strong>Redirect</strong> enabled. </li></ol><p>Then, set up a Firebase project in the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/\">Firebase console</a>: </p><ol> <li>Open your Firebase project or create a new one. Take note of your <strong>project ID</strong> for later.  <li>On the Project Overview page, add a new web app. <p>     If you plan to eventually host your web app with Firebase, you can automatically set up Firebase Hosting and simplify configuration by enabling <strong>Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app</strong>. </p><li>If you plan to test your token exchange endpoint locally, such as by using the Cloud Functions emulator (recommended), open your project settings and, on the Service Accounts page, generate and download an Admin SDK service account key. Be sure to keep this file safe, as it grants administrator access to your project. </li></ol><p>Finally, if you plan to deploy your token exchange endpoint as a Cloud Function: </p><ol><li><a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/iamcredentials.googleapis.com/overview?project=_\">Enable the IAM Service Account Credentials API</a> in the Google Cloud console. <li>After you deploy your Cloud Function, you will also need to make sure it is configured to run as a service account with the Service Account Token Creator role. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/okta-auth#deploy-the-demo-to-firebase-hosting-and-cloud-functions\">sample app documentation</a> for details. </li></ol><p>Now that your projects are set up, you’ll write the crucial piece: the token exchange endpoint. </p><h2>Okta tokens in; Firebase tokens out</h2><p>The job of the token exchange endpoint is to take a user’s Okta access token and, if it’s valid, produce a Firebase custom authentication token that represents the same user. </p><p>This endpoint needs to be able to verify the authenticity of the Okta access token. To accomplish this, use the <a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/protect-your-api/nodeexpress/require-authentication/\">Express.js middleware</a> provided in Okta’s developer documentation (reproduced below, with minor modifications): </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">const OKTA_ORG_URL = // Your Okta org URL<br />const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier');<br />const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({<br />    issuer: `${OKTA_ORG_URL}/oauth2/default`<br />});<br /><br />// Middleware to authenticate requests with an Okta access token.<br />const oktaAuth = async (req, res, next) => {<br />    const authHeader = req.headers.authorization || '';<br />    const match = authHeader.match(/Bearer (.+)/);<br /><br /><br />    if (!match) {<br />        res.status(401);<br />        return next('Unauthorized');<br />    }<br /><br /><br />    const accessToken = match[1];<br />    try {<br />        const jwt = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(<br />                accessToken, 'api://default');<br />        req.jwt = jwt;<br />        return next();  // Pass the request on to the main route.<br />    } catch (err) {<br />        console.log(err.message);<br />        res.status(401);<br />        return next('Unauthorized');<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre>  <p>Any endpoint protected by this middleware will require a valid Okta access token in the <code>Authorization</code> header. If the token is valid, it will insert the decoded token into the request before passing the request along by calling <code>next()</code>. </p><p>Now, you can write the token exchange endpoint: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">const express = require('express');<br />const app = express();<br />const cors = require('cors')({origin: 'https://YOUR_DOMAIN'});<br /><br />const firebaseAdmin = require('firebase-admin');<br />const firebaseApp = firebaseAdmin.initializeApp();<br /><br />// Get a Firebase custom auth token for the authenticated Okta user.<br />// This endpoint uses the `oktaAuth` middleware defined above to<br />// ensure requests have a valid Okta access token.<br />app.get('/firebaseCustomToken', [cors, oktaAuth], async (req, res) => {<br />    const oktaUid = req.jwt.claims.uid;<br />    try {<br />        const firebaseToken =<br />                await firebaseApp.auth().createCustomToken(oktaUid);<br />        res.send(firebaseToken);<br />    } catch (err) {<br />        console.log(err.message);<br />        res.status(500).send('Error minting token.');<br />    }<br />});<br /></pre>  <p>This endpoint uses the Firebase Admin SDK to mint a Firebase custom authentication token using the user’s Okta UID. When you sign a user in with this token for the first time (on the frontend), Firebase Authentication will add a user record with the same UID to your project. </p><p>This process of using an Okta access token to acquire a Firebase custom token is the key idea behind integrating Okta and Firebase. But, let’s go one step further and write a simple web frontend to demonstrate the use of the endpoint. </p><h2>A minimal web frontend</h2><p>The demo frontend is a plain HTML and JavaScript web app that uses the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#expandable-8\">Firebase Authentication Web SDK</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget\">Okta’s sign-in widget</a> library. </p><p>Start with two containers: one for authenticated user content and one for Okta’s sign-in widget: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;div id=\"authenticated-user-content\" hidden><br />    &lt;h2>Authenticated with Firebase&lt;/h2><br />    &lt;p id=\"user-info\">&lt;/p><br />    &lt;button onclick=\"firebase.auth().signOut();\">Sign out&lt;/button><br />&lt;/div><br />&lt;div id=\"signin-widget\" hidden>&lt;/div><br /></pre>  <p>Set up a Firebase authentication state listener that shows some user profile information to signed-in users and Okta’s sign-in widget to signed-out users: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">const oktaSignIn = new OktaSignIn({<br />    baseUrl: OKTA_ORG_URL,<br />    redirectUri: window.location.url,<br />    authParams: {<br />        display: 'page',<br />    },<br />    el: '#signin-widget',<br />});<br /><br />firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {<br />    if (user) {<br />        // User is signed in. Display some user profile information.<br />        document.getElementById('user-info').innerHTML =<br />                `Hi, ${user.displayName}! Your email address is<br />                ${user.email} and your UID is ${user.uid}.`;<br />        document.getElementById('authenticated-user-content').hidden = false;<br />        document.getElementById('signin-widget').hidden = true;<br />    } else {<br />        // User is signed out. Display the Okta sign-in widget.<br />        oktaSignIn.showSignInToGetTokens({<br />            clientId: OKTA_CLIENT_ID,<br />            redirectUri: window.location.url,<br />            getAccessToken: true,<br />            getIdToken: true,<br />            scope: 'openid profile email',<br />        });<br />        document.getElementById('authenticated-user-content').hidden = true;<br />        document.getElementById('signin-widget').hidden = false;<br />    }<br />});<br /></pre>  <p>When a user signs in with Okta’s widget, their browser briefly redirects to Okta’s authorization server, and then, assuming the user signed in successfully, redirects back to your app with the response. </p><p>Use Okta’s sign-in library to get the Okta access token from the response and use the access token to get a Firebase custom token from your token exchange endpoint: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">if (oktaSignIn.hasTokensInUrl()) {<br />    // Get the access token from Okta.<br />    const oktaTokenResponse =<br />            await oktaSignIn.authClient.token.parseFromUrl();<br />    const accessToken = oktaTokenResponse.tokens.accessToken.value;<br /><br />    // Use the access token to call the firebaseCustomToken endpoint.<br />    const firebaseTokenResponse = await fetch(CUSTOM_TOKEN_ENDPOINT, {<br />        headers: {<br />            'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,<br />        }<br />    });<br />    const firebaseToken = await firebaseTokenResponse.text();<br /><br />    // (Continued below.)<br />}<br /></pre>  <p>And finally, authenticate with Firebase using the custom token: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// (Continued from above.)<br />try {<br />    await firebase.auth().signInWithCustomToken(firebaseToken);<br />} catch (err) {<br />    console.error('Error signing in with custom token.');<br />}<br /></pre>  <p>When the call to <code>signInWithCustomToken()</code> completes, the auth state listener will detect the change and display the user’s profile information. </p><p>At this point, the user is authenticated with Firebase and you can use any of Firebase’s authentication-enabled services, such as Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage. See the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules\">Security Rules documentation</a> for more information on granting resource access to authenticated users. </p><p>For the complete demo app and backend that the code snippets above came from, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/okta-auth\">Authenticate with Firebase using Okta</a> sample on GitHub. </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/uyRf5VaFMBI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":10592,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WesK75xkREw/XymKgQu8JqI/AAAAAAAAE6c/-S_lFGNoHZY8ND2KjyzK0lzm8EO5qcEHQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase-okta.png","linkMd5":"beb2af162d0c5a5e914540a05337bdb2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-58-34-457_2374db148051dbb1.webp","destWidth":756,"destHeight":425,"sourceBytes":81412,"destBytes":30268,"author":"Firebase","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WesK75xkREw/XymKgQu8JqI/AAAAAAAAE6c/-S_lFGNoHZY8ND2KjyzK0lzm8EO5qcEHQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase-okta.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-58-34-457_2374db148051dbb1.webp","https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jcsEetKzGWE/Xyif8lmuiUI/AAAAAAAAE6Q/0Sn8GoHh_AU_PxBl3gmRMLIp4uDsKaIAACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Security%2BPhoto.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-58-44-508_dce1e63f485ea376.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/uyRf5VaFMBI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-58-42-233_b063493266318f5e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317114228},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","title":"How Gameloft uses Crashlytics to lower crash rates and increase engagement","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~3/7NhiwdMeLso/Gameloft-Crashlytics-game-case-study.html","description":"<figure class=\"profile\"> <div class=\"profile-picture\">    <img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FGDZrG7bzNw/Xi8l1Jf523I/AAAAAAAAEoM/at7aEz_STRwYb9YZ62p9nx4gei0I5FOYQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/patrick%2Bmartin.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\" data-original-width=\"600\" data-original-height=\"600\" />\"\" />  </div><figcaption>    <strong><div>Patrick Martin</div></strong>      <em>Developer Advocate, Google</em>  </figcaption></figure>  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OhUlVLkQVnc/XuKN7LmE-CI/AAAAAAAAEy4/FqRqakiZTGcqvBMpGOP2yiSxhNVlSUh7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Gameloft_Medium_v2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OhUlVLkQVnc/XuKN7LmE-CI/AAAAAAAAEy4/FqRqakiZTGcqvBMpGOP2yiSxhNVlSUh7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Gameloft_Medium_v2.png\" alt=\"Firebase banner.

As games have gotten more engaging, they’ve also become more complex to develop and maintain. Here at Firebase, we’re committed to providing game developers with the tools and resources you need to build, release and operate successful games that delight players.  </p><p>We participated in the <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/03/firebase-google-game-developer-event.html\">Google for Games Developer Summit </a>in March, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2VrCD8N3E&feature=youtu.be\">launched Unity and C++ SDKs for Cloud Firestore into open alpha</a>, shipped improved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0x_5dmEq3M\">workflows for Unity developers</a>, debuted some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GzFDXvZxKM&feature=youtu.be\">new video tutorials</a>, and wrote some <a href=\"https://medium.com/firebase-developers/how-to-add-firebase-to-your-c-desktop-game-4a177703186e\">new blogs too</a> - so you can easily add Firebase to your game and get the most out of our platform. </p><p>We have more exciting updates to come, driven by your feedback and stories. Recently, we spoke to Gameloft to understand how they’ve been using Firebase.  </p><b>Why Gameloft turned to Crashlytics </b>  <p>Gameloft is one of the world’s largest gaming studios, employing 4,600 people across 19 global offices. Their vast portfolio consists of over 190 critically-acclaimed, award-winning games that are played by 80 million people each month. Gameloft develops original franchises, like Dungeon Hunter, and also partners with major entertainment studios like Disney.  </p><p>With such a broad portfolio and audience, having the ability to monitor the stability of their games in a holistic way, and the agility to respond to issues quickly, is key to their success. However, they were lacking proper information about crashes, having a hard time reproducing crashes, and unforeseen technical issues were taking too long to track and fix, upsetting both their team and their players.  </p><p>Gameloft realized they needed a robust crash reporting tool that could help them improve game quality in a more streamlined and efficient way, so they turned to Firebase Crashlytics. </p> <b>How Gameloft uses Crashlytics to improve game quality </b>  <p>Crashlytics aggregates crashes by root cause, highlights the impact on players, and provides contextual information on each issue, which helps Gameloft prioritize the crashes to fix first and speeds up their troubleshooting process. By using Crashlytics, Gameloft achieved a 10% reduction in users experiencing crashes <em>overnight </em>for one of their games (Overdrive City)<em>. </em>According to Gameloft, this also led to a bump in the game’s Play Store rating and increased session duration by 16%!

That’s why Firebase offers products like <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics\">Analytics</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config\">Remote Config</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/predictions\">Predictions</a> and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/ab-testing\">A/B Testing</a> that allow you to tailor your app’s content and configuration for different player segments based on profile, past actions and future predicted behavior. For example, you can provide different onboarding flows for players based on their country or simplify a game level for players who are predicted to churn in hopes of keeping them engaged.  </p><p>One key area for personalization includes monetization, but figuring out the right strategy for the right group of players can be tricky. That’s why <a href=\"https://www.peoplefun.com/\">PeopleFun</a>, maker of some of the top word games on Android and iOS, turned to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/predictions\">Firebase Predictions</a>. They used Predictions in their hit game Wordscapes to create player segments based on predicted behavior and identify players who were unlikely to make in-app purchases in the next seven days. Those players were shown more rewarded video ads, while the players likely to make a purchase were not. This helped PeopleFun achieve the right balance between ads and IAP. </p><p>Read more about how PeopleFun used Firebase Predictions to increase lifetime value by up to 5% <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/use-cases/peoplefun/\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/games\">check out</a> other ways Firebase can help you supercharge your games! </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/kBVVctvjhvg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":10592,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zqEZcdz7Cvw/XyHu07aDKhI/AAAAAAAAE5s/j4Md2WkagM4G5Alqm1Zqjh_Wrife9B4AgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Partner_Logo_PeopleFun_V2.png","linkMd5":"cbf46d2ddaf19d9cd5ae750804313563","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-58-34-514_5c8e6c147a4dda23.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":477,"sourceBytes":86647,"destBytes":30546,"author":"Firebase","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zqEZcdz7Cvw/XyHu07aDKhI/AAAAAAAAE5s/j4Md2WkagM4G5Alqm1Zqjh_Wrife9B4AgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Partner_Logo_PeopleFun_V2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-58-34-514_5c8e6c147a4dda23.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70P5f0fDXDY/XyHtd3BLrqI/AAAAAAAAE5k/FU72OIkD4VMHRwBm0njVwKwIhQKHrsSqACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/0002_LauraWillis320.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-42-305_e08efd8fcb1fd4cf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/kBVVctvjhvg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn22@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-58-42-110_040b35e6a37e075b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317114228},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","title":"Manage your Remote Config templates from the Admin Node.js SDK","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~3/AI2dPg3YAWw/manage-remoteconfig-admin-nodejs-sdk.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vvf10YU4amI/XzGUkJ2DWFI/AAAAAAAAE7E/u_DI3HQd-QI-a3qJFxwCtAuHF1k_lmaFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/remoteconfig.png\"><img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vvf10YU4amI/XzGUkJ2DWFI/AAAAAAAAE7E/u_DI3HQd-QI-a3qJFxwCtAuHF1k_lmaFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/remoteconfig.png\"> <figure class=\"profile\"> <div class=\"profile-picture\">    <img style=\"margin:0;\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1DSr4KRpM7k/Xy3DuioGeNI/AAAAAAAAE6s/MBYw-sr7eKIOZo-aUBYg4Im0Okx7LMeZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Lahiru%2BMaramba.jpg\" />  </div><figcaption>    <strong><div> Lahiru Maramba</div></strong>      <em>Software Engineer</em>  </figcaption></figure>  <p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config\">Firebase Remote Config</a> allows developers to control the appearance and the behaviour of their apps without having to publish an app update. You can build your app with in-app default configurations and later change those configurations by updating your project’s Remote Config template. </p><p>We are happy to announce that you can now manage your Remote Config templates directly from the Admin Node.js SDK. </p><p>Typically, you would use the Firebase console to specify and update Remote Config templates manually. However, sometimes you need more automation and server-side control of these settings, such as scheduling Remote Config updates or importing configurations from your own proprietary systems and other Firebase projects. Until now the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/remote-config/rest\">Remote Config REST API</a> was the only way to implement such use cases, which at times could be cumbersome. </p><p>As of version 8.13.0, the Admin SDK introduced a Remote Config API that simplifies the process of creating, accessing, and updating your Remote Config templates from your own backend servers and also from managed Cloud environments like Google Cloud Functions. </p><p>Let’s go through some examples on how to use the Firebase Admin Node.js SDK to manage your projects’ templates. You can start by creating a fresh Remote Config template for your project, or you can get the current active template and make changes to it. Here's how you can get the current active template in Node.js: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">const admin = require('firebase-admin');<br />admin.initializeApp();<br /><br />const template = await admin.remoteConfig().getTemplate();<br />console.log('ETag from server: ' + template.etag);</pre>  <p>Each Remote Config template version is associated with an entity tag (ETag) for version control purposes. The Remote Config API uses this ETag to prevent race conditions and concurrent updates to resources. To learn more about ETags, see <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag\">ETag - HTTP</a>.  </p><p>Once you have obtained your current active Remote Config template you can start making modifications. Here are some of the operations you can perform using the Admin Node.js SDK: </p><ul> <li>Add new or update existing Remote Config Conditions  <li>Add new or update existing Remote Config Parameters  <li>Manage Remote Config Parameter Groups  <li>Validate your modified Remote Config template  <li>Publish your modified Remote Config template as the current active version </li></ul><p>Let’s go through an example on adding a new Remote Config condition and a parameter to your template. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// add a new condition<br />template.conditions.push({<br />  name: 'android_en',<br />  expression: \"device.os == 'android' \"<br />    + \"&& device.country in ['us','uk']\",<br />  tagColor: 'BLUE' as admin.remoteConfig.TagColor,<br />});<br /><br />// add a new parameter, that references the above condition<br />template.parameters['header_text'] = {<br />  defaultValue: {<br />    value: 'A Gryffindor must be brave, talented and helpful.'<br />  },<br />  conditionalValues: {<br />    'android_en': {<br />      value: 'A Droid must be brave, talented and helpful.'<br />    },<br />  },<br />};</pre>  <p>The above example creates a new condition named <code>android_en</code> and uses it in a conditional value of the parameter named <code>header_text</code>. Checkout <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/condition-reference\">the documentation</a> to learn more about conditional expressions. Keep in mind that the conditions in a template are listed in descending order by priority. A parameter might have several conditional values associated with it. If multiple conditions evaluate to true, the first condition in the list takes precedence. </p><p>Once you make updates to your template you must publish it to make the new changes effective. After you publish a Remote Config template using the Firebase Admin Node.js SDK, that template becomes the current active version of your project. Before you publish a template you can always validate it to check for any errors. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">try {<br />  const validatedTemplate = admin.remoteConfig()<br />    .validateTemplate(template);<br />  const publishedTemplate = admin.remoteConfig()<br />    .publishTemplate(validatedTemplate);<br />} catch(err) {<br />  console.log('Error publishing the template:', error);<br />}</pre>  <p>For more details and code samples on programmatically modifying Remote Config templates, check out <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/automate-rc\">the detailed documentation</a>. </p><p>In addition to the API for modifying Remote Config templates, the Firebase Admin Node.js SDK provides an API to manage Remote Config template versions. This API supports the following operations. </p><ul> <li>List all stored versions of the Remote Config template  <li>Retrieve a specific version of the Remote Config template  <li>Roll back to a specific stored version of the Remote Config template </li></ul><p>The <code>listVersions</code> operation allows you to retrieve a list of metadata for all stored versions of your project, sorted in reverse chronological order. Note that the last 300 versions are stored. All versions that correspond to non-active Remote Config templates (that is, all except the template that is being fetched by clients) are also deleted if they are more than 90 days old. Here’s a sample code to fetch a list of template versions. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// list all the Remote Config template Versions<br />// Only the last 300 versions are stored.<br />const listVersionsResult = admin.remoteConfig().listVersions();<br />listVersionsResult.versions.forEach((version) => {<br />  console.log('version', JSON.stringify(version));<br />});</pre>  <p>For a complete list of available operations and examples, check out <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/templates#manage_template_versions_with_the_backend_apis\">the documentation</a> on programmatically managing Remote Config template versions. </p><p>We hope this new addition of the Remote Config API in the Admin Node.js SDK helps with your backend development tasks. Stay tuned for the Remote Config API to be added across other Firebase Admin SDK platforms. We are excited to see how you use the new APIs in your projects!

So with the graduation of <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/06/crashlytics-sdk-now-available.html\">Firebase Crashlytics SDK out of Beta</a>, we think it’s a good time to highlight the benefits of integrating Crashlytics into your app. Read on for a refresher on the essential tools that Crashlytics provides to help you debug crashes and get the most out of your crash reports. </p><h2>1. Debug crashes faster with crash insights</h2><p>Even with access to crash reports, getting to the root cause of a crash can be pretty time consuming. Not only does the Crashlytics dashboard provide a holistic and clear view of what your users are experiencing, but you also get detailed suggestions on what could have caused a fatal error with <strong>crash insights</strong>. </p><p>Crash insights appear on your dashboard next to the crash report and provide additional context by highlighting potential root causes, such as SDK bugs and API misuse, that might be common across multiple apps. This serves as a starting point for investigation, which saves you time and speeds up your workflow.  </p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EThIQ05dqPI/Xx90hloXK9I/AAAAAAAAE4o/Bm-yO-6egqA8fzHSB6PXunES-n8RGhsDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/debug.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EThIQ05dqPI/Xx90hloXK9I/AAAAAAAAE4o/Bm-yO-6egqA8fzHSB6PXunES-n8RGhsDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/debug.png\" data-original-width=\"1544\" data-original-height=\"828\" /></a><h2>2. Gain user insights with custom keys and logs</h2><p>It can be frustrating to see a user run into a crash that you can’t seem to reproduce on your end. Crashlytics can help with this by allowing you to track the state and sequence of application usage prior to a crash through <strong><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports?platform=android#add-keys\">custom keys</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports?platform=android#add-logs\">custom logs</a></strong>. Custom keys provide a snapshot of information at one point in time, recording the last known value; custom logs record the events a user went through during their session. </p><p>For example, you might want to know how many items a user had in their shopping cart before a crash occurred. By naming a key using a string (e.g. “item purchase count”) and setting the value programmatically, Crashlytics uploads these key/values with the next crash. These keys and values are then visible right next to your stack trace. </p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gceRxyDhDPI/Xx91tI3XEZI/AAAAAAAAE4w/XDd9C6oGYZ4JWjxXdcWc2WHaANNJsU_9QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/keys.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gceRxyDhDPI/Xx91tI3XEZI/AAAAAAAAE4w/XDd9C6oGYZ4JWjxXdcWc2WHaANNJsU_9QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/keys.png\" data-original-width=\"802\" data-original-height=\"245\" /></a>Similar to custom keys, custom logs show up within a stack trace in your Crashlytics dashboard. All you need to do is call the Crashlytics logging function and provide your log string, and that custom log is then uploaded with the next crash. Now you can have your state and your logs all in one place. <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6y8IYlEgEfg/Xx91xbRhnBI/AAAAAAAAE40/TSEjHrrX0hoV3qB5w_mBhPNEQI_NJ-8RQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/logs.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6y8IYlEgEfg/Xx91xbRhnBI/AAAAAAAAE40/TSEjHrrX0hoV3qB5w_mBhPNEQI_NJ-8RQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/logs.png\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"224\" /></a><h2>3. Reproduce crashes faster with breadcrumbs powered by Google Analytics</h2><p>Even with custom keys and logs, trying to manually capture every event your user triggers in your app can be daunting. However, if you <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/start-using-analytics\">integrate Crashlytics with Google Analytics</a>, you can automatically capture predefined Google Analytics events, known as <strong>breadcrumbs</strong>. Breadcrumbs can further enhance the data captured with custom logs, giving you even more information on the cause of a crash. </p><p>Just like custom logs and keys, breadcrumbs can be found within your stack trace in the Crashlytics dashboard, and will show the actions a user has taken prior to a crash, as well as the parameters within the event. </p><p>For instance, going back to the shopping cart example, breadcrumbs will capture event parameters like product ID, product name, type of currency used, quantity of items in the cart, etc. Here is a full list of the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317485?hl=en\">automatically collected events</a> that Google Analytics breadcrumbs captures. </p><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g9i_H1X4mew/Xx92Lusq_bI/AAAAAAAAE5A/OYfNCYK9doQjYbX1e_AK_aLcEh7-eBCogCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-07-27%2Bat%2B5.49.42%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g9i_H1X4mew/Xx92Lusq_bI/AAAAAAAAE5A/OYfNCYK9doQjYbX1e_AK_aLcEh7-eBCogCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-07-27%2Bat%2B5.49.42%2BPM.png\" data-original-width=\"761\" data-original-height=\"243\" /></a><h2>4. Receive notifications in real-time with Crashlytics alerts</h2><p>You never want to miss a critical user issue, but it can be tough to stay on top of crash reports around-the-clock. Using <strong>Crashlytics alerts,</strong> you can configure real-time alerts by three different levels of your app’s stability. <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/velocity-alerts\">Velocity alerts,</a> considered high priority, are sent when an issue goes over a certain threshold within your user base. Regression alerts are sent when a previously closed issue has recurred in a new version of your app, typically medium priority. New issue alerts are sent when a new issue has occurred, and are generally low priority. </p><p>You can customize these alerts in the Crashlytics console, and receive them via Slack, PagerDuty, Jira, or email. </p><center><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cfy2aVjUrtI/Xx92i0wTp7I/AAAAAAAAE5I/BfRceuqtYGYNO0D---pcUbQSaWl9HmLUACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" style=\"width:80%\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cfy2aVjUrtI/Xx92i0wTp7I/AAAAAAAAE5I/BfRceuqtYGYNO0D---pcUbQSaWl9HmLUACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase.png\" data-original-width=\"609\" data-original-height=\"765\" /></a></center><h2>5. Segment crash data with BigQuery and visualize it with Data Studio</h2><p>Not only can you view your crashes in the Crashlytics dashboard, but you can also <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export\">export all Crashlytics data to BigQuery</a>.

If not, you can still <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-loteria\">check it out here</a>. Lotería is a multiplayer bingo-style game that supports up to five players per room. In the digitized Doodle version, you can play with random people around the world or create a private game with your friends.  </p><p>The Lotería game was developed in JavaScript primarily by one engineer over a few months, and the game's usage jumped from no players to millions literally overnight. The multiplayer component that supported it all was built entirely with the Firebase Realtime Database, which meant we could spend more time developing a great user experience, and less time worrying about infrastructure. Let's look into how we did it! </p><h2>Gameplay</h2>Lotería is a card game similar to bingo, where each player has their own board. A dealer calls out cards, and players check their own boards for a match. If they have the card, they mark it⁠—traditionally with a pinto bean. When a player matches the win pattern for that game, such as a full row or column, they call out, “Lotería!”. The first person to call “Lotería!” wins. <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b-kqsGGv6pc/Xi9S8KatpDI/AAAAAAAAEo8/x7gfcfk_H2MUCwfoFsjXYTtn0bYGUuQwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/loteria.gif\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"450\" alt=\"Loteria game animation\"/>There are two parts of the game that need to happen in real-time for all players. The first is dealing out the cards, and the second is when somebody calls, “Lotería!”. For the dealer, we randomly choose one of the players to act as the game host and run the dealer logic. On a repeating interval, the dealer randomly selects a new card from the deck and writes it to a location in the database that all the other players are listening to. We also include the time that the deal started, and the milliseconds until the next deal. Each client can use these numbers to show an animated timer. So the data looks like this: <p><code>/games/{gameId}/deal = {card, time, countDown}</code></p><p>To detect the winner, all players listen to another database location at <code>/games/{gameId}/winner. </code> When a player clicks “Lotería!” and has a valid winning pattern on their board, we write their ID to that location. </p><p>Often, there’s a close tie, so we use <code>Reference.transaction</code> to ensure that only the first player to call, “Lotería!” is declared the winner. We do this by making sure that <code>/games/{gameId}/winner</code> doesn’t already have an existing value before we write anything to that location. </p><h2>Matchmaking</h2><p>To create random public games, we utilized Cloud Functions for Firebase in conjunction with the Realtime Database. </p><p>When a player selects “Random Match,” their player ID is written to the location <code>/queue/</code>. A Cloud Function is set up to trigger when a new entry is created, and it checks whether we have enough players to start a game. If so, it creates the game at<code> /games/<em>{gameId}</em></code>, and writes the gameId to each player's entry, like so: <code>/players/<em>{playerId}</em>/gameId = <em>{gameId}</em></code>   <p>Players listen to <code>gameId</code> on their own database entries, so they know when to transition to the gameplay screen. </p><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-laNA4-7JwBk/Xi9TsYexFCI/AAAAAAAAEpI/zyGtz95BYk0rn9K1OZq6Y07hfRClUoaBACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/matchmaking.gif\" data-original-width=\"480\" data-original-height=\"270\"alt=\"matchmaking\"/><p>Since there are a lot of players connecting simultaneously, and the Cloud Function is asynchronous, we once again used a transaction to ensure that players are removed from the queue and placed into games atomically. Making one game at a time atomically could create a bottleneck, so instead we create as many games as possible in one transaction. </p><h2>Scaling</h2><p>Interactive Google Doodles get millions of players, so we needed to make sure that the database could handle the load. To do this, we <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding\">sharded the database into multiple instances</a>. Each instance can handle a limited amount of traffic, so we estimated how much traffic we expected to have. To do this, we wrote a load testing bot that could be run repeatedly and measured how much load this generated on a single instance. Then, we extrapolated that number to how many players we expected, which then gave us the number of instances we might need. </p><p>However, there is a downside to having too many instances: if players are spread too thinly, it might take longer for enough to connect to one instance to start a game. To solve this problem, we created an entry in the default database instance called “shards.” This was a number that could be adjusted from 1 to the maximum number of shards we created. Clients read this value and only used shards in that range. Since the Doodle was only live on the Google homepage for a short time, we updated the shards value manually through the Firebase Console, setting it lower when there was less traffic, and higher when there were spikes. Naturally, this process could be automated for a longer-running application. </p><h2>More time on gameplay, less time on infrastructure</h2>Lotería is a game that has a lot of significance for many members of the team, and we were proud to make an experience that shares our love of the game with the rest of the world. Building our game with help from the Realtime Database meant that we could get our backend up and running quickly, without having to worry about scaling. We hope to use it again in future Doodles and encourage you to give it a try for powering your own multiplayer game.   <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/lR53-ofqWyw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 18:34:00 +0000","feedId":10592,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b-kqsGGv6pc/Xi9S8KatpDI/AAAAAAAAEo8/x7gfcfk_H2MUCwfoFsjXYTtn0bYGUuQwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/loteria.gif","linkMd5":"cd8b37ed9d7a648ac08b6509ea463d71","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn74@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-39-846_fc776677f62bd399.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":481785,"destBytes":764812,"author":"Firebase","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b-kqsGGv6pc/Xi9S8KatpDI/AAAAAAAAEo8/x7gfcfk_H2MUCwfoFsjXYTtn0bYGUuQwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/loteria.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn74@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-39-846_fc776677f62bd399.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uikGz92Glt4/Xi9SR805MtI/AAAAAAAAEow/H1smJWceoAARutz0wAcOt3HNZMaBUBryACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-01-27%2Bat%2B1.12.23%2BPM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn61@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-45-119_aba52cafef7108b8.webp","https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-laNA4-7JwBk/Xi9TsYexFCI/AAAAAAAAEpI/zyGtz95BYk0rn9K1OZq6Y07hfRClUoaBACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/matchmaking.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn2@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-58-44-112_7bc3b1b09bfc5585.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/lR53-ofqWyw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-58-44-560_ef6bd727645eb0e9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317114229},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","title":"Automatically translate Firebase in-app messages using Google Translate","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~3/pU_BgJXVTUo/auto-translate-firebase-in-app-messages.html","description":"<figure class=\"profile\"> <div class=\"profile-picture\">    <img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YBsE36eeuAg/XiI_M3WYy2I/AAAAAAAAEl4/ZXRXJjII5yUfmmn3MeRngv438k5cteUbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase%2Bauthor.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\" data-original-width=\"600\" data-original-height=\"600\" />\" />  </div><figcaption>    <strong><div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpsloal\">Ali Satter</a></div></strong>      <em>Product Manager</em>  </figcaption></figure> <p>It's been over a year since we first announced <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/08/introducing-firebase-in-app-messaging.html\">Firebase In-App Messaging</a> to help you guide app users who are <em>actively using your app</em> by sending them targeted and contextual messages.  In-App Messaging allows you to communicate with your most valuable users and deepen their engagement by surfacing relevant offers, information, and tips as they use your app. </p><p>We have been actively working on adding more features and expanding on the capabilities of Firebase In-App messaging (such as new message layouts), and we’re excited to highlight another new feature today - the ability to auto-translate your message into multiple languages using Google Translate. </p><p>As your app user base expands into more countries and languages, it's important to make sure messages are localized for each recipient to improve engagement, and for that we have added an easy way to translate your message to many languages.  To get started is simple.   </p><p><strong>1. First choose your message style and content. </strong>  </p><p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UdAm9pcseOM/XiJHdxBzDBI/AAAAAAAAEmw/fyAT0Z5fLxUyxoVBQqepuxHPngYjIYu5wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/FB1%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UdAm9pcseOM/XiJHdxBzDBI/AAAAAAAAEmw/fyAT0Z5fLxUyxoVBQqepuxHPngYjIYu5wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/FB1%2B%25281%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"842\" data-original-height=\"1229\" /></a></p><p><strong>2. Set your target criteria</strong></p><p>Then in the targeting section, when you select your app, Firebase will look at your audience and determine if localizing message content would help, and provide you a helpful nudge to provide localized content: </p><p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c0tkCHAD8LE/XiJHhBTyZEI/AAAAAAAAEm0/4OSh2PRW7TI1lACu_cehfOUN0Y7YSFLbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fb2%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c0tkCHAD8LE/XiJHhBTyZEI/AAAAAAAAEm0/4OSh2PRW7TI1lACu_cehfOUN0Y7YSFLbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fb2%2B%25281%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"842\" data-original-height=\"676\" /></a></p><p><strong>3. Click on <em>Localize</em>, and you will see the following dialog.</strong></p><p>The first section of the dialog contains the default language and strings to be localized.  And if you would like to provide alternative translated messages, click on Localize next to the language you would like. </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vq7Hmb9ZVwY/XiJHkyxscgI/AAAAAAAAEm4/bKau6C9pJ0gf4adyACcBwcp6EsgpsHKQACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fb3%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vq7Hmb9ZVwY/XiJHkyxscgI/AAAAAAAAEm4/bKau6C9pJ0gf4adyACcBwcp6EsgpsHKQACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fb3%2B%25281%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"583\" data-original-height=\"729\" /></a></p><p>When you click on Localize, you can either enter the localized message yourself, or click on the <strong><em>Translate</em></strong> button and let Google Translate automatically do the translation for you. </p><p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QX0nsR20sRo/XiJHLhf45cI/AAAAAAAAEmo/8EwYcKRd5xITAZ20_sCa64Wo4qEH32RHgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase.corp.google.com_u_0_project_primer-api_inappmessaging_compose%2B%25286%2529%2Bcopy.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QX0nsR20sRo/XiJHLhf45cI/AAAAAAAAEmo/8EwYcKRd5xITAZ20_sCa64Wo4qEH32RHgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebase.corp.google.com_u_0_project_primer-api_inappmessaging_compose%2B%25286%2529%2Bcopy.png\" data-original-width=\"583\" data-original-height=\"729\" /></a></p><p><strong>4. Save your translations</strong></p><p>Once you are done with all the translations, click on <strong>Save</strong> and continue completing the rest of the steps for your messaging campaign. </p><p>Unless you provide localized messages, all your users - irregardless of their locale - will receive the message in the default language.  If you provide translations, users who’s locale matches available translations will get the localized message, and everyone else will get the default message. </p><p>We have a lot more product updates in the works for this year, and look forward to sharing them with you. If you are not already using Firebase In-App Messaging, then 2020 is the year to start.

In addition, this event powers the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9143382\">Behavior reports offered in Google Analytics’s App + Web properties, </a> which can tell you how much time users spend in each screen. It also powers the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9317498?hl=en\">Path Analysis tool</a> where you can discover the most popular navigational paths within your app.  </p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JVLCzNVargs/XzsDBbQQ8uI/AAAAAAAAE8o/V1NplYm2Q6QqR3o_AQ69kuUjpENEUnROQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/behavioroverview.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JVLCzNVargs/XzsDBbQQ8uI/AAAAAAAAE8o/V1NplYm2Q6QqR3o_AQ69kuUjpENEUnROQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/behavioroverview.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1192\" /></a><p id=\"imgCaption\">Behavior overview reporting page</p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CkdS4k13D6g/XzsDNaNV61I/AAAAAAAAE8s/0CGZVUfPS1E_i7gaJGl_e9Lzm7RdzfzoACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pathanalysis.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CkdS4k13D6g/XzsDNaNV61I/AAAAAAAAE8s/0CGZVUfPS1E_i7gaJGl_e9Lzm7RdzfzoACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pathanalysis.png\" data-original-width=\"1470\" data-original-height=\"1094\" /></a><p id=\"imgCaption\">Path analysis technique</p><p>Most of the automatically collected events, including<code> screen_view</code>, use protected event names that prevent you from being able to manually log events with the same name. There are good reasons for doing this because a lot of these events power other Firebase products, like A/B Testing and Firebase Predictions, and first class reporting features in Google Analytics. </p><p>But we’ve heard a lot of your feedback - and <code>screen_view</code> is one event for which you wanted more control over how and when the event gets logged - in addition to having the option to continue logging events automatically. </p><p>So our latest release now makes this possible. This release also marks the deprecation of the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics#setCurrentScreen(android.app.Activity,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)\">setCurrentScreen</a> (on Android) and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebaseanalytics/api/reference/Classes/FIRAnalytics#+setscreenname:screenclass:\">setScreenName</a> (on iOS) methods which will be replaced by the new calls to manually log the <code>screen_view</code> event. </p><p>There are many benefits to having more control for when the screen_view event gets logged:<br></p><ol> <li><b>Only log screen_view events that are meaningful in your app</b><br></br><p>For example, you might only want to log a<code> screen_view</code> event when a user has spent at least some minimum amount of time on the screen. <br></br><p>In fact, you might recall that Google Analytics <a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/12/new-changes-sessions-user-engagement.html\">previously logged session_start events ten seconds after an app first loaded</a> into the foreground. While this has changed and <code>session_start</code> events are logged immediately, there can be instances in your app when it makes sense to wait a few seconds before logging a meaningful <code>screen_view</code>.<br></br><p>In a video streaming app, users may often load up a title selection screen and quickly scroll through and select a series they’ve already been watching to pick up where they left off. They might not really be searching for new titles, even though they’re visiting the title screen, and you'll want to only log screen views here when you really know that they’re looking for new titles, not just quickly scrolling through it. </li><li><b>Log screen_view events for important sections and subscreens in your app</b><br></br><p>Your app might have subsections in some screens (think “Container View Controllers” with inner Child VCs or Fragments), or in the case of a game or a Flutter app, be driven by one screen that powers other views that present meaningful actions a user can take, or represent places in your app where users will spend a significant amount of time. In such cases, you might want to log a <code>screen_view</code> event manually, and add additional event parameters that represent the subsections of your app that your users spend more time exploring. </p><p>A good example here is an app that provides a customer support chat interface that overlays onto an existing screen the user is viewing. In such cases, you might want to log a manual <code>screen_view</code> event that represents that chat interface and that can collect more information in added event parameters - like which topic or which screen the user was on before they opened the support chat window. </p></li></ol><p>In addition to the reasons above, there was an <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/1894\">issue on iOS devices</a> with automatically collected <code>screen_view</code> events using the soon-to-be-deprecated <code>setScreenName</code> method in which the events were dual-logged. This change also corrects this issue so it is no longer a factor. </p><h2>How to manually log a screen_view event</h2><p>You can log a manual <code>screen_view</code> just like you would any other event in Google Analytics. You can also include the two optional parameters (i) <code>screen_name</code> and (ii) <code>screen_class</code>, as well as any custom event parameters you want to include. The two optional parameters take the place of the <code>firebase_screen</code> and <code>firebase_screen_class</code> event parameters that get passed into automatically collected screen_view events. </p><p>Specifically for iOS, this would look like: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {<br />    super.viewDidAppear(animated)<br /><br />    // After enough time has passed to make this screen view significant.<br />    Analytics.logEvent(AnalyticsEventScreenView, parameters: [<br />        AnalyticsParameterScreenName: screenName!,<br />        AnalyticsParameterScreenClass: screenClass!,<br />        MyAppAnalyticsParameterFitnessCategory: category!<br />    ])<br />}<br /></pre>  <p>And for Android: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">@Override<br />public void onResume() {<br />    super.onResume();<br /><br />    // After enough time has passed to make this screen view significant.<br />    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();<br />    bundle.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.SCREEN_NAME, screenName);<br />    bundle.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.SCREEN_CLASS, screenClass);<br />    bundle.putString(MyAppAnalyticsConstants.Param.TOPIC, topic);<br />    mFirebaseAnalytics.logEvent(FirebaseAnalytics.Event.SCREEN_VIEW, bundle);<br />}<br /></pre>  <p>As mentioned before, the new API will allow you to log manual <code>screen_view</code> events along with the option to continue collecting <code>screen_view</code> events automatically. Since both are possible at the same time, let’s get into some questions to learn more about how the new feature works with the existing automatic event collection. </p>  <h3>Can I disable automatically collected <code>screen_view</code> events and only use manual logging?</h3>  <p>Yes. While you can use both together at the same time, you can disable automatic event collection for <code>screen_view</code> events if you’d like. On iOS, set  <code>FirebaseAutomaticScreenReportingEnabled</code> to “NO” in your info.plist. On Android, set <code>google_analytics_automatic_screen_reporting_enabled</code> to “false” in your manifest. </p> <h3>What changes do I need to make to migrate from the setScreenName / setCurrentScreen method calls?</h3>  <p>The <code>setScreenName</code> and <code>setCurrentScreen</code> method calls were used to set a custom-defined screen name as the <code>firebase_screen_name</code> parameter value included with all automatically logged <code>screen_view</code> events. If you want to continue collecting custom screen names on your <code>screen_view</code> events, you will need to log the <code>screen_view</code> event manually and pass in the <code>screen_name</code> event parameter (likely using the same value you were using in the soon-to-be deprecated methods). </p><p>Note that for automatically reported <code>screen_view</code> events, the screen name value will be left blank, and the screen class value will be set to that of the most recently shown screen. </p><p>If you disable automatic screen reporting, some values are still accessible and can be automatically added to your manually logged <code>screen_view</code> events, such as the <code>firebase_screen_class</code> parameter. </p><p>This is because parameters like the screen class are first-class metrics that feed into Google Analytics’ Behavior Reports, and so we’ve gone the extra mile to automatically populate this field using information we know on the client.  On Android, the current activity will be used to populate the screen class parameter. On iOS, if you make a call to the<code> logEvent()</code> method, the root UIViewController will be used to populate the screen class value. You can always overwrite this value by passing in a different <code>screen_class</code> parameter, though. On both platforms the screen name will be left blank (unless you specify it), and the value “not set” will be displayed in the Google Analytics console. </p><h3>Do other event parameters that get passed into automatically collected <code>screen_view</code> events also get passed into manually logged <code>screen_view</code> events?</h3> <p>Yes, all event parameters that are reported along with automatically collected screen_view events, such as <code>engagement_time_msec</code>, and <code>firebase_previous_screen</code>  will also be automatically reported with manually logged screen_view events, besides the special cases for the values for screen name and screen class described in the section above. </p><p>We hope you enjoy the new ability to manually log your screen view events, and would love to hear more feedback from you about this feature, or about the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK for your apps in general.

(If you're using the default rules instead of tailoring them to your app, this is where to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started\">start</a>!) We're excited to announce that in the last few months we've released some substantial improvements to the tools for writing and debugging Rules, improvements to the Rules language itself, and increases to the size limits for Rules!. These are a few of the great new features. Check out the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/security-rules\">Security Rules Release Notes</a> for a comprehensive list of everything we've released. </p><h3>Sets</h3>  <p>We've released several improvements to make the rules language more expressive and succinct. One particularly verbose pattern was comparing the new values of a document to existing values. The new <code><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rules/rules.Set\">Set type</a></code> available in Rules is purpose-built for these comparisons, and also has methods for functionality you'd expect for a Set, like getting the intersection, union, or difference between Sets. For examples:  <p>Allow a user to create a document if the document has required and optional fields, but not others: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">allow create: if (request.resource.data.keys().toSet()<br />  .hasOnly([\"required\",\"and\",\"optional\",\"keys\"])</pre>  <p>Sets come with <code>==</code> and <code>in</code> operators and <code>hasAll</code>, <code>hasAny</code>, <code>hasOnly</code>, <code>difference</code>, <code>intersection</code>, <code>union</code>, and <code>size</code> methods.  </p><h3>New Map methods</h3>  <p>Sets are most useful in conjunction with the <code><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rules/rules.Map\">Map</a></code> class, and because the <code>request</code> and <code>resource</code> objects are both structured as maps, you're probably already familiar with it. <code>Map</code> recently got a few new methods, <code>diff</code> and <code>get</code>, that will hopefully open the door to more concise rules for everyone. Here's how they work:  <p>Map.diff() is called on one map, and takes the second map as an argument: <code>map1.diff(map2)</code>. It returns a <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rules/rules.MapDiff\">MapDiff</a> object, and all of the MapDiff methods, like <code>addedKeys</code>, <code>changedKeys</code>, or <code>affectedKeys</code> return a <code>Set</code> object.  </p><p>Map.diff() can solve some verbose patterns like checking which fields changed before and after a request. For example, this rule allows an update if the \"maxLevel\" field was the only field changed: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">allow update: if  <br />  request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).changedKeys().hasOnly([\"maxLevel\"]);<br /></pre>  <p>In the next example, posts have a field indicating the user role required to modify the post. We'll use Map.get() to get the <code>\"roleToEdit\"</code> field. If the document doesn't have the field, it will default to the <code>\"admin\"</code> role. Then we'll compare that to the role that's on the user's custom claims: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">allow update, delete: if resource.data.get(\"roleToEdit\", \"admin\") == request.auth.token.role;</pre>  <p>Keep in mind that because Sets are not ordered but Lists are. You can convert a List to a Set, but you can't convert a Set to a List. </p><h3>Local variables</h3>  <p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/rules-language#function\">Local variables</a> have been one of the most requested features in Rules, and they're now available within functions. You can declare a variable using the keyword <code>let</code>, and you can have up to 10 local variables per function. </p><p>Say you're commonly checking that a user meets the same three conditions before granting access: that they're an owner of the product or an admin user, that they successfully answered a challenge question, and that they meet the karma threshold.  </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">rules_version = '2';<br />service cloud.firestore {<br />  match /databases/{database}/documents {<br />    match /products/{product} {<br />      allow read: if true;<br />      allow write: if (exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid))<br />      || exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/product/owner/$(request.auth.uid)))<br />      && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))<br />         .data.passChallenge == true<br />      && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))<br />         .data.karma > 5;<br />    }<br />    match /categories/{category} {<br />      allow read: if true;<br />      allow write: if (exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid))<br />      || exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/product/owner/$(request.auth.uid)))<br />      && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))<br />         .data.passChallenge == true<br />      && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))<br />         .data.karma > 5;<br />    }<br />    match /brands/{brand} {<br />      allow read, write: if (exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid))<br />      || exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/product/owner/$(request.auth.uid)))<br />      && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))<br />         .data.passChallenge == true<br />      && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))<br />         .data.karma > 5;<br />    }<br />  }<br />}</pre>  <p>Those conditions, along with the paths I'm using for lookups can all now become variables in a function, which creates more readable rules: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">rules_version = '2';<br />service cloud.firestore {<br />  match /databases/{database}/documents {<br />  <br />    function privilegedAccess(uid, product) {<br />      let adminDatabasePath = /databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(uid);<br />      let userDatabasePath = /databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(uid);<br />      let ownerDatabasePath = /databases/$(database)/documents/$(product)/owner/$(uid);  <br /><br />      let isOwnerOrAdmin = exists(adminDatabasePath) || exists(ownerDatabasePath);<br />      let meetsChallenge = get(userDatabasePath).data.get(\"passChallenge\", false) == true;<br />      let meetsKarmaThreshold = get(userDatabasePath).get(\"karma\", 1) > 5;<br />      return  isOwnerOrAdmin && meetsChallenge && meetsKarmaThreshold;<br />    }<br /><br />    match /products/{product} {<br />      allow read: if true;<br />      allow write: if privilegedAccess();<br />    }<br />    <br />    match /categories/{category} {<br />      allow read: if true;<br />      allow write: if privilegedAccess();<br />    }<br />    <br />    match /brands/{brand} {<br />      allow read, write: if privilegedAccess();<br />    }<br />  }<br />}</pre>  <p>You can see at a glance that the same conditions grant access to write to documents in the three different collections.  </p><p>The updated version also uses <code><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rules/rules.Map#get\">map.get()</a></code> to fetch the <code>karma</code> and <code>passChallenge </code>fields from the user data, which helps keep the new function concise. In this example, if there is no <code>karma</code> field for a user, then the <code>get</code> returns false. Keep in mind that <code>Map.get()</code> fetches a specific field, and is separate from the <code><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.DocumentReference#get\">DocumentReference.get()</a></code> that fetches a document.  <h3>Ternary operator</h3>  <p>This is the first time we've introduced an <code>if/else </code>control flow, and we hope it will make rules smoother and more powerful. </p><p>Here's an example of using a ternary operator to specify complex conditions for a write. A user can update a document in two cases: first, if they're an admin user, they need to either set the field <code>overrideReason</code> or <code>approvedBy</code>. Second, if they're not an admin user, then the update must include all the required fields: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">allow update: if isAdminUser(request.auth.uid) ? <br />  request.resource.data.keys().toSet().hasAny([\"overrideReason\", \"approvedBy\"]) :<br />  request.resource.data.keys().toSet().hasAll([\"all\", \"the\", \"required\", \"fields\"])</pre>  <p>It was possible to express this before the ternary, but this is a much more concise expression. </p><h3>The size limit for rules files is now 256 KB!</h3>  <p>And finally, here's a feature for those of you with longer rules. Until now, rules files had to be smaller than 64 KB. (To be more specific, the compiled AST of the rules file had to be smaller than 64 KB, and you wouldn't know you were within the limit until you tried to deploy the rules.) This limit was holding some developers back, and once you reached the limit, you had to start making tradeoffs in your rules. We definitely wanted to fix this. </p><p>Since this is one of the limits that helps rules return a decision in nanoseconds, we wanted to find a way to increase the limit without sacrificing performance. We optimized how we compile and store the Rules file, and we were able to quadruple the limit to 256 KB!  </p><p>The limits on rules are in place to keep rules fast enough to return a decision in nanoseconds, but we work hard to keep them workable. Let us know if you start to outgrow any of them </p><p>All of these features are informed by the feedback we hear from you about what's great, what's hard, and what's confusing about Firestore Security Rules, so keep letting us know what you think! </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/IRFyi2Uxwx0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:36:00 +0000","feedId":10592,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mgKVS5D-2W4/XupeRC3Z4TI/AAAAAAAAEzg/Tw1cD41eQKELSZBSsgIjzWRBSm9oPbsgwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-09%2Bat%2B3.48.03%2BPM.png","linkMd5":"a79ec8078ce95e72f0b695faacfe464a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-58-34-651_ab33088553dcf079.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":1096,"sourceBytes":380108,"destBytes":115920,"author":"Firebase","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mgKVS5D-2W4/XupeRC3Z4TI/AAAAAAAAEzg/Tw1cD41eQKELSZBSsgIjzWRBSm9oPbsgwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-09%2Bat%2B3.48.03%2BPM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-58-34-651_ab33088553dcf079.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-deycj3QmJ_o/Wsum3yaKqaI/AAAAAAAAB_s/2ufTvigOiIMXRP3iTU7wRGuzmirUTpWjACLcBGAs/s1600/209641.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn86@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-58-42-987_d31f6fb359423258.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~4/IRFyi2Uxwx0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn34@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-58-42-232_08d345c4f7924e6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317114228},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:58:34","title":"Announcing the Firebase Crashlytics SDK Beta!","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FirebaseBlog/~3/fs6DGlxtq2w/announcing-firebase-crashlytics-sdk-beta.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AwqhOKRFSg8/XlA0znx7SjI/AAAAAAAAEqs/m2s7b8ctQzElNXreYaG2UDoXo7Iu72WjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ERKfCfGXYAY1FPe.jpeg\"><img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AwqhOKRFSg8/XlA0znx7SjI/AAAAAAAAEqs/m2s7b8ctQzElNXreYaG2UDoXo7Iu72WjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ERKfCfGXYAY1FPe.jpeg\"> <figure class=\"profile\"> <div class=\"profile-picture\">    <img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c_A4kawPTqQ/XkyK50vldMI/AAAAAAAAEqg/tS5wkRQFhwwRiYMIMYJxyCwJzxaugRblACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/shobit.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\" data-original-width=\"600\" data-original-height=\"600\" />\" />  </div><figcaption>    <strong><div>Shobhit Chugh</div></strong>      <em>Product Manager</em>  </figcaption></figure> <p>Stability is critical to your app’s success, so we’ve continued to enhance Firebase with tools to help you maintain high quality apps. This includes bringing the best of Fabric’s crash reporting tools to Firebase. Many of you have made the move from Fabric to Firebase yet still have questions like “Why do I still have ‘Fabric’ everywhere in my code?” or “Why does it feel like I am in Firebase, yet still in Fabric?” </p><p>We can now lay your questions to rest. We're excited to announce Firebase Crashlytics SDK is in Beta! </p><p>With the Firebase Crashlytics SDK, you can remove all Fabric dependencies, such as references to Fabric’s APIs in your code, giving you a much cleaner codebase.  </p><p>The Firebase Crashlytics SDK is also designed to be intuitive and consistent with all other Firebase SDKs. For example, the Crashlytics SDK has consistent package names, API design, and initialization as other Firebase SDKs. </p><p>The Crashlytics SDK also supports Mac Catalyst apps, in addition to iOS, macOS, and tvOS apps. This new feature makes it easier for you to continue building apps for Apple devices.  </p><p>We’ve also open-sourced the Crashlytics SDK to further increase the extensibility and transparency of our platform.  </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-091SGoLQodg/XkyKQy7ZFcI/AAAAAAAAEqI/9r10t9-eI4kOHYk_YG_ZfAyCxx2JHW1DgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/crash1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-091SGoLQodg/XkyKQy7ZFcI/AAAAAAAAEqI/9r10t9-eI4kOHYk_YG_ZfAyCxx2JHW1DgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/crash1.png\" data-original-width=\"1494\" data-original-height=\"674\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SBBBSvkJYZo/XkyKUSqEbYI/AAAAAAAAEqU/ZgXBsALLizEOXiVPZG4GLu-55xixTBmVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/crash.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SBBBSvkJYZo/XkyKUSqEbYI/AAAAAAAAEqU/ZgXBsALLizEOXiVPZG4GLu-55xixTBmVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/crash.png\" data-original-width=\"1520\" data-original-height=\"814\" /></a></p><p>Combining analytics data and crashes helps you unlock additional insights into your app’s stability. The Firebase Crashlytics SDK works seamlessly with the Google Analytics SDK to provide features such as crash-free statistics, the Latest Release report, and Breadcrumbs. With Breadcrumbs you can see the steps a user took that led to a crash. This insight helps you reproduce and fix issues quickly. Google Analytics replaces Fabric's legacy analytics engine, Answers, so we encourage you to add Google Analytics to your apps. </p><p>Try it out! </p><p>Ready to begin developing with Firebase Crashlytics SDK?

We want to meet developers where they are, no matter what platform that may be using.     <p>At I/O earlier this year, we announced <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/get-started-web\">Firebase Performance Monitoring for web</a>. It was our next big step in bringing the complete suite of Firebase products to the web. And just a few weeks ago, at the Firebase Summit, we announced support for web apps in Google Analytics, Cloud Messaging and Remote Config! These new features give you insight into your web users, what they are doing inside your app, and help you create personalized experiences for them - just like you already do on native.  Let’s take a closer look at all that is new for web developers in Firebase.  <p><h2>Google Analytics</h2></p><p>At the heart of a successful app and business strategy lies data. Analytics helps you understand how your user base is growing, who these users are, and what actions they are taking in your app.  You can then use these insights to  build tailored experiences that will delight, engage and retain your users.  <p>If you're already comfortable using Google Analytics for your native apps, the web version of Analytics should look very familiar to you. But if you are new to Firebase, there are a few key components in Analytics we want to highlight: <ul> <li>The Analytics Dashboard, which displays key performance indicators such as daily or monthly active users, revenue, and session engagement metrics. Also, these can be filtered along multiple dimensions such as app version, device model or any of your app data streams - and now web data is one of them too.<br><br><p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TfIeZmXq4L8/Xdhf0C4piAI/AAAAAAAAEbI/XaPLvqLz5hcC8pVb2FHm7A6NG_LTPwcdQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/analytics%2Bdashboard.png\" data-original-width=\"1518\" data-original-height=\"960\" alt=\"analytics dashboard\"/> <li>Detailed events reports allow you to dive one level deeper by giving you event-level insight into any event you are logging as well as any associated registered parameters<br>  <li>Retention reports that help you see how well you are retaining your users<br>  <li>StreamView, which gives you an overview of where and when user engagement is happening in real time<br><br><p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SUE0s_QBZCo/XdhgC6iH2BI/AAAAAAAAEbM/aI_h1pYN4U09nkEXCV-9wXdT71XEGYmSwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/streamview.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1091\" alt=\"StreamView\"/></li></ul> <p>Analytics also has a feature called audiences, which provides a way to segment users along attributes that are meaningful to you. For example, you can create an audience comprising all the users who performed a specific sequence of events in your app. These audiences now also work for users on the web, and membership can even be evaluated across multiple platforms by <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9213390\">setting the user_id</a> in the Analytics SDK.  <p>Let’s take the example of an e-commerce app and a product review feature. One important thing to track in such an app is users who started writing a product review, and then left without completing it. Using audiences, we can create a user segment that represents exactly this group of users.  <p>Example sequence of events “Started session” > “Started review” > “Canceled review”  <p>We can create an audience representing that sequence in the Audience builder shown in the screenshot below: <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KzwpJ4hyE8c/XdhgjdIIpTI/AAAAAAAAEbY/G6Q4_jLXS8wJsueg6yAZLFos3QWmgPSbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/audience%2Bbuilder.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1349\" alt=\"audience builder\" /><p>In the next two sections we will show you how to combine audiences with Remote Config & Cloud Messaging to create personalized experiences for your users.  <p><h2>Remote Config</h2><p>Remote Config (<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/use-config-web\">now works on web</a>) gives you the power to alter your app for any segment of users without requiring you to release a new build. For example, you can segment users by geo and date (like Christmas) and infuse a holiday color palette into your app.  <p>Going back to the product review example, say you want to show a custom message when any user who’s part of the “Abandoned reviewers” audience opens the app. You can now use that audience as the targeting condition for your Remote Config parameters across both your web and native apps.  You could even strategically roll out new features to target audiences across web and native, so you can monitor regression and roll it back if you run into any issues. <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OH1UBcyXaX4/XdhjX6tRZTI/AAAAAAAAEcE/LLwYzp0v3Doe9yanZIF94OR_GkeFZ7pmgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/proddddd.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"551\" alt=\"product review page\" /> <p><h2>Cloud Messaging</h2><p>Cloud Messaging has already been <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client\">available for web</a> for quite some time. What's new is that FCM for web is now integrated with Google Analytics, which allows you to send targeted notifications to your users based on their behavior in your app. You can do this by leveraging both new web specific signals (like browser type) and Google Analytics’ custom audiences and user properties. It’s another great way for you to personalize your users’ app experiences.   <p>What’s also new is that campaigns can be easily configured in the Firebase console. Additionally, the funnel report that tracks campaign success also now works for web campaigns. All you need to do is specify an Analytics conversion event when setting up your campaign and the report will track success automatically.  <p>Let’s go back to our favorite product review example. Now that we have a way to identify the audience who haven’t completed their reviews, we can re-engage them with tailored notifications for users on the native app as well as users on the web app. Since the audience is already being populated by Google Analytics with these user segments, you now simply have to go to Firebase Cloud Messaging in the Firebase console and create a campaign which sends a message to these audiences on their respective platforms. <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9uZRmYblRrY/XdhiSdriltI/AAAAAAAAEbs/MK3Dxs6vgxIkrBUtXWNI5sszCGNs7hTVgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/productrev2.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"755\" alt=\"Product reviews example 2\"/><p>Once we’ve started our messaging re-engagement campaign, we can use Google Analytics to create closed funnels to view the performance of the engagement workflow on any specific platform. <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-40duGXcTaEk/Xdhia4d60yI/AAAAAAAAEbw/tI94Mh8WQzEq_miSJiQU550raZDW9HzPgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ga.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"693\" alt=\"Google Analytics\" /><p><h2>How to get started with all the new web features</h2><p>To use any of what we just described you, take a look at the instructions for implementing and integrating the web analytics SDK <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/get-started\">here</a>. One important note is that if you are already using analytics for your native apps, you will first need to<a href=\"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/07/firebase-google-analytics-upgrade.html\"> upgrade to the full Google Analytics experience</a> in order to access web analytics. The Remote Config SDK for web is currently in Beta and you can access it <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/use-config-web\">here</a>. To get started with FCM for web, simply follow the instructions <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client\">here</a>.  </p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>We hope you’re as excited about these new web features as we are. The above example illustrates one way you can use the new web analytics features to improve your web app experience and engage users, but there are many more ways these features can be used together. We can’t wait to hear what use cases you’ve implemented in your own web apps.

Numerous studies have pointed out that real estate investing has created more millionaires throughout history than any other form of investing (like <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidgreene/2018/11/27/why-real-estate-builds-wealth-more-consistently-than-other-asset-classes/#57f3ab4d5405\">this one</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/real-estate-is-still-the-best-investment-you-can-make-today-millionaires-say.html\">this one</a>). So why don’t more people do it? </p><p>I asked myself this very question a few years ago after talking to a group of friends about the success I’ve had with real estate, and listening to their reasons why they think it’s out of their reach.  </p><p>A common theme among them was that they viewed it as something too difficult to learn and master. There were too many steps, the learning curve was steep and there was a lot of room for mistakes for somebody just starting out, especially when analyzing the financial performance of potential investment properties. </p><p>Traditionally, most investors used spreadsheets to do the math - which works only if you know what and how you’re calculating something. But if you don’t know that, it’s very easy to make mistakes and overlook things. And no one wants to make mathematical errors before a huge purchase like an investment property. </p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mRLrvwOF9pI/XeWXDtFaMlI/AAAAAAAAEco/yYYHM3nIW3sjprg19WvM553bGAfwYkL8ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image1.png\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"800\" alt=\"analysis spreadsheet\"/><p id=\"imgCaption\">Where do I even begin?!</p><p>And that’s when I had the idea to build <a href=\"https://dealcheck.io/\">DealCheck</a> – a cloud-based, easy-to-use property analysis tool for real estate investors and agents. I wanted to create a platform that would help new investors learn the ropes and avoid costly mistakes, but at the same time provide the flexibility to perform more advanced analysis with a click of a button.</p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E3fRR96Bq-U/XeWXipeaQII/AAAAAAAAEcw/_rEUdakP-M0x6l719BQDRrnvUT8T_C92ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/dealcheck%2Blanding%2Bpage.png\" data-original-width=\"1500\" data-original-height=\"808\" alt=\"dealcheck home screen\"/><p id=\"imgCaption\">Making real estate investing easier and more accessible.</p><h2>The Challenges of Solo Development</h2><p>I was working as a front-end engineer at the time, so I knew I could build the UI myself, but what about the back-end, data storage, authentication, and a bunch of other things you need for a full-functioning cloud app?  <p>I didn’t know anybody I could bring on as a co-founder, so I set out to research what technologies and platforms I could leverage to help me with the back-end and server infrastructure.  <p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> kept popping up again and again and I began to look at it in more detail. It was then recently acquired by Google and its collection of BaaS (backend-as-a-service) modules seemed to offer the exact solution I needed to build DealCheck.  <p>I was especially impressed with the documentation for each feature and how well all of the different technologies could be tied together to create one unified platform.  <p>It wasn’t long before I signed up and started building the first MVP of the app. <h2>Using Firebase to Quickly Build a Scalable Backend</h2><p>As the only developer on the project, I had limited time and resources to spend on building the back-end, so I set out to use every Firebase feature that was available at the time to my advantage.  <p>My goal was actually to write as little server-side code as possible and instead focus on leveraging the different Firebase modules to solve three specific challenges: <h3>Challenge #1 - Authentication and User Management</h3><p>The first one was authentication and user management. DealCheck’s users needed the ability to create their accounts so they can view and analyze properties on any device (more on that later). I wanted to have the ability to sign in with email, Facebook or a Google account. </p><p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth\">Firebase Authentication</a> was designed specifically for this purpose and I used it to handle pretty much the entire authentication flow. Out-of-the-box, it has support for all the major social networks, cross-network credential linking and the basic account management operations like email changes, password resets and account deletions. </p><p>There was no server-side code required at all – I just needed to build the UI on the front-end.  </p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yx5OdG7eAlM/XeWYlDT_xnI/AAAAAAAAEc8/W-Wa_ykc8xMmL46p7eMRoZR-r7HMz5eAACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/google%2Bsign%2Bin.png\" data-original-width=\"1500\" data-original-height=\"860\" alt=\"Email, Facebook and Google sign in powered by Firebase.\"/><p id=\"imgCaption\">Email, Facebook and Google sign in powered by Firebase.</p><p>And as an added benefit, Firebase Authentication ties directly into the Realtime Database product to create a declarative permissions and access control framework that’s easy to implement and maintain. This helped me make sure user data was protected from unauthorized access, but also facilitate data sharing among users.  <h3>Challenge #2 - Cloud Storage with Cross-Device Sync</h3><p>Next up was data storage. I knew that I wanted DealCheck’s users to be able to use the app and analyze properties online, on iOS and Android. So I needed a real-time, cloud-based database solution that could sync data across any device.</p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D45vF2jufU8/XeWY7ducYHI/AAAAAAAAEdE/rO-YQ5WWg7AWfIg8o66lzijyzwS75P3pACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/sync.png\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"920\" alt=\"Syncing data across web and mobile\"/><p id=\"imgCaption\">Syncing data across web and mobile is not easy!</p><p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database\">Firebase Realtime Database</a> is a NoSQL, JSON-based database solution that was designed exactly for this purpose, and I was actually surprised how great it worked. I used the official <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/angularfire\">AngularJS bindings for Firebase</a> on the front-end to read and write to it directly from the client. </p><p>I had to do some extra work on mobile to implement an offline mode with syncing after reconnections, but all-together the code required to make everything work was minimal. </p><p>As I mentioned, Firebase Authentication tied directly to the database to facilitate access control, so I really didn’t need to do anything extra there. And I was able to set up automatic daily backups of all the data with a click of a button.  </p><h3>Challenge #3 - Third-Party Integrations</h3><p>Up to now, I had written exactly 0 lines of server-side code and everything was handled by the client directly. As DealCheck’s development progressed, however, I knew that I would need a server to handle some operations that could not be done in the client. </p><p>I wasn’t very experienced with server maintenance and DevOps, but fortunately the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions\">Firebase Cloud Functions</a> product was able to solve all of my needs. Cloud Functions are essentially single-purpose functions that can be triggered (or executed) based on a specific HTTP request or events coming from the Authentication, Realtime Database or other Firebase products. </p><p>Each function can be run once based on a specific event trigger to perform its prescribed task. You don’t have to worry about provisioning a server instance or managing load – everything is done automatically for you by Firebase. </p><p>What’s even cooler, is that Cloud Functions can access the Realtime Database and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage\">Cloud Storage</a> buckets of the same project, performing operations on them server-side, as needed. </p><p>This is how DealCheck processes subscription payments through Stripe, validates Apple and Google Play mobile subscription receipts, integrates with third-party APIs and updates database records without user interaction. </p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T8P-xtHYelk/XeWZlQ9j9PI/AAAAAAAAEdM/lEe24d6RzPIQLry0uA_2tqF07WY_BImHACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image4.png\" data-original-width=\"1500\" data-original-height=\"860\" alt=\"Dealcheck website\"/><p id=\"imgCaption\">Bringing in sales comparable data from third-party providers into DealCheck.</p><p>Cloud Functions became the “glue” that tied the entire back-end infrastructure together. <h2>Growing from an MVP to 100,000 Users with Firebase</h2><p>The first version of the DealCheck app was built and launched in less than 5 months with just me on the development team. I definitely don’t think that would have been possible without Firebase powering the back-end infrastructure. Maybe the project wouldn’t have ever launched at all.  <p>While Firebase is awesome for quick MVP development, it’s definitely designed to power production applications at scale as well. As DealCheck grew from a small side-project to one of the most popular real estate apps with over 100k users, all of the Firebase products that we use scaled to support the increasing load.   <p>Moreover, the fantastic interoperability of all Firebase modules allows us to develop and release new features much faster because of the reduced coding requirements and ease of configuration.  <p>So next time you’re looking to build an ambitious project with a small team – take a look at how Firebase can help you reduce development time and provide a suite of powerful tools that scale as your business grows.  <p>This is exactly how DealCheck grew from a simple idea to make property analysis easier and faster, to an app that is helping tens of thousands of people grow their wealth and passive income through real estate investing. It’s a truly awesome and fulfilling experience to see your work positively impact so many people and it wouldn’t have been possible without Firebase.</p> <img
