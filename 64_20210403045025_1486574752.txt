Cultured meat is the process of growing meat from cells extracted from animals. Many experts believe that cultured meat offers us the opportunity to produce meat with significantly reduced environmental impacts and without slaughtering animals. The technology is being rapidly developed across the world and is beginning to be introduced to some high-end restaurants but there has been discussion about whether one day we may be able to grow our own meat from animal cells in our own kitchens. Carnerie is a ‘grow your own meat’ device for around twenty years in the future. It is controlled by an app, whereby the user is able to order cell capsules from local farms in order to grow a variety of different types of meat. This conceptual, speculative project is designed to help us visualize what this future scenario could be like and whether it’s a future that we would buy into.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/inspired-by-norman-walker-the-father-of-juicing-this-compact-masticating-juicer-easily-fits-onto-any-countertop/00_walkerjuicer_hatchduo_compactjuicer.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/auto-draft/02_walkerjuicer_hatchduo_compactjuicer.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Hatch Duo has designed <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/27/this-sleek-yet-compact-juicer-pays-homage-to-norman-walker-and-easily-fits-into-every-kitchen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Walker Juicer</a>, a masticating juicer without the bulk. Offering a slower, more concentrated grind, masticating juicers do not incorporate too much heat or oxygen into their juicing process. In regard to nutritional value, masticating juicers are largely preferred over centrifugal juicers. However, masticating juicers typically take up more space than centrifugal juicers since their slower grind generally requires a longer spout and auger. The Walker Juicer consolidates the parts of a masticating juicer and places them in its main body to create a more compact build without compromising each juice’s nutritional value.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/ototos-ninja-cutting-board-comes-with-its-own-knife-docked-inside-it/ninja_cutting_board_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UrUf7U2.gif\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p>Clearly meant for people who’d like to live out the game Fruit Ninja in real life,<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/18/ototos-ninja-cutting-board-comes-with-its-own-knife-docked-inside-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the Ninja Cutting Board &#38; Knife</a> from OTOTO is an adorable little kitchen accessory that makes mise en place fun!

The pump, which is no larger than a thumb-drive or a car-charger, locks into the air valves on the SealVax bags and comes with two ports at the opposite end – a Type-C port, and a Lightning connector. Designed to plug into any iPhone or Android smartphone, the vacuum pump runs on your smartphone’s battery, sucking the air out of the SealVax bag in mere seconds. Worried about liquids in your bag? The SealVax even has a liquid isolator, which transfers fluids into a separate chamber (instead of sucking them into the vacuum).

There’s an incredible amount of nuance in the way everyone’s wrist moves as they operate knives while chopping, slicing, scouring, or peeling, so the guys at Écriture had a pretty brilliant idea – “What if the knives weight-adjusted based on how you used them?” It sounds like a bizarre question, but to be honest, it’s all in the physics of knife-work. When you need your wrists to put in the work, a knife with a heavy handle serves best. When you need a knife’s blade to do the work for you, a heavier blade allows for better cutting, so rather than having different knives for different applications, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/03/these-kitchen-knives-let-you-adjust-their-center-of-gravity-for-a-uniquely-custom-chopping-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Ecriture Perfect Knives</a> come with a switch on the handle that lets you shift the knife’s center of gravity. A sliding weight inside the hollow handle allows you to decide the knife’s balancing point, giving you better control based on your technique. The Ecriture Perfect Knives come in a set of 6 exquisitely designed blades for handling a variety of tasks. From mincing to filleting, julienning to slicing, there’s a blade for every occasion and a patented weight-switching mechanism in each handle for every individual.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/Anytongs_turn_your_flatware_into_kitchen_tongs.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/776/872/990a1fb70174b73a8e18dc19a7eb0839_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1594407309&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=bb670af2e6e8d9eefaedfce61d917b03\" width=\"1050&#34;/\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designed so that you can snap your existing spoons and forks to their form, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/11/08/this-nifty-gadget-turns-your-cutlery-or-flatware-into-instant-tongs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Anytongs</a> can turn your cutlery and flatware into a pair of instant tongs. The Anytongs were made to be a smaller, more universal alternative to the tongs you use and own. Its compact design lets it easily occupy less than half the space of your pair of tongs, while the ability to slot your own spoons and forks into it means you can use it for anything from grilling and flipping, to serving and stirring. A well-calibrated torsion-spring sits at one end of the Anytongs, giving it a wonderful snappy-springy experience that makes it incredibly easy to use, while rubber pads on its tips allow for comfortable use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/this-sustainable-cutting-board-has-10-features-that-includes-killing-99-99-germs/ChopBox_UV-light_sanitizing-chopping-board6-hero.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0dc98d_bd57638f465540b5a14a5e5d83617bef~mv2.gif\" alt=\"chopbox1\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p>You can easily sanitize your knives and cutting surfaces, embrace your inner quarantine chef with germ-free cooking thanks to Chopbox’s built-in disinfecting UVC light – see I told you, this board is lit and literally!

The product’s large, front-facing button functions as the unit’s control panel. The touchscreen dial’s usability is akin to a round thermostat’s – its circular formation allows users to adjust aspects of cooking, like levels of temperature and the duration of timers, simply by dragging haptic sensors one way or the other around the screen’s perimeter. Compatible with the Samsung Health app from Google Play, Barr also connects to its app that provides new recipes and health information.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308576\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/kitchen-gadgets-ds/kitchen_ds_yanko_design-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"961\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308577\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/kitchen-gadgets-ds/kitchen_ds_yanko_design-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"961\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://goat-story.com/products/gina-smart-black?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GOAT STORY GINA smart coffee instrument</a> allows you to brew your own coffee in the comfort of your own home, and in three different styles &#8211; pour-over, drip, and French Press.

The design lets you have access to fresh greenery 365 days a year without sacrificing any counter space or causing a mess. It is compact and works wonderfully for small urban apartments or big suburban houses. What makes this herb garden unique its compactness because it makes it invisible in your kitchen space. Designer Igor Abakumov drew inspiration from his own life experience for this. “My mom is a real culinary virtuoso and she often complains about the lack of specific greens in the store. And then I got the idea to design a home garden that will be built into the kitchen and will delight with greenery all year round,” he explains.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

lot more space in the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/washing-machine/\">washing machine</a> than we might give them credit. Most of the time, I reason with the overflow of socks by removing a bulky pair of jeans or a couple of t-shirts, otherwise, I keep the socks in the laundry basket to await next week’s load. It’s a good thing I own a lot of socks. The creators from EZVALO have created a <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/appliance/\">miniature washing machine</a> to take care of our smaller undergarments called NIX so they don’t take up most of the space or get lost in the cycle of our regular loads of laundry.</p>\n<p>NIX is a miniature washing machine specifically built to clean, dry, and sanitize our undergarments, like underwear, undershirts, and socks, using less water in the process. The miniature washing machine features an inclined drum that promises to save water while also making it easier for users to load, unload, and keep an eye on their laundry. Additionally, NIX comes with an integrated water tank, allowing users to place their miniature washing machine anywhere they’d like without the hassle of having to attach hoses or electrical appliances to a wall outlet. Featuring a vertical-lifting door, the designers behind NIX boast its futuristic and clean design scheme. Along the top of NIX’s main door, a digital display screen allows users to denote which cycle they’d like NIX to perform all through the use of haptic sensors.</p>\n<p>Shortlisted for 2021’s iF Design Award, NIX is a miniature laundry machine that saves water and space so that users can clean their smaller clothing items like pairs of underwear and socks. Even besides that, NIX seems like an especially convenient household appliance for more urgent washing matters like accidental red wine spills or guacamole mishaps. Yes, I’m speaking from personal experience.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.ezvalo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EZVALO</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full

the two together? Meet the &#8216;Flowery Tale&#8217;, a visual portmanteau by Japan-based design brand Mecli. The Flowery Tale comes designed to outwardly look like a book, but open it up and it turns into a 3D vase made out of the book&#8217;s specially-cut pages. When opened, the hard-bound book&#8217;s spine provides ample negative space to slide a test tube through, and there you have it, a &#8216;paper&#8217; vase with flowers blooming through! I mean, this is just MADE for Instagram!</p>\n<p>The Flowery Tale comes with three different vase designs (cutouts, to be precise) built into the same book. With thick partitions separating them, you can simply open up the book to any vase design you want, and the cut-out pages give you the visual gestalt of continuity, resembling a vase made out of paper. The vases are designed to be inverted too, so while each book comes with 3 vase designs, they can be flipped over resulting in as many as 6 different visual styles to go with your flowers. The test-tube comes with a stopper that allows it to rest on the top of the book without sliding through, and the Flowery Tale&#8217;s pages are waterproof, so a little splash of water won&#8217;t do them any harm!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://mecli.jp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mecli</a></p>\n<p><img

width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>As the gloom of the pandemic continues, two brands – rather distinct in approach – have collaborated for a Spring 2021 collection complete with a rainbow of colors. The Technicolor capsule collection is an outcome of the uncanny partnership between Lacoste and <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/polaroid/\">Polaroid</a> that comprises an instant <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/camera/\">camera</a> and clothing made in each other’s iconic styles.</p>\n<p>Lacoste-themed Polaroid 600 instant film camera in red and green hue is the highlight of the consortium. This boxy camera mimics the former’s crocodile logo &#8211; in an animated form of course &#8211; when the built-in flash is popped open. The peppy camera strikes an instant chord with the era gone by thanks to its retro look and bold use of colors. On the other hand, Polaroid-themed Lacoste apparels feature Technicolor sweatshirts, tracksuits, swimwear, T-shirts, and the like, with Polaroid photo prints in the brand’s rainbow logo that transports you back to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>While the spectrum of Polaroid colors goes from photography to fabric, the Lacoste touch to the Polaroid camera transposes a new attraction to the classic Polaroid 600 instant film camera. A genuine piece of vintage retro-tech, this is in all respects a functional camera instead of being just a charming little boxy crocodile one may count it out for on the first glance. With its retro spirit, this new Polaroid 600 offers highly saturated style and if you want to own the fancy cam, it is available in Europe along with a strap and a pack of 600 color film for €150.</p>\n<p>Designer: Lacoste x Polaroid</p>\n<p><a

requirements!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=308626","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308627\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/sit-to-stand-desk/sit_to_stand_desk_yanko_design-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been three months into 2021, and I&#8217;ve honestly pretty much gotten used to working from home. At this point in time, the work from home routine suits me just fine, except for the fact that constantly sitting around on a desk can turn out to be problematic for my back and posture. The knots on my shoulder are at an all-time high, and I&#8217;m always on the lookout for ergonomically designed work desks and chairs, that can allow me to work for hours on end, without sacrificing my back to Satan! During one of my hunts for home office furniture, I came across the UFOU UPON Intelligent Sit-to-Stand Desk. UPON is supposed to be the world&#8217;s 1st e-desk with three-axis adjustments! What this basically means, is that it&#8217;s a lifting table that is adaptable to various height adjustments.</p>\n<p>Designed by UFOU Design Inc, the height of the desk can be freely adjusted from 650mm to 1300m, so it&#8217;s suitable for everyone, whether child or adult! It doesn&#8217;t matter how tall you are, you can easily customize the modular desk to suit your height and posture. No more straining your neck, because a desk is too short for you (I&#8217;m 5&#8217;11 and I struggle with this ALL the time). The tray can be extended up to 150mm, and the flip angle lockable from 0 to 35 degrees. All these intriguing features let you work while sitting or standing and make it suitable for a variety of activities from reading, writing, drawing to working on your laptop. The three-axis adjustment allows the table to be extended upwards, downwards, forward, backward, and at multiple tilted angles. You can do this via the patented &#8216;Joy-Con&#8217; controller, which is quite similar to a Joystick. The controller comes equipped with a sedentary reminder, lock, and memory button. Additionally, an intelligent anti-pinch function prevents the desk from getting jammed up or trapped.</p>\n<p>With a standing desk like UPON you can almost never get bored! You never have to work in the same old position for long hours. You can adjust the desk according to your moods and comfort, allowing you to truly focus on your work, letting your creativity flow, and in turn, increasing your productivity. UPON is not limited to a single user, it can in fact cater to the needs of multiple users. It can adapt to the requirements of various people from different age groups, heights, and fields of work. If you do install such a desk in your home office, it can be utilized by all the working members of your family, irrespective of how they choose to use it. UPON&#8217;s various configurations make it compatible with all sorts of methods of applications, so each user can make the most of the desk, in their own style! UPON is a modern, modular, and intelligent desk whose applications and possibilities are endless!</p>\n<p>Designer: UFOU Design Inc.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308629\"

culminate in and focus on just one thing and one thing only &#8211; an incredibly luxurious driving experience. With a car, just like with any product, you&#8217;re less likely to remember the car&#8217;s features but you&#8217;re much more likely to remember how the car made you &#8216;feel&#8217;, and that&#8217;s exactly what the LF-Z focuses on. Every detail of the car is crafted with user emotion and user experience in mind, resulting in a vehicle that&#8217;s hard to ignore and definitely hard to forget! The crossover-styled vehicle sports an edgy, authoritative aesthetic that commands one&#8217;s attention, with slick, razor-thin headlights and taillights, side mirror cams, and door-handles that sit flush within the surface, popping out when a driver or passenger approaches the vehicle.</p>\n<p>The LF-Z comes powered by Lexus&#8217;s new all-electric platform that sits underneath the automobile. Lexus claims its all-new powertrain will vastly improve acceleration and power delivery compared to traditional cars, offering an impressive range and accelerating speed. The car comes with a lower center-of-gravity, allowing for razor-sharp handling and enhanced control. The car comes outfitted with Steer-By-Wire, a technology that replaces the traditional steering mechanism for a &#8220;fully electronic and speed-sensitive system that filters out any unwanted road vibration.&#8221; The futuristic concept comes with an auto-drive feature too, that not only lets you summon the car to your doorstep or from the parking lot, but also lets you switch to auto-pilot while you drive, allowing the car to take over all driving functions while you kick back and enjoy the in-car experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Envisioning an open and minimalist design, the interior embodies an elevated level of the Lexus human-centered approach. The Tazuna cockpit features an augmented reality head-up display, gauges, touchscreen display, and other functions that are grouped into a single module. On the road, the artificial intelligence acts as a lifestyle concierge, acknowledging by touch or voice the driver’s preferences, proposing routes, restaurant reservations and more&#8221;, says Lexus in a press release.</p>\n<p>The LF-Z currently exists as a &#8216;vision&#8217; concept, outlining Lexus&#8217;s vision for an electrified future. The company plans on releasing as many as 20 cars as a part of its electric line-up by the year 2025, with the goal of achieving carbon-neutrality through the lifecycle of its entire model line-up by the year 2050.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus</a></p>\n<p><img

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Interior design relies on changing styles to keep things interesting. New trends and color schemes have a way of dictating the trajectory of new products. Then, there are interior design products that stand the test of time and changing trends. These are the pieces of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/furniture/\">furniture</a> that move with us from apartment to apartment. Student designers Rasmus Palmgren and Hanna Höglund gave their own remix of the traditional <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/bookshelf/\">bookshelf</a>, designing a foldable bookshelf that consists of shelves, a cabinet, and a drawer.</p>\n<p>Timeless pieces of furniture like bookshelves and armoires seem to be most functional when they’re stripped down and designed to accommodate their most essential use. At first, Palmgren’s and Höglund’s bookshelf appears as an ordinary, minimal bookshelf, but a closer look reveals the intricate cabinetry work that went into the ‘Fold Shelf’s’ design. The folding mechanisms that fill out Fold Shelf also allow the unit to shrink down to nearly half its size compared to when it&#8217;s fully opened and ready for use. The designers say that Fold Shelf was designed as a Swedish cabinetmaker’s, or journeyman’s piece, requiring the incorporation of a pull-out drawer, hinges, veneered surfaces, and joints.</p>\n<p>In building Fold Shelf, Palmgren and Höglund hoped to create a piece of furniture for flexible living, allowing owners to bring the bookshelf with them as they move to different places. Fold Shelf is filled out with wooden hinges that comprise a folding system, allowing the shelf unit to be dismantled and reassembled without the use of tools or additional hardware. Each individual shelf is connected to the unit’s frame and forms an X via wooden beams that merge at a wooden hinge.</p>\n<p>The shelf’s wooden hinge allows the beams to fold onto one another, shrinking the bookshelf down to its ladder frame, which could alternatively be used as a rack for hanging. However Fold Shelf is used, the thoughtful combination of minimal cabinetry work with an adaptive design gives Fold Shelf an air of modern sophistication, while not compromising its simple assembly.</p>\n<p>Designers: <a href=\"https://rasmuspalmgren.com/\">Rasmus Palmgren</a> and Hanna Höglund</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308806\"

href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/dog/\">dog</a>, Scraps who loves to sit on her lap and a <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/chair/\">desk chair</a> that could be improved because of it. Dogs especially like sitting on top of you when you’re working on less important matters, like your job. Searching up and down Google’s limits, Giertz noticed time and time again that there weren’t any desk chairs on the market designed for people with small dogs whose preferred seated position was located anywhere on their owner’s body. So, in the trailblazing nature of her YouTube channel, she designed her own.</p>\n<p>In her uploaded YouTube video, <em>A chair made for needy pets</em> Giertz takes us through the construction of both the chair’s initial prototype and its final form. Using Fusion 360, Giertz created a 3D model of the pet chair. The model features an enclosed crate, the main dog door, footrest, stairs, and roof to also work as Giertz’s seat. Employing CNC milling to construct the chair’s top seat and roof, sidewalls, stairs, and front entryway, Giertz cut vertical ridges along the sidewalls to bend them around the radius of the chair. After mounting the pieces of plywood together to form the prototype’s planned structure, Giertz uses screws to attach them, but the finished prototype saw some improvements.</p>\n<p>Giertz turned to CNC milling to construct the chair’s bottom piece, this time formed in two sections to fit onto the CNC bed. On top of the chair’s joined bottom piece, the rest of the CNC-milled pieces of plywood came together. To help Scraps move up and down the chair’s steps with more confidence, Giertz narrowed the distance between the steps and added a railing system to border the chair’s stairs, main seat, and roof.</p>\n<p>Increasing the size of the dog house’s main door and solving the trouble that came with bent plywood, Giertz opted for a fuller opening located in the spot where the plywood had to bend around the chair’s radius, leaving less tension in the wood. To see Giertz build the chair from the ground up and paint it a “moldy, vomit color,” as she describes (although I&#8217;d like even a moldier seafoam green) &#8211; scroll below and be sure to watch

Architecture always captures my attention and mesmerizes me! There&#8217;s something extraordinary about a structure seamlessly floating on water without any real support. It&#8217;s a mystery to me, and I&#8217;m always trying to dive into the science of it. As if floating architectural structures weren&#8217;t masterpieces already, architects are now getting even more creative and inventive. Hotels, cinemas, man-made islands, and even greenhouses can be seen idly floating on water bodies all over the world. From a floating cinema in Paris along the banks of River Seine to a cluster of artificial floating island parks in Copenhagen, we&#8217;ve curated a collection of architectural wonders that&#8217;ll have you thinking, &#8220;How did anyone even manage to build this?!&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know about you, but most of these places have sealed a spot on my must-see wishlist.

Deemed &#8216;Cinéma Sur L&#8217;Eau, the launch of the cinema marks the inauguration of &#8216;Paris Plages&#8217;, a summer program held every year alongside the river Seine. The program features a variety of outdoor sports and recreational activities, and the floating cinema is one of its offerings. This floating concept ensures that the attendees are able to watch and enjoy a movie on a 16 x 9-meter screen while maintaining the necessary distance and practicing precautions. It&#8217;s a brilliant idea that ensures social distancing is enforced while engaging in a fun leisure activity!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/auto-draft/1-floating_park_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/auto-draft/2-floating_park_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Have you heard that phrase “Whatever floats your boat”? If you are in Copenhagen, you might even hear “Whatever floats your park!” and that would be in reference to the world’s first “parkipelago” (a portmanteau of park and archipelago) which are a cluster of artificial floating island parks. Designed by a Danish design studio, Studio Fokstrot, and Australian architect Marshall Blecher, these islands were a part of urban development along the waterfront. They are officially called <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/11/17/these-floating-island-parks-could-be-a-part-of-our-new-normal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Copenhagen Islands</a> and each module is created with a flexible public program to keep the interest of the urban dwellers at its core. The islands are activity-friendly and enable visitors to enjoy boating, swimming, kayaking, picnics, performances, events, and more which could also boost tourism or simply make things better for citizens with travel being on the down-low this year.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/prvok/02-prvok_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/prvok/07-prvok_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">We’ve seen buildings being made using <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/02/19/nasa-plans-to-use-mushrooms-to-build-sustainable-housing-on-mars-like-this-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mushrooms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/15/recycled-sand-and-plastic-waste-are-used-to-make-this-sustainable-brick/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bricks made from recycled plastic and sand waste</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/14/organic-concrete-curves-give-an-unconventional-vibe-to-this-sustainable-luxury-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">organic concrete</a>, and now are seeing another innovative solution – a floating 3D printed house! <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/16/this-3d-printed-house-reduces-carbon-emissions-and-takes-48-hours-to-build/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prvok</a> is the name of this project and it will be the first 3D printed house in the Czech Republic built by Michal Trpak, a sculptor, and Stavebni Sporitelna Ceske Sporitelny who is a notable member of the Erste building society. The house is designed to float and only takes 48 hours to build! Not only is that seven times faster than traditional houses, but it also reduces construction costs by 50%. No bricks, cement, and concrete (responsible for 8% of CO2 emissions alone!) are used which means it reduces carbon emissions by 20% – imagines how much CO2 could be reduced if this was used to build a colony. A robotic arm called Scoolpt designed by Jiri Vele, an architect, and programmer will be used in 3D printing and can print as fast as 15 cm per second.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/bjarke-ingels-designs-urban-lillypads-that-support-emission-free-transportation-in-a-sustainable-city/Bjarke-Ingels_BioDiverCity_Peninsula_yankodesign-11.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/bjarke-ingels-designs-urban-lillypads-that-support-emission-free-transportation-in-a-sustainable-city/Bjarke-Ingels_BioDiverCity_Peninsula_yankodesign-19.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/05/this-lillypad-inspired-floating-sustainable-city-was-designed-to-support-emission-free-transportation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BiodiverCity</a> is one of Ingels&#8217; most recent projects, it is a city of three islands connected by autonomous vehicles for land, water, and air to make this a transport emission-free habitat off the coast of Malaysia. Three islands will be built in Penang and will serve as cultural, business, and residential hubs. The most striking thing about the development is that all the transportation on the 4,500 acres will consist of autonomous boats, vehicles, and air travel, making the islands car-free and pedestrian-friendly. Construction is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions, in fact, even more than the aviation industry. So to reduce the impact on the environment, most buildings will be prefabricated or 3D printed on-site and others will use a combination of bamboo, Malaysian timber, and “green concrete” which is made from recycled materials like aggregate.</p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/this-floating-villa-will-give-you-a-quick-digital-getaway-to-australia/06-lilypad_yankodesign..jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/this-floating-villa-will-give-you-a-quick-digital-getaway-to-australia/01-lilypad_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/04/20/a-solar-powered-floating-airbnb-that-lets-you-be-a-sustainable-traveler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Lilypad</a> is a luxury villa designed by Chuck Anderson and is anchored just north of Sydney’s Palm Beach. Anderson is a boat enthusiast so it is no surprise that he created a floating house! This beautiful Airbnb is also eco-conscious, it is completely solar-powered and is slowly helping us pivot towards sustainable travel. The exterior of the house is made from timber and includes an open living area, a wine cellar, a sleeping loft, and, of course, a bathroom (for all that wine that we will consume post quarantine on our holiday!). To feel fancy, you have <em>alfresco</em> dining (which means you can eat your food while enjoying the breeze and sun when going outside is cool again) and sunbathing area on the lower level which also boasts of an expansive terrace.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/286200/03-jellyfish_barge_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/286200/01-jellyfish_barge_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Studiomobile and Pnat came up with <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/11/06/this-floating-modular-greenhouse-can-help-coastal-communities-avoid-a-food-crisis-in-2050/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Jellyfish Barge</a> which is a floating, modular greenhouse designed especially for coastal communities and can help them cultivate crops without relying on soil, fresh water, and chemical energy consumption. The innovative greenhouse uses solar energy to purify salt, brackish or polluted water. There are 7 solar desalination units planted around the perimeter and are able to produce 150 liters (39.6 gallons) of clean fresh water every day from the existing water body the greenhouse is floating on. The simple materials, easy self-construction, and low-cost technologies make it accessible to many communities that may not have a big fund.  The module has a 70 square meter wooden base that floats on 96 recycled plastic drums and supports a glass greenhouse where the crops grow. Inside it, there is a high-efficiency hydroponic cultivation method that helps increase water savings by 70% compared to traditional hydroponic systems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/305867/1-ecohotel_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/305867/3-ecohotel_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">This <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/17/this-sustainable-floating-luxury-hotel-powered-by-clean-energy-has-a-revolving-platform-is-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eco-Floating Hotel</a> in Qatar is raising the bar for eco-friendly travel and tourism! Powered by wind + solar energy it also features tidal sustainability mechanisms and a revolving restaurant to give you ALL the best views. Designed by Hayri Atak Architectural Design Studio (HAADS), the hotel would span over 35,000 sq m (376,000 sq ft) and house 152 rooms. The giant glass donut-shaped structure has a lush green cover integrated into its exterior and a mesmerizing indoor waterfall with a huge vortex-like glass roof. Sustainability is at the core of this project and all of the design details are centered around it. The vortex shape of the roof will actually be used to collect rainwater for irrigation and more while solar panels + wind turbines will provide clean energy. Even the water current will be harnessed with a tidal energy system so when the hotel turns it can produce power similar to a dynamo. The hotel also intends to purify seawater and treat the wastewater it produces so it doesn’t harm the environment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/272028/10-nimmo_bay_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/272028/08-nimmo_bay_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">I love a floating cabin but when it comes with a floating spa?! That is the ULTIMATE off-the-grid holiday. This luxury getaway is everything you can dream of post-pandemic! Designed to completely immerse you in nature, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/03/this-floating-health-wellness-sustainable-spa-gives-you-an-immersive-experience-in-nature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nimmo Bay Resorts</a> gives you a wholesome health and wellness experience. Nestled in the wilderness of British Columbia, Nimmo Bay gives you the best of Candian scenery with soaring pine trees and beautiful lakes. One of the most interesting parts of the resort is a floating cedar sauna — a serene, meditative cabin that can be used as a personal wellness space or as a room for group yoga classes. To reach the wooden spa you have to take a kayak or a canoe. The floating wooden platform holds the cabin on one end and an intimate socialization area, picnic table, and tub can on the other end. You can book appointments with practitioners that use both therapeutic and relaxation techniques, as well as Shiatsu and Ayurvedic head massage with 100% natural products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/11/lotus/lotus_01.jpg\" alt=\"lotus_01\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/11/lotus/lotus_02.jpg\" alt=\"lotus_02\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">When you imagine a farm, this is probably the last thing you’d think of… and that’s precisely its appeal! Called <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2017/11/10/not-your-daddys-farm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lotus</a>, this floating architecture is at once a space for growing veggies, dining, and socializing within urban environments. The structure utilizes a vertical design to house its various hydroponic and greenhouse stations. Inside and out, visitors and diners can enjoy waterside views and watch and learn more about their food growing as they dine. Designed to be built on waterways and lakes within cities, they capitalize on centrally located free space to avoid interfering with the existing structures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/292416/22-house_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/292416/15-house_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">With the rising sea levels, coastal communities are first in the line of fire (or should I say water?). <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/sustainable-architecture/\">Architecture is adapting</a> itself to be more energy-efficient and <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/sustainable-design/\">sustainable</a>, but what are we doing about adapting to the changing climate and the disasters they bring? Vietnam-based firm H&#38;P Architects designed and constructed an adaptable (and floating if need be!) house that can be used as a prototype for various communities around the world. The project is called <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/14/this-house-was-designed-to-adapt-to-the-rising-sea-levels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HOUSE</a> and translates into Human’s Optional USE. It is simple and created with minimal construction materials – a steel frame, wall, roofing options, and interior furnishings so it is just the essentials. The purpose of this design was to help resettle those who were in need of housing after being displaced, either due to disasters or other unfortunate events. What makes HOUSE unique is that it is adaptable as a structure – it can work on the land, or on stilts where flooding is common, or simply float all together supported by barrels which make it buoyant. In fact, the frame of the house and the stilts also make it adaptable for mountainous terrain.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

Some of us have <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/?s=interior+design\">redesigned our entire homes</a>, while some of us have taken up a new hobby. And you can find the rest of us sprawled on the couch <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/category/games/\">playing video games</a> or binge-watching sitcoms. In a sort of ode to how we’ve adapted to quarantine, JaK Studio, an architecture, and design firm based in London and Sarajevo, has designed HOM3, a customizable and modular <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/?s=minecraft\">Minecraft-inspired</a> home-building system.</p>\n<p>In creating HOM3, which stands for ‘Home Office Module Cubed,’ the designers at JaK Studio felt inspired by the home-building system featured in Minecraft– the best part of playing video games. To build your own multifunctional HOM3 cabin, JaK Studio is currently working with game designers from AI Interactive to make the process of creating the floor plan feel and look very similar to the process of building your Minecraft home. HOM3 essentially turns the virtual home design process of Minecraft into reality. Speaking to this, founding partner of JaK Studio, Jacob Low says,</p>\n<p>“During [the] lockdown, our team became fascinated by the principles of games such as Minecraft which allow people to transform and customize their environments, and we began experimenting with the idea of customizable, modular micro-architecture. HOM3 transports what we found in the gaming world to the physical space, offering a really unique design solution for modern living.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Committed to artfully showcasing all that we’ve done and learned in quarantine including our environmental impact, the modules built by JaK Studio are made from wood and cork material that has been sustainably sourced or recycled. Additionally, each module is designed following Passivhaus insulating principles, ultimately making for a self-sustained and contained home. The modules that comprise HOM3’s building system start off with a fundamental block module that measures 1.5 x 1.5 meters, which costs $1,193. I wouldn&#8217;t mind spending some quality quarantine time here.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://jakstudio.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JaK Studio</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308768\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/auto-draft/01_home3_jakstudio_minecrafthouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Future owners of HOM3 have the chance to set the size, shape, configuration, and location of their modular cabin.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308766\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/auto-draft/03_home3_jakstudio_minecrafthouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>HOM3 was designed to create a physical space where owners can spend time how they so choose<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– whether it be a spa, gym, bedroom, or office space.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308765\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/auto-draft/04_home3_jakstudio_minecrafthouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>The interior is also up to the future owner to configure.
