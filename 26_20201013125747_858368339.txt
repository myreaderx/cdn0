Now a UK entrepreneur has decided to address the thorny issue of rating venture capitalists.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.landscape.ventures/\">Landscape</a>, a new review platform for tech startup founders to discover and find investment opportunities, officially launches today. Started by CompSci graduate Joe Perkins, the site purports to provide transparent feedback from entrepreneurs on their experiences with European VCs and accelerators. During its recent beta phase, Landscape clocked-up 700 over reviews and has garnered 83 &#8216;Verified Partners&#8217; on the platform. The intention is to start with the UK and Europe and later expand to the US market.</p>\n<p>But Perkins has not started the site without industry involvement. Landscape has built an advisory group which includes Alex Depledge MBE (founder and CEO of Resi), Eammon Carey (MD of Techstars London and partner at The Fund), Emma Sinclair MBE (co-Founder of Enterprise Alumni), Hussein Kanji (partner at Hoxton Ventures), and Jon Bradford (partner at Dynamo Ventures). </p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Another institutional VC giving its backing to the platform is Ada Ventures. Partner &#8216;Check&#8217; Warner said in a statement: “The VC and accelerator landscape is regularly called out due to bad actors or for not doing enough to be more inclusive. There are some great organizations already working with firms to make things better, but data is incredibly important and founders often feel powerless when raising money in the beginning. Landscape’s platform not only provides much-needed transparency for everyone, levels the field, and means investors will have to take consistent and sustained action rather than provide lip service, or a one-off.  Even better &#8211; investors will have more insight into how founders perceive them and have the insights they need to improve.”</p>\n<p>Perkins came up with the idea this year, during the last peak of Covid19 in the UK, after his own experiences raising capital for his educational technology company Coursematch in 2019. “We had been pitching a bunch of investors and I’d been really interested to see how the quality of interaction varied so greatly from each fund. We had one interaction in particular with a London-based fund that ended up being a real time-waster, and I remember thinking “I wish I had a mechanism to warn future founders!”, he commented. Coursematch ended up <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/course-match/company_financials\">raising</a> funds from the Ignite Accelerator and the Development Bank of Wales.</p>\n<p>The platform reviews are provided by anonymous founders, who score VCs and accelerators they have interacted with on 12 different factors such as Approachability, Diversity, and Response Time. Founders have to provide more information about themselves, the business, and whether the firm they are reviewing invested in their startup, in order to provide context. Landscape is free for founders to use, but offers a paid subscription for VCs enabling them to unlock premium services allowing them a right of reply. Obviously, some might consider that a form of blackmail, but given they can reply to reviews, and see the reasons they might be losing marks, it might concentrate a few minds on how they can improve their offering to founders.</p>\n<p>The launch of the site possibly also reflects the fact that UK VC has reached the point where there is now more competition for deals.</p>\n<p>The idea itself is not new. Started in 2007, Glassdoor set out to do this for any company. It was <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/glassdoor-to-be-acquired-for-1-2b-by-japanese-hr-company/#ftag=CAD590a51e\">acquired</a> by the Japanese firm, Recruit Holdings, for US$1.2 billion in 2018. Better known as a platform for employees to air their grievances about larger corporates, you will of course sometimes see tech startups appear on the platform, in a positive or negative light.</p>\n<p>In the VC space, Adeo Ressi, founder of The Founder Institute, launched <a href=\"http://TheFunded.com\">TheFunded</a> in 2007. The website is designed to allow entrepreneurs to write anonymous reviews about venture capital groups and their processes. It was largely met with derision from VCs and Ressi intended to keep the site anonymous but was eventually outed. TheFunded never really took off (as the dated design and old updates attest), as the VC world is notoriously gossipy and it would not usually be that hard to figure out who was doing the dissing.</p>\n<p>This is the challenge faced by Landscape. TheFunded started in a very large VC sector, the US. By contrast, Landscape is launching into the UK initially, which is many times smaller.</p>\n<p>Perkins told TechCrunch it&#8217;s been many years since TheFunded launched and &#8220;the ecosystem has matured to a point where something like Landscape can exist&#8221;. He also said Landscape will go global very soon: &#8220;Success for Landscape is creating a platform that not only allows founders to complete due diligence on investors before taking their capital, but also provides investors with the insights they need to iterate and improve on their own product, something more and more VCs are becoming open to. While a specific VC may be able to infer who they think has left a review, Landscape will never explicitly reveal this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of the responses that the founders leave in their review are included on the platform, but some are left out to protect the founders&#8217; anonymity. Of the 600 founders that have left a review thus far, none have raised issues with this &#8211; with that being said, Landscape will always allow for a founder to remove or edit their review at a later date. A lot of reviews are being generated from founders within a portfolio, which may be more complementary to the fund. With more reviews from anyone who has been in discussion with the firm, we’ll be able to give founders more information for their due diligence,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>According to Landscape, the 10 Best Performing European VC Firms rated by its community (these are un-ranked listings), with over five reviews are:</p>\n<p>7percent Ventures<br />\nAda Ventures<br />\nAscension Ventures<br />\nBACKED VC<br />\nConnect Ventures<br />\nDynamo Ventures<br />\nEpisode 1 Ventures<br />\nKindred Capital<br />\nSeedcamp<br />\nTalis Capital <br />\n <br />\nAdditional insights based on almost 700 reviews so far include:</p>\n<p>• VCs score worst on “Diversity”, and “Beyond Money”.<br />\n• Accelerators score worst for Post Programme Support.<br />\n• Female founders typically feel less supported by their investors than male founders.<br />\n• Founders who didn’t successfully raise capital rate VC “Response Time” lower than those who did.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/tQBMjzlS6Xk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:01:41 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"07efa06ad99b5c8d05bb666db09cea6c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Mike Butcher","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-18-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/13/12-57-18-404_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn26@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-43-685_8f5e754c0be7f521.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tQBMjzlS6Xk:MLb6Lz-d-LM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn58@2020_6/2020/10/13/12-57-17-443_66b45097b9eca642.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/13/12-57-22-489_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/tQBMjzlS6Xk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn92@2020_3/2020/10/13/12-57-17-456_4ca855e1763b40ec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602593805079},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","title":"Kegg, a connected fertility tracker and kegel trainer for women, launches out of beta","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059121","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Fertility tracking has seen <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/its-a-new-era-for-fertility-tech/\">an explosion of startup activity</a> in recent years. Femtech startup Lady Technologies is adding to this rich mix with the full U.S. launch of a dual-purpose device, called <a href=\"https://kegg.tech\">kegg</a>, that&#8217;s designed to measure hormonal changes in a woman&#8217;s cervical fluid to help her determine the chance of conception on a given day.</p>\n<p>The egg-shaped gizmo, which features a gold-plated steel cap and band ringing its tip, as well as a silicone tail to house its Bluetooth radio (so it can chat to the companion app), doubles as a connected pelvic floor trainer (the &#8216;k&#8217; in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lady-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lady-technologies\">kegg <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is for &#8216;kegels&#8217;) &#8212; taking a leaf out of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/elvie-early-impressions/\">UK femtech pioneer Elvie&#8217;s playbook</a>. Though the two-in-one function is a new twist.</p>\n<p>Kegg relies on a technology called impedance to sense electrolyte levels in a woman&#8217;s cervical fluid in order to detect the hormonal switch from estrogen to progesterone dominance that accompanies ovulation &#8212; via a daily test that&#8217;s touted as taking just two minutes. (If you&#8217;re also using it for the optional kegal exercises that would take a bit longer.)</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;A minute electrical impulse at a specific frequency is emitted from the gold plated electrodes on the kegg and received by the other (this process is then reversed). By sensing the changing trends in the impedance, we’re able to detect the hormonal change and make a prediction to the user,&#8221; explains CEO and founder Kristina Cahojova. &#8220;Since every woman&#8217;s fluids are slightly different, kegg needs to record at least one fertile window to provide personalized predictions.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;We have numerous patents on the underlying design of kegg and key aspects of how it operates,&#8221; she adds.</p>\n<p>Kegg was unveiled on the TechCrunch Disrupt SF stage, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/kegg-kegel-ball-fertility/\">back in 2018</a>, as part of our startup battlefield competition (though it didn&#8217;t go on to win). Fast forward two years and it&#8217;s now officially launching out of beta to offer the FDA-registered gizmo to the U.S. market &#8212; priced at <a href=\"http://www.kegg.tech\">$275</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s announcing a $1.5M seed round too, with investors including Crescent Ridge Partners, SOSV, Texas Halo Fund, Fermata Fund and MegaForce, as well as some unnamed angel investors.</p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, Samina Hydery, kegg advisor and women’s health investor, said: &#8220;Investor interest in femtech and fertility has accelerated over the last few years. While I&#8217;ve seen an influx of ovulation prediction kits, at-home blood tests, menstrual tracking apps, and temperature monitors in the consumer market, kegg&#8217;s value proposition became clear once I spoke with women about their experiences trying to conceive and medical researchers in the field. It’s hard not to get excited by the various growth vectors that can expand kegg’s market in the future &#8212; from being used as a tool for natural family planning to helping monitor postpartum/perimenopausal health.”</p>\n<p>&#8220;We pride ourselves in having almost half of our investors women,&#8221; notes Cahojova &#8212; whose inspiration for building kegg was personal; having suffered from irregular menstrual cycles herself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;I didn’t want to be treated with hormones. When I talked to fertility instructors or a specialized fertility doctor, all they wanted to know about was my patterns of cervical fluid. Why? Because the fertile window is defined only by the presence of fertile cervical fluid, having a positive LH [luteinizing hormone] test is nice but it won’t help you get information to fix your cycles. That’s why so many fertility doctors are interested in cervical fluid and that is why so many women are told to track it with their fingers,&#8221; she explains.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;How on earth are you supposed to be able to track objectively something so important, yet, private without the help of technology? I was frustrated and angry that every company that I talked to didn’t have a solution and didn’t want to make this so needed product because it &#8216;would have to go into the vagina&#8217;. So I set out to make a product that would help me and women like me.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus far kegg has been hitting a chord with U.S. women of reproductive age who are trying for a baby, according to Cahojova &#8212; who says her startup has built a 2,000-strong community of fertility-tracking women over kegg&#8217;s beta period.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Our typical user is a woman in her reproductive age,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Our users are in long-term relationships or married and they likely have been actively trying to conceive for more than three months. Fifty percent are trying to conceive their first child, while the remaining are already mothers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our customers have experience with BBT (body basal temperature charting) or LH tests (ovulation tests) and they are overall interested in holistic fertility and wellness, not in medication. They also prefer the convenience of kegg over other methods that either need to be worn throughout the night or used more frequently.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059139\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059139\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2059139\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7L3A2565.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059139\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Lady Technologies</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;Each woman is unique and so are her cycles,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Unlike ovulation trackers, kegg helps women understand their fertile window and cyclical fertility and follow their own patterns. Usually women take up to six months to learn how to read cervical fluid patterns. Our customers report that kegg gives them confidence and they feel empowered. Many keggsters conceived with kegg after years of trying because kegg gave them trends beyond ovulation. Nothing makes me more happy than an email from a customer whose life changed thanks to my work and kegg.&#8221; (On that it says &#8220;several&#8221; women have reported successful pregnancies using kegg since the beta launch in 2018.)</p>\n<p>The startup also has its eye on international expansion, including to Asia (with the support of its Japanese-market focused investor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/hellofermata/?trk=similar-pages_result-card_full-click\">Fermata</a>) &#8212; with a plan to launch kegg in Singapore in late October, and in Japan and Canada next year.</p>\n<p>While the kegg has a core focus on fertility tracking (and a secondary feature as a connected pelvic floor trainer), Cahojova is excited about wider possibilities for women&#8217;s health that she hopes will be opened up as they&#8217;re able to take in and crunch more data.</p>\n<p>Kegg users&#8217; impedance readings are uploaded to the startup&#8217;s cloud for analysis, so its algorithms can make a personalized fertility prediction. But its website also notes it uses &#8216;anonymized/pseudonymized&#8217; data for research into women&#8217;s health. (Cahojova specifies users&#8217; personal data is never shared outside the company. &#8220;Any data we offer to researchers we work with is completed anonymized,&#8221; is her privacy promise.)</p>\n<p>Asked what areas of research she&#8217;s hoping kegg will help advance, she tells us: &#8220;Researchers have noted that health issues can affect typical electrolyte cycles. In many of our internal studies we’ve seen examples where readings were &#8216;out of norm&#8217; for the user. In case after case we found evidence of underlying health issues (for example infections) were the cause. In the future our goal is to understand how kegg can help monitor overall cervical health.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cahojova also says the device is being used by fertility instructors and doctors to help with monitoring their patients. &#8220;The beauty of kegg is that by having a user friendly and modern device that women like to use we can get data on changes of vaginal fluids on a large scale. With kegg data we also hope to help doctors finally answer their billion dollar question &#8212; how can they improve the quality of cervical fluid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are supportive of science and are open for research collaborations,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;We provided kegg for independent peer-reviewed clinical study under Dr.Gabriela López Armas, MD, PhD, for her research on kegg and other fertility trackers. All the participants finished the protocols in summer of 2020 and the study is to be published independently in the near future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the business model for kegg is currently fixed price hardware sales, Cahojova says the startup is looking at offering subscription packages in future. &#8220;In the future, we want to offer more to our users, e.g.: connecting them to specialists to review their cycles or view of additional layers of information. Once we have enhanced services ready, we’ll look at switching to a subscription model,&#8221; she adds.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pPKuasyOcb\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/its-a-new-era-for-fertility-tech/\">It&#8217;s a new era for fertility tech</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;It&#8217;s a new era for fertility tech&#8221;

which has clocked 1.3 billion “participating players” in the last 12 months &#8212; has picked up $215 million from SoftBank, specifically by way of a &#8220;private placement to a subsidiary of SoftBank Group Corp., through issuance of 43,000,000 new shares.&#8221;

and today the company is trading more than 15% up on the news. At market open today, it was valued at NOK22.2 billion, or about $2.4 billion &#8212; so by the end of the day that market cap is likely to have gone up as a result of today&#8217;s investment.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Kahoot! is experiencing strong momentum and accelerated adoption as enterprises increasingly seek engaging, trustworthy and user-friendly ways to build corporate culture, educate and interact,&#8221; the company noted in a statement. &#8220;|At the same time, schools and educators are looking to enhance the learning experience, whether virtually or in the classroom. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement to finance accelerated growth through value-creating non-organic opportunities and continue to build a unique platform company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We are reaching out to SoftBank for a direct comment on the news &#8212; which was announced by Kahoot in the briefest of terms necessary for disclosure as a publicly-traded company &#8212; and will update as we learn more.</p>\n<p>SoftBank has had a long track record with investing in both gaming and online education, backing the likes of Supercell (another European gaming hit startup, now majority owned by Tencent), and most recently Unacademy, an e-learning startup in India.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the company has been one of the more prolific investors in the startup world, both from SoftBank Group as well as via its Vision Fund and other related VC funds that it has set up.</p>\n<p>But not all of those investments have been great: the company has come under fire for sinking hundreds of millions into growth rounds for buzzy startups that hemorrhaged cash and failed to turn a profit &#8212; OYO, WeWork and Uber being prime examples &#8212; and in some cases appeared to be run in a way that didn&#8217;t indicate that they would turn things around anytime soon. The takeaway message for some was that SoftBank, once a gold standard in investing, felt hasty and poorly managed itself.</p>\n<p>But despite that it has continued to remain very active, and the head of the Vision Fund, Rajeev Misra, recently <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/troubled-tech-fund-softbank-wants-to-back-startups-in-these-3-areas-amid-covid-ceo-outlines-plan/2021637/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highlighted e-learning as one of the three areas</a> it&#8217;s focusing on for investments at the moment, in light of Covid-19.</p>\n<p>Kahoot, meanwhile, has been building a two-pronged business: first, a platform aimed at school children to build and use, and browse and use other&#8217;s online learning content; and second, a platform where corporates can build, use, and use other&#8217;s corporate training materials. The former puts an emphasis on free usage, while the latter is a paid product.</p>\n<p>In both cases, Kahoot&#8217;s content is built around the idea of gamification &#8212; learning designed as games &#8212; to make the process more fun and engaging. It has described itself as the &#8220;Netflix of Education&#8221; &#8212; but I think of it a little more like YouTube, because of the user-generated element of a lot of the material.</p>\n<p>Kahoot has been hugely successful in its model so far. It says that it has had 1.3 billion participating players, with 200 million games played and 100 million user-generated Kahoots, in the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>As a point of comparison, last month, when it announced an acquisition to boost its corporate learning business &#8212; it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/user-generated-e-learning-site-kahoot-acquires-actimo-for-up-to-33m-to-double-down-on-corporate-sector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bought an enterprise engagement platform called Actimo for about $33 million</a> &#8212; it said that it had counted some 1 billion “participating players,” on top of some 4.4 billion users since first launching the platform in 2013.</p>\n<p>SoftBank is not the company&#8217;s first high-profile investor. Other backers in the company include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/kahoot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/disney-kahoot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Disney</a>, as well as the well-known regional VCs Northzone and Creandum. The company tells me it has now raised a total of $325 million (based on current exchange rates).</p>\n<p>Online education has been on a slow incline for years, as schools and students turn to the internet to supplement and in some case replace teaching in physical classrooms, tapping into infrastructure that has further reach, in some cases (like higher education) costs less, and is popular with students.</p>\n<p>But, as with some other areas of tech, 2020 has seen that trend accelerate drastically as many schools have reduced teaching or shut down altogether in an effort to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus that leads to Covid-19.</p>\n<p>That has led to a huge boost of activity &#8212; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/edtech-startups-prepare-to-become-not-just-a-teaching-tool-but-a-necessity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sometimes quite urgent and not as a choice but a necessity</a> &#8212; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investor attention</a> in the last year for e-learning startups. Others announcing funding in the last couple of months have included Outschool (which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/outschool-newly-profitable-raises-a-45m-series-b-for-virtual-small-group-classes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raised $45 million</a> and is now profitable), Homer (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/homer-nabs-50m-from-lego-sesame-workshop-and-gymboree-for-its-early-learning-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raised $50 million</a> from an impressive group of strategic backers), Unacademy (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raised $150 million</a>), and the juggernaut that is Byju&#8217;s (most recently, picking up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/silver-lake-leads-500-million-round-in-indias-byjus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$500 million from Silver Lake</a>).</p>\n<p>Alongside e-learning, gaming companies have been one of the categories of tech that have had a windfall of sorts this year by providing content to divert and occupy people as some normal activities have been curtailed because of the global health pandemic.

But those companies don&#8217;t operate in a vacuum, and building their businesses involves an ecosystem of third-party suppliers. &#8220;With that comes a far-reaching ecosystem of potential benefits and potential threats that becomes the whole attack surface area &#8212; and that is not attended to by what people think about and by the tools we all have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting here is that the service analyzes a company&#8217;s security stance with regard to these attacks by looking at the connections it makes across the public infrastructure of the internet &#8212; and with that it can look at how a company connects to one vendor, but also how they are connected to others, as well.</p>\n<p>With that, Cyberpion is able to discover the inventory of known and unknown assets a company has across its ecosystem and can continuously scan for security vulnerabilities and, of course, provide alerts and recommendations for how to remedy these issues.</p>\n<p>“Attacks on external digital assets of enterprises are becoming a prominent vector for sophisticated <span class=\"il\">cyber</span> criminals,&#8221; said Hyperwise Ventures’ managing partner, Nathan Shuchami. &#8220;In the face of hackers finding vulnerabilities in new and wider attack surfaces, <span class=\"il\">Cyberpion</span> offers unparalleled detection and protection capabilities, providing comprehensive security across the organization’s entire online ecosystem.

Earlier this year, for example, it announced plans to spend about <a href=\"http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51323#:~:text=The%20Korean%20government%20is%20planning,2026%20to%20commercialize%20AI%20semiconductors.\">1 trillion won ($870 million)</a> on AI chips commercialization and production before 2029. Last year, President Moon Jae-in <a href=\"https://www.msit.go.kr/cms/english/pl/policies2/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2020/03/23/National%20Strategy%20for%20Artificial%20Intelligence_200323.pdf\">announced</a> his &#8220;Presidential Initiative for AI&#8221; to raise public awareness on the industry.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>These efforts come amid growing demand for AI-related chips, which, by <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-hardware-new-opportunities-for-semiconductor-companies#\">McKinsey estimates</a>, could account for almost 20% of all semiconductor demand and generate about $67 billion in revenue by 2025.</p>\n<p>South Korea is already home to two of the world&#8217;s largest memory chip makers &#8212; Samsung and SK hynix. While that&#8217;s a lucrative industry, it&#8217;s one relying more on &#8220;the manufacturing process rather than core technologies,&#8221; observed Seewan Toong, an independent IT industry expert.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about making the chip smaller, denser, more efficient, and putting more memory on one chip,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>The country wants to make its semiconductors smarter and vow to own 20% of the global AI chip market by 2030, according to Yonhap.</p>\n<p>Samsung dabbled in next-gen chips as it became the <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/baidu-and-samsung-electronics-ready-for-production-of-leading-edge-ai-chip-for-early-next-year\">mass-production partner for Baidu&#8217;s AI chips</a> late last year. In July, the conglomerate <a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200701000842\">announced</a> hiring 1,000 new staff to work on chips and AI. SK hynix has picked its own Chinese ally by backing Horizon Robotics, an AI chip designer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/horizon-robotics-raises-600m/\">last valued at $3 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>China, which has long focused on the application of AI rather than fundamental research, has similarly shelled out state funds for home-grown semiconductor companies as the country suffers from U.S. sanctions on core technologies. The question is how many startups, under state support, will survive to compete with global behemoths like Nvidia and Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a really smart move by South Korea,” said Albert Liu, chief executive of Kneron, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/kneron-launches-its-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-google-and-others/\">well-financed edge AI startup</a> backed by Alibaba, Li Ka-shing’s Horizons Ventures and Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>“Emerging players have a huge opportunity because the market itself is a huge opportunity, as everything from a Tesla to a toaster will need an edge AI chip over the next few years. 5G, AI and IoT is coming of age, and enabling the technology ecosystem that will improve our lives in a secure and private manner.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The story is updated on October 13 with expert comment.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vPlXdXipepE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 08:07:36 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"c59dfae4f37f14c6e0bdddb5f75ea0e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Rita Liao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-18-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/13/12-57-18-404_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn62@2020_4/2020/10/13/12-57-17-437_9a170c361205d10d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vPlXdXipepE:kvoLZKXpa4c:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-17-493_bee319280d6f1e91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/13/12-57-22-489_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vPlXdXipepE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn11@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-17-441_bc9da6aa396b0ad4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602593805080},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","title":"Commercializing the open source FingerprintJS browser fingerprinting tech nabs Chicago entrepreneur $4M","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059610","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Chicago-based serial entrepreneur Dan Pinto has raised new cash and launched a new company looking to commercialize a years-old open source project that purports to solve one of the web&#8217;s hardest problems &#8212; fraud prevention.</p>\n<p>The company he launched in January, FingerprintJS, touts itself as a new kind of toolkit offering browser fingerprinting as a service for any application.</p>\n<p>The company, based on an open source project that already has 5 million downloads and 8,000 websites using the service (and hundreds of paying customers, according to the company), is a variation on the browser fingerprinting technology that companies have been using for years.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>FingerprintJS uses the same canvas fingerprinting, audio sampling, WebGL fingerprinting, font detection and browser plugin probing tech that&#8217;s available on the market, but de-identifies the fingerprint from a specific device by generating a unique identifier of a browser without using cookies. Companies can store the identifier in their database and then track its behavior, the company said on its website.</p>\n<p>The open source project was actually started five years ago by Valentin Vasilyev,<a href=\"https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/commit/dbcff5eeb447fc21c3c60764e4ba27f6eef068e0\"> according to the project&#8217;s Github page</a>. Vasilyev and Pinto worked together at Pinto&#8217;s last startup, Machinio, which was sold back in 2018. The two men launched a business around Vailyev&#8217;s project in January and have raised $4 million in financing to support the commercialization of the project.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The open source community was pivotal to our success thus far,&#8221; said Vasilyev, in a statement. &#8220;We will continue to build upon that base and focus on selling to developers first. Software engineers understand technology and are starting to recognize how effective our product is to help stop fraud.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Funding came from Nexus Venture Partners, with participation from Hack VC, the Entrepreneur Roundtable Accelerator&#8217;s Remarkable Ventures fund and angel investors like Rony Kahan, the chair and co-founder of Indeed, according to a statement from FingerprintJS.</p>\n<div class=\"row mt-3 vertical-content\">\n<div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n<div class=\"features_one mt-3\">\n<div class=\"features_detail mt-4\">\n<p class=\"mt-3 features_desc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“FingerprintJS APIs make it possible for developers to quickly embed fraud detection and prevention capabilities into their code,” said Abhishek Sharma, principal at Nexus Venture Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with the FingerprintJS team because of their product-led bottom-up technology development and distribution in a category that has historically been reliant on top-down enterprise sales.”</span></p>\n<p>One potential roadblock to FingerprintJS&#8217; growth comes from recent the General Data Protection Regulations enacted by the European Union and better known by their acronym, GDPR. Those regulations restrict the use of several browser fingerprinting and tracking technologies. Some browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, have even set up their own controls to limit the amount of data a website can use to track visitors online.</p>\n<p>Pinto is undeterred.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a unique opportunity to disrupt the fraud technology market by enabling our customers to build fraud prevention in their applications rather than it being an afterthought just as Stripe has done with payment processing,” he said in a statement provided by the company. “Think of online fraud as a shell game where malicious users are constantly trying to hide themselves in order to commit fraud. Existing solutions try to generate a fraud score for each visitor without trying to understand who they are. We focus on uniquely identifying malicious users which directly solves the underlying fraud problem.” </span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/d6yWcGxaAVc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 11:30:09 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"442dc8d197c2c83dc6125eaee73c4485","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-18-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/13/12-57-18-404_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/13/12-57-17-469_89a220499bacc56e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=d6yWcGxaAVc:xchJtzp2Boc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-17-629_3271579e5a96d89b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/13/12-57-22-489_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/d6yWcGxaAVc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_3/2020/10/13/12-57-17-629_0e5b4798806e8a4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602593805080},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","title":"Qatalog, the ‘virtual workspace’ rebundling SaaS tools to help teams function better, raises $15M","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059215","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.qatalog.com/\">Qatalog</a>, a London-based startup that has developed a &#8220;virtual workspace&#8221; that brings together disparate SaaS tools to help teams function better, is disclosing $15 million in Series A funding.</p>\n<p>Leading the round is European venture capital firm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/atomico-v/\">Atomico</a>, with participation from Salesforce Ventures, and angel investors Jacob de Geer (CEO/co-founder of iZettle), Chris Hitchen (partner at Inventures, founder Getprice), and Thijn Lamers (former EVP at Adyen).

By building what Rauf calls the “work graph,” Qatalog wants to unify workplace information to make it much more accessible and transparent, and with the ability to automate routine work and enable SaaS tools to talk to one another. In doing so, the idea is that teams can work smarter and collaborate better throughout the organisation.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059383\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059383\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"965\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2059383\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png 1225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png?resize=300,283 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png?resize=768,723 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png?resize=680,641 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qatalog</p></div></p>\n<p>“Organizations have an endless supply of tools, methods, and data to make people more productive and happy at work,” he tells me. “But these tools create a lot of chaos, wasted time, and frustration. These pain points are exacerbated by silos of tools and processes, and an increase in remote work”.</p>\n<p>To solve this, Rauf says Qatalog has built a “source of truth” for the teams, projects and people within a company and all the “ancillary information” about them. This includes connecting various tools, locations and systems, and providing additional “capabilities and features that make accessing, retrieving, sharing and coordinating work very seamless”.</p>\n<p>In some ways, Qatalog is perhaps akin to a modern workplace intranet, if one were to take a SaaS-first and ‘small pieces, loosely joined’ approach. Or perhaps another way to think about Qatalog is that SaaS tools are especially good at solving one problem or a subset of related problems, but don’t scale particularly well when operating in a vacuum or if they (or users) try to bolt on additional functionality outside of their core offering. What’s needed is a way to re-bundle this disparate functionality and the information and workflows it spawns, therefore negating the need for companies to hack together spreadsheets or “super Google docs” to try to consolidate processes and a company’s knowledge-base.</p>\n<p>“We connect to [a company’s] various tools, pull as much information about them as possible together, and ask for additional information as needed,” Rauf explains. “Users can then search across their workspace and tools from one place; create teams and projects and wire up all the different silos into them; set trackable goals and connect them to various tools, people, teams and projects; and build workflows that can be assigned and tracked across the team”.</p>\n<p>The “workflows” can be something as mundane as the steps required and people involved when booking leave, or something more involved such as a complex work task. The clever part is not just the way a workflow is created and presented, but how workflows are powered under the hood by Qatalog’s “work graph”. This reduces form filling when linking people, teams and SaaS tools to different steps in a workflow and also means that information is two-way. Complete a task within Qatalog and information can be automatically pushed to Slack, Google Calendar etc., and vice versa. It is also not hard to see how a work graph of this kind could enable more automation and/or work macros to be employed in future.</p>\n<p>With regards to Qatalog’s typical customer, Rauf says that so far the startup has found that companies with 50 plus people and distributed teams have been good candidates as that&#8217;s when internal systems and ad-hoc knowledge management processes start to fail. “At that point, most companies have also likely picked up 10+ tools and are finding information requires manual switchboarding by people,” he tells me.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RuNgEAqMUx\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/onna/\">Onna, the &#8216;knowledge integration platform&#8217; for workplace apps, raises $27M Series B</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Onna, the &#8216;knowledge integration platform&#8217; for workplace apps, raises $27M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/onna/embed/#?secret=RuNgEAqMUx\" data-secret=\"RuNgEAqMUx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/KRtM3mJ3m6s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 08:00:51 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png","linkMd5":"90a58827ae5dbbaf6890b08b7254aa76","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-06-446_f7a64079828284b4.webp","destWidth":1225,"destHeight":1154,"sourceBytes":687809,"destBytes":312008,"author":"Steve O'Hear","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProductSummary-directory.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-06-446_f7a64079828284b4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/13/12-57-07-954_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-18-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/13/12-57-18-404_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn27@2020_5/2020/10/13/12-57-17-743_096f43c3c8f4a180.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KRtM3mJ3m6s:x8GIzc3Y_Bo:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/13/12-57-17-628_4556d1dc64d165e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/13/12-57-22-489_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/KRtM3mJ3m6s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn32@2020_2/2020/10/13/12-57-22-675_172a2ba5d22497c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602593805074},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 20:56:45","title":"Watch Apple unveil the new iPhone live right here","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059413","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is set to announce new iPhone models today.
