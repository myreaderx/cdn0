It’s worth the little extra work. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>The sale doesn’t end at checkout</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-purchase email campaigns are the sequence of messages you send after a customer has submitted an order. They span from: immediately after checkout, through delivery, and initial thoughts on the product. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few reasons why post-purchase emails deserve your time and attention. </span></p>\n<p><b>They keep customers informed. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because making orders online or signing up for a new subscription service is commonplace, doesn’t mean trust isn’t involved.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Each time a customer makes an order with your company, they trust that you’ll deliver.</p>\n<p>If you go silent after a purchase, customers may feel like you’ve taken their money and run.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also plenty of vital information you need to share after a purchase. Customers want to know their shipping status, and what to expect from the returns process. Plus, post-purchase thank you emails are a great opportunity to further the customer relationship.</span></p>\n<p>Tell customers what the best next step is, such as downloading your app or signing up for text alerts. In the example below, <a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/reservation-confirmed-for-san-francisco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airbnb</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tells travelers to check house rules and find activities for their trip.  </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-10.jpg\" alt=\"Airbnb post-purchase email\" width=\"700\" height=\"2093\" /></p>\n<p><b>They make waiting easier. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumers in the age of Amazon are spoiled, and we all want fast shipping. In fact, almost</span><a href=\"https://www.getconvey.com/blog/fast-free-shipping-amazon-delivery-expectations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> half of all consumers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> expect businesses to keep up with Amazon.</span></p>\n<p>However, super-speedy delivery just isn’t possible in all businesses. So in the meantime, you can send updates and build anticipation to make the waiting a little easier.</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-26.png\" alt=\"Post-purchase email stats\" width=\"700\" height=\"430\" /></p>\n<p><b>They encourage the next sale. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just over </span><a href=\"https://alicepos.com/15-customer-experience-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">half of consumers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have made an additional purchase from a company after a positive customer service experience. That means if you play your cards right in the post-purchase timeframe, you could be setting yourself up for another sale. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>The post-purchase email sequence you need</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Order confirmation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order confirmation messages are the first, and likely most common, post-purchase email. This </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/triggered-retention-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transactional email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goes out as soon as checkout is complete, and should include details about the order such as: order number, items purchased, cost, and how to contact the support team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the order confirmation email is mainly about building trust and letting customers know their order went through, you may also </span><a href=\"http://getvero.com/resources/cross-sell-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cross-sell</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or introduce </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/referral-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referral opportunities</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/your-etsy-purchase-from-theheartdepartmentco-6500600/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etsy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses its order confirmation email to highlight the shop and additional items.

If you want to use your post-purchase emails to present a cross-sell item, make sure it’s customized based on the order.</span></p>\n<p>If you recommend a product that’s for a completely different <a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/audience-segmentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">audience segment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or one that’s identical to what they’ve just ordered, it’ll look like you’re just suggesting products at random as a money grab. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Shipping confirmation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most shoppers (</span><a href=\"https://www.visiblescm.com/2020/07/24/dont-ignore-these-12-statistics-on-ecommerce-shipping-theyre-priceless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">83% to be exact</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) expect regular communication about their orders, which is where shipping confirmation emails come in. These messages keep customers up to date on the movement of their order and begin the countdown to delivery.</span></p>\n<p>Be sure to include tracking information if it&#8217;s available, or at least an estimated delivery date.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/today-is-the-day-fitbit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fitbit </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uses humor to relate to the customer, letting them know they don’t need to “camp out at the mailbox,” since they can use the tracking code to get updates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-11.jpg\" alt=\"FitBit post-purchase email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"1043\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping confirmation emails are also opportunities to build anticipation for the order through content. </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/a-shipment-from-order-us650050-is-on-the-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polaroid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, links to their FAQ page so that customers can get up to speed on how to use the product before it arrives. </span></p>\n<p><b>Automate it</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re sending educational content, make sure it’s related to the product purchased. By sending targeted information, you can help customers make the most of their new product or subscription.</span></p>\n<p>Plus, <a href=\"https://instapage.com/blog/personalization-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">78% of consumers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have a higher purchase intent when a brand sends them personally relevant content. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Relationship building</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are plenty of technical details to track in post-purchase emails such as shipping notifications, there’s also time for relationship building.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>After a customer has made a purchase, you can send out emails to invite them into the community, and share helpful and educational content.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Makeup brand </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/you-did-good\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ILIA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> takes the time to celebrate customer choices with the subject line “You Did Good.” The message isn’t promotional, and instead focuses on the customer’s perspective and accomplishments. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5-7.jpg\" alt=\"ILIA post-purchase email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"1232\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company goes on to </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/how-to-use-your-new-multi-stick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educate customers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on how to use their recent purchase. The subject line “How to Use Your New Multi-Stick” is clear and compelling, especially since it’s personalized to the item the customer actually bought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1045\" /></span></p>\n<p><b>Automate it</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use dynamic content in your shipping confirmation emails to excite, educate, and inspire customers. For example, a cookware brand could share recipes that use the items purchased, or clothing retailers could send outfit inspirations from similar styles. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Review request email</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers are willing to spend </span><a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31% more</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a business with excellent reviews, so you should aim to gather as many as possible. After a customer has had time to use your product thoroughly, you can send a review request email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a handy guide for when you should ask for a review:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Standard ecommerce</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; wait two weeks after delivery to ask for a product review. Setting up a two-week delay in your </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/workflows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email workflow</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes this process automatic. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Rental ecommerce</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; wait until the rental item has made it back to the warehouse and completed its QA check. A successful item return can be set up as an </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/event-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">event to trigger</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your email. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Subscriptions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; wait until a customer has received two subscription boxes, or the equivalent of two months since subscribing. Workflow rules prevent you from accidentally sending time-delayed review emails to customers who have churned.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your post purchase follow up email can either have a simple 1-5 scale rating system, or include links to review sites such as your Facebook, Google, or Amazon page. Remember, the fewer clicks the better, so make leaving a review as straightforward as possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a battle of the bedtime companies, Casper and Tuft &#38; Needle send slightly different review request emails. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/how-did-you-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Casper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes the exact item purchased, just in case the customer has forgotten. They request a written review and let the customer know how helpful it would be to the company. The mattress company also uses the review request email to introduce a referral program. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-7-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"922\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuft &#38; Needle, on the other hand, uses an NPS survey to gather feedback. A simple 1-10 scale within the email is simple for customers to interact with, and then they can follow up with promoters for more detailed reviews. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-7-18.png\" alt=\"Tuft and Needle NPS test\" width=\"700\" height=\"287\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you select a high NPS score, the company directs you to a page that asks what you like best about it. A low NPS score redirects to a comment box asking what was disappointing about the experience. </span></p>\n<p><b>Automate it</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a message as simple as a review request email comes with automation and personalization opportunities. You can dynamically bring in the exact item that a customer ordered, or use a triggered event to send follow up messages to high and low NPS score users. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Discount to reorder</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One customer order is good, but </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/retention-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retaining a customer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and having repeat purchases is even better.

Rather than offering a discount on another one-time purchase, you can use this email to introduce your subscription.</span></p>\n<p><b>Automate it</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>Like other post-purchase emails, a discount-to-reorder message can have personalized content based on user persona and purchase history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Timing also comes into play with these messages, since you can create workflows to send discount emails at the cadence that customers are most likely to repurchase.</p>\n<h2><strong>Post-purchase email best practices</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Use dynamic content to send out relevant post-purchase emails</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic content in email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a little bit like mixing and matching to get the perfect solution.
