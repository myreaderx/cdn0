In this case, you can add corresponding quick filters and update selections directly from dashboard widgets.</p>\n<p>Another example is an ability to quickly switch displayed time periods (program increments, iterations, ...) on dashboards used for \"progress overview and tracking\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/02/QuickFiltersInWidgets.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-133194\" src=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/02/QuickFiltersInWidgets.gif\" alt=\"QuickFiltersInWidgets\" width=\"800\" height=\"417\" data-zoom=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/02/QuickFiltersInWidgets.gif\" data-zoom-size=\"[800,417]\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Description field in Quick Add form</h2>\n<p>Now you can add entities and fill in detailed Descriptions right away. The Administrator of a system can customize the Quick Add form and add a Description field where necessary and mark it as required, so that people don't forget to add descriptions.<br clear='none'/>\nDescription will be in a form of multi-line text field. Users will be able to create items with descriptions both in plain text and text containing markdown or HTML formatting:<br clear='none'/>\n<a href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/02/DescriptionSyntax.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-133184\" src=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/02/DescriptionSyntax.gif\" alt=\"DescriptionSyntax\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" data-zoom=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/02/DescriptionSyntax.gif\" data-zoom-size=\"[800,433]\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Default values selection for Project and Team context filters</h2>\n<p>View owners can now set default values for the Team and Project context filters.

This functionality was extremely unstable and buggy so we decided to re-work it completely.</li>\n<li>Old \"Solutions Gallery\" has been phased out. We no longer support \"Solutions Gallery\" as a tool for creation of new views and reports.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tabular reports now load successfully every time they're opened.</li>\n<li>In the Detailed view layout, in inner Lists, it is now possible to customize the columns of Extendable Domain entities which are used as the upper level of the List.</li>\n<li>Users with \"Edit\" Direct Access to Release and Team Iteration can now edit these entities.</li>\n<li>Milestone flag now displays the correct date.</li>\n<li>Names of custom fields are no longer replaced with custom Terms in Visual reports.</li>\n<li>Externally shared Visual reports with multiple views no longer become suddenly inaccessible .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/blog/update-quick-filters-in-list-widgets-on-dashboards-default-values-selection-for-project-and-team-context-filters/\">Update: Quick filters in List widgets on Dashboards &#8211;
