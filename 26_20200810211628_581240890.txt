However, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/jeff-clavier\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jeff-clavier\">Jeff Clavier <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> was an exception to that rule.</p>\n<p>As the founder of Uncork Capital (formerly known as SoftTech VC), he has been in the business of angel and seed investing for 16 years, popularizing the opportunity and highlighting the need for more support at this stage — well before it was cool. You could say he was early to early stage.</p>\n<p>Clavier said that at the end of 2019, it was estimated that there were more than 1,000 firms focusing on seed investing in the market, but by the end of this year, there will be about 2,000. “Don&#8217;t ask me whether it makes any sense because when I started 16 years ago, I didn&#8217;t think would be a big deal,” he said. “But certainly that creates a bit of a conundrum for founders to try and understand.”</p>\n<p>As of now, Clavier has made nearly 230 investments and counting.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch Early Stage, our virtual conference highlighting that stage of startup life, was the perfect venue to hear from him on all things seed investing and building startups today. Below are some highlights, a link to the video and a pitch deck he put together for the chat. Questions were edited for space and clarity.</p>\n<h2>Not all VCs are created equal (so know who you are pitching)</h2>\n<p>First thing to understand is that not all VCs are created equal. There are a bunch of different firms, tons of them out there, and you as a founder need to understand what are the specifics of your pitch opportunity, how to match with the right firm, and to figure out what stage of “early” you happen to be.</p>\n<p>Startups can be super early, or mid-stage, which is typically what we refer to as pre-seed. Then there&#8217;s the seed stage, where you have developed a product, with a demo. And there is post-seed, where you have product but are not quite ready to raise a Series A. So who are the firms that can actually be the right fit for me at those different stages? The qualification part of the targeting is really important. Especially in a COVID environment when you can’t spend the same kind of time with each other.</p>\n<p>It’s useful for founders to try and understand investors better, maybe asking a couple of questions like, &#8220;When is the last time you made a brand new investment at seed stage?&#8221; And &#8220;How has your investment process changed as a result of COVID?&#8221;</p>\n<p>For investors, you want to understand how you&#8217;re going to evolve your process to cope with the fact that you don&#8217;t spend time with those founders face-to-face. Some firms are still struggling with that.</p>\n<p>At Uncork, we’re now past the point of portfolio triage that we had in the first few weeks of of the pandemic. What was surprising to me was the speed and velocity at which some deals actually.</p>\n<h2>Find an investment lead<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/X5Xnn1x-EbE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:59:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-200408619-001.jpg?w=510","linkMd5":"8b59bcec077ca5793fab5b263d5b7b49","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn67@2020_6/2020-08-10/1597094005244_633f5357eee1927d.webp","author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn51@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094002885_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005221_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005212_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn91@2020_6/2020-08-10/1597094005188_cfdf71a5f2c506dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X5Xnn1x-EbE:Q7G4dVg3Y3s:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005189_a3d18c53e89a5b41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005089_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/X5Xnn1x-EbE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_2/2020-08-10/1597094005212_acf37aa7e7cddcf2.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:19","title":"SpaceX takes a big hop forward in Starship development","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2029418","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><em>Max Q is a weekly newsletter all about space. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/newsletters\">Sign up here to receive it weekly on Sundays in your inbox</a>.</em></p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the busiest week in space tech news – much like a lot of the industry, it feels like we&#8217;re entering into a bit of a summer doldrums period where things slow down considerably.

One of the major blocks to actually rolling out these technologies though is simply spectrum: there just isn’t enough of it available for private use. 5G needs spectrum at very low frequencies to penetrate buildings and increase range, and it also needs high frequencies to support the huge bandwidth that future applications will require.</p>\n<p>The crux though is in the midband — frequencies that can support a mix of range, latency and bandwidth that could become a mainstay of 5G technologies, particularly as a bridge for legacy infrastructure and devices.</p>\n<p>Today, the midband of U.S. spectrum is heavily utilized by government services like the military, which uses the spectrum for everything from conflict operations to satellite connectivity. That has prevented commercial operators from accessing that spectrum and moving forward with wider 5G deployments.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That’s why it is notable today that the White House announced that the 3450Mhz to 3550 Mhz spectrum will officially be handed off to the FCC for an auction that will allow private operators to access midband spectrum. Given the legal process involved, that auction is expected to take place in December 2021, with private operation of services likely beginning in 2022. Usage of the band is expected to follow the spectrum sharing <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/aws-3-transition__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!QyomB89_2rgW8DOUWoa2lolypMC2XvYSBA5o4RVQS3C0cDnR640uCoP-im41hAg$ \">rules of AWS-3</a>, according to a senior Trump administration official.</p>\n<p>According to the White House, a committee of 180 experts was assembled from all the armed services and the Defense Secretary’s office to look at where a segment of the DoD’s spectrum could be freed up and moved to private usage to back 5G.</p>\n<p>Such efforts are in line with the MOBILE NOW Act of 2017, which Congress passed in order to spur government agencies to speed up the process of allocating spectrum for 5G uses. That act encouraged NTIA, an agency which advises on telecom issues for the U.S. government, to identify the 3450Mhz to 3550Mhz band <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2018/ntia-identifies-3450-3550-mhz-study-potential-band-wireless-broadband-use__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!QyomB89_2rgW8DOUWoa2lolypMC2XvYSBA5o4RVQS3C0cDnR640uCoP-5kI9l6Q$ \">as a major area of study back in 2018</a>, and earlier this year in January the agency found “<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2020/ntia-report-finds-viable-options-spectrum-sharing-3450-3550-mhz-band__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!QyomB89_2rgW8DOUWoa2lolypMC2XvYSBA5o4RVQS3C0cDnR640uCoP-MrgtDq4$ \">viable options</a>” for converting the band to private use.</p>\n<p>It’s the latest positive step in the long transition of wireless to 5G services, which demands changes in technology (such as the wireless chips in cell phones), spectrum allocation, policy development, and infrastructure buildout in order to come to fruition.</p>\n<p>Ted S. Rappaport, a professor of electrical engineering and the founding director of <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!QyomB89_2rgW8DOUWoa2lolypMC2XvYSBA5o4RVQS3C0cDnR640uCoP-LXxn8Kw$ \">NYU WIRELESS</a>, an academic research center focused on advanced wireless technologies, said that “It’s great news for America … and a terrific move for U.S. consumers and for the U.S. wireless industry.”</p>\n<p>He noted that the particular frequency was valuable given existing knowledge and research in the industry. “It’s not that far from existing 4G spectrum where engineers and technicians already have good understanding of the propagation. And it’s also at a spectrum where the electronics are very low cost and very easy to make.”</p>\n<p>There has been growing pressure on U.S. government leaders in recent years over the plodding 5G transition, <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-5g-race-china-and-u-s-battle-to-control-worlds-fastest-wireless-internet-1536516373__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!QyomB89_2rgW8DOUWoa2lolypMC2XvYSBA5o4RVQS3C0cDnR640uCoP-DXUtkjk$ \">which has fallen behind peer countries like China</a> and South Korea.

While the announcements today is notable, there will also be concerns whether 100Mhz of spectrum is sufficient to support the widest variety of 5G devices, and thus, this allocation may well be just the first in a series.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, additional midband spectrum for 5G will help move the transition forward, and will also help device and chip manufacturers begin to focus their efforts on the specific bands they need to support in their products. While it may be a couple of more years until 5G devices are widely available (and useful) in the United States, spectrum has been a key gating factor to reaching the next-generation of wireless, and a gate that is finally opening up.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MfE2gxj3He\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/nebraska-and-iowa-win-advanced-wireless-testbed-grants-for-rural-broadband/\">Nebraska and Iowa win advanced wireless testbed grants for rural broadband</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Nebraska and Iowa win advanced wireless testbed grants for rural broadband&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/nebraska-and-iowa-win-advanced-wireless-testbed-grants-for-rural-broadband/embed/#?secret=MfE2gxj3He\" data-secret=\"MfE2gxj3He\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yQJ7CeeP0lQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:30:45 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1127588481.jpeg?w=600","linkMd5":"9378034ca3da62180eb1ae356a02f3a4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn59@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094007296_bc796d061127893b.webp","author":"Danny Crichton","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn51@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094002885_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005221_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005212_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597094005221_af50ceae3d8cb141.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yQJ7CeeP0lQ:hFL8_R0K2tM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn51@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597094005543_fe88d6471487cc89.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005089_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yQJ7CeeP0lQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597094007192_3a04983418505261.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:19","title":"SpaceX reveals plans for a Texas spaceport resort in new job ad","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2029467","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"space-exploration-technologies\">SpaceX <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has big plans for its Boca Chica, Texas site – where it&#8217;s currently building and testing Starship, the company&#8217;s next-generation passenger and cargo spacecraft.

But most of them were not.&#8221; In the same way, he argued, &#8220;This is not a testament about public domain content overall, it’s not to say that there aren’t legit channels and apps out there that people are consuming and enjoying&#8221; — it&#8217;s just that many of the public domain apps being submitted are used for ad fraud.</p>\n<p>To avoid paying for fake impressions, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/doubleverify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"doubleverify\">DoubleVerify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> recommends that advertisers advocate for transparency standards, buy from platforms that support third-party verification and, of course, buy through ad platforms certified by DoubleVerify.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FiydMGJSwd\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/doubleverify-mark-zagorski/\">DoubleVerify names adtech exec Mark Zagorski as new CEO</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;DoubleVerify names adtech exec Mark Zagorski as new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/doubleverify-mark-zagorski/embed/#?secret=FiydMGJSwd\" data-secret=\"FiydMGJSwd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7OLNSPGk0Lg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:13:38 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"20d08e10e0b807dfba52cb2e831d492e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn51@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094002885_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Anthony Ha","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn51@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094002885_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005221_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005212_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn87@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005181_ab7c06ed0c957f60.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7OLNSPGk0Lg:gadt7ub3GLI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn71@2020_2/2020-08-10/1597094005231_5847fb88a43d1804.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005089_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7OLNSPGk0Lg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn55@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005073_3af4d294eca7fbed.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:19","title":"Hyundai to bring three new EVs to market under spin-off brand Ioniq","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2029368","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Hyundai has launched a dedicated EV brand called Ioniq with plans to bring three all-electric vehicles to market over the next four years. The Ioniq brand is part of the Korean automaker&#8217;s broader strategy to sell 1 million battery electric vehicles — and take a 10% share of the EV market — by 2025.</p>\n<p>If the Ioniq name sounds familiar, it&#8217;s because it already exists. In 2016, Hyundai introduced the Ioniq, a hatchback that came in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric versions. The Korean automaker is using that vehicle as the jumping off point for its new EV brand.</p>\n<p>All of the vehicles under the Ioniq brand will have Hyundai&#8217;s underlying electric modular platform, called E-GMP.</p>\n<p>Hyundai said the new EV brand will begin with the Ioniq 5, a mid-size crossover that will launch in early 2021. The Ioniq 5 will be based on Hyundai&#8217;s Concept 45, a monocoque-style body crossover that the company unveiled in 2019 at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt. Designers of the Concept 45 leaned on some of the lines and characteristics from Hyundai&#8217;s first concept, the 1974 Pony Coupe. The &#8220;45&#8221; name comes, in part, from the 45-degree angles at the front and rear of the vehicle.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2029400\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2029400\" class=\"wp-image-2029400 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg\" alt=\"hyundai-concept 45\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hyundai-concept-45.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2029400\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>\n<p>The Ioniq 6 sedan will follow in 2022, and will be based on Hyundai&#8217;s Prophecy concept that was unveiled in March.

This order is set to go into effect in ten days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Court is under no illusion that implementation of its injunction will be costly,&#8221; Judge Schulman wrote in the order. &#8220;There can be no question that in order for Defendants to comply with A.B. 5, they will have to change the nature of their business practices in significant ways, such as by hiring human resources staff to hire and manage their driver workforces.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The decision comes after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/uber-lyft-preliminary-injunction-hearing/\">Judge Schulman heard arguments in court last week</a>. The hearing was the result of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">filing a preliminary injunction in an attempt to force Uber and Lyft to comply with AB 5 and immediately stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors.</a></p>\n<p>In the order, Judge Schulman says the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the argument that Uber and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lyft\">Lyft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> are violating AB 5. AB 5 codifies the 2018 ruling established in <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S222732.PDF\">Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles</a>. In that case, the court applied the ABC test (more on that a bit later) and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors based on the presumption that “a worker who performs services for a hirer is an employee for purposes of claims for wages and benefits…”</p>\n<p>The motion for a preliminary junction was filed as part of the suit filed in May, which<a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/2020-05-05%20-%20Filed%20Complaint.pdf\"> asserted</a> Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors. The suit argues <a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber</a> and Lyft are depriving workers of the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for

publisher.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you click or tap on a link to a paywalled story published by a News+ partner — including stories from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/\">our own Extra Crunch membership program</a> — iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and macOS Big Sur will take you straight to the article page in the News+ app, even when the link ostensibly points to the publisher&#8217;s own

class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The experience should be familiar to (for example) New York Times app readers who, when they click on a web link, are taken straight to the article page in the NY Times app. (In TechCrunch&#8217;s case, I noticed that Apple even prompts users to open the News app when they click on stories that aren&#8217;t paywalled.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed

src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>This addresses one of the more frustrating elements of being a News+ subscriber: Although your $9.99 monthly subscription gets you access to paywalled stories from publishers like The New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal, you only get access via the News app — not the publishers&#8217; websites. So I&#8217;ve often seen something I want to read on Google or Twitter, but instead of clicking the link, I have to open the News app and track down the story.</p>\n<p>So this seems like it should significantly improve the reader experience, even if it might be a little disconcerting at first. And it only applies to News+ subscribers, who are opted-in but will have the option to turn off the &#8220;Open Web Links in News&#8221; feature in their News settings.</p>\n<p>But as Haile noted, publishers may be less excited about the change: &#8220;Any strategic rationale that Apple News+ represents a separate channel/audience is now gone. This directly cannibalizes a publishers’ core subscription audience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Apple has not released News+ subscriber numbers, there have been several reports — including <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/apple-news-has-struggled-to-add-subscribers-since-march-launch.html\">a November 2019 story from CNBC</a> — suggesting that the service has struggled to attract new subscribers after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/business/media/media-companies-take-a-big-gamble-on-apple.html\">signing on 200,000 users</a> in the first 48 hours after launch. And<a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/nine-months-apple-news-isnt-wowing-publishers/\"> Digiday reported</a> that publishers have been underwhelmed with revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> An Apple spokesperson just provided the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Apple is committed to creating the best experience for Apple News+ subscribers. This change offers subscribers seamless access to the content that is part of their News+ subscription right in the News app or publisher app, as well as providing<span style=\"color: #d1d2d3;\"> </span>publishers with increased engagement and revenue opportunities on Apple News.

We are humbled that we were able to help as this was our biggest Prime Day ever for small businesses,” he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Prime Day is one of the biggest sales events for Amazon globally. In India, the e-commerce giant has historically sold more goods during sales events scheduled around the festival of Diwali, which is when local residents peak their spendings.</p>\n<p>But the participation of 91,000 sellers in last week&#8217;s Prime Day is the highest Amazon has ever witnessed during any sales period in India. During the sale around Diwali last year, for instance, the company had <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/b?ie=UTF8&#38;node=1592137031\">reported</a> the participation of 65,000 sellers.</p>\n<p>Amazon, which competes with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/walmart-invests-additional-1-2-billion-in-indias-flipkart-to-increase-stake/\">Walmart’s Flipkart in India</a>, has visibly rushed to expand its base of sellers in the country in recent quarters. Earlier this year, Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said the company would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/\">invest $1 billion in India</a> to help digitize local small businesses and increase their cumulative exports on Amazon to $10 billion by 2025.</p>\n<p>The company revealed today that it has amassed 650,000 sellers in India, up from 500,000 it disclosed in January this year.</p>\n<p>Amazon has also been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/\">focusing on tie-ups with neighborhood stores across the country</a>, leveraging their vast reach to drive more people to shop online. The company said over a thousand such shops from more than 100 cities made their debut on Prime Day last week.</p>\n<p>Amazon also claimed that during Prime Day, the number of requests people made to Alexa exceeded one million. The company also shared a wide-range of other stats such as a claim that twice as many customers signed up for a Prime membership during last week&#8217;s Prime Day compared to last year&#8217;s. But without any concrete figures, these numbers are bereft of meaning.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_RScFM1VF-s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:22:46 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1195397590.jpg?w=599","linkMd5":"02653aa8c209d114f4e56322b896fdd9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn55@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005326_ae86f67a90fc1065.webp","author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn51@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094002885_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005221_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005212_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn27@2020_2/2020-08-10/1597094005259_c67ac1fd242ed694.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_RScFM1VF-s:D9eJXQD2mmU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn43@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005194_48573ab8e03f80c3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597094005089_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_RScFM1VF-s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn95@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597094005200_20b77c9c26338ffd.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 05:13:22","feedId":26,"fetchDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:13:22 +0000","fetchMs":22,"handleMs":5950,"totalMs":191466,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.215.119.172","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"6e6f2c473dcf4524bbe4862859d69d7f_26","bgimgsTotal":9,"bgimgsGithubTotal":9,"articlesImgsTotal":37,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":36},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 02:43:20","id":26,"name":"TechCrunch","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://s.yimg.com/oa/build/images/favicons/techcrunch.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn82@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597093998431_f2e65e4f8ef2441a.ico","description":"TechCrunch is a group-edited blog that profiles the companies, products and events defining and transforming the new web.","weekly":null,"link":"https://techcrunch.com"},"extra4":{"start":1597093996647,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":107,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5950,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":3311,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1764,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":183074,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":37,"extra6":36,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null]}
