Skillets have gently sloping, shallow sides, a wide bottom, a long handle, and often, no lid. Frying pans are measured by the size across the top of the pan. The most common sizes are 8-inch, which is perfect for a grilled cheese sandwich or scrambled eggs for one, 10-inch, which is perfect for everyday use if you are only cooking for one or two people, and 12-inch, which is good if you are cooking for a family.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Saut&#233; pan</strong>: A saut&#233; pan is similar to a skillet, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A saut&#233; pan has straight sides (skillets have gently sloped sides), a long handle, and sometimes a smaller loop handle on the other side for ease in lifting the pan. Most saut&#233; pans include a lid. Use your saut&#233; pan to saut&#233;, braise, or cook up any large batch of food with a lot of liquid. A 5-quart saut&#233; pan is the most useful size or 3-quart if you only cook for one or two people.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Saucepan</strong>: The pot you will reach for over and over, saucepans are round, with straight sides, a long handle, and a fitted lid. Saucepans are perfect for heating and cooking soups, stews, rice, sauces, or vegetables. Saucepans are measured in quarts. A 2-quart and a 4-quart saucepan will cover your needs nicely.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Stockpot</strong>: A tall, round pot with a fitted lid, stockpots are perfect for large batches of soups or stews, corn on the cob, or pasta. Stockpots are measured in quarts and an 8-quart pot is large enough to handle a family's needs.</li></ul>\n\tWhich metal is best for cookware?\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a5fc7ccf421496e3d8b5376?format=jpeg\" alt=\"cookware\" height=\"1125\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Anolon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 30px; font-family: Georgia,Times,sans-serif;\"><li><strong>Stainless steel</strong> is one of the most popular materials for cookware sets, and for good reason. It doesn't react with foods, works with just about every cooking technique, is very durable and resistant to scratches, dents, and rust, and is safe for the dishwasher (although it's best to wash your cookware by hand). Stainless steel does not conduct heat well, however, so you'll usually find it reinforced with either aluminum or copper. Most stainless steel works with induction cooktops.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Aluminum</strong> is very soft on its own, so almost all cookware made of this reasonably priced metal is <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/best-cookware-hard-anodized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anodized</a> &#8211; a process that hardens and strengthens the aluminum, and also reduces its tendency to react with acidic foods like tomatoes. Aluminum is a great conductor of heat and is suitable for most cooking methods. It resists scratches and stains and is easy to care for. Aluminum cookware is usually not compatible with induction cooktops.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Nonstick</strong> pots and pans are generally anodized aluminum coated with a nonstick material, such as Teflon, that prevents food from sticking. This makes cleanup a breeze, particularly with sticky foods such as cheese. On the downside, the nonstick coating tends to scratch easily and wear away over time. You'll need to be careful while stirring or mixing; use plastic or silicone utensils to avoid scratching the cookware. Nonstick pots and pans are generally not safe for very high heat, and although they are dishwasher safe, doing so can speed up the disintegration of the nonstick coating. Most nonstick cookware is not suitable for induction cooktops.</li><li><strong>C</strong><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">opper</strong> is hard to beat for warm natural beauty, but you'll pay a premium for cookware made from this super-conductive metal. Copper reacts to changes in temperature very quickly, meaning it will heat up and cool down faster than most other cookware metals, thus giving you close control over your favorite dishes. On the downside, because copper is reactive, it usually has to be lined with another metal, such as stainless steel, and it requires polishing to maintain its glow. It's also prone to scratches and discoloration, and it's not compatible with induction cooktops.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Carbon steel</strong> is something like a hybrid of cast iron and stainless steel, but much more expensive than either of those metals. It's lighter than cast iron, heats up faster and conducts heat better than cast iron, and develops a natural, somewhat nonstick surface just like cast iron. It also requires periodic seasoning, rusts easily, and reacts with some foods &#8211; also traits of cast iron. Despite its flaws, many chefs love the tight temperature control carbon steel offers, as it responds quickly to changes in the heat. It's also suitable for use with an induction cooktop.</li><li><strong>C</strong><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">ast iron&#160;</strong>cookware sets are rare, but it's a very popular metal for skillets, saucepans, and Dutch ovens. This heavy metal is actually not a good conductor of heat, but once it heats up, it stays hot for a long time. <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/best-cast-iron-skillet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cast iron</a> is great for searing meats, scrambling eggs, and baking cornbread, and it goes into the oven just as easily as it cooks on top of it. It requires periodic seasoning, however, is very prone to rust and discoloring, and can be a pain to clean, although it does develop a naturally nonstick surface. Enameled cast iron is a little easier to care for, but is very expensive. Cast iron is suitable for induction cooktops.</li></ul>\n\tMore great cookware guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ede50f6f34d056b9d31cba6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"pots and pans\"

This once low-key destination has since boomed in popularity thanks to wide, white-sand beaches, relatively affordable rental homes, and proximity to many large East Coast cities. Ramshackle single-story beach cottages have given way to sprawling, multi-level houses and fancy restaurants, gourmet stores, and kitschy shops have all moved in.&#160;</p><p>Yet even with this explosive growth — and the persistent snarl of summer traffic — the Outer Banks still manages to retain its natural beauty and charm. The centrally-located beach towns of Kitty Hawk, Nags Head, and Kill Devil Hills tend to be more crowded, but offer family-friendly amenities, while if you head farther north to Corolla, or south to Hatteras, you'll be rewarded with miles of pristine beaches, rugged dunes, lighthouses, and the occasional wild horse.</p><p>As people continue to look for safe travel options where outdoor activities are plentiful amid the ongoing pandemic, all that coastal scenery and space make the Outer Banks especially appealing. Not to mention even the winter temperatures stay in the high 50s and low 60s. when Of course, safety cannot be guaranteed without a vaccine, and it's important to follow guidelines from the CDC and WHO, consider your own risk, and confirm rules mandated by states for visitors.

Republican poll watchers, and other observers to corroborate Trump's claims — including one who said it was peculiar that droves of US service members voted for President-elect Joe Biden.</p><p>\"I did find it odd that, throughout the day/night, I saw a few dozen military ballots be counted,\" a certified poll watcher said in his statement dated November 4. \"Although I cannot provide specific numbers or names, I can estimate that at least 80% of the military ballots I saw were straight ticket Democrat or simply had Joe Biden's name filled in on them.\"</p><p>\"I had always been told that military personnel tended to be more conservative, so this stuck out to me as the day went on,\" he added.</p><p>The poll watcher, who was stationed at the TCF convention center in Detroit and said he had a \"GOP network of friends,\" also alleged he faced intimidation by his colleagues after scrutinizing their actions and calling for a ballot review. He was eventually escorted out of the location by police officers after debating with a supervisor.</p><p>The layout of absentee ballots vary by state, and some designs make it easier to tell if they are from a US service member. Overseas Michigan residents, such as service members, are allowed to vote through an electronic ballot that may be mailed in the event that physical ballots are not available — on top of these ballots are the words \"MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTER BALLOT,\" according to a Michigan Bureau of Elections manual dated March 2018.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac660f98669500182b5868?format=jpeg\" alt=\"poll watcher\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An observer watches as county employees process mail-in ballots in Las Vegas on October 31.\n<p class=\"copyright\">John Locher/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But the poll observer's anecdote of seeing an overwhelmingly majority of \"military\" ballots at his location supporting Democrats is being met with some pushback, particularly in the wake of Trump's declining approval rating in recent polls and his attitude toward some veterans.</p><p>According to a poll from the <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/\">Military Times and Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families</a> conducted in July, 42% of 1,018 active-duty military respondents said they strongly disapproved of Trump's tenure at the White House. Nearly half of the poll's respondents said they viewed Trump unfavorably. That poll showed Biden with a 4-percentage-point lead over Trump.</p><p>But a separate <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/09/10/2020-military-voters-trump-biden-polling/\">Morning Consult</a> poll found Trump with a 10-percentage-point lead over Biden from military-affiliated households in October.&#160;</p><p>Despite Trump's professed love toward US service members and veterans, several reports published this year have thrown that rosy assessment into doubt. In September, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/\">The Atlantic</a>&#160;published a scathing report that said Trump disparaged dead military veterans.</p><p>The report, written by Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, cited officials who said they heard Trump describing Marines who died during World War I as \"losers\" and \"suckers\" and that he did not want injured veterans to appear at a military parade because he believed it would make spectators uneasy.</p><p>Trump's opinion of the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a longtime Arizona lawmaker and US Navy veteran, also incensed veterans' groups and congressional leaders with military service. After McCain died from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2018, Trump was angry when the senator received half-staff flag honors, The Atlantic reported. Trump was outspoken about his negative assessment of McCain and previously rejected the notion of describing him as a war hero \"because he was captured\" during the Vietnam War.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/military-vets-against-trumps-army-polls-election-2020-11\">Common Defense</a>, a nonprofit organization seeking to elect progressive candidates, questioned the long-standing belief that military service members and veterans would be inclined to support Republican candidates.</p><p>\"The current military is as diverse as the population we are drawn from and serve,\" a Common Defense spokesman told Insider. \"And if there is one thing that unifies us, no matter where we fall on the political spectrum, it is our frustration with the perception that we are the props for any particular politician or political party.\"</p><p>The spokesman added: \"Common Defense has campaigned for four years to mobilize veterans in swing states like Michigan to vote against Donald Trump, and so it is no surprise to us that military ballots in Detroit favored President-elect Joe Biden.\"</p><p>Trump's allies have relied on anecdotal evidence, such as the poll observer's claim in Michigan, and set up hotlines offering rewards to those who can corroborate their allegations of voter fraud. For instance, Texas Republican Lt. Gov.

Over 26,000 people in El Paso, a border city of some 680,000 in Texas, currently have COVID-19, a thousand of them are in the hospital. Fourteen people were reported dead on Wednesday alone, 696 since the pandemic began. The surge in fatalities is outstripping the city's ability to store the bodies; it now has 10 mobile morgues — air-conditioned trucks — to prevent corpses from decaying.</p>\n<p>\"I wish I were omnipotent — to be able to know what to do and how to do it,\" Margo, a Republican facing an upcoming runoff election, told Business Insider on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Unlike some in his party, Margo was an early advocate of masks, pushing back against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and his since-rescinded prohibition on local mandates. But he does share the reticence to shutter businesses.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">\n —City of El Paso (@ElPasoTXGov) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1326540604763852802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 11, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Last month, an El Paso County judge, Ricardo Samaniego attempted to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-texas-el-paso-prisons-2c8c536c178dd7464740876e64352fd7\">force such closures</a>, issuing a two-week shutdown order for all non-essential businesses, from gyms to tattoo parlors, and limit restaurants to take-out and delivery. Samaniego extended that order Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Margo's administration at first declined to enforce the order, which faces an ongoing legal challenge from a group of El Paso restaurants and the Texas attorney general. Uncertainty reigned, El Paso's restaurants continuing to serve diners and, per the city's contact-tracing program, contributed to the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>\"Huge, huge confusion,\" Laura Rayborn, a local spa owner, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/coronavirus-hospitalizations-el-paso-texas.html\">told The New York Times</a>. \"The mayor went on the radio and on TV and said, 'Stay open.\"</p>\n<p>\"We were between a rock and a hard place, legally,\" Margo argued, citing Gov. Abbott's own executive order limiting the ability of local jurisdictions to impose lockdowns. A district court later upheld the judge's order and, on Nov. 6, El Paso police began enforcing it. It is the most stringent set of restrictions since April, when the city lifted a stay-at-home order.<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>The law was not Margo's only consideration. He knows that bars — and bars adding food trucks so they can evade the city's public health edicts and stay open as restaurants — contribute to the spread of the coronavirus. Indoor dining, too: in October, Margo limited dining establishments to carry out after 9:00 p.m., reducing the maximum occupancy to 50% before that.</p>\n<p>\"When you drink alcohol, your guard goes down and people drop their protections,\" Margo said. That was the thinking that informed the restrictions. However, \"what we found is that people were leaving the bars after 9:00 p.m., but they weren't going home. They were congregating in other homes together or other locations together.\" Over half of positive COVID-19 cases in El Paso are people between the ages of 20 to 39. \"That's still a behavioral issue that's a problem.\"</p>\n<p>Shopping, too, is to blame for the spread: Contact-tracing has revealed that one of the top apparent sources of infection <a href=\"https://www.ktsm.com/news/big-box-stores-top-source-of-covid-19-spread-in-el-paso-officials-say/\">are big-box retailers</a> — Walmart, Target, and the like — where extended families walk the aisles in search of bargains. <strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, perhaps, these places would be limited to delivery or curbside pickup too. The status quo of doing just enough to arrest the spread of the virus, but not enough to stamp it out, has meant states and cities across the country, red and blue, have seen progress followed by another surge.</p>\n<p>\"I recognize that there are physical deaths as a result of this pandemic, and physical hurt with families and others,\" Margo said. \"But there also are financial deaths that are occurring.\"</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac95ac7f8f4200182a66f2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages 1229244828\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2223\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   A store closing banner hangs above Trump 2020 hats on a storefront on October 23, 2020 in downtown El Paso, Texas. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">PAUL RATJE/AFP via Getty Images</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>A quarter of El Paso's small businesses have shut down since March. \"They're not underground. They're not waiting to resurface. They're gone,\" Margo said. \"We have 32,000 under unemployment, and we have 148,000 people being fed by our food bank. So there is a balance to this. And all I've been trying to do is walk that tight wire.\"</p>\n<p>Shutdowns are, to be sure, a last resort — a hammer that's brought down when a virus is out of control. They might not prevent individual bad behavior, or entire families behaving irresponsibly, but they would, at a time when cities are resorting to morgues on wheels, arrest the spread of a deadly virus. In the long run, temporary pain could also mean long-term economic gain, putting an end to the stop-and-start pattern that's now repeating for a third time.</p>\n<p>Provided, of course, that there was a coherent and consistent federal response. No city is an island, and even those with the strictest responses to the pandemic have been unable to stave off a resurgence in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-harvards-dr-thomas-tsai-asseses-trumps-pandemic-response-2020-7\">absence of a coherent federal plan</a>.<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>A second stimulus has been stalled in Congress for months. Democrats have been calling for a comprehensive package, including $1,200 checks, money for state and local governments, and billions more in funding for small business loans, and passed such a measure in May. Senate Republicans, however, have balked at the price tag, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell putting a new stimulus on the backburner while the chamber confirmed Supreme Court Justice Amy Comey Barrett.<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Trump administration, meanwhile, has veered between calls to cut off negotiations on a new stimulus deal and to \"go big\" — too big, even, for conservatives in Congress. <strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>\"If you had the financial support that we had at the beginning.... then yeah, that's fine. People can still put food on the table and they still can pay their rent and the businesses can get by,\" Margo said. \"But without that, then it's a morality play. And that bothers me.\" Without that financial support — grants for small businesses and stimulus checks for their patrons — the result is that both the economy and public health suffers.</p>\n<p>\"We need more help,\" Margo told Business Insider. \"We continue to need more help.\"</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

The big question for Republicans is not whether Trump will keep a grip on the party, but whether that grip will be as absolute as it has been the last four years — and whether he will indeed run again for president in 2024.</p><p>Trump and his family have already issued a series of loyalty tests, demanding support for their false accusations of voter fraud, and other Republicans with their eyes set on running for the White House in 2024 have obliged.</p><p>The first clear gauge of Trump's power as an outgoing president will be a pair run-off special elections for the Senate in Georgia. If Trump and his family are called on successfully to help drive Republican voter turnout and the Republicans hold both seats and control of the Senate, that will likely be viewed as a victory for Trump and further cement his grip on the GOP. But if either or both candidates lose, or Trump's brand is seen hurting them, than that will further weaken Trump.&#160;</p><p><strong>Join Insider politics reporter Tom LoBianco in conversation with

Instead, it urges a focus on five key areas where boomers reaped financial gains through luck and external forces: low interest rates, urbanization, pollution, cohort size, and education.</p><p>Boomers, the report says, have benefited from an increased value in assets thanks to low-interest rates and from inflated housing prices. They didn't have to pay as much for education as millennials currently do, nor will they have to face the cost for environmental damage caused by the carbon emission-releasing companies in which they've invested. The generation is also larger in size, the report continues, meaning it typically wins elections.</p><p>With these five forces in mind, the report proposes several tax policies to help close the wealth divide:</p><ul><li><strong>Tax on primary residence</strong> via tax on the profit of the house sale (a capital gains tax) or tax on the property purchase (a stamp duty tax) to offset inflated housing prices</li><li><strong>Additional taxes on financial assets</strong> such as stocks and bonds to offset growth from low-interest rates as boomers begin to sell these assets into retirement</li><li><strong>A \"super tax\" on stocks</strong> to compensate for gains companies made on pollution, which could help fund investment in climate change&#160;</li></ul><p>These taxes, the report states, are intended to avoid higher income taxes. \"These can be an invasion on hard work and, should they rise, there is a risk that work will be disincentivised,\" it reads.</p><p>The report also calls for policies apart from taxation, such as lowering housing prices or centralizing control of city planning, which it recognized as a \"dramatic step\" to leveling the effects of urbanization. For the rising cost of education, the report suggests government subsidies for higher education or government grants to new graduates for the first few working years that will compensate for entry-level salaries less than tuition costs. More powerful youth advisory councils may also address the bigger challenge of imbalance in generational size, the report adds.</p><p>The report notes that some of these policies are more realistic, others more radical, and some may overlap, rendering others unnecessary. But the time for change is now, it says, before millennials take control.&#160;<br><br>\"All indications are that they will enact policies that not only forcibly redistribute in blunt ways, but also upend the<br>very foundations of capitalism,\" the report states.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/baby-boomer-tax-generational-wealth-gap-deutsche-bank-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/S4Pkb-uQhZM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:02:33 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fac2af57f8f4200182a64cf?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f05c92e8a7396ef348e952389de0409e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn3@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-49-51-639_77e24c8d42252c97.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":223176,"destBytes":223176,"author":"hhoffower@businessinsider.com (Hillary Hoffower)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fac2af57f8f4200182a64cf?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn3@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-49-51-639_77e24c8d42252c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-05-069_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn100@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-49-55-841_3ea881f87401d605.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-00-114_8bbbf4a0af1f006d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn48@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-59-767_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4Pkb-uQhZM:AmrJNTvxVYE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-07-001_13d4034462b70bdb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/S4Pkb-uQhZM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-56-374_3ec5f60071574d62.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156579275},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:39","title":"Upset and not accepting of the election results, Trump appears to have forgotten he still has to govern","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/upset-election-results-trump-seem-forget-he-still-has-govern-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9307ad212113001874077a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump wind\" height=\"1249\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>President Donald Trump appears to be neglecting his duties and has mostly been out of sight for the past week.&#160;</li>\n<li>Since losing the election, he's refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden and is falsely alleging fraud.</li>\n<li>Trump has not addressed the growing COVID-19 outbreak and other national concerns.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Following the results of the presidential election, President Donald Trump appears to be neglecting his duties to govern. He has spent much of the past week falsely alleging voter fraud and then once a winner was projected, refusing to concede to President-elect Joe Biden.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery for a Veteran's Day ceremony. It was his first appearance in six days, and he did not speak at the event, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/donald-trump-schedule-election/index.html\">CNN</a> reported.</p><p>White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere told CNN that Trump is \"carrying out all of his duties.\"</p><p>\"Just as he promised, President Trump is fighting hard for a free and fair election while at the same time carrying out all of his duties to put America First,\" Deere said.</p><p>CNN noted that the last intelligence briefing on Trump's public schedule was for October 2, the morning after he tested positive for the coronavirus. While the public schedule does not have all of the president's meetings and events, it has been relatively empty for the past several days.&#160;</p><p>As Trump has stayed out of the public view, the US has been hitting records in new cases of COVID-19 as officials across the country try to figure out how to stop the rapid spread of the virus. On Tuesday, a record of almost 131,000 new cases was recorded and hospitalizations also hit an all-time high.&#160;</p><p>Public health experts have said this could be the \"deadliest\" wave yet, but Trump has not addressed the growing number of cases. The president, however, without any evidence, did post on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325961445062938625?s=20\">Twitter allegations that Pfizer</a>, who on Monday revealed promising vaccine results, deliberately waited until after the US election make that announcement.&#160;</p><p>He provided no evidence to support that claim. A Pfizer spokesperson told Business Insider that the timing had nothing to do with the election.</p><p>While Trump has stayed quiet on the pandemic, Biden addressed the country after it surpassed 10 million total cases, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-projects-image-governing-trump-stays-sight/story?id=74126134\">ABC</a> reported.&#160;</p><p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Read more</em></strong><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">:&#160;</em><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/progressives-biden-administration-cabinet-sanders-warren-2020-11?r=oo-kush\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/progressives-biden-administration-cabinet-sanders-warren-2020-11?r=oo-kush\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Here are 30 top progressives ready to lob grenades, cause headaches and otherwise cajole the incoming Biden administration from its left flank</a></em></p><p>\"We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months.

weeks since they spoke with the Trump administration.</a> The company filed a petition in court over the November 12 deadline to divest after they had no meaningful dialogue with the Trump admin on a deal.&#160;</p><p>Trump had gone after the platform, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese-based company for national security concerns.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-stimulus-trump-sits-out-pelosi-democrats-economy-2020-11\">is also sidelining itself from COVID-19 stimulus bill talks.</a> Democrats and Republicans, including the White House, spent months trying to agree on a package after the first round of financial relief expired this summer.&#160;</p><p>CNN reported that the President went golfing at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, over the weekend.&#160;</p><p>Trump's keen focus on his re-election loss has placed the country at a standstill without proper governance.&#160;</p><p>His refusal to recognize Biden as the winner of the election has blocked <a

Aeronautical Division of the US Signal Corps.</p><p>When the US entered the war in 1917, it was \"almost totally unprepared in aeronautical experience, equipment, and personnel,\" according to a post-war <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Unification_of_the_War_and_Navy_Departme.html?id=-DdqugEACAAJ\" target=\"_top\">report</a>.</p><p>With no experience or fighter aircraft of its

It could carry four 25-pound bombs and had a top speed of about 135 mph.</p><p>With over 8,000 built, the SPAD XIII was one of the most-produced fighters of the war and was the US's primary fighter. The two most successful US aces of the war, Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and 2nd Lt. Frank Luke, scored most of their kills with SPAD XIIIs.</p><h2>P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa991ccf7d1cb0019e3a975?format=jpeg\" alt=\"P-38 Lightning fighter plane WWII\" height=\"1048\" width=\"1398\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An early model of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning over Los Angeles, November 20, 1940.\n<p class=\"copyright\">(AP Photo)</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>By the time of World War II, US pilots, then part of the US Army Air Corps, were much better prepared.</p><p>US manufacturers had developed dozens of fighter designs. One was the <a href=\"https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/history/p-38.html\" target=\"_top\">P-38 Lightning</a>, which was introduced in 1941 and was one of the fastest in the world, with a top speed over 400 mph.

Racks under the wings could carry 10 rockets or up to 1,000 pounds of bombs.</p><p>The Mustang could reach 425 mph and 40,000 feet, and was the US's primary fighter in Europe, though it also served as a fighter-bomber.</p><p>P-51s are <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2000593917/\" target=\"_top\">believed</a> to have shot down 4,950 enemy aircraft.

It usually carried eight air-to-air missiles and eight 750-pound bombs.</p><p>The Phantom II was equipped with afterburners that made its top speed 1,485 mph, though it usually cruised at 590 mph. Its service ceiling was 56,100 feet.</p><p>It was the Vietnam War's defining jet.

Below, you'll find answers to frequently asked questions, plus when you can start shopping.&#160;</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><h2>Best early Black Friday 2020 deals from Walmart</h2><h3>November 11 at 7 p.m. EST online and in-store on November 14</h3><div id=\"ProductCard_5f986f77851d5a0bdd44a3e9\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f986f77851d5a0bdd44a3e9&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5f987076acfefb65d04a5d0c\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f987076acfefb65d04a5d0c&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5dadabb2cc4a0a3f1175f5c3\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5dadabb2cc4a0a3f1175f5c3&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><h2>When does Walmart's Black Friday sale start?&#160;</h2><p>Walmart, like many retailers, is trying something new for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Friday 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cyber-monday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cyber Monday 2020</a>. Instead of a weekend of markdowns and deals, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-black-friday-stores-limited-capacity-3-day-event-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart will stagger its offers</a> and introduce new ones every week until Black Friday. Here's the schedule:</p><ul><li>November 11 at 7 p.m. EST online and in-store on November 14 at 5 a.m. local time. Discounts will primarily be for TVs, smartphones, and tablets.</li><li>November 25 at 7 p.m. EST online and in-store on Black Friday, November 27 at 5 a.m. local time. This is the official Black Friday date, so we expect to see discounts on most categories.</li></ul><p>These sales end the day they are released. So if you miss a deal online, you'll have another opportunity in-store after a couple of days.</p><h2>How do we select the best Black Friday deals at Walmart?</h2><ul><li>We only choose products that meet our high standard of coverage, from brands we've tested and trust.</li><li>We compare the prices against other retailers like Amazon, Target, and Best Buy and only include the deals that are the same or better (not including promotional discounts that come from using certain credit cards).</li><li>We research price history thoroughly, to ensure that every deal we list is actually worth your time.</li></ul><h2>Can you shop at Walmart in person this year?</h2><p>Yes, but don't expect the mad rush during Black Friday like in years past. This year, Walmart will also limit store capacity to just 20% during its Black Friday sales. Plus, there will be safety precautions, including masks for staff and shoppers, plus carts will be sanitized.&#160;</p><p>Since Walmart scheduled each set of discounts online a few days in advance, shoppers should consider heading in-store only when they miss a deal.&#160;&#160;</p><h2>Does Walmart have curbside pickup?</h2><p>Every year around the holiday season, shipping delays and lost packages present a big headache for many consumers. To help alleviate that stress, Walmart offers contact-free curbside pickup for online orders. Going this route can save shoppers from any shipping-related headaches, so you'll have your orders on hand much sooner than if shipped.</p><h2>What early Black Friday deals should you buy at Walmart?</h2><p>Historically, Walmart's Black Friday markdowns are on par with those offered by Best Buy, Target, and Amazon — and this year is no different. Outside of a few select doorbusters, we expect each retailer to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-that-price-match\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">price-match their competitor's prices</a> during Black Friday.&#160; Shoppers can expect big savings on several TVs, streaming media players, kitchen appliances, and more.&#160;</p><p>With their staggered release, shoppers should shop for the deals offered during the aforementioned dates. Every deal that's been announced is either live right now and listed above or expired.</p><h3>&#160;</h3><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

solid and reliable carry-on is an essential piece of luggage for any traveler. Key factors that make a carry-on suitcase standout are size, weight, durability, and how easy it is to pack. As a travel editor, I've tested numerous carry-ons over the years, including for our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-carry-on-bag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best carry-on suitcases</a>.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074VJYRZN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_110920_samsonite-centric-luggage-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074VJYRZN&linkId=558821a6f4a565292cc9261570a9a02cf4a565292cc9261570a9a02c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Samsonite Centric 20\" Hardside Expandable Luggage with Spinner Wheels</a> beat out the competition and is my top overall pick as the best hard-side carry-on bag you can buy. I've used this suitcase on trips ranging from lengthy international vacations to quick weekend getaways and found that it excels when it comes to function, durability, and ease of use. Plus, it comes in at an excellent price point for the quality. After several years of use, this suitcase continues to impress me.</p><h2>Design and specs</h2><p>The most important factor when it comes to a carry-on is that it fits in an airplane's overhead bin. After all, if you get to your seat and discover that your bag won't fit, the whole point of packing a carry-on has been defeated.&#160;</p><p>While this bag is specifically noted as being 20 inches in height, it's important to understand that measurement actually refers to interior packable space. The overall height of the exterior of the bag actually comes in at 22 inches, including the wheels, when I measured it. Luckily, this is still well within the FAA sizing regulations and, in my experience, this bag easily fits on nearly all international and domestic flights, with the exception of tiny jumper planes.&#160;</p><p>The hard-side suitcase is made out of high-quality polycarbonate. The twill texture is scratch- and scuff-resistant with a slightly shiny finish. This bag weighs 7.5 pounds, which is pretty average in terms of carry-ons and it's easy enough to lift into overhead bins. Standout details also include rubberized grip under the top and side handles for extra comfort when lifting the bag, smooth silver zippers that are easy to grip and pull, and a TSA-approved lock.</p><p>The four multi-directional wheels are also excellent. They are quiet and the suitcase rolls in front of you, beside you, or behind you on almost any surface easily. However, they are not as functional on thick carpet as some of the best wheels I've tested on other bags. That said, I haven't come across too many instances during my travels when I actually needed to pull the bag on thick carpet, so that has not been a significant issue.&#160;&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074VJYRZN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_110920_samsonite-centric-luggage-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074VJYRZN&linkId=558821a6f4a565292cc9261570a9a02cf4a565292cc9261570a9a02c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">The Samsonite Centric Hardside</a> carry-on is available in three colors: black, orange, and teal.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac4f207f8f4200182a65d0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"samsonite centric hardside luggage review zipper\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hannah Freedman/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What it's like to use</h2><p>I've been using the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074VJYRZN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_110920_samsonite-centric-luggage-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074VJYRZN&linkId=558821a6f4a565292cc9261570a9a02cf4a565292cc9261570a9a02c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Samsonite Centric Hardside Carry-On</a> for several years, and its best quality is how well it has held up over that time. While there are a few scuff marks visible if you really get up close to inspect the bag, they are minimal. There are no serious scratches or dents to speak of and from afar, the bag still looks practically new.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the wheels are a breeze on most surfaces and make the suitcase very easy to roll on and off the plane and through crowded airports. The adjustable handle is a good height, but it does wobble a decent amount and could be sturdier.&#160;</p><p>While 20 inches of interior space may not sound like a lot, I've been able to easily pack a week's worth of clothes in this carry-on for longer trips. The interiors don't offer any fancy perks, but the mesh zipper pocket and strong buckles are sufficient for securing clothes, shoes, and packing cubes in place. The handle poles do take up some space on one side of the bag, which can make laying clothes totally flat a challenge. However, if you pack smartly you can build yourself a base with smaller items and lay additional clothes flat on top of that.&#160;&#160;I like to pack shoes and items that need extra securing on the side with the mesh zipper, and bulkier items like sweaters on the opposite side so I can pull the buckles tight to help compress them.</p><p>This suitcase also has the option to expand by unzipping extra zippers on the outside. While I don't recommend using the expandable option if you know you'll be on smaller planes, I do like the versatility it allows. I've used the expandable option on longer international and cross-country flights when I know the overhead bins will easily accommodate the bag even at a slightly larger width. It is also a nice feature for travelers like me who tend to always pick up a souvenir or two and need extra room for them on the trip home.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac4f3f7f8f4200182a65d3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"samsonite centric hardside luggage review interior\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hannah Freedman/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What makes the Samsonite Centric Hardside carry-on stand out</h2><p>The value of this bag is what really sets it apart. The materials are of good quality and highly durable and will last for years. While many high-end suitcases easily come in closer to $300 or more, this suitcase starts around $150 and frequently can be found on sale for under $100, making it an excellent value.</p><p>While this suitcase doesn't come with many bells and whistles, it has everything you need for a good, sturdy carry-on and comes in at the right price.</p><h2>The cons</h2><p>The biggest downside of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074VJYRZN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_110920_samsonite-centric-luggage-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074VJYRZN&linkId=558821a6f4a565292cc9261570a9a02cf4a565292cc9261570a9a02c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Samsonite Centric</a> is the adjustable handle. While it's held up fine over the past few years, it is very wobbly and much less sturdy when compared to the handles of other high-end suitcases.</p><p>This carry-on is also a pretty standard weight at 7.5 pounds. While it hasn't been an issue for me, if you have trouble lifting carry-ons or tend to overpack and worry about every last ounce for the weigh-in required on some flights, you may be better suited to a lightweight carry-on option.&#160;</p><p>This suitcase is also fairly bare-bones and doesn't come with any extras like a USB port or extra interior organizers.&#160;</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>There are seemingly endless options when it comes to carry-on suitcases, and undoubtedly there are other hard-side options on the market worth considering, including the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomingdales.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Frimowa-essential-lite-cabin-small%3FID%3D3141780D3141780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Rimowa Essential Lite</a> ($490), the <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/TUJGRkpGSUJGSEhLR01CRkpKS0ZJ?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.awaytravel.com%2Fsuitcases%2Fcarry-on%2Fcoast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Away Carry-On </a>($225), and the <a href=\"https://www.tumi.com/p/international-carry-on-0287660NVY/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Tumi International Carry-On</a> ($750). However, as you'll notice, nearly all of those will cost you significantly more. If you're looking for a suitcase that will last a lifetime or that comes with lots of extras, these suitcases might better suit your needs.&#160;</p><p>But for a quality bag that is durable and will last you several years without breaking the bank, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074VJYRZN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_110920_samsonite-centric-luggage-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074VJYRZN&linkId=558821a6f4a565292cc9261570a9a02cf4a565292cc9261570a9a02c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Samsonite Centric 20\" Hardside Expandable Luggage with Spinner Wheels</a> is tough to beat. This suitcase has all the qualities you need in a solid carry-on, including plenty of packing space, a durable and scratch-resistant shell, excellent multi-directional wheels, an expansion option, and the right dimensions to fit in almost any overhead bin.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent price for the quality, durable, scratch-resistant, wheels easily, expandable</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Handle wiggles a decent amount when fully extended, slightly heavier than other options available&#160;</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5f734e77d67e123b3026cc8e\" style=\"position:relative;

importance of having a commander-in-chief that understands military service and sacrifice in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>Kait Wyatt and her husband Derek were in the Marines together, and during their service, Derek made the ultimate sacrifice. He was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010.</p><p>\"It has been 10 years, and we miss him every day,\" Wyatt said, \"I don't think that'll ever change.\"</p><p>Reflecting on Veteran's Day, Wyatt told Insider that it is \"not only honoring the sacrifice of the veteran but also bringing light to the struggle that it is to be in the military.\"</p><p>She characterized veterans, as well as people like first responders, as those that \"put their lives on the line and soak up the negativity that is in our world so that they can shield the people who need it the most.\" Wyatt argued that a president should have some understanding of what that service and sacrifice means.</p><p>\"Donald Trump's not that person,\" she said, adding that on the far end of the sliding scale of selfishness, \"there's Donald Trump, where the only thing that matters is Donald Trump.\"</p><p>During his presidency, Trump, who has suggested he would have made a good general but does not actually have military experience, has made a number of disparaging remarks about veterans and military families, such as late Arizona Sen. John McCain or Gold Star father Khizr Khan, among others.</p><p>There are also reports that Trump called troops killed in combat \"losers\" and \"suckers,\" as well as reports that he questioned a fallen Marine's service, telling the father at his son's grave in Arlington: \"I don't get it.\"</p><p>In an interview with CNN in September, Wyatt <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gold-star-widow-blasts-trump-over-photo-at-arlington-cemetery-2020-9\">expressed anger and frustration after seeing a photo of Trump standing at her husband's grave at Arlington</a>. \"You can't stand on the graves of better men who fought and died for this country while you rip apart that country with your incompetence and unqualified presence within a position of leadership,\" she told CNN.</p><p>Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery again Wednesday.</p><p>Talking to Insider Wednesday, Wyatt expressed her support for President-elect Joe Biden, who was recently projected the winner of the presidential election, though Trump is disputing the results.</p><p>He has not served in the military either, but he is a Blue Star family member. His son Beau Biden served as a member of the National Guard and deployed to Iraq.

Those complexities, coupled with the advent of better batteries, will drive investments into \"pure\" battery electric vehicles, he said.&#160;</p><p>Previous moves by GM certainly suggest a preference for going all-electric.

Trump, however, has refused to acknowledge his defeat for five days and instead baselessly claimed election fraud.</p><p>The flurry of departures apparently sent shockwaves through the Department of Defense. A <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/trump-officials-ousted-burrowing/index.html\">defense official told CNN</a> that the situation was \"unsettling,\" adding that \"these are dictator moves.\" The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-army-christopher-miller-mark-esper-james-anderson-95f848b7cdaba116b7c09787edb4c839\">Associated Press wrote</a> that \"unease was palpable inside\" the Pentagon Tuesday.</p><p>Rep.

I've been nearly killed a bunch of times. I'm not an alarmist. I try to stay cool under pressure. Mark me down as alarmed,\" <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/gen-barry-mccaffrey-on-shakeup-at-the-pentagon-mark-me-down-as-alarmed-95737413944\">retired four-star Gen. Barry McCaffrey said on MSNBC Wednesday</a>.</p><p>\"We are watching the setup of people who are unqualified for office to be in control of the 2.1 million men and women of the armed forces,\" he added.</p><p>David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesman with decades of military service, told Insider that part of the \"cause for alarm is not knowing why this is being done.\"</p><p>\"You have an administration with very little credibility, little to none. The level of trust is very low, so people are naturally going to think the worst,\" he added. \"And the administration isn't taking steps to reassure anyone about why they're taking these actions.\"</p><p>\"I think what has everybody most concerned is that it doesn't make sense,\" Lapan said.</p><p>If it were vindictive, a response to Trump's souring on Esper as the defense secretary, then he could have simply fired Esper and elevated Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist. But that didn't happen. Instead, someone was brought in from outside, and then the departures accelerated.</p><p>\"There is no rational explanation for it,\" he said. \"There are any number of bad scenarios that could play out. We don't know which of those might be true, if any, but in the absence of any better explanation, people are concerned.\"</p><p>Lapan noted that the people coming in largely appear to be unqualified or underqualified for the positions they are taking over, potentially crippling the military's leadership.

In less than 10 years, the character has become a core part of the Marvel Universe, starring in the 2019 Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature, \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\"&#160;</p><p>With new powers, a different origin story, and a healthy respect for the original hero, Miles and \"Into the Spider-Verse\" helped Spider-Man evolve for a new generation of fans. As the headliner of a premier launch title, \"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales\" is designed to show players how their games will evolve in the coming generation too.</p><p>\"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a>\" will be released on November 12 alongside a remastered version of \" Marvel's Spider-Man\" for PlayStation 5. The game costs <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">$50 on its own</a>, or <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489334156344774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">$70 with the remaster</a>. \"Miles Morales\" is also available on <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489745661107141\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">PlayStation 4 for $50</a>, and there will be a paid upgrade option if you decide to buy a PS5 later.</p><h2>'Spider-Man: Miles Morales' review: A showcase for the PlayStation 5's next-gen performance</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac2f417f8f4200182a64eb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales PS5\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">&#34;Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&#34; / Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"Marvel's Spider-Man\" is the bestselling PS4 game of all-time, so there's a good chance that most PlayStation fans and PS5 early adopters are familiar with the original game. <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">\"Miles Morales\"</a> demonstrates just how the next-gen PS5 hardware can improve a game's performance with upgrades that go beyond graphics alone.</p><p>The visual improvements are immediately noticeable, with the PlayStation 5 delivering a higher resolution, new lighting and reflection effects, and a higher, more stable frame rate. Loading times improve greatly with the PlayStation 5's solid state drive — 30 to 60 second wait times from the PlayStation 4 \"Spider-Man\" are cut down to under five seconds in <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">\"Miles Morales.\"</a></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b967c7f8905f2fd1e8b4f25?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Spider Man ps4\" height=\"1035\" width=\"1834\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>These subway loading screens were fun on PS4, but PS5 loads so fast you can skip them entirely.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Marvel&#39;s Spider Man</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>PlayStation 5's power boost delivers tons of small enhancements to \"Spider-Man\" too; you'll find the streets of New York bustling with more cars and people, Spider-Man can swing through the city even faster because the streets take less time to load, and the environments show sharper detail in general. Overall, \"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a>\" showcases how PS5 can render a beautiful, busy, open world at 4K without hiccups.</p><h2>Graphics</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac29ebb09abb001862603c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Spider-Man Miles Morales PS5\" height=\"1406\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">&#34;Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&#34; / Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">\"Miles Morales\"</a> might be the best looking game we see during this initial run of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X launch titles, thanks to its expert implementation of real-time ray tracing; a premium graphics feature that's meant to be one of the PlayStation 5's hallmarks.</p><p>Ray tracing allows objects within the game world to create their own lighting effects, leading to more realistic looking shadows, reflections, and color shading. For \"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a>,\" this means that Miles's bio-electric powers, the reflective glass covering New York's skyscrapers, and the glowing neon billboards of Times Square all create their own unique lighting effects while you play.</p><p>Ray tracing is taxing on the PS5, however, slowing the game's animations down to 30 frames per second when the graphics are set to fidelity mode. In performance mode, \"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Miles Morales</a>\" runs at a full 60 frames per second, and the image quality is just slightly below 4K, though few people would notice at a glance. Performance mode does disable ray tracing effects, though.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac2d9b7f8f4200182a64e1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Spider-Man Miles Morales PS5\" height=\"843\" width=\"1125\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ray tracing creates some pretty awesome reflections and lighting effects.\n<p class=\"copyright\">&#34;Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&#34; / Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Personally, I find myself switching back and forth between fidelity and performance mode based on whether I'm checking out story missions and cutscenes, or just casually fighting crime and exploring. Ultimately, I feel like ray tracing gives the game a wonderful level of depth, so I'd recommend using fidelity mode to start and switching later if you want a smoother experience.</p><p>The game's character models are also tremendously detailed, with facial motion capture helping characters communicate with feeling during cutscenes. If you've played the original \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" you'll notice that character faces are a bit more detailed, and Peter Parker has a whole new actor.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac2b7fb09abb0018626049?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Spider-Man Miles Morales PS5\" height=\"844\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">&#34;Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&#34; / Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Miles Morales</a>\" is set shortly after the events of \"Marvel's Spider-Man,\" continuing the story with a teenage Miles stepping into his first days as Spider-Man. The story lasts about eight to 10 hours with cinematic cutscenes, making it about half as long as the first game. As someone who felt like \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" should've been a bit shorter, I find Miles to be a much tighter experience.</p><p>Though Peter Parker makes an appearance early on, Miles is left to defend the city on his own after a few quick lessons and training exercises. As a young hero, Miles has to learn to fully control his powers and strike a balance between his new found responsibilities and his personal life.</p><p>A growing clash between the Roxxon Corporation and the Underground, a street gang with futuristic weapons, forces Miles to intervene as Spider-Man to prevent New York from being destroyed. He battles supervillains, like the Rhino, the Prowler, and a new version of the Tinkerer, as he fights to protect the city.</p><p>The story in \"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Miles Morales</a>\" succeeds in separating the hero from Peter Parker; making him independent by highlighting his identity as an Afro-Latino New Yorker and focusing on the relationships that make him different from the original \"Spider-Man.\" There are still plenty of superhero cliches to be found in the world of \"Marvel's Spider-Man,\" but this version of Miles feels like one of his most satisfying incarnations to date.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6e3e34a5fb5800198b2f64?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales\" height=\"1125\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Miles Morales</a>\" doesn't do much to change the basic formula of \"Marvel's Spider-Man,\" adopting the same open-world gameplay based in New York City. The map has been slightly expanded to include Miles' hometown of Harlem, and weather effects, like snow and rain, add lovely detail to familiar scenery.</p><p>Between story beats, Miles will find different crimes and neighborhood missions spread across the city. Combat is a mix of basic button presses with timed dodges and gadgets for extra flair. Miles' cloaking ability also adds an extra layer to stealth sequences. As you progress through the story, you'll unlock more moves and tools to use in fights.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac31f0b09abb0018626072?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Spider-Man Miles Morales ps5\" height=\"844\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Unlike Peter Parker, Miles can make himself invisible for brief periods.\n<p class=\"copyright\">&#34;Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&#34; / Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In contrast to the car chases and shoot-outs Miles encounters, the neighborhood missions bring context and character to Miles' adventure. Answering requests on the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man app leads to Miles tracking a bodega cat, helping subway workers, and other complex side activities with fun rewards. Exploration is also essential, with hidden collectibles calling attention to the tremendous amount of detail within the city landscape.</p><p>The game has multiple difficulty settings and plenty of accessibility options to make sure that anyone can have fun, regardless of their age or prior experience with video games. Having completed \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" on advanced difficulty levels, I hopped into \"Miles Morales\" at the harder than normal \"Spectacular\" difficulty without issue, and I'm looking forward to starting a New Game+ on \"Ultimate\" difficulty — but not until I complete the PS5 remaster of \"Marvel's Spider-Man.\"</p><h2>Should you buy the Ultimate Edition?</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac29f0b09abb0018626040?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Spider-Man Miles Morales PS5\" height=\"1406\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">&#34;Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&#34; / Sony</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Buying the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489334156344774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">ultimate edition of \"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales\"</a> is the only way to get the remastered PS5 version of \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" right now. That $70 version will also give you access to the game on both PS4 and PS5, if you want to play \"Miles Morales\" on PS4 first and upgrade later. The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723489852019026143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">standard version of \"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales\"</a> costs $50.</p><p>In my mind, the ultimate is the better choice, since the remaster of the first \"Spider-Man\" will provide dozens of hours of extra gameplay and a visual overhaul of an all-time classic game for about $20 more. If you're planning on buying the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1723491528040262749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">$50 PlayStation 4 version of \"Spider-Man: Miles Morales,\"</a>&#160;Sony has promised an upgrade option for gamers who buy the PlayStation 5 later on, though the price isn't known just yet.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><figure>\n\t<img

version won't look nearly as good on PS5.</p><p>As a comic book fan, longtime Spider-Man fan, and black person living near New York City, it's lovely to see Miles get the space to shine in his own game, and to see such care given to recreating the diverse neighborhood that gave birth to such a fun character.</p><p>If you haven't been able to find a PS5 yet, you might be disappointed to pay $50 for an experience that isn't nearly as optimized as the PS5 version of \"Spider-Man.\" However, the story and gameplay additions that \"Miles Morales\" brings to the table absolutely warrant the $50 PS4 price tag.</p><h3>'Spider-Man: Miles Morales' (PS5)</h3><div id=\"ProductCard_5fac5386851d5a13101fdd14\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe

Encompassing the Phoenix area, the county has trended towards Democrats in recent years.</p><p>There are major down-ballot races in the Senate and House, including the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-1st-district-house-election-tom-ohalleran-tiffany-shedd-2020\">1st District</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-2nd-district-house-election-ann-kirkpatrick-brandon-martin-2020\">2nd District</a> in the southeast, and the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-6th-district-house-election-david-schweikert-hiral-tipirneni-2020\">6th District</a> in Phoenix's northern suburbs.</p><p>The state's congressional delegation is split: six Democrats and five Republicans in Congress. Both houses of the state legislature and the position of governor, however, are held by Republicans. Arizona has 11 electoral votes and is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/arizona/\">believed by analysts</a> to be competitive.</p><p>Arizona, and particularly Maricopa County, has seen significant demographic shifts in recent years that have helped move the state to the left. The state has seen an influx in new residents from the coasts, people with higher educational attainment, and Latinos, who are disproportionately younger and have been activated by years of the state GOP's attacks on immigration.</p><p>Polling has also shown that Arizona's suburban women shifted leftwards this cycle. This group has been crucial to Democratic victories across the country, both this year and in 2018. The state elected its first Democratic senator in decades — Sen. Kyrsten Sinema — in 2018.</p><p>Arizona political strategists say Trump's regular attacks on former Arizona Sen. John McCain, a longserving political moderate and Vietnam veteran, has also hurt the president's popularity among establishment Republicans and independents in the state.</p><p>Arizona, which Trump won by just over three points in 2016, has voted Republican for every election but one since 1972.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

She further denied allegations of copying, saying that she hadn't even bought or been given free merchandise from the store, and that she had checked with WheWoreWhat's designers, and found that they weren't aware of Eros' pattern either.&#160;</p><p>Eros' counsel Jeff Gluck told Business Insider strongly pushed back on these claims in an interview with Business Insider in October. He said that that he had evidence, in the form of showroom logs and gifting requests, that proved that Bernstein visited Eros' showroom (not its retail store), and that Bernstein had previously requested free merchandise from The Great Eros, Gluck said.</p><p>Gluck also clarified that in terms of intellectual property, Eros wasn't claiming that they owned the rights to line drawings of female nudes. He said that the design similarities between Eros' tissue paper and WhatWeWore's merchandise had multiple design similarities, such as the weight of the lines in the drawings and the way that the figures were arranged.&#160;</p><p>The Great Eros slammed Bernstein's decision to sue in a social media post in October.</p><p>\"Danielle, you have become a bully... You just drove 100 mph into a brick wall, because your bulls--t stops here and now,\" the brand wrote.&#160;</p><p>\"I am an advocated and committed supporter of small businesses, and as an entrepreneur and designer, I hold creative liberty and ownership in the highest regard,\" Bernstein responded on Instagram.</p><p>Saks Fifth Avenue, Onia, Bernstein, WeWoreWhat, Carbon 38, and Shopbop did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.&#160;</p><p>WeWoreWhat has faced <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/danielle-bernstein-controversies-timeline-copying-designers-lawsuits-covid-19-2020-10\">allegations of copying smaller designers in the past</a>, including a face-mask design in July. Since starting her blog WeWoreWhat in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/danielle-bernstein-jade-myers-poshmark-swimwear-feud-2020-1\">Bernstein has released designs</a> that include overalls, swimwear, and more.

It's easy to see why, too. They're great for maintaining cardio fitness, preparing for road races like 2-milers or 5Ks, or serving as a complement to your weekly workout routine — especially for anyone who doesn't have time to always run outside.&#160;</p><p>Compared to other types of machines, treadmills are also incredibly simple to use. You just run or walk on the belt, and a motor moves it under your feet at whatever speed you select. But treadmills offer a whole host of different features that'll help you gain exactly the kinds of training and health benefits you need. Some treadmills are advanced, offering high-tech features like touchscreen displays and live-streamed classes, while others are more basic.</p><p>We've included a variety of treadmill types at a number of price points to help you find the best option for your needs.

It's made for tall or heavy runners looking a tough workout, but you'll pay more than $3,000 for the kind of quality that this 3G Cardio unit delivers.</p><p>It has an Ortho Flex Shock suspension system to minimize the stress of impact for runners, and the 22 by 62-inch platform is perfect for running.</p><p>The 3G Cardio comes with many pre-programmed workouts and a fitness level test.

With the Tread+, the company used that same tried-and-true formula to deliver a high-quality treadmill experience.&#160;</p><p>Where the Tread+ differs from traditional treadmills is both with its intuitive design and built-in display. On either arm of the unit are two dials, one to increase or decrease speed and another to increase or decrease the incline angle. Each dial turns smoothly enough that you're able to easily adjust either metric with the speed or incline quickly following suit.&#160;</p><p>Peloton's thoughtful design also extends to its low-impact slat belt that works well to absorb shock while also not being terribly loud as you run. This also means that it allows for a much smoother and comfortable run experience.</p><p>A Peloton workout unit wouldn't be complete without a massive display sitting front and center, and the Tread+ is no different, sporting a gorgeous 32-inch touchscreen monitor. The display is where the Peloton magic happens, as it's able to stream the live and pre-recorded classes, shows your in-class stats such as time and distance ran, and is your navigation tool for Peloton's content library. There's even a 20-watt built-in soundbar that flanks the bottom of the screen capable of pumping out impressive quality sound.&#160;</p><p>Then there's the price. Starting at $4,295 for the basic package, the Tread+ is no drop in the bucket. Factor in the recurring $39 subscription package for access to Peloton's content and you end up with quite the investment. Still, if you're able to afford it, the quality of the Tread, as well as the benefit of its workout and wide range of content, make it one of our favorite treadmills on the market.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros:&#160;</strong>Intuitive design, easy-to-use speed and incline dials, beautiful 32-inch touchscreen display with built-in soundbar, and access to Peloton's deep library of workout content</p><p><strong>Cons:&#160;</strong>Expensive initial investment and recurring subscription fee</p>\n\tThe best budget treadmill\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a53cc493225deb4198b4e5d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"treadmill\" height=\"743\" width=\"990\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Horizon Fitness</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Compared to other budget fold-up treadmills, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.horizonfitness.com%2Fhorizon-t101-treadmill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Horizon Fitness T101-04 Treadmill</a> has nice features and good performance.</h3><p>Saving space with a fold-up treadmill is a great idea for a lot of people.

They will have simple tracking features, such as speed, distance, and time. Most basic units will have a short bed that works better for a walker's stride than for running. And you'll find limited shock absorption features here, which isn't great for runners. Such treadmills will fold up for easy storage (although some more expensive treadmills also can fold up for storage).</li><li><strong>Mid-range: </strong>These treadmills will work for walkers or runners. For walkers, a mid-range treadmill should have longer support arms, allowing you to balance yourself easier. The belt bed will be a bit longer than the basic treadmill, but those with long running strides may still struggle. You'll see better tech features in this price range, including a heart rate monitor worn on the chest or pre-set training programs.</li><li><strong>Top-end: </strong>The highest quality of treadmills will contain long belt beds with good shock absorption, making them perfect for runners. To gain these features, such treadmills rarely will fold up for storage, meaning they require a lot of free space. They will deliver greater maximum speed levels and greater levels of incline, too. These treadmills will consist of the highest-quality materials. You'll receive Wi-Fi connectivity and extensive pre-set exercise programs with these models.</li></ul><h3>Key features of treadmills</h3><p>As treadmills evolved, companies began adding a suite of high-tech features. However, don't focus entirely on the bells and whistles of expensive treadmills. Pay attention to its physical parts, too, to find the best possible unit for your needs.</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 30px; font-family: Georgia,Times,sans-serif;\"><li><strong>Exercise programs: </strong>Treadmills may have pre-programmed workouts that can help you with weight loss, cardiovascular performance, speed workouts, or hills training. These programs will allow you to set the length of exercise time, but they will automatically change the speed of the treadmill and the incline to match the parameters of the pre-programmed workout.</li><li><strong>Horsepower: </strong>Any treadmill motor with a continuous duty measurement of at least 2.0 should be sufficient for most people, says <a href=\"https://www.precor.com/en-us/purchase-tools/buying-guides/treadmill-buying-guide-choose-right-treadmill-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Precor</a>. Smaller motors will work better for walkers and larger motors work better for runners.</li><li><strong>Incline and decline: </strong>To help with training for running on hills or for additional calorie burn, the treadmill needs to offer an incline. Most treadmills can reach at least a 12% incline grade. Some treadmills even give you a simulation of running downhill with a decline grade of around 3%.</li><li><strong>Length: </strong>Runners need a treadmill belt bed of roughly 55-60 inches long, while walkers can use one closer to 45-50 inches long. Taller people will need an even longer belt bed. Remember that the length of the treadmill isn't the same as the length of the bed. The treadmill length (and width, for that matter) must accommodate the base portion of the unit that doesn't move, as well as the bed's motor housing at the front of the unit.</li><li><strong>Safety line: </strong>Treadmills will contain a safety line that hooks into the unit. You'll clip the safety line to your shirt. Should you stumble, the safety line will disconnect from the treadmill, causing it to shut down immediately. This is a nice safety feature, and it prevents those common TV and movie gags where the person using the treadmill falls and gets launched into a wall. Trust us, this gag looks funny, but it also really, really hurts, so the safety line will save you some pain.</li><li><strong>Speed: </strong>The speed with which the bed rotates on the treadmill is measured in miles per hour. Most people don't need anything over 10 mph, but those seeking heavy-duty interval workouts can find speeds up to 15 mph in a top-end treadmill.</li><li><strong>Support rails: </strong>A treadmill made for walkers, especially elderly walkers, should have long support rails on the sides that you can grip while using the treadmill to steady yourself.</li><li><strong>Touch screen controls: </strong>You should be able to adjust the incline, speed, and program in use through the touchscreen monitor. The screen also gives you information on the time elapsed, calories burned, distanced traveled, your heart rate, and more.&#160;</li><li><strong>Weight limit: </strong>Based on the size of the motor and on the shock absorption capabilities, a treadmill may give you a maximum user weight recommendation.&#160;</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi connection: </strong>Through a Wi-Fi connection, you can gain access to simulated video workouts. Or you can play streaming movies on the display screen, giving you some entertainment as you're workout out on the treadmill.</li><li><strong>Width: </strong>A treadmill belt bed should be at least 22 inches wide for runners which provides plenty of space in case you have a misstep. Walkers can successfully use a narrower bed than runners, such as 18 or 20 inches.</li></ul>\n\tHow we test treadmills\n\t\n\t<p>Each treadmill featured in this guide went through a series of extensive tests (i.e. we ran on them &#8212;&#160;<em>a lot</em>) to see how well they compared across these four categories:&#160;<strong>Performance, features, quality,&#160;</strong>and&#160;<strong>value</strong>. Here's how each category specifically factored into which treadmills ended up making this guide:</p><p><strong>Performance:&#160;</strong>How a treadmill performs comes down to a few basic aspects, including how comfortable it is to run on (and how shock absorbing it is), if it's able to avoid sounding like you're loudly pounding the ground with each step, what its tread feels like underfoot, and how wide the running area is. Though not all treadmills reliably check each of these boxes, a healthy combination of at least three of those often translates to high quality.&#160;</p><p><strong>Features:&#160;</strong>Some modern treadmills, like those from Peloton or ProForm, feature a built-in interactive screen that streams workouts, tracks output metrics, and improves the treadmill's performance. For models that don't have a screen, we looked at how intuitive it was to increase and decrease the treadmill's speed and whether it offered an incline or decline mode. Even those that aren't decked out with the ability to stream workouts are still feature-heavy enough to warrant a spot in your home gym.</p><p><strong>Quality:&#160;</strong>If used often, treadmills can take a consistent beating, mostly due to a runner pounding on it step after step after step. This means the best treadmills should feature a sturdy and durable tread, a high-quality design that won't become compromised even after a full year or more of use, and that feature an interface or series of buttons and dials that can avoid popping off or being unusable.&#160;</p><p><strong>Value:&#160;</strong>The value of a treadmill is less about its sticker price and more so the combination of the three categories above compared to its initial (and sometimes recurring) investment. We factored in everything when selecting treadmills across each featured category and often feel that it's worth it to spend a little more money on a product that's designed to last than to spend less, more often on something inferior.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-treadmill'>Business

In 2016, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president\">carried the state by about 44,000 votes</a>, a margin of less than 1 percentage point, to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p><p>This year, Democrats focused on running up the score in the suburban counties around Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh. They also went toe-to-toe with Trump among the rural and non-college-educated voters they struggled to win in 2016.</p><p>Before Trump, a Republican presidential nominee had not won Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush narrowly secured the state in 1988.</p><p>While Trump led the vote count on election night, his lead significantly narrowed throughout last week as mail ballots pushed Biden over the top.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-ddhq-and-business-insider-called-the-election-for-biden-2020-11\"><em><strong>Read more: </strong>Why DDHQ and Insider called the election for Joe Biden</em></a></h3><section></section><p>The shift in the vote count as mail-in ballots were processed was particularly dramatic for two main reasons. First, Trump spent much of the pandemic denigrating voting by mail and falsely claiming that it is fraudulent and corrupt.

stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Scott Atlas, a coronavirus adviser to President Donald Trump, slammed Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday as \"a political animal,\" hours after the country's top infectious disease expert provided his latest verdict on the state of the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>Atlas made the comments during a nightly appearance on <a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6208873994001#sp=show-clips\">Fox News with host Laura Ingraham</a>, who claimed Fauci has taken on an \"upbeat\" tone toward the virus since Election Day.</p><p>She compared a clip of Fauci from late October in which he said the United States likely<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-coronavirus-us-wont-see-semblances-of-normality-until-2022-2020-10\">&#160;won't see \"semblances of normality\"</a> until 2022 to an interview of him on Tuesday when he predicted that a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-covid-19-vaccine-april-pfizer-healthcare-elderly-vulnerable-2020-11\">vaccine will hopefully be available </a>to Americans by April.&#160;</p><p>\"There's all kinds of prognostications that were made, all negative, all to undermine what the reality of the timelines were, all to undermine the president,\" Atlas said. \"Once you do that sort of thing and make yourself a political animal basically, you lose your credibility.\"</p><p>However, Fauci's remarks on a COVID-19 vaccine came after drugmaker Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-success-plans-for-emergency-approval-fda-2020-9?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">announced on Monday</a> that its coronavirus vaccine candidate completed its final stage of clinical trials with a 90% efficacy rate.&#160;</p><p>\"This is very good news looking forward,\" Fauci said <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-pfizer-vaccine-90-percent-efficacy-rate-extraordinary-2020-11\">on Monday</a>, adding that the results are \"extraordinary\" and \"have a major impact on everything that we do with regard to COVID.\"</p><p>Still, Atlas pushed back on Fauci, adding to a string of baseless attacks from the White House that public health officials and pharmaceutical companies are working against Trump to harm his political standing. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-claims-dr-fauci-is-a-democrat-no-evidence-2020-10\">falsely accused</a> Fauci of being a Democrat and called <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthony-fauci-donald-trump-coronavirus-restrictions-election-2020-10\">him a \"disaster,\"</a> as the two have often not seen eye-to-eye on the federal coronavirus response.&#160;</p><p>\"Well maybe [Fauci's] cheered up because of the election,\" Atlas said.</p><p>Atlas also repeated an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-conspiracy-theory-delay-election-day-2020-11\">unfounded claim</a> from Trump that Pfizer deliberately withheld coronavirus vaccine data from the public until after Election Day. Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-results\">lost the election</a> last week to President-elect Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-results\">Insider and Decision Desk HQ</a> projected on November 6.&#160;</p><p>Atlas frequently appeared on Fox News echoing the president's views on the pandemic before the Trump administration tapped him to join the White House coronavirus task force. Since his arrival in August, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-atlas-hits-back-critics-questioning-science-fauci-redfield-2020-10\">tensions between</a> him and Fauci, as well as task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, have escalated based on conflicting views on how to tackle the virus.</p><p>Atlas, who has no background in epidemiology, has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-adviser-is-pushing-white-house-to-adopt-herd-immunity-2020-8\">reportedly tried</a> to push a controversial \"herd immunity\" strategy, which Fauci and Birx have argued could potentially lead to higher death rates. A senior administration official previously told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html\">The Washington Post</a> that Atlas has positioned himself as an \"anti-Dr. Fauci.\"</p><p>Another Trump ally, Steve Bannon, also recently attacked Fauci and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-banned-twitter-fauci-and-wrays-heads-on-pikes-2020-11\">called for the beheading</a> of him and other government officials.&#160;</p><p>Fauci responded in <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/dr-anthony-fauci-about-covid-19-in-the-us/12874036\">an interview on Wednesday</a> that it's been \"very stressful\" helping manage the pandemic under the Trump administration.&#160;</p><p>\"When you have public figures like Bannon calling for your beheading, that's really kind of unusual,\" he said.&#160;\"But I've gotten through it by really focusing like a laser beam on exactly what my goal is. I'm a scientist and I'm a physician.\"</p><p>\"People calling for you to be beheaded, fired, thrown in the fire pit, or whatever, that's just noise. You don't pay attention to that,\" he added.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-advisor-scott-atlas-anthony-fauci-criticism-political-animal-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/U_zifEbP_gg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:22:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fac0c317f8f4200182a63d8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"72b83c520ae3160f28db7fcbaf95f31f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn92@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-08-116_f7c8902eb2c51724.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":30286,"destBytes":30286,"author":"oseddiq@insider.com (Oma Seddiq)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fac0c2eb09abb0018625f51?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn87@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-03-438_dd162360e8ed6599.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-05-069_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-07-682_18999bb34cc65f48.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-49-56-394_8b8346d8ae0efec9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn48@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-59-767_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U_zifEbP_gg:35A8gyskwn4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-04-472_8aa42ce1d9783e3b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/U_zifEbP_gg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-03-932_abff236a652aa1ed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156579271},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:39","title":"Of course Trump is trying to burn it all down.

He's golfing and seething and tweeting that the election was \"rigged.\" At the same time his public presidential <a href=\"https://t.co/JUEEmXf77J?amp=1\">schedule is empty</a>, and even though coronavirus cases are hitting record levels, he has not addressed the public in about a week. He <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-ghost-america-losing-election-joe-biden-inauguration-2020-11\">doesn't have the guts</a>.</p><p>Naturally, the Trump administration is recalcitrant as well. It is refusing to help Biden's team with the transition. It is reshuffling the Department of Defense in a way that is disturbing the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GenMhayden/status/1326346254092267520\">national security community</a>. And — just to add some pettiness to all of this — it is threatening to fire anyone on the inside <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/john-mcentee-trump-admin-new-jobs\">who starts looking for a job.</a> Harrowing, but again, totally expected from these people.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to win two special elections in Georgia in early January which will decide which party controls the Senate. So he's adding fuel to Trump's fire in an attempt to turn out the base, refusing to reject Trump's baseless legal challenges to the election, and further eroding America's faith in the democratic process. This could have a long term negative impact on our democracy, but that's fine for McConnell — which shouldn't surprise anyone.&#160;</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who is being investigated for <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/state-department-watchdog-pompeo-435753\">abusing his office</a> and spent this spring&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pompeo-spreads-wuhan-lab-coronavirus-conspiracy-get-trump-attention-2020-5\">spreading the lie</a> that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan — is being a bully. No surprise there. On Tuesday he crowed that we would have smooth transition to \"<a href=\"https://t.co/Gc9y1RivmE?amp=1\">a second Trump administration</a>,\" but now he seems to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1326309985031249926\">walking that back at bit</a>. Bullies often do that upon confrontation.</p><p>Attorney General Bill Barr — known for using legalese to make his <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-order-expand-white-house-perimeter-protesters/\">aggression as passive</a> as possible — wrote a letter allowing US Attorneys to \"pursue substantial allegations of voter fraud.\" It's unclear to legal experts whether it's a move that has any real teeth, but the head of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/10/933395215/head-of-doj-s-election-crimes-unit-steps-down-after-barr-oks-election-inquiries\">DOJ's Election Crimes Unit</a> stepped down shortly thereafter.</p><p>Jared Kushner is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crampell/status/1325504043985350658\">outsourcing</a> the brutal task of getting his father-in-law to accept reality to friends (much like the coronavirus response). And his wife Ivanka Trump — America's duchess of dissociation — is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump\">tweeting</a> as if nothing is wrong, like she just touched down here from another planet or something. All of this is extremely on brand for everyone.</p><p>But that predictability doesn't make it any less stressful in the moment, I understand that. Even though election officials around the country insist there was no <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=HomepageHomepage\">widespread malfeasance</a>, even though Trump's legal challenges look really thin, this tension could drag on until Inauguration Day on January 20.</p><p>There's a lot that could go wrong between now and then. Coronavirus cases are spiking in what experts are calling \"the most deadly\" phase of the virus. Changes at the Defense Department have some worried that our country could be vulnerable while Trump pitches his fit.

e-commerce companies that are set to thrive in a post-pandemic world, according to Stifel.</strong></li><li><a

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>No group of companies have benefited more from the COVID-19 pandemic than e-commerce companies, and there may still be ground left to gain.&#160;</p><p>The sector experienced a massive surge in business amid the pandemic as consumers shifted to online shopping in order to limit physical trips to traditional retail stores. In the second quarter of 2020, online&#160;shopping surged 44% compared to the prior year and represented more than 20% of all retail sales, according to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf\">data from the department of commerce.</a></p><p>But with this week's news of a successful <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-success-plans-for-emergency-approval-fda-2020-9\">COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNtech,</a> a return to normal is likely over the next six to nine months, according to Stifel.</p><p>In a note on Monday, the Wall Street firm said it expects the next three quarter to be rough for e-commerce stocks \"as investors begin to asses the sustainability of underlying trends amplified by COVID-19 and the approaching difficult comps starting in 2Q 2021.\"</p><p>But Stifel remains \"incredibly optimistic\" on these 6 e-commerce stocks despite a six-to-nine month headwind ahead, according to the note.</p><h2><strong>1. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock\">Amazon</a></strong></h2><p>\"Amazon has been a primary beneficiary of the pandemic given the increased penetration of e-commerce , helped by higher online grocery and consumables spend, and the continued dislocation in offline retail. Under a recovery scenario, we see Amazon continuing to benefit from these developments,\" Stifel said.</p><p>Prime users are continuing to shop at a greater frequency, and Stifel argues this trend is likely to remain in place given how sticky Amazon's Prime ecosystem is.&#160;</p><p>On top of that, Amazon's deep investments into the cloud will likely continue to bear fruit in 2021 given that the company highlighted an increase in the backlog of multiyear deals on its third quarter earnings call.</p><h2><strong>2. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ebay-stock\">eBay</a></strong></h2><p>\"Despite our expectations for decelerating volume growth, we believe management is focused on improving the core marketplace business and is developing new experiences to support growth and retain some of the new and reactivated customers brought to the platform in recent months. eBay has recently announced new initiatives in authentication and the development of a platform for refurbished items with some exclusive brand partnerships,\" Stifel said.</p><p>Stifel expects initiatives from eBay's new CEO, improvements to the buyer/seller experience, and the business opportunity from managed payments to support better-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the coming quarters, according to the note.</p><h2><strong>3. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/etsy-stock\">Etsy</a></strong></h2><p>\"We expect near-term volatility in shares as the company enters 2021, and expect a sizable deceleration in GMS growth under a vaccine scenario in the coming quarters. 2021 presents challenging comps in 2Q and 2H, compounded by a decline in facemask sales as the health crisis hopefully subsides,\" Stifel said.<strong><br></strong></p><p>Despite a challenging setup in 2021, \"we believe Etsy will continue to benefit from the meaningful increase in awareness and engagement brought on by the pandemic,\" Stifel said.</p><p>\"We would be buyers of extended weakness and believe ongoing investments in product improvements will support retention, though note that it will likely take many quarters for this dynamic to be fully realized,\" Stifel concluded.</p><h2><strong>4. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock\">Netflix</a></strong></h2><p>\"Netflix's business has benefited from the pandemic in several ways: some subscriber pull-forward effect, competitive consolidation, and content spend efficiencies.&#160;Thematic de-risking could lead to further near-term consolidation in shares, while risk such as the subscriber digestion period and price increase implementation will likely remain on the radar. We are comfortable with the long-term growth opportunity and could see an opportunity in Netflix shares should sentiment swing too far in the negative direction in the coming months/quarters,\" Stifel said.</p><h2><strong>5. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/pton-stock\">Peloton</a></strong></h2><p>\"From $100, we see room for a three-year double,\" Stifel said.</p><p>\"Peloton has been one of the marquee beneficiaries of pandemic-related shifts in consumer behavior and discretionary spending. The immediate reaction in Peloton shares on the Pfizer vaccine news makes sense, with shares down -20%,\" Stifel noted.</p><p>\"However, here is why we continue to recommend shares: we view the fitness industry as forever changed. Yes, consumers may gradually return to gyms, yoga centers, and other fitness-related clubs. But many former members may never opt to renew their expensive gym passes. The fitness industry has been disrupted and consumers are finding more economical, time-efficient ways to meet their fitness needs— enter Peloton,\" Stifel explained.</p><p>\"Moving into 2021 we think measured product launches and increasing international traction will carry estimates higher over time,\" Stifel said</p><h2><strong>6. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/w-stock\">Wayfair</a></strong></h2><p>\"Wayfair has benefited from increased spending on home categories as the pandemic has sparked housing turnover, increased nesting and forced a high degree of work/learn from home,\" Stifel explained, adding that it faces a tougher road ahead of all the other names.</p><p>\"Facing difficult compares in 2021, and having to produce heightened results against a backdrop of waning benefits from the short term factors of work/learn from home, the surge in housing turnover, and return primarily of offline (and online) competition could prove challenging. Our below consensus 2021 estimates still produce six 2019 holiday quarters. We do believe Wayfair will permanently benefit to some degree from the pandemic given the acceleration in the home category online,\" Stifel said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/ecommerce-companies-stocks-thrive-post-pandemic-world-stifel-says-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/H2aF5WFrKhU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:44:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f9b30856f5b310011724517?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"badbaf43180c3ebc8597cda01729a479","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-49-53-714_07634cc548de016c.webp","destWidth":1883,"destHeight":1412,"sourceBytes":94068,"destBytes":94068,"author":"mfox@businessinsider.com (Matthew Fox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f808b224c3b2e0019bba2be?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn71@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-05-802_c84d86152e993fc7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-05-069_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-04-668_ec04a33761a18ee5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn76@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-04-836_d6232079d26741d7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn48@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-59-767_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=H2aF5WFrKhU:jHk_rMgUmjQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-49-56-809_3798d0edd9bcfb8b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/H2aF5WFrKhU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-49-54-901_7e7312a3f678c622.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156579269},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:39","title":"YouTube says everything is working again after users experienced a worldwide outage Wednesday evening","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-down-outage-company-aware-fixing-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e6fc98cc48540084b7a1223?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Youtube logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

It indicates the levels of cash available and how quickly a financial asset or security can be converted into cash without losing significant value. In other words, how long it takes to sell.&#160;</p><p>Liquidity is important because it shows how flexible a company is in meeting its financial obligations and unexpected costs. It also applies to the average individual as well. The greater their liquid assets (cash savings and investment portfolio) compared to their debts, the better their financial situation.</p><h2>Types of liquidity</h2><p>Liquidity comes in two basic forms: market liquidity, which applies to investments and assets, and accounting liquidity, which applies to corporate or personal finances.</p><h3>Market liquidity</h3><p>Market liquidity refers to the liquidity of an asset and how quickly it can be turned into cash. In effect, how marketable it is, at prices that are stable and transparent.&#160;</p><p>High market liquidity means that there is a high supply and a high demand for an asset and that there will always be sellers and buyers for that asset. If someone wants to sell an asset yet there is no one to buy it, then it cannot be liquid.&#160;</p><p>Liquidity is not the same thing as profitability. Shares of a publicly traded company, for example, are liquid: They can be sold quickly on a stock exchange, even if they have dropped in value. There will always be someone to buy them.&#160;</p><p>When investing, it is important for an investor to bear in mind the liquidity of a particular asset or security. Among investments and financial vehicles, the most liquid assets include:</p><ul><li>Savings/money market accounts</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-blue-chip-stocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stocks traded on major exchanges</a> and exchange-traded funds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-treasury-bonds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US government bonds</a></li><li>Commercial paper</li><li>Other short-term money-market securities</li></ul><p>These all can be sold quickly at their fair value in return for cash.&#160;</p><p>Examples of illiquid assets, or those that can not be converted to cash quickly, tend to be tangible things, like real estate and fine art. They also include securities that trade on foreign stock exchanges, or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-penny-stocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">penny stocks</a>, which trade over the counter.&#160;</p><p>These items all take a long time to sell.</p><h3>Accounting liquidity</h3><p>Accounting liquidity refers to a company's or a person's ability to meet their financial obligations — aka the money they owe on an ongoing basis.&#160;</p><p>With individuals, figuring liquidity is a matter of comparing their debts to the amount of cash they have in the bank or the marketable securities in their investment accounts.&#160;</p><p>With companies, it gets a tad more complex. Liquidity takes a look at a company's current assets versus its current liabilities.</p><h2>Why liquidity is important</h2><p>The higher their liquidity, the better the financial health of a business or a person is.&#160;</p><p>For example, say a company had a monthly loan payment of $5,000. Its sales are doing well and the company is realizing profits. It has no issues in meeting its $5,000 monthly obligation.</p><p>Now say the economy suffered a sudden economic downturn. Demand for the business's products has vanished so, therefore, it is not bringing in revenue and making profits; however, it still has to meet its $5,000 monthly loan bill.&#160;</p><p>Unfortunately, the company only has $3,000 of cash on hand and no liquid assets to quickly sell for cash. It will default on its loan within one month. Now if the company had $10,000 in cash and other liquid assets worth $15,000 that it could sell in a few days for cash, it would be able to meet its debt obligations for many months to come, hopefully until the economy rebounds.&#160;</p><p>The same holds for human beings. The more savings an individual has the easier it is for them to pay their debts, such as their mortgage, car loan, or credit card bills. This particularly rings true if the individual loses their job and immediate source of new income. The more cash they have on hand and more liquid assets they can sell for cash, the easier it will be for them to continue to make their debt payments while they look for a new job.</p><h2>Determining a company's liquidity</h2><p>Three liquidity ratios are primarily used to measure a company's accounting liquidity:</p><ul><li>Current ratio</li><li>Quick ratio</li><li>Cash ratio</li></ul><h3>Current ratio basics</h3><p>The current ratio, also known as the working capital ratio,&#160;seeks to determine a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations that are due within a year. It is calculated as:</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa97fc4f7d1cb0019e3a8f3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the current or working capital ratio\" height=\"719\" width=\"1668\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The current ratio is one of the simplest liquidity measures.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The higher the ratio, the better a company's financial health is and the stronger its ability to meet its financial obligations.</p><p>For example, if a company has current assets of $3 million and current liabilities of $2 million, it will have a current ratio of 3/2 = 1.5. Now, if it has current assets of $8 million and current liabilities remain at $2 million, it will have a current ratio of 8/2 = 4.&#160;</p><h3>Quick ratio basics</h3><p>The quick ratio, aka the acid test ratio, also measures current assets against current liabilities.&#160;</p><p>However, in its calculation of current assets, it only uses the most liquid assets: cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. It does not include inventory, which the current ratio does, as inventory cannot be sold as quickly as the other assets.</p><p>There are actually two formulas for the quick ratio:</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa97fda1df1d500182199c5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the 2 quick ratios\" height=\"1354\" width=\"1668\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Quick ratios limit what&#39;s considered in calculating liquidity.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Again, the higher the ratio, the better a company is situated to meet its financial obligations.</p><h3>Cash ratio basics</h3><p>The cash ratio is an even more stringent ratio than the quick ratio. It compares <em>only </em>cash to current liabilities. If a company can meet its financial obligations through just cash without the need to sell any other assets, it is an extremely strong financial position.</p><p>The cash ratio is calculated as:</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa97fe7f7d1cb0019e3a8f6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the cash ratio\" height=\"719\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The cash ratio applies the strictest standard to liquidity.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What liquidity ratios can tell you</h2><p>A company's liquidity can be a key factor in deciding whether to invest in its stock or buy its corporate bonds.</p><p>High liquidity ratios indicate a company is on a strong financial footing to pay its debt. Low liquidity ratios indicate that a company has a higher likelihood of defaulting, particularly if there is a downturn in its specific market or the overall economy.</p><p>Whatever the ratio you're using:&#160;</p><ul><li>A value of 1 indicates that a company has current assets equal to current liabilities.&#160;</li><li>A value above 1 indicates that a company has more current assets than current liabilities.&#160;</li><li>A value below 1 indicates that a company has more current liabilities than current assets and is not in a position to meet its financial obligations.&#160;</li></ul><p>(For the cash ratio the values would relate to just cash as opposed to all current assets.)</p><p>When comparing liquidity ratios, it is important to only compare companies within the same industry. This is because every type of industry is going to have different asset and debt requirements.</p><p>For example, a technology company does not operate the same as an airline company. The tech firm might need to buy computers and office space, while an airline needs to buy planes, a large labor force, and jet fuel. So it's natural for an airline company to carry higher levels of debt.</p><p>Financial analyst reports on companies often include liquidity ratios. Otherwise, an investor might have to calculate it themselves, using the info reported on a company's financial statements or in its annual report.</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>Liquidity refers to the amount of money an individual or corporation has on hand and the ability to quickly convert assets into cash. The higher the liquidity, the easier it is to meet financial obligations, whether you're a business or a human being.</p><p>If a person has more savings than they do debt, it means they are more financially liquid.</p><p>Companies with higher levels of cash and assets that can be readily converted to cash indicate a strong financial position as they have the ability to meet their debts and expenses, and, therefore, are better investments.&#160;</p><p>The liquidity of a particular investment is important as it indicates the level of supply and demand of that security or asset — and how quickly it can be sold for cash when needed.&#160;</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-volatility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volatility measures how dramatically stock prices change, and it can influence when, where, and how you invest</a></h3><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-diversification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-position=\"3\" data-analytics-module=\"featured_post\">What is diversification?
