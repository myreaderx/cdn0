Starting today, we’re excited to officially begin inviting Google Play Music listeners to effortlessly transfer their music libraries, personal taste preferences and playlists to YouTube Music, their new home for music listening and discovery.   <br /><br />For now, users will continue to have access to both services. We want to ensure everyone has time to transfer their content and get used to YouTube Music, so we’ll provide plenty of notice ahead of users no longer having access to Google Play Music later this year. <br /><br /><h3>Easy transfer and transition  </h3><br />We know many listeners have spent a lot of time creating their perfect music and podcast libraries in Google Play Music, so we’ve made it simple to move both to their new homes. All Google Play Music users will soon receive an email with detailed instructions on how to begin transferring your full Google Play Music history and content, as well as podcasts, to their new homes.  <br /><br />Music fans will be able to start the transfer process of their music library to YouTube Music by following these simple steps: <br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Download the YouTube Music app (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube-music/id1017492454\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a>/<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>).</li></ul><ul><li>Click on the transfer button in YouTube Music, and your uploads, purchases, added songs and albums, personal and subscribed playlists, likes and dislikes, curated stations and personal taste preferences will move right over.</li></ul><ul><li>Your updated recommendations will appear immediately on the YouTube Music home screen, and we’ll notify you via email and notifications when your music library transfer is complete and your music is in the “Library” tab. </li></ul><br /><br />You can also check out the video with transfer details <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWIDd7WK_cU\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>. <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HCccPdlnvas/XroOJDfjHOI/AAAAAAAAAys/F-yXOU0zAC4vaUCqru4g8GoAPKS-IKVWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/GPM_PhoneComposite_StepByStep_2560x1440_alt.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HCccPdlnvas/XroOJDfjHOI/AAAAAAAAAys/F-yXOU0zAC4vaUCqru4g8GoAPKS-IKVWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/GPM_PhoneComposite_StepByStep_2560x1440_alt.jpg\" /></a></div><br /><br />And if you’re a podcast listener, you can visit this <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/transfer\" target=\"_blank\">web page</a> and transfer your subscriptions and episode progress to Google Podcasts with a single click.

We’ve just passed the three-year mark, so I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on how we’re thinking about YouTube TV.<br /><br />Since launch, we’ve listened to your feedback and worked to build an experience that fits the needs of everyone in your family, by adding highly-requested content like<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/about/blogs/news/pbs-member-stations-now-live-on-youtube-tv/\" target=\"_blank\"> PBS</a> and <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/04/updates-to-youtube-tv-more-content-new-price.html\" target=\"_blank\">Discovery Network</a> brands, including HGTV and Food Network, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1205608388283060224\" target=\"_blank\">launching</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1207057960725295107\" target=\"_blank\">new</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1212810846780502016\" target=\"_blank\">features</a> to reinvent how you watch live TV.  <br /><br />As we continue to build a best-in-class experience for you, we have a few updates to share: new content launching today, new features we’ve recently introduced, and an updated price.  <br /><br /><h3>More content to enjoy, starting today </h3><br />Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200507005293/en/ViacomCBS-Google-Announce-Expanded-Distribution-Agreement\" target=\"_blank\">we let you know</a> that we’d soon be adding more of ViacomCBS’s family of brands to YouTube TV, which includes 8 of your favorite channels launching today: BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, TV Land and VH1.  <br /><br />That means you can follow the biggest stories in news, politics and pop culture with “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah;” catch up with Catelynn, Cheyenne, Maci, Mackenzie and Amber on “Teen Mom OG;” join the search for America’s next drag superstar with “RuPaul’s Drag Race;” go on an adventure with “SpongeBob SquarePants;” and follow the fictional lives of the Dutton family on the new season of “Yellowstone,” airing now.    <br /><br />BET Her, MTV2, MTV Classic, Nick Jr., NickToons, and TeenNick are also set to come to YouTube TV at a later date.  <br /><br />In addition to our base plan of now more than 85+ channels, we also recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1265733378357297153\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> Cinemax and HBO Max, which includes all of HBO plus a robust library of content and original series, to our growing list of add-on channels, making YouTube TV your one-stop shop for entertainment. <br /><br /><h3>The latest features to try while you sit back with your favorite shows </h3><br />We’re always listening to our member’s feedback on the channels they want to see on YouTube TV, but we’re also continuously building new features and making improvements that reinvent how you watch TV and interact with your favorite content on YouTube TV. Here are just a few of those features and updates we’ve launched recently: <br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Jump to the news that matters most to you: </b>We’ve been testing a new feature that allows you to jump to various segments within select news programs on YouTube TV, and have just brought this to all users. Similar to our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1205608388283060224\" target=\"_blank\">key plays view</a> for sports, on some programs you’ll be able to jump to specific news clips within the complete recording. This feature is available on TV screens now and will come to mobile devices in the coming weeks.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Control over your recorded content: </b>In addition to your unlimited DVR space, YouTube TV members can pause, rewind, and fast forward through all their recorded shows, regardless of network.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Go easy on the eyes with Dark Mode: </b>We recently introduced a dark theme to both desktop and mobile devices to help tone down your screen’s glare and experience YouTube TV with a dark background.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Mark a show as watched:</b> You now have an option to select “Mark as Watched” on desktop and mobile devices for any TV show you’ve already seen, a top requested feature from our members.</li></ul><ul><li><b>A fresh new look for the Live Guide:</b> Based on your feedback, we’ve updated the Live Guide on desktop so you can see what’s on, now, and also scroll ahead 7 days into the future.  </li></ul><br /><br /><h3>An update to your price </h3><br />As we continue to evaluate how to provide the best possible service and content for you, our membership price will be $64.99. This new price takes effect today, June 30, for new members. Existing subscribers will see these changes reflected in their subsequent billing cycle on or after July 30. <br /><br />We don’t take these decisions lightly, and realize how hard this is for our members. That said, this new price reflects the rising cost of content and we also believe it reflects the complete value of YouTube TV, from our breadth of content to the features that are changing how we watch live TV. YouTube TV is the only streaming service that includes a DVR with unlimited storage space, plus 6 accounts per household each with its own unique recommendations, and 3 concurrent streams. It's all included in the base cost of YouTube TV, with no contract and no hidden fees. <br /><br />While we would love every member to continue to stay with our service, we understand that some of you may choose to pause or cancel your membership. We want to make YouTube TV flexible for you, so members can pause or cancel anytime <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/settings/subscriptions?setac=cancel_choice\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.  <br /><br />As the streaming industry continues to evolve, we are working to build new flexible models for YouTube TV users, so we can continue to provide a robust and innovative experience for everyone in your household without the commitments of traditional TV. <br /><br />Thank you for being a part of the YouTube TV family. We’ll continue to work to make it the best place to watch live TV, how you want it. <br /><br /><i>Christian Oestlien, Vice President of Product Management, YouTube TV </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=1whWtVeqN8Q:T0PzFM_I67E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=1whWtVeqN8Q:T0PzFM_I67E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=1whWtVeqN8Q:T0PzFM_I67E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/1whWtVeqN8Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:30:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"b3652e33264176228e83f26c410e1195","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=1whWtVeqN8Q:T0PzFM_I67E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-41-35-084_bf43a10dfec15478.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/1whWtVeqN8Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn6@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-41-35-084_d5d32f7ccde5c4ba.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605652},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"2020 Brandcast Delivered: A NewFront Just for You","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/2rDD4ho9ehQ/brandcast-newfront-just-for-you.html","description":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LsJENhxhr4Q/XvO8BZbE5JI/AAAAAAAAA0E/uFEwciiwnVIrNBNPNkTOnDyiUqJHoGRQwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/BC-Delivered-black-RGB.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"542\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"108\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LsJENhxhr4Q/XvO8BZbE5JI/AAAAAAAAA0E/uFEwciiwnVIrNBNPNkTOnDyiUqJHoGRQwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/BC-Delivered-black-RGB.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><br />People are streaming more than ever before. But one thing remains consistent: When they’re looking for something personally relevant to them, they turn to YouTube. <br /><br />Whether it’s celebrating this year’s graduating class with the likes of President and Mrs. Obama, Beyoncé and BTS in YouTube Originals’ “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxpTjcouaeQ\" target=\"_blank\">Dear Class of 2020</a>,” reminiscing over Game 6 of the 1993 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/NBA\" target=\"_blank\">NBA</a> finals or attempting quarantine glow-ups from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q\" target=\"_blank\">James Charles</a>,&nbsp;YouTube’s extensive video library creates a truly meaningful and personal experience for viewers. <br /><br />And, this year more than ever, we’re seeing people make time for what matters. On June 13, viewers tuned in to watch “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CV4DOdeFxU\" target=\"_blank\">Bear Witness, Take Action</a>,” a YouTube Originals live stream that assembled artists and activists to learn, heal and raise awareness for the Equal Justice Initiative. This was part of a new multi-year, $100 million-dollar fund to help amplify the voices and stories of Black Creators.  <br /><br />Today, at our ninth annual NewFront event, we celebrated moments like these through a more personal experience for brands and advertisers with “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://youtube.com/forbrands&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1593035236381000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPCDwDhU1AVpYXl0YhKdiqCTMldw\" target=\"_blank\">Brandcast Delivered</a>.” <br /><br />Throughout the completely reimagined virtual event, we celebrated the diversity of YouTube’s voices and content.

While YouTube overall reaches more people age 18-49 than all linear TV networks combined,<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">4</span></sup> we’ve seen a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/youtube-streaming-trends-features/\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic shift </a>in viewing patterns, as people increasingly watch on connected TVs. In the U.S. alone, over 100 million people watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month.<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">5</span></sup> And, according to Comscore, YouTube makes up 41% of ad-supported video streaming watch time.<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">6</span></sup>    <br /><br />Last month, we <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/introducing-youtube-select/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> YouTube Select — a reimagination of Google Preferred — to make it easier to reach your audiences where they are watching, and find the right <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/introducing-youtube-select/\" target=\"_blank\">content </a>for your brand. YouTube Select includes the same popular creator content, plus a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQwGUPDdOOc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">streaming TV lineup</a> that combines the best of YouTube TV and core lineups content, both on TV screens.  <br /><br />YouTube Select also includes YouTube Originals programming, including the breakout hit, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaqxtzLg4Cw&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Influencer with James Charles</a>,” which hit over 50 million views in its first month alone;<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">7</span></sup> “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAXahAh0ChY&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Retro Tech</a>,” featuring tech guru Marques Brownlee; and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb3k0x_Qrg0&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Liza on Demand</a>.” And they’re all returning for new seasons. <br /><br />Additionally, today we announced that Demi Lovato will be returning for a new YouTube Originals project. Demi’s new docuseries will be a follow-up to her 2017 documentary, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWTlL_w8cRA\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Complicated</a>,”which will bring you on her personal and musical journey over the last three years. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/davidblaine\" target=\"_blank\">David Blaine</a> will also be joining the YouTube Originals slate with a first-of-its-kind special event. We are excited to share more on these shows, among many others, throughout the year. <br /><br /><h3>Uncover new audience insights and convert demand into action </h3><br />YouTube has become an important part of the modern purchase journey with 70 percent of YouTube viewers saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on our platform.<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">8</span></sup> We’re introducing tools to help marketers understand their audience, as well as complement their awareness initiatives with campaigns that drive conversions. <br /><br />As people turn to YouTube to discover their next purchase, we’re also seeing an increase in conversions from ads on the platform. In the last twelve months, we’ve been able to help our customers achieve over 950 million conversions<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">9</span></sup> – generating quality leads, boosting web traffic, and achieving new sales on YouTube.  <br /><br /><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads/new-ways-to-drive-action\" target=\"_blank\">Last week</a>, we announced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee63ZSUGGSU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Video action campaigns</a>, a simpler and more cost-effective way to drive action on YouTube. It automatically brings video ads that drive action to the YouTube home feed, watch pages, and Google video partner — all within one campaign.

In turn, this creates a valuable opportunity for brands to reach new audiences on YouTube and partner with creators to amplify their message. Over the years, we’ve seen branded content grow on YouTube, thanks to the direct connection creators have with their fans. In fact, the influencer marketing industry as a whole is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to reach $15 billion by 2022.  <br /><br />Given the success our brands and creators have seen with branded content on YouTube, we are evolving FameBit to YouTube BrandConnect. <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9ludkUThWb8/XugVkHwJxoI/AAAAAAAAAzE/aw2ATKLVeq4nOceSNtYNz2j6WjQL7GfSACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/YouTube_connect_transition_V01.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"450\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9ludkUThWb8/XugVkHwJxoI/AAAAAAAAAzE/aw2ATKLVeq4nOceSNtYNz2j6WjQL7GfSACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/YouTube_connect_transition_V01.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3>What YouTube BrandConnect offers </h3><br />Through YouTube BrandConnect, we’re making it easier for creators and brands to create branded content that is both authentic and effective. Our focus will continue to be supporting and driving revenue to creators, providing measurable campaigns for brands, and reaching viewers with authentic and relevant content. We’ve built unique, industry-first features within our branded content platform to support each of these goals.  <br /><br />On the creator side, we’ve developed insights-based matchmaking tools that allow more access to branded content deals for eligible creators across YouTube. Because of the connection that creators have with their fans, our proactive matchmaking produces highly engaging and relevant branded content. And it’s working - over the past two years, average deal size across the full service product grew more than 260%. <br /><br />YouTube creators have a real-time pulse on their community and have the flexibility to pivot their content to serve audience (and brand) needs, something we’re seeing firsthand right now. For example, the Reese’s brand’s March Madness campaign took a turn when the annual basketball tournament was cancelled due to the pandemic. Creators including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihc7wrKL0a8&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">2Hype</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdAd8XkV9RA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Smosh Pit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDo6Uj9jFHA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Eh Bee Family</a> were able to adapt their previously-shot content to still bring a relevant vibe to fans at home, while driving strong consumer engagement and awareness for Reese’s Miniature Cups newly designed packaging, which was perfect for a stay-at-home game of couch basketball. <br /><br />For brands, we’ve added new measurement solutions like Brand Interest Lift, Influencer Lift, and organic view-through conversations that provide them with real-time campaign results and bring the accountability of digital advertising to branded content campaigns. Brand Interest Lift allows advertisers to measure consumer search behavior resulting from viewing the creator’s video, and Influencer Lift measures consumer sentiment on Purchase Intent, Brand Recall, and more. Through Google insights and tools, it is possible for brands to measure the impact and ROI of influencer marketing for the first time on YouTube.  <br /><br />We’ve also introduced several ads technology innovations such as the shopping shelf and app shelf to help viewers buy products and download apps being discussed in creators' videos directly from the watch page. This will soon expand to a new media shelf, where viewers can buy or rent movies and shows. We’ve also introduced new technologies like the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/immersive-branded-experiences-youtube-and-display-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">AR try-on experience</a> that allow viewers to virtually try on and shop products, alongside their favorite creators.  <br /><br />Eligible creators in the U.S. with 25,000+ subscribers will be able to sign up for YouTube BrandConnect directly in YouTube Studio, where we’ll be adding more campaign management features in the coming months. With YouTube BrandConnect, brands can easily connect and measure branded content campaigns with their Google and YouTube advertising strategies - allowing for full-funnel influencer marketing integrations. <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--As7b_FOyTI/XugVrMv-CsI/AAAAAAAAAzI/5v_n0y9hhRMMc8qrsN8ScdoymQ85auwpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/BrandConnectReStudio.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1225\" data-original-width=\"1128\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--As7b_FOyTI/XugVrMv-CsI/AAAAAAAAAzI/5v_n0y9hhRMMc8qrsN8ScdoymQ85auwpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/BrandConnectReStudio.png\" width=\"589\" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3>Looking forward with YouTube BrandConnect </h3><br />We’re always looking for new ways to help creators earn more money, and we’ve added additional resources to help creators get started making branded content on <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/branded-content\" target=\"_blank\">Creator Academy</a>.

Over the last few years, we’ve increased our efforts to make YouTube a more reliable source for news and information, as well as an open platform for healthy political discourse. Here is an overview of how this work helps us to better support elections. <br /><br /><h3>Remove election-related content that violates our policies </h3><br />Our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Community Guidelines</a> provide clear guidance on content that is not allowed on YouTube. One common question we get is how these policies apply to election-related content. Here are some examples of where our established <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">deceptive practices policies</a> apply: <br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm; for example, a video that has been technically manipulated to make it appear that a government official is dead.</li><li>Content that aims to mislead people about voting or the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-google-and-youtube-are-working-protect-2020-us-census/\" target=\"_blank\">census processes</a>, like telling viewers an incorrect voting date.</li><li>Content that advances false claims related to the technical eligibility requirements for current political candidates and sitting elected government officials to serve in office, such as claims that a candidate is not eligible to hold office based on false information about citizenship status requirements to hold office in that country. </li></ul><br /><br />Additionally, we terminate channels that: <br /><br /><br /><ul><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801947?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Attempt to impersonate</a> another person or channel, misrepresent their country of origin, or conceal their association with a government actor.</li><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Artificially increase</a> the number of views, likes, comments, or other metric either through the use of automatic systems or by serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. </li></ul><br /><br />As always, we enforce our policies consistently, without regard to a video’s political viewpoint. <br /><br />The best way to quickly remove content is to stay ahead of new technologies and tactics that could be used by malicious actors, including technically-manipulated content. We also heavily invest in research and development. In 2018, we formed an Intelligence Desk to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content and problematic behaviors, and to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they become a larger issue. For example, in 2018, as a result of the Intelligence Desk’s work to detect the evolving online tactics and impending statements of terrorist organizations, we shared 100,000 digital fingerprints (also known as hashes) of terror content to the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism’s hash-sharing database. <br /><br />To combat foreign and domestic coordinated influence operations looking to interfere in electoral processes, we coordinate closely with <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/threat-analysis-group/protecting-users-government-backed-hacking-and-disinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Threat Analysis Group</a> (TAG) to identify bad actors and terminate their channels and accounts. Through TAG, we work with other technology companies to share intelligence and best practices, and share threat information with law enforcement. <br /><br /><h3>Raise up authoritative election news </h3><br />Political news and events can be subject to misinformation, so the availability of quality information sources is crucial. That’s why we <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/12/the-four-rs-of-responsibility-raise-and-reduce.html\" target=\"_blank\">raise up authoritative voices</a>, including news sources, for news and information in search results and “watch next” panels. Millions of search queries and recommendations are getting this authoritative ranking treatment today, and we're continuing to improve and expand our systems. <br /><br />Additionally, we <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/07/building-better-news-experience-on.html\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> Top News and Breaking News shelves to highlight quality journalism, as well as <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7630512?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">information panels</a> that indicate funding sources below videos from publishers that receive public or government funding. During breaking news events, we provide short previews of text-based news articles in search results, along with a reminder that developing news can rapidly change. Because of all these efforts, last year we saw consumption of content from authoritative news partners’ channels grow by 60%. <br /><br />For the 2018 U.S. midterm and the 2019 EU Parliamentary elections, when users searched for a candidate on YouTube, we surfaced an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9004474?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">information panel</a> with additional information about that candidate—for example, party affiliation and district—above search results. We also highlighted the official YouTube channels of candidates when available. We will have a similar feature for candidates in the 2020 U.S. elections in the coming months. <br /><br /><h3>Reduce the spread of election misinformation </h3><br />Content that comes close to violating our Community Guidelines is a fraction of 1% of what’s watched on YouTube in the U.S. To reduce this even further, in January 2019, we launched <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/01/continuing-our-work-to-improve.html\" target=\"_blank\">changes</a> to our recommendations systems to limit the spread of harmful misinformation and borderline content. The result is a 70% average drop in watch time of this content coming from non-subscribed recommendations in the U.S. These changes are now implemented in the U.S. and other English-language markets, and we’ve begun expanding this effort to non-English-language markets, helping us reduce recommendations of borderline content, including election-related misinformation, around the world. <br /><br /><h3>Recognize and reward campaigns, candidates, and political creators </h3><br />Politicians, commentators and news publishers can access a suite of YouTube features and resources, including support from our partnerships team. These specialists work with news organizations, political creators and candidates on both sides of the aisle to optimize their presence on YouTube, helping them  more effectively reach viewers, engage their community and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/new-advanced-protection-program-account-security-instant/\" target=\"_blank\">keep their accounts secure</a>. <br /><br />In addition to our work at YouTube to support elections, other teams at Google are also <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/supporting-2020-us-election\" target=\"_blank\">working hard</a> ahead of Election Day—including by expanding our political advertising policies to provide users with even more <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">visibility</a> into who is buying election ads on YouTube, Google, and partner properties. YouTube remains committed to maintaining the balance of openness and responsibility, before, during and after the 2020 U.S. election. We’ll have even more to share on this work in the coming months. <br /><br /><i>Leslie Miller, VP of Government Affairs &amp; Public Policy, YouTube </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=JljeiBXZlUk:-xfPxfPBoBs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=JljeiBXZlUk:-xfPxfPBoBs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=JljeiBXZlUk:-xfPxfPBoBs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/JljeiBXZlUk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"f1f90a8b83b93a3522fdca613ac3266c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=JljeiBXZlUk:-xfPxfPBoBs:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-41-34-178_9b71dc328f60726e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/JljeiBXZlUk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn74@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-41-34-105_ec24e8e47b22c4b6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605659},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"We hosted a virtual Iftar this Ramadan on YouTube, bringing together a global community","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/6_4PHoboeJY/we-hosted-virtual-iftar-this-ramadan-on.html","description":"Like millions of families around the world, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/mmoshaya\" target=\"_blank\">my family and I</a> have been breaking our fast this Ramadan in the safety of our own home in the sunny city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia — something I am very grateful for. Although I love my family, and I am thankful to have them here with me this Ramadan, something was still missing.  <br /><br />So I reached out to a few of my friends (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/honga1st\" target=\"_blank\">Omar Hussein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChOPyo-uWLVi5uO53mSBX-w\" target=\"_blank\">Noor Stars</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thesaudireporters\" target=\"_blank\">Saudi Reporters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DramaQueen7373\" target=\"_blank\">Asrar Aref</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJNTGwKmgMCwfYDbnz514Q\" target=\"_blank\">Anasala Family</a>) and asked them if they wanted to come over for Iftar, and to bring millions of their friends with them.  <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pe9Z9ZhXUvs\" width=\"560\"></iframe> </div><br /><br />On Tuesday, May 19, we decided to break our fast together at 6:32 p.m. — sunset in Saudi Arabia. We played games, showed-off our cooking skills, and finally broke our fast along with thousands of people who joined us from across the country and beyond.  <br /><br />What’s incredible is that people all around the world have been trying to find innovative ways to create that sense of togetherness during the holy month while staying safe. Earlier this month, creators in Indonesia came together and hosted a virtual Iftar, bringing together people from all over the country. Also next week, on May 26 at 8 p.m. EEST, Arab popstar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnf7fs7mlfbzsJpwWnJBYA\" target=\"_blank\">Nancy Ajram</a> is going to host a special <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP1X_uwwM44\" target=\"_blank\">Eid celebration concert </a>on her YouTube channel.  <br /><br />I am proud I got to be part of this incredible experience that showed the world the power of YouTube and the creator community. Bringing this many people together during this difficult time is truly rewarding.  <br /><br />From all of us, we wish you a Ramadan Kareem and a blessed Eid ahead.  <br /><br /><i>Mohamed Moshaya, YouTube Creator based in Saudi Arabia  </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=6_4PHoboeJY:4H4Vs2mjRuQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=6_4PHoboeJY:4H4Vs2mjRuQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=6_4PHoboeJY:4H4Vs2mjRuQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/6_4PHoboeJY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"baa7028bfad1eee30aa7a247b4d3b518","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=6_4PHoboeJY:4H4Vs2mjRuQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-41-34-135_98307537a7d664a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/6_4PHoboeJY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-41-35-046_a761d4926f11766b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605657},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"YouTube Originals announces new documentary, “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert.\" Premieres March 31.","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/SlFcCd0baFc/youtube-originals-coachella-documentary.html","description":"In celebration of Coachella's 20th anniversary, YouTube Originals is partnering with Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival for a feature-length documentary, “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert.” It is set to premiere March 31.

They make this community the best that it can be. <br /><br />Here are nine women, from around the globe, who inspire us with their creative and entrepreneurial spirit. They’re teachers, leaders and artists. They’re often in traditionally male-driven communities, breaking glass ceilings, everywhere they go. We’re proud to feature some of their answers to our Q&amp;A, and we’re so, so lucky to call them YouTubers. <br /><br /><h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/rachanaphadke\" target=\"_blank\">Rachana Phadke Ranade</a></h3><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xn7KWR9EOGQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div></div><br />Rachana is a chartered accountant, faculty member at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, trained in Indian classical music, a mom, and is at the helm of a 400K+ strong YouTube channel, where she educates her viewers on finance, business, and markets. Her channel team has grown from two people to five, including researchers and a video producer.  <br /><br />A NextUp Women to Watch winner in India, she's passionate about equipping women to be financially independent. She’s one of the few creators in a traditionally male-driven arena of financial education in India.   <br /><br /><b>YT:&nbsp;What are you most proud of from your work on YouTube? </b><br /><b><br /></b><b>Rachana:</b> “I feel proud of the fact that my most viewed lecture on Youtube which has crossed 2.4 million views is a 1.5 hours lecture! Encouraging people to click on such a long lecture and keeping them glued to it for a substantial time makes me feel really good. <br /><br />I also feel proud that people from the Indian Navy, Indian Airforce and Indian Army also watch my lectures. I have received many comments from them on many of my videos! So, I feel proud of the fact that I am able to serve those who serve our nation!” <br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>2.

Emma created mmmEnglish to help her students learn while she wasn’t teaching. The channel took off quickly, and Emma saw the opportunity to build a business helping people learn English, using YouTube to reach an engaged global audience.  <br /><br /><b>YT: What are you most proud of from your work on YouTube? </b><br /><br /><b>Emma:</b> “YouTube has been the catalyst that has taken my career and my life in a new direction - one that I couldn’t have imagined 5 years ago! In particular, it has allowed me to create a second business that I am completely in love with, The Ladies’ Project, a community for international women learning English as a second language. It takes away the pain of finding genuine speaking partners to practise with online, while empowering women to build confidence in themselves (their English conversation skills!) and create opportunities to thrive.” <br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>3.

She recently more than doubled the staff to handle the launch of her physical merch store and her globalization efforts via her English channel. Refika says YouTube has helped her both financially and emotionally, allowing her to grow her business and pursue her dreams.    <br /><br /><b>YT: How do you balance between being a creator and a businesswoman?  </b><br /><br /><b>Refika:</b> “It’s definitely not easy finding the balance. As a creator and business person, I am the product, I am the creative who keeps the product shiny and interesting, and I’m the operations person managing everything from top to bottom. I always have this feeling that there’s never enough time, and this weighs on me. I always have this heavy feeling of guilt, never feeling enough, but at the end of the day, I do my best!” <br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>4.

Earlier this year, it was announced she’ll be the online host of Eurovision. <br /><br /><b>YT: How do you balance between being a creator and a businesswoman? </b><br /><br /><b>Nikkie:</b> “In the beginning you need to learn what a ‘business person’ is because you are the brand and sometimes it might feel weird to talk about your own work, etc., but you get used to it. I now know I am my channel and my channel is my brand.  <br /><br />Also, I’ve been very fortunate to have help from very good, trustworthy people who help me on the business side so I can focus on creativity.” <br /><br /><b>YT: What is one important lesson learned from being a YouTube boss? </b><br /><br /><b>Nikkie:</b> “Don't get comfortable. As a platform,YouTube continues to evolve, so stay flexible and don't take any opportunity for granted.” <br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>5.

I was brought up to be a people pleaser, and it's taken a long time for me to accept that some people aren't going to like me and that is totally fine!

There’s a way to build a career around the things you’re most passionate about, and for me that was family and hair. That was the magic recipe for us, and I love that we didn’t have to choose one or the other.” <br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>7.

She now has the largest financial entertainment channel in the world and is considered one of the most influential women in Brazil. <br /><br /><b>YT: What are you most proud of from your work on YouTube? </b> <br /><br /><b>Nathalia:</b> “I am proud to have created a new vertical of content within YouTube, which is entertainment applied to education. It is knowing that I was able to open a door to other financial channels, which today makes the subject have much more impact in the lives of many many people. …. We are talking to a huge number of Brazilians who have never had access to financial education. And the moment Me Poupe! democratized access through a simpler and more fun language, and people started to understand that it is possible to talk about a subject that is so tense, that it is so hard in a light way, it broke several barriers and made that subject, that it is so important for people to be freer and make better decisions with money, not be so hostage to debt and have this financial education. So what I'm most proud of is being at the forefront of this segment on YouTube.”  <br /><br /><h3><b>9.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQh6LB206jF3JxpCDD-fp5Q\">Tate McRae </a></b></h3><br />Singer/songwriter/dancer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQh6LB206jF3JxpCDD-fp5Q\">Tate McRa</a>e released her debut EP “all the things i never said” in January, featuring her hit song “stupid.” Tate is set to kick off her “All The Things I Never Said Pt.

Many were arrested for child prostitution, even though they’d only lived 13 or 14 young years of life — not even close to the age of consent. They were not “child prostitutes,” but victims of child rape and trafficking. In prison, many of the girls were isolated for weeks, spending 23 hours a day in solitary confinement. <br /><br />It was impossible for the struggles of these girls — and more broadly, the 48,000 U.S. children who are behind bars — to be witnessed. Their stories go unseen and unheard. So, to help these girls be more visible, I came to Google in 2015. And as Senior Counsel on Civil and Human Rights, I wanted to wield technology for the greater humanitarian good. YouTube and Google  have  always been a tool for people to change their own narratives. <br /><br />YouTube and Google have also long supported efforts to improve our criminal justice system. Over the last four years, we’ve given over $30M in grants to criminal justice reform organizations, and partnered on projects like Love Letters, helping children send digital love letters to their incarcerated parents on Mother’s and Father’s Day. Through our philanthropy, and use of our platform, we’ve supported the work of those who are trying to do what's right.  <br /><br />That work continues today, with the launch of a project that uses immersive storytelling tools to build empathy through proximity. <br /><br />Today, YouTube and Google, in partnership with the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth (CFSY), are launching Project Witness — a campaign that allows us to learn from formerly incarcerated children using Virtual Reality.  <br /><br />It works like this: The VR film anchors the viewer in the experience of an incarcerated child. You’re able to see and hear the experience of being in solitary confinement from the viewpoint of a child in an adult prison. YouTube is a powerful platform for so much more than entertainment — from advocacy to education and awareness — that is open and accessible by everyone. VR is a unique format to pull the viewer into the story.<br /><br />The film is available to everyone on YouTube, and can be watched on desktop or via a VR headset. We will also feature Project Witness at a number of YouTube Spaces and events throughout the year.  <br /><br /><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jo1gM2LLlIc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />Project Witness is one part of YouTube’s ongoing criminal justice initiatives. On February 6, we released an episode of  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUe3pxoAIAY\" target=\"_blank\">BookTube</a> featuring Bryan Stevenson, based on his best-selling memoir “Just Mercy,” which is now also a feature film. And in the next few weeks we will release a documentary that explores the challenges of the cash bail system. <br /><br />YouTube is a platform that seeks to give everyone a voice, and we're proud to support the voices who are changing the way formerly incarcerated children are perceived. That’s why I came here, and I haven’t looked back ever since. <br /><br /><i>Malika Saada Saar, YouTube Social Impact </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=x4f3BHAwrqE:maQOmiWU8o0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=x4f3BHAwrqE:maQOmiWU8o0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=x4f3BHAwrqE:maQOmiWU8o0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/x4f3BHAwrqE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G0kEbnRQnb8/XkV4B0n03jI/AAAAAAAAAxY/oyb7QDs8czYxWhkfWpwWgSkWAOUKhPUzACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ProjectWitnessPoster01.png","linkMd5":"0df733d583adf238323066f42f0490f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-06-118_2837da8a619bd8cc.webp","destWidth":1067,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":1021818,"destBytes":64298,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G0kEbnRQnb8/XkV4B0n03jI/AAAAAAAAAxY/oyb7QDs8czYxWhkfWpwWgSkWAOUKhPUzACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ProjectWitnessPoster01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-06-118_2837da8a619bd8cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=x4f3BHAwrqE:maQOmiWU8o0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-41-35-036_58d5cd514b31d537.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/x4f3BHAwrqE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn26@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-41-34-104_2d3cf56c5ebdb720.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605659},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"Observing Ramadan at home","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/97oDfnn9etc/observing-ramadan-at-home.html","description":"The month of Ramadan begins today, with millions around the world beginning a time of reflection, fasting and prayer that will feel very different than in years past, as faith communities find new ways to celebrate safely in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within their communities. <br /><br />During these difficult times, it’s incredibly important for us to continue to connect with each other and feel part of our wider communities, even from home.

Selected footage sourced from participants like you will be woven together in this documentary to tell the story of an ordinary day during these extraordinary times. “Life In A Day 2020” will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and on YouTube in 2021. <br /><br /><h3>How the project works </h3><br />On a single day, Saturday, July 25, people around the world are invited to film their day. <br /><br />Maybe you'll be filming from home as you continue to navigate the coronavirus pandemic, or maybe you're in a part of the world where you're figuring out how to move forward in a transformed world. Maybe you're connecting with friends, reuniting with family, or going to work. Maybe it's a special day - you’re getting married, moving out, sharing important news. Or maybe it’s just a normal day. We want to weave together these unique experiences and perspectives to create a time capsule of this moment. <br /><br />The final feature film will be edited over the course of five months, crafted entirely through what is found in the submitted footage. Once the submission window closes, a 30-person team of multilingual reviewers stationed around the world will begin reviewing and translating submitted videos. Three principal feature editors - Nse Asuquo (House of My Fathers, The Jazz Ambassadors), Mdhamiri Á Nkemi (The Pale Horse, Blue Story), and Sam Rice-Edwards (Whitney) - will then undertake an enormous post-production effort, working alongside director Kevin Macdonald, to shape the film's final narrative out of the submitted footage. br /><br /><h3>Who can take part </h3><br />The filmmakers are encouraging people from all over the world to take part, and they hope to capture a wide perspective on life. Submissions are open from July 25 to August 2, which means you will only have one week to submit your footage at <a href=\"http://lifeinaday.youtube/\">lifeinaday.youtube</a>.<br /><br />While only a small number of the submitted clips will make it into the movie, YouTube and the filmmakers hope the filming day itself becomes a significant day of global participation. The “Life In A Day 2020” project celebrates the importance of everyone coming together in a moment of equal, worldwide collaboration. <br /><br /><h3>About the original film </h3><br />In 2010, “Life In A Day” brought the YouTube community together for a massive participatory feature film project that attracted 80,00 submissions. The final film premiered at Sundance in 2011, was released globally in theatres, and has been watched on YouTube over 16 million times.   <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=YsLXXEF9eJ0:TLvGshkZ1xU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=YsLXXEF9eJ0:TLvGshkZ1xU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=YsLXXEF9eJ0:TLvGshkZ1xU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/YsLXXEF9eJ0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"bd9f81322d868b027ae497c0e08a0ac4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=YsLXXEF9eJ0:TLvGshkZ1xU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-41-34-162_bd97ffc5948e59f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/YsLXXEF9eJ0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn14@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-41-34-049_8aaa1c10c7a54d81.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605652},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"COVID-19: Resources to help people learn on YouTube","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/PAPY9iLFil4/covid-19-resources-to-help-people-learn.html","description":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">As more and more families find themselves at home, we know people are learning how to adjust to this situation.

On February 14, 2005, YouTube was registered as a website. Its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCVxQ_3Ejkg\" target=\"_blank\">founders</a> wanted to create a way for people around the world to share videos. Soon after, the first video&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">⁠—</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw\" target=\"_blank\">“Me at the zoo”</a>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">⁠—</span>&nbsp;was uploaded, and before the end of the year, the site was receiving millions of views a day.<br /><br />Just miles away at Google’s headquarters, I had begun working with colleagues to see how people would use online video. Much to our surprise, users all over the world wanted to upload their videos to share their stories. But what surprised me even more was that so many others wanted to watch these videos about everyday life: funny dances, kids making cute unexpected comments, and, of course, lots of cat videos. These videos entertained us, but they also showed there was something very human about connecting through online video. While traditional media often showed polished and perfected versions of life, this medium was different; it had a raw, honest, and authentic feel.  <br /><br />As YouTube began to take off, it became clear that the company would need significant capital investment to support its growth, so YouTube decided to sell to another company. I, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_Kamangar\" target=\"_blank\">Salar Kamangar</a>, made the case to bring the companies together. After the acquisition, founder <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Hurley\" target=\"_blank\">Chad Hurley</a> became CEO, then Salar, and I was incredibly honored to become YouTube’s third CEO six years ago. <br /><br />Fast forward to today, and YouTube has more than two billion monthly users around the world, and 500 hours of video uploaded every minute. Looking ahead in 2020, we’re focused on making YouTube a place where everyone has a voice and can see the world as we:  <br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Grow the creator ecosystem to be the best place for creators.</b> Creators are the heart of YouTube, and they’re pioneering new content by vlogging about their lives, covering topics like gaming, fitness, comedy, hobbies, makeup tutorials, and every kind of How To imaginable. Want to fix that 10 year old refrigerator or car? YouTube likely has the video to replace every single part, and in multiple languages! Creators are at the cutting edge of culture and also becoming next generation media companies, boosting local economies with new jobs. Compared to last year, the number of creators earning five figures annually has increased more than 40 percent. And more than 170,000 YouTube channels around the world have over 100,000 subscribers&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">⁠—</span>&nbsp;that’s hundreds of thousands of small businesses growing through the platform. YouTube is unique as a platform since we share the majority of revenue with our creators. Going forward, our goal is to continue to grow revenue and audiences of YouTube creators. We appreciate everything creators do to inspire, educate, and entertain their audiences. We know their fans appreciate them, too, and today we’re launching the third annual #LoveNotes campaign. Click <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1227647319396507648\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to show support for your favorite creators. </li></ul><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Partner with the music industry</b> to <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8550838/lyor-cohen-youtube-music-billboard-cover-story-interview-2020\" target=\"_blank\">grow revenue</a>, break new artists and promote music. YouTube offers twin engines for revenue with advertising and subscribers, paying out more than $3 billion to the music industry last year from ads and subscriptions. We’re also partnering with artists to support and amplify their work through every phase of their career. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-J-KZfRV8c13fOCkhXdLiQ\" target=\"_blank\">Dua Lipa</a> was in YouTube's first-ever Foundry program — our initiative to develop independent music acts. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwFjwMjI0y7PDBVEO9-bkQ\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Bieber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiGm_E4ZwYSHV3bcW1pnSeQ\" target=\"_blank\">Billie Eilish</a> have built massive global audiences by directly connecting and engaging with fans on YouTube. At just 18 years old, Billie is now one of the world's biggest stars with five recent Grammy wins. And from its early days, YouTube has been a home for artists who found creative ways to use the platform to help expand their reach. In 2005, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/okgo\" target=\"_blank\">OK Go</a> had one of the first viral hits with their music video, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1_CLW-NNwc\" target=\"_blank\">A Million Ways</a>.\" Fans posted their own versions of the boy band-inspired choreography, and OK Go decided to make it official with a dance challenge on YouTube. We continue to see unknown artists make it big with a single viral hit. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uMv3bNXwapHl8Dzf2p01Q\" target=\"_blank\">Lil Nas X</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qovpFAGrQ\" target=\"_blank\">\"Old Town Road\"</a> became a YouTube phenomenon and the longest-leading single atop the Billboard Hot 100.  </li></ul><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Work with media companies to extend their audiences</b> through time shifting, new geographies and new users. We’re also boosting awareness of subscription services, sports and news highlights, long-form content, and movies with trailers and clips. And we’re connecting networks and media partners to a consumer base that is increasingly cutting the cord. Today, <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/go/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube TV</a> has more than 2 million subscribers, and our service has expanded nationwide in the U.S., offering access to more than 70 channels, including cable networks, live sports, and on-demand programming. </li></ul><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Help advertisers</b> big and small find more customers. Advertisers recognize the reach and effectiveness of YouTube to build awareness, improve consideration, and drive results. In 2020, we’ll continue to make our solutions simpler and more effective, while keeping responsibility front of mind. We’ve spent the last three years working to strike the right balance between what advertisers think of as brand safety and what creators think of as demonetization. We continue to develop tools that give advertisers confidence about where their ads run. We’re also working to offer more transparency and certainty to creators with more guidance on our advertiser-friendly <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> and an expansion of our creator <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK2xupRNgaU\" target=\"_blank\">self-certification</a> program. </li></ul><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Continue to be a place where users come to laugh and to learn.</b> YouTube has become the world's largest video library, a place where people come to be entertained, watch their favorite creators, get help with homework, learn a new hobby, see the latest music video and find community. We’ve seen the ways video is an effective medium for learning&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">⁠—&nbsp;</span>users can see how to do something and repeat the lesson as many times as needed!  Whether it’s help with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1zxj-axCEo\" target=\"_blank\">math class</a> for college or learning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPE0WfmWpb8&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">how to sew</a> and becoming an entrepreneur, we know YouTube is a key force for learning. To amplify this positive impact, we’re investing in quality family content, including our $100 million fund dedicated to the creation of thoughtful, original children’s content on YouTube and YouTube Kids.</li></ul><br /><br />With these new opportunities have come new challenges around responsibility. From the very first days, we realized the importance of setting the rules of the road with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Community Guidelines</a>. Over the years, we’ve built on our commitment to protect the YouTube community. While YouTube is clearly a platform&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">—</span>&nbsp;our focus as a company is to distribute the content produced by others&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">⁠—</span>&nbsp;that doesn’t mean we don’t have responsibility. This is my number one focus, and we will continue to do the hard work to make sure that we’re on the right side of history.<br /><br />We think about our responsibility efforts in terms of 4 Rs:  <br /><br /><br /><ul><li>We <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/09/the-four-rs-of-responsibility-remove.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>remove</b></a> content that violates policies as quickly as possible. In Q3 of last year alone, <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">we removed</a> more than 8.7 million videos.</li></ul><ul><li>We <b><a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/12/the-four-rs-of-responsibility-raise-and-reduce.html\" target=\"_blank\">raise</a>&nbsp;</b>up&nbsp;authoritative voices in searches and recommendations for news and other types of sensitive information.</li></ul><ul><li>We <b>reduce</b> our recommendations of content that brushes up against our policies. We’ve reduced watchtime of borderline content from non-subscribed recommendations in the U.S. by more than 70 percent. Last year we launched these efforts in other markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, and Mexico. And we started 2020 with launches in Italy and Japan, with plans to continue to expand throughout the year.</li></ul><ul><li>And we <b>reward</b> content that meets our even higher bar for monetization.  </li></ul><br /><br />We’re proud of the work we’ve done over the past three years to raise the bar on responsibility. Over the past two years, we've made more than 50 policy changes, often in consultation with relevant outside experts around the world who help us craft guidelines that will protect our community in the long run. Today, problematic content is only a fraction of one percent of what’s watched on YouTube, and we want to drive that number down even more. And as the U.S. <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2020/02/how-youtube-supports-elections.html\" target=\"_blank\">presidential election</a> approaches, we will continue to balance openness with responsibility by ensuring that YouTube is a reliable source for information. Our efforts include raising up authoritative election news and removing bad actors and misleading content. <br /><br />Over the next few months, we’ll be celebrating the moments that led up to the public launch of YouTube in May 2005. As I look back on my journey with online video over the past 15 years, I feel incredibly privileged to have been part of these key moments. What inspires me as CEO of YouTube are the stories I hear everyday of how YouTube enabled someone to build a business, gain new skills, laugh, cry, and connect with others. While I don’t know what the next 15 years will bring, I’m certain that YouTube will continue to empower the next generation of storytellers and enrich all our lives.  <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=37Db1l5Bt2w:ewDndD74fd4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=37Db1l5Bt2w:ewDndD74fd4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=37Db1l5Bt2w:ewDndD74fd4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/37Db1l5Bt2w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C5jHSgi5JL8/XkWGoSJiQ2I/AAAAAAAAAxk/ykI888NpgLYJSCMEjqdP-efiMJD5rWqkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Susan-note2.png","linkMd5":"f2decb43517d4cd0844406f0642cf4da","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-40-06-141_37e4db3a9ffd25e6.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":622,"sourceBytes":251033,"destBytes":69100,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C5jHSgi5JL8/XkWGoSJiQ2I/AAAAAAAAAxk/ykI888NpgLYJSCMEjqdP-efiMJD5rWqkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Susan-note2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-40-06-141_37e4db3a9ffd25e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=37Db1l5Bt2w:ewDndD74fd4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn94@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-41-35-100_53d503204db5569d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/37Db1l5Bt2w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn89@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-41-34-066_ca0d6ee16c242d16.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605659},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"State of the Union 2020: Live on YouTube","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/YYW4agsM4OY/state-of-union-2020-live-on-youtube.html","description":"From breaking news to key moments, people around the world have been able to access important content and news through YouTube.

It’s a strange and hard time to be entering this new stage of life, but each speaker delivered a unique message of hope to the next generation of leaders. There were tributes, there were performances and moments of surprise-and-delight planted throughout. (Hint: You’ll hear an arrangement from Finneas O’Connell, plus an appearance from a classic, animated American sitcom.) From the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0pokKf2e0&amp;list=PLjq6DwYksrzxue8EuB6CxNEUtb2pHW-Rt&amp;index=12\" target=\"_blank\">Obamas</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEd1FBW3H70&amp;list=PLjq6DwYksrzxue8EuB6CxNEUtb2pHW-Rt&amp;index=10\" target=\"_blank\">Lady Gaga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGtJE58bli0&amp;list=PLjq6DwYksrzxue8EuB6CxNEUtb2pHW-Rt&amp;index=4\" target=\"_blank\">Beyoncé</a>, the over four-hour event also peppered in celebrity powerhouses like J.Lo and Mariah Carey.  <br /><br />“Dear Class of 2020” definitely can’t replace the feeling of physically walking across a stage to receive your diploma, but it was memorable. The 10 following quotes left more than an impression on us. These words will be ringing in our heads in the days to come, as we ready ourselves for the second half of 2020. <br /><br /><br /><ol><li><b>President Barack Obama:</b> “America changed — has always changed — because young people dared to hope. As someone once said, 'Hope is not a lottery ticket. It’s a hammer for us to use in a national emergency to break the glass, sound the alarm and sprint into action. '”&nbsp;</li><br /><br /><li><b>Beyoncé:</b> “Look how far you’ve come and how much you’ve contributed. Keep pushing. Forget the fear. Forget the doubt. Keep investing and keep betting on yourself.”</li><br /><br /><li><b>&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel:</b> “I know this is a lousy time to enter the real world, but years from this, you will have what few people do: a cool story. Know what year I graduated high school? 1985. You know the most interesting thing that happened in 1985 was? “Police Academy 2,” ‘kay? Look it up. But when you tell people the year you graduated, everyone will be super interested, they’ll wanna know what was it like? Did you live underground? Did you used to touch hands with each other? Who did you take to the prom: your mom or your dad? Did the president really tell people to drink bleach?”</li><br /><br /><li><b>Alicia Keys:</b> “You, my friends, you are graduates in the most powerful time to be coming of age. And there’s nothing and no one that can stop you from changing the world. I see you. You’re unstoppable. We honor you and celebrate you.”&nbsp;</li><br /><br /><li><b>Sundar Pichai:</b> “You will prevail.” (Read his transcripted speech <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/youtube/sundar-pichai-message-class-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</li><br /><br /><li><b>Michelle Obama:</b> “In an uncertain world, time-tested values like honesty and integrity, empathy and compassion — that’s the only real currency in life.”&nbsp;</li><br /><br /><li><b>Liza Koshy:</b> “You should also know you’re not alone. You’ve got a lot of company. And being stuck at home meant you had to find creative new ways to celebrate, which made #DearClassof2020 really blow up.”</li><br /><br /><li><b>Stephen Colbert:</b> “I have no doubt you will be the heroes of so many who have not yet been born. And years from now, if you have the good fortune to hold your own child’s face in your hands and tell them how proud you are of them, you’ll understand how we feel about you right now. And they’ll wonder how you did what you are about to go do.”&nbsp;</li><br /><br /><li><b>Malala Yousafzai:</b> “Don’t be defined by what you’re losing during this crisis, but by how you respond to it.”&nbsp;</li><br /><br /><li><b>Sec. Condoleezza Rice:</b> “You are the next generation of Americans who will fight for what is right, and one day make impossible seem inevitable.”</li></ol><br /><br /><i>— The YouTube Team </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=RHwK1ZybqWY:z1whkf79SXc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=RHwK1ZybqWY:z1whkf79SXc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=RHwK1ZybqWY:z1whkf79SXc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/RHwK1ZybqWY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:30:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"bed598d953b0ccbf46a3424b22e9215c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=RHwK1ZybqWY:z1whkf79SXc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn5@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-41-34-139_ca84549c17c97bd9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/RHwK1ZybqWY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn57@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-41-34-125_19ff965788b10723.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605657},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"Safer Internet Day: 5 ways we’re building a safer YouTube","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/B4gP3ng2UOk/safer-internet-day.html","description":"Keeping you and your family safe online is a top priority at YouTube. Today on Safer Internet Day, we’re sharing some of the ways we work to keep YouTube safe, and how you can be more in control of your YouTube experience. From built-in protections to easy-to-use tools, we hope you’ll take advantage of these tips:  <br /><br /><h3>1. Learn more about the content available on YouTube </h3><br />We work hard to maintain a safe community and have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> that explain what we allow and don’t allow on YouTube. Most of what we remove is <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">first-detected by machines</a>, which means we actually review and remove prohibited content before you ever see it. But no system is perfect, so we make sure if you see something that doesn’t belong on YouTube, you can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9387085?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=2803138\" target=\"_blank\">flag it</a> for us and we’ll quickly review it. If you want to know what happened to a video you flagged, just visit your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/reporthistory\" target=\"_blank\">reporting history</a> to find out.   <br /><br /><h3>2. Learn more about what data we collect and how to update your privacy settings  </h3><br />Check out <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/yourdata/youtube?hl=en&amp;e=ReorderPrivacyCheckupSteps\" target=\"_blank\">Your Data in YouTube</a> to browse or delete your YouTube activity and learn more about how we use data. Your YouTube privacy settings include managing your search and watch history.  If you prefer more private viewing, you can use Incognito mode on the YouTube mobile app or Chrome browser on your computer. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9040743?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more.</a><br /><br />You can also take the <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?e=ReorderPrivacyCheckupSteps\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Checkup</a> and we’ll walk you through key privacy settings step-by-step. For YouTube, you’ll be able to do things like easily pause your <a href=\"https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols/youtube?utm_source=retention-promo\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube History</a>, or automatically delete data that may be used for your recommendations.   <br /><br /><h3>3. Check in on your security settings and keep your passwords safe </h3><br />Head over to <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en&amp;e=ReorderPrivacyCheckupSteps\" target=\"_blank\">Security Checkup</a> for personalized recommendations to help protect your data and devices across Google, including YouTube. Here, you can manage which third-party apps have access to your account data and also take the <a href=\"https://passwords.google.com/checkup/start\" target=\"_blank\">Password Checkup</a>, which tells you if any of your passwords are weak and how to change them. In addition, you can access <a href=\"https://passwords.google.com/?ep=1&amp;rapt=AEjHL4NBgnRi808tPRqJiqLcdRrRG1VjZoB5owjGkbfZwymFYNwwqe41cImikbmV13XTKG_Jq5WJTTQ5CgfZUK-we0Ev5JQ3Jg\" target=\"_blank\">Password Manager</a> in your Google Account to help you remember and securely store strong passwords for all your online accounts. <br /><br /><h3>4. Learn more about how ads work and control what ads you see on YouTube </h3><br /><a href=\"https://safety.google/privacy/ads-and-data/\" target=\"_blank\">We do not sell your personal information</a> to anyone, and give you transparency, choice and control over how your information is used as a part of Google. If you’re curious about why you’re seeing an ad, you can click on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1634057\" target=\"_blank\">Why this ad</a> for more information. If you no longer find a specific ad relevant, you can choose to block that ad by using the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922\" target=\"_blank\">Mute this ad</a> control. And you can always control the kinds of ads you see, or turn off ads personalization any time in your <a href=\"https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\" target=\"_blank\">Ad Settings</a>.   <br /><br /><h3>5. Try the YouTube Kids app, built with parental controls </h3><br />We recommend parents use <a href=\"https://www.youtubekids.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Kids</a> if they plan to allow kids under 13 to watch independently. YouTube Kids is a separate app with family-friendly videos and parental controls. We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids suitable for kids and have recently reduced the number of channels on the app. The app also empowers parents to choose what’s the right experience for their kids and family, such as which content is available for their kids, how long they can use the app for and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/kids/\" target=\"_blank\">much more. </a><br /><br />In addition to YouTube Kids, we also recently made <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2020/01/better-protecting-kids-privacy-on-YouTube.html\" target=\"_blank\">changes</a> to Made for Kids content on YouTube to better protect children’s privacy.  <br /><br />Finally if you have any questions or feedback, let us know! We are available 24/7 on @TeamYouTube, or you can always check out our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/community\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Help Community</a> to learn about the latest announcements. Responsibility is our number one priority, and together with you, we will continue our ongoing efforts to build a safer YouTube.  <br /><br /><i><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #3c4043; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">—&nbsp;</span>The YouTube Team </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=B4gP3ng2UOk:OvIGMFgcWQI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=B4gP3ng2UOk:OvIGMFgcWQI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=B4gP3ng2UOk:OvIGMFgcWQI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/B4gP3ng2UOk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:01:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"76e04b8a18b87fb010d6fc81500e1c30","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=B4gP3ng2UOk:OvIGMFgcWQI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn98@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-41-34-131_34cdbc42ddedd0f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/B4gP3ng2UOk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-41-34-068_2ed1d0bc3bc03a03.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605659},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"Go to adventure, arts, sports or STEM camp with #CampYouTube","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/6YU5V85Dci8/camp-youtube.html","description":"Parents and caretakers, \n<br />\n<br />We know this isn’t the easiest time for you.

This Letter addresses initiatives to support the Black community, the impact of COVID-19, and how YouTube is working on behalf of creators. </i><br /><br />In the last few months, we’ve experienced enormous tragedy and loss.  <br /><br />As people around the world have felt the devastating impact of the COVID-19 crisis, they’ve dealt with illness, loneliness, unemployment, and juggled added responsibilities with kids at home. <br /><br />And over the past few weeks, we’ve grieved together as the Black community has endured more senseless acts of racial terror and violence. We know that for many, tragedies like these are a persistent reminder of the harm caused by systemic racism. They also compound the toll of the pandemic, which disproportionately impacted Black and Brown communities in the U.S. and abroad. <br /><br />At YouTube, we believe Black lives matter and we all need to do more to dismantle systemic racism. We join in protest against the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others before them. <br /><br />The painful events of this year have reminded us of the importance of human connection and the need to continue to strengthen human rights around the world.  <br /><br />Our platform has been a place where people come together since YouTube first launched <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2020/02/youtube-at-15-my-personal-journey.html\" target=\"_blank\">15 years ago.</a>&nbsp;And in the midst of uncertainty, creators continue to share stories that might not otherwise be heard while also building online communities.  <br /><br /><h3>Supporting the Black community </h3><br />We have always been proud that we are a platform that celebrates a broad and diverse set of voices. And we have implemented many policies and product features to protect our communities. <br /><br />But we recognize we need to do more, in particular with the Black community, and that is why we are committing to following actions. <br /><br /><h4>Amplifying Black voices </h4><br />We’re committed to doing better as a platform to center and amplify Black voices and perspectives. <br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Today, we’re announcing a multi-year $100 million fund dedicated to amplifying and developing the voices of Black creators and artists and their stories.</li><br /><li>And one example of the type of content we’d like to elevate on the platform will premiere this Saturday, June 13. We’ll host a live stream fundraising event produced by YouTube Originals (YTO), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ38YduTchI&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">“Bear Witness, Take Action.”</a> The YTO will bring together creators, artists, influential public figures and prominent activist voices for roundtable discussions and musical performances, with donations benefiting the <a href=\"https://eji.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Equal Justice Initiative</a>.</li><br /><li>Through the month of June, our Spotlight channel will highlight racial justice issues, including the latest perspectives from the Black community on YouTube alongside historical content, educational videos, and protest coverage. This content showcases incredibly important stories about the centuries-long fight for equity.   </li></ul><br /><br /><h4>Protection from hate and harassment </h4><br />We’ve taken many steps over the years to help protect diverse communities from hate and harassment across the platform, including Black creators and artists. And last year, we developed more stringent <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9282436\" target=\"_blank\">hate speech</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">harassment</a> policies. Our updated hate speech policy specifically bans videos alleging that a group is superior based on qualities like race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion.  <br /><br />As a result of these changes and our ongoing enforcement, last quarter alone we removed over 100,000 videos and 100 million comments for hate and harassment. <br /><br />That said, we know there’s more work to do. <br /><br />Building on our work over the past several years, we’re taking this moment to examine how our policies and products are working for everyone&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">⁠—</span>&nbsp;but specifically for the Black community&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">⁠—</span>&nbsp;and close any gaps. And more broadly, we will work to ensure Black users, artists, and creators can share their stories and be protected from hateful, white supremacist, and bullying content.<br /><br />Generations of Black Americans have been waiting for justice in the United States, and we know the effect of inequality is felt around the world.  <br /><br />I’m committed to listening&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">—&nbsp;</span>to Black employees at YouTube, to Black creators, to Black artists, to leaders in the Black community, and to Black users who tune in to YouTube every day.<br /><br />There is much work to do to advance racial equity in the long-term, and these efforts will continue in the months and years ahead. <br /><br /><h3>Connecting people with useful information, responsibly </h3><br />Over the past few months, another top priority has been connecting people to trusted information as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the globe. Our teams started by engaging with public health officials in more than 90 countries so they could make locally relevant information available, which we display on our homepage and in panels that appear on videos and in search results about COVID-19. Collectively, these panels have been shown more than 200 billion times.  <br /><br />YouTube also launched a dedicated COVID-19 news shelf, with videos from health authorities and news organizations, in more than 30 countries around the world. We’ve found that when people come to YouTube searching for coronavirus topics, on average 94 percent of the videos they see in the top 10 results come from high authority channels. We think this is important progress, even as we keep working to bring that number higher. <br /><br />In addition to raising up trusted information, we have also been focused on combating harmful medical misinformation. We’re consulting on an ongoing basis with health authorities like the WHO and local organizations like the CDC, the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, and India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as well as expert medical and public health professionals, to design policies based on the latest science. We updated our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785\" target=\"_blank\">policies</a> to prohibit content with harmful medical information, for example saying the virus is a hoax or claiming there is a guaranteed cure. To date, we’ve removed over 200,000 videos for violating these policies.  <br /><br />We also understand the importance of representing a broad set of voices in the public debate. There are a range of opinions on topics like how governments respond to the crisis, when and how we should reopen economies, and criticism of health authorities and government officials. We want to ensure these important discussions continue on the platform, even as we work to combat misinformation.  <br /><br />Creators also have an important role to play in helping connect people to useful information. Forty high-profile creators have spoken with leading health officials, including <a href=\"https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jaime.sepulveda\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jaime Sepúlveda’s</a> Spanish-language interviews with creators and <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Anthony Fauci’s</a> conversations with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3jiM2FNR8\" target=\"_blank\">Trevor Noah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfcJecd6jtE\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Mike</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2YKKba6ps0\" target=\"_blank\">Lilly Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3miPW-wkfk&amp;list=PLbpi6ZahtOH71a6AQn1p3XGQ2CQSlfPIU&amp;index=5&amp;t=609s\" target=\"_blank\">Phil DeFranco</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reginabenjamin.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Regina Benjamin</a> and <a href=\"https://apha.org/about-apha/executive-board-and-staff/apha-staff/georges-c-benjamin-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Georges Benjamin</a> also spoke with Black creators about the impact of COVID-19 on the Black community. These creator interviews have been seen in more than 160 countries and received more than 43 million views.  <br /><br />And more than 700 creators and artists joined YouTube’s #withme PSA campaign, encouraging users to stay home and highlighting important messages about how to stop the virus.  <br /><br />These public service announcements are reaching people around the world - they’ve received over three billion impressions.  <br /><br />Thank you to all of our creators who led the way with this initiative.  <br /><br /><h3>Learning  </h3><br />YouTube has always been a key learning resource, but we are now seeing a record amount of engagement. The average daily views of videos with homeschooling in the title have more than tripled globally in the last three months. <br /><br />As students began learning from home, some of the first events we featured on Learn@Home were live streams <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fSQkPJpBqM\" target=\"_blank\">hosted</a> by The College Board to help high school students <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/advancedplacement\" target=\"_blank\">prepare</a> for Advanced Placement tests in May. The response exceeded our expectations - the videos from the first day of live streaming have received more than 700,000 views. And students preparing for AP exams through the daily live streams received unexpected support from Lin-Manuel Miranda, who recently hosted a special edition U.S. History master class.  <br /><br />Creators have launched live stream series to help students of all ages stay motivated to learn at home, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Rober</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/featured\" target=\"_blank\">3Blue1Brown</a>. And we’ve seen new read-alongs for children, like PBS Kids with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa8HWWMcQEGStVxurBtLn8nkDxGc3j3ow\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Obama</a> and Dolly Parton’s weekly Goodnight with Dolly. <br /><br />And students are even finding ways to keep up with physical education on YouTube by tuning in to daily shows like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhWmnEVA0y4\" target=\"_blank\">PE with Joe</a> or taking a dance break with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMr-d2PLsO95ydptpBnsxdQNSKc9iUNU0\" target=\"_blank\">KIDZ BOP</a>.  <br /><br /><h3>Enabling online connections and communities </h3><br />In our house, kids aren’t just learning online, they’re also virtually celebrating holidays, birthdays, and even hosting sleepovers with their friends. <br /><br />We’re finding new ways to connect, and at YouTube, we’re seeing communities bringing people together online.  <br /><br />People are using live streams at a much higher rate, with live watchtime on TV screens up over 250 percent year-over-year on YouTube globally during the height of stay at home measures around the world. <br /><br />Live streams are also helping us capture moments that otherwise would have been lost, like graduation ceremonies. To mark this key milestone, we developed an online <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxpTjcouaeQ\" target=\"_blank\">#DearClassof2020</a> commencement headlined by President Barack Obama and featuring <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNL1ZadSjHpjm4q9j2sVtOA\" target=\"_blank\">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRijo3ddMTht_IHyNSNXpNQ\" target=\"_blank\">Dude Perfect</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzJIliq68IHSn-Kwgjeg2AQ\" target=\"_blank\">Jackie Aina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpi8TJfiA4lKGkaXs__YdBA\" target=\"_blank\">The Try Guys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hx0ajieM3M\" target=\"_blank\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Google’s own Sundar Pichai. <br /><br />Creators have also stepped in to support global relief efforts, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYzPXprvl5Y-Sf0g4vX-m6g\" target=\"_blank\">jacksepticeye’s</a> live stream #HopeFromHome, which raised money for the United Way. Creators in the United Kingdom came together for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pntmw76eQBc\" target=\"_blank\">Stream #WithMe</a>, a live fundraiser benefiting <a href=\"https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/giving/NHSCharitiesCOVID19/\" target=\"_blank\">NHS</a>. And artists and creators joined <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hGR3f1ct9Q\" target=\"_blank\">One Love Asia,</a> a concert benefiting UNICEF. <br /><br />To enable the YouTube community to have even more impact, this year we’ve expanded the access to our donate button from 1,500 eligible channels to more than 40,000, allowing more creators to easily engage their audiences on causes they care about. <br /><br /><h3>Welcoming new creativity  </h3><br />Even during these incredibly difficult times, we’re seeing unprecedented creativity from our creative community. Because creators are experts at filming to suit any style, from high-production to garage studios, they were able to quickly adapt and make content that reflected our new reality, from yoga for stress release to quarantine routines.  <br /><br />And artists are bringing fans together online and making YouTube a virtual concert venue. Bands like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/therollingstones\" target=\"_blank\">Rolling Stones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/Radiohead\" target=\"_blank\">Radiohead</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPuuuhmMW7jh6roOrIV9yRw\" target=\"_blank\">Grateful Dead</a> are releasing live concert footage every week, giving fans something to look forward to while staying at home. Brazilian singer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwfEOn0O1DWcyTgzVVu28ig\" target=\"_blank\">Marília Mendonça</a> hosted a live stream concert on YouTube from her home last month, and the video has been viewed more than 20 million times.  <br /><br />We’re also welcoming cultural institutions that are creating or expanding their YouTube channels, giving audiences the chance to tune in to legendary performances from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bolshoi\" target=\"_blank\">The Bolshoi Theater</a>, weekly releases of Andrew Lloyd Weber musicals on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLeErO8nXsc\" target=\"_blank\">The Shows Must Go On</a>, and Shakespeare plays streamed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ShakespearesGlobe/videos\" target=\"_blank\">The Globe Theatre</a>. <br /><br />And there’s been a rise in new formats for content during quarantine. We’ve seen YouTube’s first virtual <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm8mbAPAWG0\" target=\"_blank\">fashion show</a> and a streaming <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/weareone\" target=\"_blank\">global film festival</a>. <br /><br />Gaming creators are also drawing new audiences. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU\" target=\"_blank\">Travis Scott</a> leveraged the power of the popular game Fortnite to perform unreleased music to viewers around the globe without ever leaving his house. Viewers tuned in live to streams from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0bC92gFO25qcJcECTQNN_A\" target=\"_blank\">Flakes Power</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd534c_ehOvrLVL2v7Nl61w\" target=\"_blank\">Muselk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kXj0_DYmYg\" target=\"_blank\">Avxry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej2x205NtlM\" target=\"_blank\">Valkyrae</a> and other gaming creators, with all four experiences garnering 100 million views on YouTube. <br /><br />Thank you to all the creators and organizations who are releasing new content during this time, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tk0FULFq-M\" target=\"_blank\">tips</a> for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9sspffLAXg\" target=\"_blank\">working</a> at home to DIY advice from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw/videos\" target=\"_blank\">dad who launched a YouTube channel</a> to answer questions like how to hang a shelf or unclog a drain.  <br /><br />Whether your views are in the hundreds or in the millions, you’re making the world a little brighter for someone watching from home. <br /><br /><h3>YouTube creator updates </h3><br />As creators rose to meet the challenges of the pandemic, they also faced obstacles along the way. We know the uncertainty of the past few months has been hard and our team is working to provide support. In March, we adjusted our policy to enable ads for content from creators and news organizations discussing the coronavirus.  <br /><br />Given fluctuations with the advertising market, we are encouraging creators to also invest in other forms of monetization to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857\" target=\"_blank\">grow and diversify their revenue</a>. Since the beginning of March, we saw over two million viewers support creators by purchasing their first <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/01/can-we-chat-hello-super-chat.html\" target=\"_blank\">Super Chat</a>, <a href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2019/11/introducing-super-stickers.html\" target=\"_blank\">Super Sticker</a> or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7636690?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">membership</a> on YouTube.  <br /><br />The number of creators earning the majority of their YouTube revenue from memberships and paid digital goods is up 40 percent since January.  <br /><br />And with more artists now going live on YouTube, we recently announced that we’ll be extending the availability of Super Chat and Super Stickers to more artist channels. <br /><br />This year we’ve also worked to give creators more control over monetization decisions and to provide transparency with our policies by expanding <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7687980?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Self Certification</a> to all creators in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). With Self-Certification, creators tell us what’s in their video and how it complies with our ad-friendly guidelines. <br /><br />In the past few weeks, you may have heard questions raised about Section 230, a regulation in United States law that allows YouTube to be an open platform while protecting the community from harmful content, like content that incites violence or endangers children. We believe undermining Section 230 would impact our ability to protect our users and would also significantly limit content from a wide range of creators across the political spectrum who have a voice on our platform. Such a change might require online services like YouTube to \"over-filter\" content, making it more difficult for creators to share breaking news, create learning content, expose injustice, and amplify a diversity of voices and opinions. <br /><br />We'll continue to work on your behalf to explain how eroding 230 would harm the creator ecosystem globally. <br /><br /><h3>Mental health </h3><br />YouTube creators have long been known for their authenticity, and I appreciate how creators have openly shared how hard it is to create content as we navigate new challenges. It’s important for all of us to make our mental health and wellbeing a top priority.  <br /><br />People come to YouTube every day looking for information and resources, and we realize we have a tremendous opportunity to shine a light on various health issues.  <br /><br />Over the last few months, we’ve seen a 45 percent increase in views of meditation videos and a growing popularity of mindfulness and wellbeing content. <br /><br />Our teams also recently expanded the tools available to users to help prioritize wellbeing. We’ve added a new <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/48055830?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">bedtime reminder</a>, in addition to our “take a break” option, to help viewers manage their time on YouTube. <br /><br />And through our Get By #WithMe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBR8-60-B28hp2BmDPdntcQ\" target=\"_blank\">campaign</a>, we’ve partnered with creators to spotlight videos like Why Support Helps with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton\" target=\"_blank\">Kati Morton</a>. Creators like Kati are helping educate and reduce the stigma associated with mental health.  <br /><br />The past few months have been incredibly challenging, and we still have a long road ahead of us. But even in these difficult circumstances, I’m finding glimmers of hope every day on YouTube - your passion and creativity have been inspiring.  <br /><br />Thank you for all the ways you’re coming together to support one another, and for all the ways you’re giving back.  <br /><br />You’re reminding us to look for the good, even when so many things about life feel out of order.  <br /><br />Thank you for being a part of our community. Whether you’re connecting with people on YouTube across your city or across the world, your voices are coming together to make a difference. <br /><br /><i>Susan Wojcicki </i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=DnxLHoNXrDk:aeGYYE5N854:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=DnxLHoNXrDk:aeGYYE5N854:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=DnxLHoNXrDk:aeGYYE5N854:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/DnxLHoNXrDk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"9bc7a8638f310678310f85fa13c26219","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=DnxLHoNXrDk:aeGYYE5N854:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn42@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-41-34-179_5059e329528bda2e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/DnxLHoNXrDk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-41-34-092_3cfea6fe2c942e06.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605657},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"Expanding fact checks on YouTube to the United States","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/_kLtRuzhPJo/expanding-fact-checks-on-youtube-to-united-states.html","description":"Over the past several years, we've seen more and more people coming to YouTube for news and information. They want to get the latest on an election, to find multiple perspectives on a topic, or to learn about a major breaking news event. More recently, the outbreak of COVID-19 and its spread around the world has reaffirmed how important it is for viewers to get accurate information during fast-moving events. That's why we're continuing to improve the news experience on YouTube, including <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/12/the-four-rs-of-responsibility-raise-and-reduce.html\" target=\"_blank\">raising up authoritative sources</a> of information across the site. Today, we’re continuing this work by expanding our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9229632?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">fact check information panels</a>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">—&nbsp;</span>which we launched in Brazil and India last year&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">—&nbsp;</span>to the United States.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EhceewYPahY/XqcyETmZqYI/AAAAAAAAAyg/t8EYnOShQRsILncZIb3E1z8YGKIGOJutgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fact%2Bcheck_Covid%2B%252B%2Bibuprofen%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"832\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EhceewYPahY/XqcyETmZqYI/AAAAAAAAAyg/t8EYnOShQRsILncZIb3E1z8YGKIGOJutgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fact%2Bcheck_Covid%2B%252B%2Bibuprofen%2B%25281%2529.png\" /></a></div><br /><br />The fact check feature expands upon the other ways we raise and connect people with authoritative sources. For example, our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9057101?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9257092\" target=\"_blank\">Breaking News and Top News shelves</a> help our viewers find information from authoritative sources both on their YouTube homepage and when searching for news topics. In 2018, we introduced information panels that help surface a wide array of contextual information, from links to sources like Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia for topics prone to longstanding misinformation (e.g. \"flat earth\" theories), or more recently, linking to the WHO, CDC or local health authorities for videos and searches related to COVID-19. We're now using these panels to help address an additional challenge: Misinformation that comes up quickly as part of a fast-moving news cycle, where unfounded claims and uncertainty about facts are common. (For example, a false report that COVID-19 is a bio-weapon.) Our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9229632?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">fact check information panels</a> provide fresh context in these situations by highlighting relevant, third-party fact-checked articles above search results for relevant queries, so that our viewers can make their own informed decision about claims made in the news. <br /><br />There are a few factors that determine whether a fact check information panel will appear for any given search. Most important, there must be a relevant fact check article available from an eligible publisher. And in order to match a viewer’s needs with the information we provide, fact checks will only show when people search for a specific claim. For example, if someone searches for \"did a tornado hit Los Angeles,\" they might see a relevant fact check article, but if they search for a more general query like  \"tornado,\" they may not. All fact check articles must also comply with our Community Guidelines, and viewers can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/4347644?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop\" target=\"_blank\">send feedback</a> to our team. <br /><br />Our fact check information panel relies on an open network of third-party publishers and leverages the <a href=\"https://www.claimreviewproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ClaimReview</a> tagging system. All U.S. publishers are welcome to participate as long as they follow the publicly-available ClaimReview standards and are either a verified signatory of the International Fact-Checking Network’s (IFCN) Code of Principles or are an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9229632?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9257092\" target=\"_blank\">authoritative publisher</a>. Over a dozen U.S. publishers are participating today, including The Dispatch, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker, and we encourage more publishers and fact checkers to explore using ClaimReview. In addition to this roll out, YouTube will provide $1M through the <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google News Initiativ</a>e to the IFCN to bolster fact-checking and verification efforts across the world. This follows Google’s <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/covid-19-65-million-help-fight-coronavirus-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">efforts</a> to support the ecosystem in the midst of the challenging COVID-19 environment, and we'll be looking for more ways to support the fact check ecosystem in the future. <br /><br />As always, it will take some time for our systems to fully ramp up. Our systems will become more accurate, and over time, we'll roll this feature out to more countries. We are committed to our responsibility to protect the YouTube community, and expanding our fact check information panels is one of the many steps we are taking to raise up authoritative sources, provide relevant and authoritative context to our users, and continue to reduce the spread of harmful misinformation on YouTube. <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=_kLtRuzhPJo:BwEP2u4atog:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?a=_kLtRuzhPJo:BwEP2u4atog:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=_kLtRuzhPJo:BwEP2u4atog:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/_kLtRuzhPJo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2774,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EhceewYPahY/XqcyETmZqYI/AAAAAAAAAyg/t8EYnOShQRsILncZIb3E1z8YGKIGOJutgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fact%2Bcheck_Covid%2B%252B%2Bibuprofen%2B%25281%2529.png","linkMd5":"60c99e7919685befabd553402f29a1fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn77@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-40-05-934_0472619241eb7e78.webp","destWidth":832,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":739816,"destBytes":129772,"author":"YouTube","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EhceewYPahY/XqcyETmZqYI/AAAAAAAAAyg/t8EYnOShQRsILncZIb3E1z8YGKIGOJutgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fact%2Bcheck_Covid%2B%252B%2Bibuprofen%2B%25281%2529.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn77@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-40-05-934_0472619241eb7e78.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-40-05-701_51b0d82b2226b917.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/youtube/PKJx?i=_kLtRuzhPJo:BwEP2u4atog:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-41-34-137_d5df19968cb59ae7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~4/_kLtRuzhPJo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn69@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-41-34-106_f5ef862e931aeb02.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598283605657},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:40:05","title":"Better protecting kids’ privacy on YouTube","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/youtube/PKJx/~3/4MtxjEyhUE8/better-protecting-kids-privacy-on-YouTube.html","description":"Last September, we <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/09/an-update-on-kids.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a series of changes to better protect kids and their privacy on YouTube and to address concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Specifically, that all creators will be required to designate their content as made for kids or not made for kids in <a href=\"https://studio.youtube.com/\">YouTube Studio</a>, and data from anyone watching a video designated as made for kids will be treated as coming from a child, regardless of the age of the user. <br /><br />In November, we released a setting in Studio to make it easier for creators to designate their content. And today, we will begin to roll out these changes globally. We wanted to outline what you will start to see in the coming days. <br /><br /><h3>What is made for kids content? </h3><br />According to the FTC, a video is made for kids if it is intended for kids, taking into consideration a variety of factors. These factors include the subject matter of the video, whether the video has an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys or games, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/11/youtube-channel-owners-your-content-directed-children\" target=\"_blank\">and more</a>. <br /><br />To help us identify made for kids content, in November we <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a new audience setting</a> in YouTube Studio to help creators indicate whether or not their content is made for kids. Creators know their content best, and should set the designation themselves. We also use machine learning to help us identify this content, and creators can update a designation made by our systems if they believe it is incorrect. We will only override a creator designation if abuse or error is detected. <br /><br /><h3>An updated experience for made for kids content </h3><br />YouTube now treats personal information from anyone watching children’s content on the platform as coming from a child, regardless of the age of the user. This means that on videos made for kids, we limit data collection and use, and as a result, we need to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CzTAeLNRbg\" target=\"_blank\"> restrict or disable</a> some product features. For example, we no longer serve personalized ads on this content or support features such as comments, live chat, notification bell, stories, save to playlist, and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632097\" target=\"_blank\">others</a>. <br /><br />Many creators around the world have created quality kids content for their audiences, and these changes will have significant impact. We’re committed to helping creators navigate this new landscape and to supporting our ecosystem of family content. We’ll share more in the coming months. In the meantime, we continue to engage on this issue. For example, we participated in the FTC’s <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/audio-video/video/future-coppa-rule-ftc-workshop-session-2\" target=\"_blank\">public workshop</a> and submitted our <a href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2019/12/our-comment-on-coppa.html\" target=\"_blank\">comment on COPPA</a>, where we discussed the importance of clear guidelines that help creators live up to their legal obligations and support access to quality kids content. <br /><br /><h3>Continued investment in YouTube Kids </h3><br />We still recommend parents use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/kids/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Kids</a> if they plan to allow kids under 13 to watch independently. In fact, tens of millions of people use YouTube Kids every week, and recently we saw an all-time high of weekly viewers since the app’s launch. Starting today, you will see a YouTube Kids promotion across all made for kids content. We also continue to improve the product. For example, we recently launched signed-in support for YouTube Kids <a href=\"https://www.youtubekids.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on the web</a> and connected devices&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #545454; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">—</span>&nbsp;such as smart TVs&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #545454; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">—</span>&nbsp;so parents can now access and control their child’s YouTube Kids experience across even more surfaces.<br /><br />Responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. We’ve been significantly investing in the <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/06/an-update-on-our-efforts-to-protect.html\" target=\"_blank\">policies</a>, <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/04/introducing-new-choices-for-parents-to.html\" target=\"_blank\">products</a> and <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/11/5-ways-were-toughening-our-approach-to.html\" target=\"_blank\">practices</a> to help us do this. Today’s changes allow us to do this even better and we’ll continue working to provide children, families and family creators the best experience possible on YouTube. <br /><br /><i>— The YouTube Team
