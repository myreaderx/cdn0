Thing is, teams consider different and multiple elements when organizing their own sprints.</p><p>We originally supported the two most common frameworks: <strong>ICE Score</strong> (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and <strong>PIE</strong> (Potential, Importance, Ease) but, from now on, you will be able to create as many criteria as you want/need as well as their scale:</p><figure><img alt=\"Custom Prioritization Scoring\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*uG0UkNnRV2Gu1ZsitOO6Bg.gif\" /><figcaption>How to customize your priority score with Experiments.</figcaption></figure><p>If you are using any of the most famous frameworks, such as, <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/\"><strong>RICE</strong> </a>(made famous by Intercom), <strong>Weighted Scoring Prioritization</strong>, <strong>The Kano Model</strong>, <strong>MoSCoW</strong> or if you have created something unique to your own reality, Experiments is able to support you.</p><h3><strong>Custom Sprint Columns (KanBan)</strong></h3><p>Just like every team has its own prioritization system, they also have their own <a href=\"https://blog.growthhackers.com/the-4-steps-framework-for-an-effective-growth-meeting-45075d254f26\">internal execution process</a>, which evolves and improves over time — there are no one-size-fits-all when it comes down to spring management and, we want you to be able to model our tool to your own reality — not the other way around. In order to do this, we’ve created the <strong>custom columns on your sprint dashboard.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VgfQ8Pywjh_0aV2xPLbK_Q.gif\" /><figcaption>Customizing your “Idea Steps” with Experiments</figcaption></figure><p><strong>PS: </strong>The first (Up Next) and last (Ready to Analyze) columns are fixed and cannot be changed. This is due to the fact that, once an idea is approved, new elements appear inside of your card and, once an idea is analyzed, your card goes straight to your Learning Center (and your knowledge gets stored).</p><h3><strong>Metrics on Card</strong></h3><p>Data, metrics, KPIs, charts, and tracking live in the <a href=\"https://blog.growthhackers.com/the-three-layer-cadence-of-kpis-of-a-growth-strategy-88113452e755\">core of every growth or experimentation team</a>. Regardless if you are searching for the best opportunity to focus on right now, or if you are diving deep into how users behave once in your product/app, or how they navigate through your website or a heatmap of a landing page, it is always present and, the conclusion of a test/experiment without the data to back it all up, does not have the same impact (even more so for colleagues outside of the growth environment).</p><p>To help growth teams easily collect, gather and centralize data from different sources but linked to an experiment, we’ve built the <strong>Metric On Card.</strong></p><p>In a few words, once you suggest a testing idea or when you approve such a test, you will be able to connect that card with an existing metric (or create a new one), which can also be connected with external sources (spreadsheets, Amplitude, Mixpanel, etc), <strong>automating the collection of data</strong> to conclude if your hypothesis has indeed been validated or not.</p><figure><img alt=\"Custom Sprint Columns (KanBan)\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ofa1q5TtQz4vx29J4BFUmQ.gif\" /><figcaption>Add a metric goal to analyze your experiment with better data.</figcaption></figure><p>With this, we hope to automate the collection of data, so growth teams can focus on executing their tests (increasing the production capacity) as well as bring more data-backed validations to the table.</p><p>There’s a lot more to come, we hope you like it, and don’t hesitate to reach out either to <a href=\"http://pclivati@growthhackers.com/\"><strong>give us feedback</strong></a>, to <a href=\"https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/pclivati1\"><strong>ask for a demo</strong></a><strong>,</strong> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Y9tRL3\"><strong>sign up for a trial</strong></a>! :)</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=870be6462264\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://blog.growthhackers.com/whats-new-in-experiments-q1-2021-870be6462264\">What’s new in Experiments —Q1&#39; 2021&#39;</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.growthhackers.com\">Growth Hackers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 17:25:43 +0000","feedId":9175,"bgimg":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*uG0UkNnRV2Gu1ZsitOO6Bg.gif","linkMd5":"4e18dbe458009d879d6786e001f18333","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-59-37-477_537444bf3c7b572e.webp","destWidth":1013,"destHeight":542,"sourceBytes":1847290,"destBytes":1012624,"author":"Pedro Clivati","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*uG0UkNnRV2Gu1ZsitOO6Bg.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-59-37-477_537444bf3c7b572e.webp","https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VgfQ8Pywjh_0aV2xPLbK_Q.gif":null,"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ofa1q5TtQz4vx29J4BFUmQ.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-59-48-420_f0e03e29a2bd7141.webp","https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=870be6462264":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-59-38-797_25cd1d7e67977efa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617987552122}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:59:12","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:59:12","feedId":9175,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:59:12 +0000","fetchMs":403,"handleMs":19,"totalMs":134536,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ee7dcad84751b3133a91709509a32bb9","hostName":"us-034*","requestId":"08abced368d14a68b8e6441679806576_9175","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":1616054,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":4,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":3,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx5oss":1},"failGithubMap":{"myreaderx23":1}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:34:55","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:57:29","id":9175,"name":"Growth Hackers - Medium","url":"https://blog.growthhackers.com/feed","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*TGH72Nnw24QL3iV9IOm4VA.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn93@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-57-29-829_7b1d3de1dd751a79.png","description":"The official Medium account of http://GrowthHackers.com.
