As my interest in space grew over the years and writing about this industry became my profession, I felt a deepening sense of regret for missing that glorious moment of triumph in our shared space history. I lived with that regret for decades—right up until April 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Five years ago today, SpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket first stage on a boat.</p>\n<p>I was not prepared for the experience of watching a skinny, black-and-white rocket fall out of the sky against the azure backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/04/like-a-boss-falcon-soars-into-space-and-lands-in-the-ocean/\">land on a small drone ship</a>. As whitecaps crashed into the side of the boat, it seemed like a portal opening into the future. This breakthrough in rocket technology washed away any regrets I had about missing Apollo. In my mind, landing a Falcon 9 first stage at sea represented an essential step toward reducing the cost of getting people and payloads into space and unlocked a bright spacefaring future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754791#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754791&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 12:34:07 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26289200916_16b6adadc1_k-980x653.jpg","linkMd5":"46aabc6d69fb580bc4e3eaac8299a466","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn13@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-48-402_526af4f87b8434c0.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":653,"sourceBytes":51962,"destBytes":27574,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26289200916_16b6adadc1_k-980x653.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn13@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-48-402_526af4f87b8434c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn38@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-49-616_e06aedf7929179b3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LqtNOFjrFFE:QE-KLWH-IgU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn51@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-10-883_632b388f0605ade0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn46@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-49-520_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-49-501_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986508125},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:48","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:48","title":"When asked to fix something, we don’t even think of removing parts","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755231","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JimPennucci_Flickr_SwissArmyKnifeVictorinox-800x532.jpeg\" alt=\"When asked to fix something, we don’t even think of removing parts\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JimPennucci_Flickr_SwissArmyKnifeVictorinox.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2832\" data-width=\"4256\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pennuja/5363518281/in/photostream/\">Jim Pennucci / Flickr</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>As a society, we seem to have mixed feelings about whether it's better to add or subtract things, advising both that \"less is more\" and \"bigger is better.\" But these contradictory views play out across multibillion-dollar industries, with people salivating over the latest features of their hardware and software before bemoaning that the added complexities make the product difficult to use.</p>\n<p>A team of researchers from the University of Virginia decided to look at the behavior underlying this tension, finding in a new paper that most people defaulted to assuming that the best way of handling a problem is to add new features. While it was easy to overcome this tendency with some simple nudges, the researchers suggest that this thought process may underlie some of the growing complexity of the modern world.</p>\n<h2>Let’s add stuff</h2>\n<p>The researchers say they got interested in the topic because they noticed that beyond the admonition that less is more, many fields had specific advice about improvement through subtraction. Editors caution writers about using excess language, social scientists talk about the need to remove barriers, and so on. In contrast, there are few reminders to add stuff to fix problems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755231#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755231&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 20:43:28 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JimPennucci_Flickr_SwissArmyKnifeVictorinox-800x532.jpeg","linkMd5":"ce3ee4e3ea88f7e1f7f29266a26991e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-48-547_deae99ee662f6a1a.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":532,"sourceBytes":64552,"destBytes":27948,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JimPennucci_Flickr_SwissArmyKnifeVictorinox-800x532.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-48-547_deae99ee662f6a1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn62@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-57-633_07ef8941fe57004b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hYsj0qg3Fls:ZkyuLaNQMBY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn39@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-49-531_0b0b39539d2cc5e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn46@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-49-520_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-49-501_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986508130},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:48","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:48","title":"Rocket Report: SpaceX abandons catching fairings, ULA bets on upper stages","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755533","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-Oct-8-2020-0246-2-800x525.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of SpaceX reusing a Falcon 9 rocket.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-Oct-8-2020-0246-2.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1313\" data-width=\"2000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Fairing catcher ship <em>GO Ms. Tree</em> leading the way into Port Canaveral.

(He was ennobled by the Swedish king, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X_Gustav_of_Sweden\">Charles X Gustav,</a> when his diocese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Roskilde\">passed from Danish hands</a> in 1658.) Winstrup died in late December 1679 and was buried in Lund Cathedral in January 1680. When his coffin was opened in the early 19th and 20th centuries, the body was remarkably well-preserved.</p>\n<p>So when the curators of the Lund University Historical Museum heard, in 2012, that the bishop's coffin would be moved to a new burial site outside the cathedral, they joined with scientists in a multidisciplinary collaboration to study the bishop's remains before they were reinterred. The body was X-rayed and CT-scanned, along with the bishop's clothing, various artifacts, and plant and insect remains.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755510#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755510&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 10:45:15 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bishop2-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"72a0c2e5b211c3a613f62cc837b6cd69","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-48-507_026fbcb46b93463b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":33982,"destBytes":24750,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bishop2-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-48-507_026fbcb46b93463b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn57@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-49-530_9540229782f836bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=OGtfsDVbYbY:etKNRTsruOc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-19-681_71711891eca76f1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn46@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-49-520_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-49-501_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986508130},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:48","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:48","title":"2 recent studies sequence DNA from the earliest Homo sapiens in Eurasia","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755625","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BK-excav-800x530.jpg\" alt=\"2 recent studies sequence DNA from the earliest Homo sapiens in Eurasia\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BK-excav.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1632\" data-width=\"2464\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Hajdinjak et al. 2020)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>DNA from the earliest <i>Homo sapiens</i> in Europe adds more detail to the story of our species’ expansion into Eurasia—and our complicated 5,000-year relationship with Neanderthals.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/these-are-the-oldest-homo-sapiens-fossils-ever-found-in-europe/\">earliest traces of our species in Eurasia</a> are a lower molar and a few fragments of bone from Bacho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria, dating to between 46,000 and 42,000 years old. A recent paper describes DNA from those fossils, as well as a 42,000- to 37,000-year-old jawbone from the Oase site in Romania. The results suggest that the early waves of <em>Homo sapiens</em> in Eurasia included several genetically distinct groups, only some of which eventually passed their genes on to modern people. Most of those early Eurasians mingled with Neanderthals fairly often.</p>\n<h2>Paleolithic and ready to mingle</h2>\n<p>Neanderthals had lived in Europe and Asia for at least 350,000 years (and had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/neanderthals-history-is-as-complicated-as-ours/\">a complicated population history of their own</a>) when the first groups of <i>Homo sapiens</i> expanded northward from eastern Africa and the Levant. Today, many populations of modern humans still carry tiny fragments of Neanderthal DNA in our genomes as souvenirs from the mingling of two hominin species 45,000 years ago. But we still don’t know much about how often Neanderthals and <i>Homo sapiens</i> got together during the few millennia when they shared a continent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755625#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755625&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b7nnrOZje3w:eqD3UfVriCw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=b7nnrOZje3w:eqD3UfVriCw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b7nnrOZje3w:eqD3UfVriCw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=b7nnrOZje3w:eqD3UfVriCw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b7nnrOZje3w:eqD3UfVriCw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b7nnrOZje3w:eqD3UfVriCw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:40:21 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BK-excav-800x530.jpg","linkMd5":"4f0db627a7381bde95b1a711dcc6429c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-41-48-424_8cb1e077257744dc.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":530,"sourceBytes":170008,"destBytes":77264,"author":"Kiona N.
