Colored in a remarkably eye-catching green, the glassware stack up on each other when not in use, turning your kitchen-counter into the backdrop of a Western movie. When you do need them for sipping something like Orange Juice, or something more appropriate like &#8216;Green&#8217; Tea, the branch-shaped handles serve as a nifty functional detail, being decorative when you want, and useful when you need them. Don&#8217;t worry though, this adorable set of cactoid-crockery doesn&#8217;t come with spikes and definitely don&#8217;t need watering. Moreover, they&#8217;re freezer and dishwasher-safe too.

rocket!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=277068","description":"<p><iframe title=\"Nominal - Rocket Inspired Rollerball Pen\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mercatorlondon/nominal-rollerball-pen-inspired-by-spacex-rocket/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Remember when &#8216;space pens&#8217; were a rage? They were the only pens that could work in zero gravity and were developed for the express purpose of writing in space. I&#8217;m here, however, to talk about another kind of Space Pen. Inspired by the democratization of space travel and how one private company, founded by Elon Musk is leading the charge to make space-travel accessible to all, the Nominal Pen is literally designed to look like a rocket&#8230; making it perhaps the most literal take on the &#8216;space pen&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The pen&#8217;s name comes from the term &#8216;nominal&#8217;, often used for when everything&#8217;s going smoothly and according to plan. Designed as a celebration of SpaceX&#8217;s recent achievements of being the only private company to send humans to the ISS and bring them back (while even retrieving parts of the spaceship to be reused at a later date &#8211; something nobody&#8217;s ever done), the Nominal Pen models itself on the Falcon series of rockets (the Falcon 9 Block 5 in particular). The pen comes in a similar light+dark metal finish, featuring four retractable legs that open out, allowing it to stand vertically on its own&#8230; after all, it would be quite shameful to have to put a rocket-shaped pen in your pen-stand, right? The Nominal Pen&#8217;s retractable legs are operated by a twist-to-open mechanism machined right into the pen&#8217;s metal body&#8230; while the opposite end of the pen features a magnetic crew-capsule that detaches from the rocket-body! The pen comes in two variants &#8211; a matte aluminum, and glossy steel, and an optional Octo-stand to dock your &#8216;space pen&#8217; on your desk in glorious fashion.</p>\n<p>The Nominal Pen&#8217;s allure lies in its simple yet effective representation. The Falcon rocket&#8217;s relatively cylindrical design carries onto the pen very well, resulting in a piece of stationery that&#8217;s beautiful to look at, comfortable to hold&#8230; and comes fitted with a Schmidt P950M pressurized refill for a smooth writing experience too. The detachable crew-capsule is, to be very honest, a really addictive fidget-toy too, and reveals a metal surface beneath it which can be custom-engraved with your initials&#8230; the closest thing to &#8216;putting yourself on a rocket&#8217;! It would be fairly accurate to say that the Nominal Pen had a pretty successful launch on Kickstarter, and is currently &#8220;blasting&#8221; past its funding goal.</p>\n<p>Oh yes, and it writes in zero-gravity too!</p>\n<p>Designer: Mercator London</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yde.fnd.to/nominal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $88</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-08-24T10:30:33+00:00\">$195</del> (55% off).

November","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=277254","description":"<p><iframe title=\"Aberlite Pro - Professional Beard and Hair Straightener\"

scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Meet the Aberlite Pro, a truly innovative male-grooming product you&#8217;d expect from Dyson, if the company weren&#8217;t so low-key sexist. The Aberlite Pro compresses hours of beard-grooming into mere minutes, with its ionic de-frizzing technology that can take an untidy beard and smoothen it up in no time, giving you a gentlemanly mane that&#8217;s shapely, and makes you look incredible on Zoom meetings, or when you don&#8217;t have to wear that face-mask. Yes, Dyson. Men have grooming needs too.</p>\n<p>The hair on your beard is nearly thrice as thick as the hair growing on your head&#8230; which means it&#8217;s 3x more difficult to manage. While a quick shampoo and comb-down can fix the hair on your head, maintaining and grooming a beard is much more time-consuming and ritualistic. You need to trim, tone, condition, and wax your beard to keep those hairs in line (I say this with utmost confidence as a beard-man myself). Designed to manage that mane around your mandible, the Aberlite Pro is a nifty, comb-shaped device that uses a combination of PTC heating and negative-ionic conditioning technology to smooth that beard. All you need to do is plug it in, set the appropriate heat setting, and comb away. The handle of the brush has an ionizer built into it, coating your beard-hair with negative ions and an anti-static coating as you run the brush up and down. The ions instantly detangle your hair, get them in line, and fix split-ends to make your beard look regular. The anti-static coating prevents the groomed hair from fraying apart for hours. While the ions help get your beard in shape, heat coils around the brush-teeth apply a consistent temperature to your hair, helping straighten them and making them longer. The coils are placed at the base of the teeth, keeping the heat far from your skin, while heat-resistant caps on the tip of each brush tooth prevent your skin from feeling the heat from the brush too. The Aberlite Pro comes with as many as 8 heat settings to choose from (depending on how unruly your beard is), and at its lowest setting, the brush even works on your head, allowing you to effectively style your hair in a swift motion&#8230; because bed-heads are real and the pandemic has only made them worse.</p>\n<p>All that technology (along with a nifty auto-shutoff feature) fits right into a product that&#8217;s hand-held, portable, and literally the size of a regular brush. Designed to work on all sorts of beards, the Aberlite Pro makes it easy to perfectly groom yourself with a mere wave of your hand, saving you time and energy (because who really has the motivation to sit and apply creams, toners, and waxes anymore) and money in the long run too. Its safe, portable design makes it easy to travel with, and that heat + ionization routine should keep your beard groomed for days before you need to use the device again&#8230; Plus the Aberlite Pro begins shipping this month, which gives you enough time to get your hands on one before No-Shave November kicks in. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</p>\n<p>Designer: Dominic Montante</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aberlite-pro-professional.kckb.st/7f508e81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $79</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-09-05T04:46:46+00:00\">$120</del> ($41 Off).

maybe shoelaces?) with its playful vibe. The upcoming ZX 8000 sneaker collaboration was announced by Adidas Originals as a part of its ongoing A-ZX series. Stepping on LEGO blocks but now they can&#8217;t hurt you because you have made allies with the enemy HA!</p>\n<p>Adidas usually has the classic monochromatic shoes with a few bold limited-edition drop and this sneaker design certainly incorporates elements from both brands in a way that none are overpowered &#8211; so you can recognize those Adidas curves but you can also relate to the LEGO colors! Digital sneaker god, Sean Wotherspoon, received a pair ahead of the official release and shared images that unveiled more details like LEGO’s iconic logo on the tongue tag and a miniature LEGO man modeled after him! The detailing on the shoes with grooves and ridges brings in the element of the connecting blocks and the shape of the shoe itself has a very 90&#8217;s Adidas aesthetic. It is refreshing to see a bright red sole on a shoe other than Louboutins. One of the most thoughtful details is the green LEGO block that seems to hold the laces in places and I am assuming this shoe will come with versatile lace options as well.</p>\n<p>The special pair also comes in an equally unique shoebox crafted with interlocking plastic bricks &#8211; while most will find this to be a cute branding touch, it is important to remember the global plastic problem and hold huge brands like Adidas and LEGO accountable. Good sneaker design is cool, but waste-free packaging is cooler and since sneakers are a part of streetwear it would be wise to keep the streets clean. The ZX 8000 is going to be priced at $130 and is set to be released on September 25th, 2020.</p>\n<p>Designer: Adidas and LEGO</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277191\"

class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-277019\" /></p>\n<p>The Helvezzia Tipo-6 exists in a parallel universe where electric vehicles were commonplace back in the 1940s. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised though, if the world, plagued by the 2nd World War and the need to have an efficient way to transport humans and resources, developed electric cars on a mass-production scale.<br />\n[Fun Fact: EVs did, in fact, exist in the 1900s but were soon phased out after the discovery of large petroleum reserves in the USA]</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s step out of that scenario for a second to admire the beauty that is the Helvezzia Tipo-6 concept, an alt-reality race car with a 1940s-inspired exterior and a powerful electric interior. Designed specifically for racing, the Helvezzia Tipo-6 seats just one person with a pretty advanced looking dashboard featuring a steering wheel with gauges and switches, and a secondary set of gauges behind the steering. The car comes with a nice, tubular body, an open cockpit, and wheels that pop out of the bodywork, with hubcaps covering the rims entirely. There&#8217;s even a step knee located to the left of the driver, headlamps with their own covers too, and by far my favorite detail, that ridiculously beautiful chrome grille on the front, added purely for vanity purposes because an EV wouldn&#8217;t really need a radiator. Finally, the Helvezzia Tipo-6 caps off with a chrome rear, giving the entire car quite a unique retro-meets-modern vibe from front to back!</p>\n<p>Designer: Alexander Imnadze Baldini</p>\n<p><img

Open it, however, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a spacious shoulder-hung tote bag that can hold all your items, with individual compartments for your laptop, phone, wallet, a dedicated loop for your keys and AirPods case, and a neat magnetic closure system to seal the bag&#8217;s opening.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something incredibly simple about the way the Monstera appears.

The Fotebag comes with 8L of storage, perfect for taking your laptop/tablet to work, or stepping out for groceries, or just carrying stuff outdoors to the beach or the park. An anodised aluminum hook lets you unhook the strap too, easily allowing you to secure it around handles, bars, and railings if you choose.</p>\n<p>The Monstera Fotebag&#8217;s nylon fabric construction allows it to be lightweight, splash resistant and durable enough to take on all sorts of use-cases. The bag&#8217;s outer fabric repels dust and water with ease, keeping your stuff inside safe and dry, while the bag itself is built to carry as much as 20 kilos without breaking a sweat (a wider strap helps prevent shoulder-strain too). The bags come in 6 colors, although the designers are working on expanding the Monstera&#8217;s color range. Their universal size makes them perfect for practically any sort of scenario, while the easy-going style is perfect for work, recreation, the gym, yoga, or even the supermarket. Besides, the fact that they fold up into a tiny pouch that can slide into your pocket or backpack means it&#8217;s even more convenient to carry your Monstera Fotebag around with you anywhere you go!</p>\n<p>Designer: Loop Design Studio</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kck.st/31uKx0P\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $28</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-09-15T11:22:39+00:00\">$33</del> (16% off).

href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/wood/\">wood</a>? I didn&#8217;t but it feels like something Geppetto would make if he was in 2020! Lucky for us we don&#8217;t have to wait for the master skills of our favorite fable characters, Japanese designer Mikiya Kobayashi has designed a conceptual wooden electric scooter that is especially aimed at those with mobility issues like the often forgotten elderly demographic.</p>\n<p>The electric vehicle is called ILY-Ai and it actually can be counted as a trike because it has three wheels &#8211; two large ones in the front and a balancing one in the rear end. ILY-Ai is carved from solid timber and is a complete aesthetic contrast to the usual sleek, matte, futuristic electric scooters you see. The concept is developed in collaboration with Aisin&#8217;s technology as they are one of the leaders in the world of mobility and they are also well known in Japan for manufacturing automotive parts as well as lifestyle, wellness, energy-related products. Another crucial collaborator is Karimoku, Japan&#8217;s leading wooden manufacturers that helped in picking the right kind of wood so that ILY-Ai worked for indoor and outdoor spaces comfortably.</p>\n<p>Wood adds a warm and cozy element to the design, Kobayashi has retained the natural timber&#8217;s aesthetic for an organic shape/feel. The combination of chestnut wood and aluminum elevates the design and gives it a user-friendly touch while smoothly hiding the latest mobility technology. One important feature that was included for the elderly and for anyone with mobility issues trying to be independent is the safety sensor that automatically stops the scooter when it detects obstacles. Karimoku lends its years of wood-related study to ensure the design is as functional as its form with the clean curves and padded leather seat for comfort. This wooden scooter almost looks like our most nostalgic childhood toy comes alive with a better purpose to serve us in our adult life!</p>\n<p>Designer: Mikiya Kobayashi</p>\n<p><img

href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">camera bag</a> can often be an extremely challenging task given the demanding and everchanging needs of photographers. Some travel with large lenses, others require dedicated storage for a drone, tripod, external flash, or extra clothes on a lengthy shoot. The issue with (and the challenge behind) designing the perfect camera bag revolves around this uncertainty, the fact that cameras and accessories come in different sizes and shapes, and that every photographer has their own setup.</p>\n<p>This lack of a standard set of requirements makes it difficult for any bag to be a jack of all trades, but the OneMo backpack certainly comes excitingly close to being the ultimate photographer&#8217;s bag. Designed to be modular, functional, expandable, durable, and versatile, the OneMo has an answer for any sort of scenario. The bag comes with a spacious 25L inner that can be infinitely segregated using modular walls, allowing you to carefully pack and secure your belongings. Whether it&#8217;s a camera, a microphone, an expensive lens, or just a pair of clothes, these modular walls flex and bend to form the layout you need, changing every time you change your gear. Modular compartments aside, the OneMo even comes with its own detachable storage unit which transforms into a secondary shoulder bag for stuff like drones, lenses, etc. The shoulder bag fits right into the OneMo, but can be removed and carried separately, or independently too, giving you the flexibility to travel with all your gear or carry just the essentials. Use just the shoulder bag for short-range shots, or the camera backpack + shoulder bag for a long shoot spanning 2-3 days &#8211; the OneMo gives you the flexibility you need.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The OneMo backpack</a> comes with three points of entry, allowing you to quickly access parts of the bag based on your need. A zip on the top lets you easily access a jacket or your laptop, while a quick-access entry on the side lets you swiftly grab your camera. The full-access zip runs along the back, allowing you to completely open up your backpack and view all its contents in one go. Zip it open and the OneMo reveals perhaps one of my favorite features&#8230; dedicated battery storage. These tiny battery compartments come with their own red-green sliders, allowing you to mark the battery inside as empty (red) or full (green) so you never accidentally pick up a dead battery. A multitude of other pouches (accessible from both the inside and the outside) allow you to store cables, power banks, your phone, or even your cards in their own RFID blocking pocket. There&#8217;s a little something for everyone in the OneMo and its accompanying shoulder-bag, even for people who want to carry more than the bag can accommodate.</p>\n<p>The OneMo backpack and shoulder bag both come with expandable storage, allowing you to add as many as 10 extra liters to the existing 25L backpack. The expandable storage on the backpack is big enough to fit an entire gimbal, so you don&#8217;t need to set it up every time, while the shoulder bag&#8217;s expandable storage and dedicated pockets are perfectly sized to fit DJI Mavic combos, including drones, smart remote controller, cables and batteries. Additional straps on the outside let you secure bulkier items like sleeping bags or blankets as well as suspend tripods off the side. The OneMo&#8217;s design doesn&#8217;t just accommodate all types of gear, it accommodates every sort of lifestyle too. The bag&#8217;s outer body is crafted from a special tear-proof and scratch-proof polyester, and padded straps + a ventilated back panel keep you cool and breezy as you carry your gear along with you. If the weather takes a turn for the worse, the bag&#8217;s waterproof construction is more than equipped to shake off any droplets that fall on it. For more extreme situations, a hidden rain-cover comes integrated into the bag&#8217;s base, allowing you to secure your expensive gear and protect them from the elements. Couple that versatility, modularity, expandability, and durability along with the OneMo&#8217;s lifetime warranty and you have a pretty strong contender for the title of the ultimate photographer&#8217;s bag!</p>\n<p>Designer: Ying Zhang of PGYTECH</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click Here to Buy Now: $199.90</a>.</strong> Use Coupon Code: <strong>Yankodesign</strong> to get $5 off and Free Shipping to USA!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277045\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/OneMo_backpack_holds_all_your_creative_tools.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">OneMo Backpack</h4>\n<p>The OneMo is a modular, functional, expandable, durable, and versatile two-in-one bag designed to hold all your creative tools.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277055\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/how-one-company-designed-the-ultimate-camera-bag-for-every-photographer/OneMo_backpack_holds_all_your_creative_tools_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"823\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Quick Access Entry</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/162/854/8cc79c476fd2d574818187c6e27efe93_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1573397409&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=b9e826a6e7a43ae24c88c30140dbab7f\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" /></a></p>\n<p>Get the item you need in seconds with OneMo backpack quick side opening.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Built-In Pouch Mode</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pgytech.com/collections/acessories-collection/products/onemo-backpack?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=yankodesign&#38;utm_campaign=OneMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0252/2395/4525/files/content-item3-pic1.gif?13590\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" /></a></p>\n<p>With a separate shoulder strap, the built-in expandable sling bag gives you more choices in how you travel.

too…","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=277196","description":"<p><iframe title=\"Introducing Apple Watch Series 6 — It Already Does That\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCMnrssX1NE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&#8220;It Already Does That&#8221;&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you watched the keynote just a few hours/minutes back (depending on when you&#8217;re reading this), the words &#8220;It Already Does That&#8221; will sound incredibly familiar to you. The words are proof of two things. A. The Apple Watch is a pretty remarkable device, and B. It&#8217;s so remarkable there&#8217;s little you can do to really improve it.</p>\n<p>There was an entire video in Apple&#8217;s keynote dedicated to what the Apple Watch can already do &#8211; which is a testament to the company&#8217;s vision and cutting edge technology, but it also goes to show that the Apple Watch 6 isn&#8217;t VASTLY better than the Apple Watch Series 5. It&#8217;s just slightly better, and comes with a few embellishments to make it seem &#8216;new and better&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The keynote starts with what a great life-saving device the Apple Watch is, and Tim Cook, like literal clockwork, talks about how he loves to read letters every day from Watch owners about how the miraculous device saved their life. This isn&#8217;t really too different from any of the previous Apple Watch reveals over the last 2-3 years. The Watch is a great device when it comes to keeping track of your vitals &#8211; that hasn&#8217;t changed &#8211; and it still tracks your heart rate, heart rhythm, EKG, and can tell if you&#8217;ve fallen or not&#8230; it already does that. This year, the Watch 6 comes with a built-in blood oximeter that can calculate the amount of oxygen in your blood by using infrared sensors to detect the color of your blood and parse it through well-written algorithms. The Blood Oximeter feature comes at a great time &#8211; given the nature of this pandemic, but it raises two questions. What feature would Apple have showcased had it not been for COVID-19? And how many of us will really use it after the pandemic&#8217;s long gone?</p>\n<p>The Blood Oximeter runs on a new set of sensors embedded into the watch, but aside from that, there&#8217;s really no hardware upgrades to talk about other than the new S6 chipset and a larger, moderately brighter screen. It&#8217;s still the same old Apple Watch, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing, because the Apple Watch is a pretty remarkable device&#8230; but it isn&#8217;t a great thing either. The Blood Oximeter aside, the Watch 6 does practically everything the Watch 5 does. Like I mentioned earlier, it comes with a heart-rate monitor, a sleep tracker, an EKG machine, an always-on display, an e-sim, and all the fitness tracking features your heart could desire. In short, &#8220;It already does that&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Most of the Watch 6&#8217;s noteworthy upgrades come with WatchOS 7 and its UI, led by Alan Dye, VP of Human Interface Design and a successor to Jony Ive. The Watch 6 boasts of new faces that allow you to access a whole myriad of features and information right from the face of the watch. You could choose a minimal watch face, an artistic one (in collaboration with Geoff McFetridge), a color-striped one to correspond with your clothes, your home team, or Pride, a face that shows you your vitals, your appointments, or various time-zones, and even a Memoji Watch Face. Apple&#8217;s made improvements to its Nike and Hermès Watch-lines too, and even launched a Product Red version of the Watch 6 along with a &#8216;new type of single-loop&#8217; silicone strap they call the Solo Loop.</p>\n<p>I honestly believe there isn&#8217;t much Apple can do to make subsequent Watches &#8216;vastly&#8217; better. The Watch 6, at least according to me, is the pinnacle of smartwatch innovation and perhaps the only thing that can make it an absolute home-run is the ability to calculate blood-sugar without needing to prick your skin. The Watch 6 puts Apple in a very tough position because I&#8217;m struggling to think of what more a Watch could do, but that&#8217;s probably me living inside a box. The &#8220;It Already Does That&#8221; video seems a lot like foreshadowing for a disappointing Watch Series 7, because it&#8217;s honestly hard to think of any new feature to put inside the damned wearable. That being said, Cook and his team did a great job so far, especially considering how now every part of the watch is made entirely from ethically sourced materials, recycled metals and plastics, with 100% renewable energy and no harmful chemicals. Oh, and the Watch 6 ships without a charging cable too, in Apple&#8217;s effort to help cut down on e-waste (although I wouldn&#8217;t call that an upgrade as a consumer). It&#8217;s worth noting that Apple&#8217;s even promised to completely carbon neutral by as early as 2030&#8230; here&#8217;s to hoping we all live to see that day, eh?</p>\n<p>Designer: <a

Given the oddly shaped house, the focal point of the villa is this large kitchen-dining room with sloped ceilings. The residents of the house have a penchant for finely designed carpentry, which caused the designer to pay extra attention to the details, like this drawer design. “I knew it was going to be a kitchen design, which I am also happy about in 10 years, but which, conversely, could also have been designed 10 years ago. That is the essence of Danish design for me &#8211; that it is timeless.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277132\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/furniture-designed-with-hidden-details-that-put-your-ikea-furniture-to-shame-part-5/03-Terrazzo-Bench_Furniture-Details_yankodesign1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277148\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/furniture-designed-with-hidden-details-that-put-your-ikea-furniture-to-shame-part-5/03-Terrazzo-Bench_Furniture-Details_yankodesign3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"592\" /></p>\n<p>Designed by <a href=\"https://osandoos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OS &#38; OOS Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://klaaskuiken.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Klaas Kuiken</a> with materials supplied by StoneCycling, this Terrazzo Bench is a sustainable solution for the increasing amount of glass waste produced in Zanzibar. “Zanzibar is an island with about 1 million inhabitants.
