Aside from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/iphone-13-and-13-pro-review-if-you-could-have-three-wishes/\">a couple of exceptions</a>, it is the main charging, data, and display port for nearly all modern phones, tablets, and laptops. The European Union has even proposed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/european-union-announces-plans-to-require-all-mobile-devices-to-use-usb-c/\">making it mandatory in all devices</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the USB-C connector has always been related to but separate from the other specifications in the USB protocol. USB-C cables can use 2.0 or 3.2 speeds, they can support multiple charging wattages, they can either have or not have Thunderbolt support, and even Thunderbolt cables can be either \"active\" or \"passive.\" The connector is the same, but the capabilities aren't.</p>\n\n<p>The group behind USB-IF has always taken a hands-off approach to this problem, choosing to solve it not with top-down mandates but with certification and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/universal-usb-type-c-chargers-get-a-new-certification-program-from-the-usb-if/\">optional logos</a>. Today, the group <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210930005098/en/USB-IF-Announces-New-Certified-USB-Type-C%C2%AE-Cable-Power-Rating-Logos\">announced</a> a new batch of logos (<a href=\"https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/USB-IF_Cable%20Power%20Rating%20USB4%20Logo%20Announcement_FINAL.pdf\">PDF</a>) intended to demystify the USB-C 2.1 and USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) 3.1 standards that were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/new-usb-c-type-2-1-standard-offers-up-to-240-w-power-delivery/\">announced earlier this year</a>. Among other tweaks, the new logos account for USB 4 support, as well as an increased maximum USB-PD charging wattage, from the old maximum of 100 W up to a new maximum of 240 W.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799747#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799747&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:22:04 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NewUSBImage_for_PR_FINAL_v21-800x450.jpeg","linkMd5":"6f1cf8bd872239e249433d939f6377c9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn14@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-22-362_4f85f2a3ab263830.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":81737,"destBytes":38030,"author":"Andrew Cunningham","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NewUSBImage_for_PR_FINAL_v21-800x450.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn14@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-22-362_4f85f2a3ab263830.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn76@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-30-041_dc748ceec243baa4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Ue4HBflrogk:h6PzWGqzkNs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn80@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-29-968_9f89afb5a02e84b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-950_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054073187},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","title":"Jon Stewart’s new Apple TV+ series: Old man yells at cloud—but it hits the spot","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799516","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stewart-apple-listing-800x423.png\" alt=\"Jon Stewart is back on TV to set some things on fire.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stewart-apple-listing.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1352\" data-width=\"2560\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Jon Stewart is back on TV to set some things on fire. (credit: Apple TV+ / Busboy)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>In Jon Stewart's first-ever conversation with an Apple TV+ studio audience, he offers a curious send-off—in fact, it argues against the point of <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-stewart-returns-with-current-affairs-series-for-apple-exclusive-4083290/\">his new multi-million dollar hosting deal</a>. \"You're probably just going to look at aggregated clips of\" this first episode of <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/umc.cmc.4fcexvzqezr25p9weks6sxpob\"><em>The Problem With Jon Stewart</em></a>, he says, instead of subscribing to Apple TV+. It's a bit meandering, followed by a joke about pirating episodes of <em>Ted Lasso</em>.</p>\n<p>If anybody can show up to a new streaming service and make a joke at the expense of subscriptions, it's probably Stewart. Online video sharing—and we're talking the renegade kind, uploaded by fans and shared freely—greatly contributed to <em>The Daily Show</em>'s massive cultural footprint before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/jon-stewart-leaving-the-daily-show-later-this-year/\">Stewart left that show behind in 2015</a>. And as you may have noticed, the TV landscape has dramatically changed since then. These days, every major player is throwing stuff at the video-streaming wall to see what sticks (or, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/quibi-streaming-service-shutting-down-after-less-than-one-year-1-75-billion/\">in Quibi's case last year, what absolutely doesn't</a>).</p>\n<p>So after six years off the \"fake news\" desk, what path does Stewart and Apple's new production take? His aforementioned joke may suggest a series that's meant to be shared and remixed in small clips, but <em>The Problem</em> arrives with a different modus operandi: empathy, not sound bites, and patience, not pulverization. You can arguably pluck out some zingers tailor-made for quick swipes on a service like TikTok, but Stewart seems more invested in relishing the full 44 minutes of each episode. As a result, this fake-news innovator spends the runtime of his new series punting the \"fake\" out of his reputation, expectations be damned.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799516#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799516&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 17:25:43 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stewart-apple-listing-800x423.png","linkMd5":"23238a1fedbbc33f86916ae29a8fb6a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-10-651_08158cd2801fc495.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":423,"sourceBytes":383250,"destBytes":14616,"author":"Sam Machkovech","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stewart-apple-listing-800x423.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-10-651_08158cd2801fc495.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn79@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-30-030_7290f022125a220b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=BsRzllT4ytI:OVSBgSpuiRo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-30-034_f9bd953032c320e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-950_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054073189},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","title":"Nreal Air sunglasses let you watch TV in AR","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799636","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nreal-Air-Front-980x551.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Nreal plans to release its specs in the US.

That’s pretty much what augmented reality (AR) glasses company Nreal is going for with the Nreal Air announced today. With a light, 2.72 ounce (77 g) weight and micro-OLED display, the Nreal Air is just what you need to finally watch <em>Parks and Recreation</em> in an actual park.</p>\n<p>Since Nreal released the <a href=\"https://www.nreal.ai/light\">Nreal Light </a>in 2019, AR tech has evolved so hardware offerings can be smaller. The Nreal Air is 27 percent lighter than the Nreal Light (3.74 ounces/106 g), although it also comes with less functionality. There’s no handtracking or spatial awareness, so you can’t interact with what you see. Instead, you’ll have to rely on an app on your smartphone, which must be tethered to the Nreal Air for it to work (as is the case with the Nreal Light).</p>\n<p>This is because the Nreal Air isn’t about dragging and dropping furniture around your virtual home or trying on outfits via a virtual avatar before buying, or other, more interactive AR applications. Instead, Nreal is targeting the Nreal Air primarily at watching videos on YouTube and other streaming apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799636#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799636&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 16:00:20 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nreal-Air-Front-980x551.jpg","linkMd5":"bc16a9cc5a9651abe29e362334904ffd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn11@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-14-275_3ad00510854d03a5.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":551,"sourceBytes":29621,"destBytes":16436,"author":"Scharon Harding","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nreal-Air-Front-980x551.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn11@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-14-275_3ad00510854d03a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-30-022_01463ad29d63d6a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=em2MuxPL_Ek:rUheGyZmcp4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn82@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-30-034_c0c3960f826a1071.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-950_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054073186},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","title":"Theranos device failed pharma evaluation, while lab director cleared it for seven tests","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799647","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-493352668-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-493352668.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.

Was that good or bad, the prosecution asked her? “Bad,” Sung replied.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799647#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799647&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:50:14 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-493352668-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"40508a12efcf8c2468a375a4bb6b43d8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-18-307_4ca891da0c413027.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":70729,"destBytes":24496,"author":"Tim De Chant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-493352668-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-18-307_4ca891da0c413027.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn24@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-30-045_78f2e9a13f47f078.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=dOjuuJyN0u4:Dj_ZLN1Wv3U:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn78@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-30-056_969be08efd5cb1e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-950_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054073187},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","title":"Liquid metal encased in hydrogel makes a promising energy-harvesting device","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791073","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hydrogelTOP-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Researchers at North Carolina State University have created a soft and stretchable device that converts movement into electricity.

It produces small amounts of electricity comparable to other energy-harvesting technologies, and it can also operate in water as well as air, according to the team's <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.202103142\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Advanced Materials.

The 2013 researchers found they could harvest energy from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-layer_capacitance\">electrical double-layer capacitor</a> (ELCD) by depressing arrays of water droplets sandwiched between two rigid electrodes, thereby spontaneously charging the capacitor. But the rigidity proved to be a shortcoming, since electricity was only generated by moving the stiff electrode up and down.

While their organization and the way they transfer data through layers of processing may share some rough similarities to networks of actual neurons, the data and the computations performed on it would look very familiar to a standard CPU.</p>\n<p>But neural networks aren't the only way that people have tried to take lessons from the nervous system. There's a separate discipline called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/07/pocket-brains-neuromorphic-hardware-arrives-for-our-brain-inspired-algorithms/\">neuromorphic computing</a> that's based on approximating the behavior of individual neurons in hardware. In neuromorphic hardware, calculations are performed by lots of small units that communicate with each other through bursts of activity called spikes and adjust their behavior based on the spikes they receive from others.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Intel released the newest iteration of its neuromorphic hardware, called Loihi. The new release comes with the sorts of things you'd expect from Intel: a better processor and some basic computational enhancements. But it also comes with some fundamental hardware changes that will allow it to run entirely new classes of algorithms. And while Loihi remains a research-focused product for now, Intel is also releasing a compiler that it hopes will drive wider adoption.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799694#p3\">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799694&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:00:36 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:V_sGLiPBpWU","linkMd5":"dac060a397726fcc5a3cc703eb76fbce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-12-131_f3179e7a1fdd51e3.webp","destWidth":66,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1009,"destBytes":340,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-12-131_f3179e7a1fdd51e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=W23JWIzANPQ:pQ8rZ_emLsg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn44@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-30-024_abd6c06e91e46d2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-950_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054073190},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","title":"Sony acquires its most prominent remaster studio, Bluepoint Games","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799744","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wws-standard-hero-desktop-01-en-03jun21-800x450.png\" alt=\"Sony acquires its most prominent remaster studio, Bluepoint Games\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wws-standard-hero-desktop-01-en-03jun21.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1148\" data-width=\"2040\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/corporate/playstation-studios/\">Play Station</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>After months of speculation, it's finally official: Sony is acquiring <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/demons-souls-ps5-review-a-gorgeous-game-worth-dying-repeatedly-for/\"><em>Demon's Souls</em></a> developer Bluepoint Games.</p>\n<p>News of Bluepoint's addition to the PlayStation Studios roster shouldn't surprise many. The Austin-based studio turned heads with 2018's <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> remake before tackling its redux of FromSoftware's <em>Demon's</em> for the PS5. It has been a longtime independent collaborator with Sony, remastering critical favorites like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/uncharted/\">Uncharted</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/\">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, and <em>Gravity Rush</em>, and it has almost exclusively worked with PlayStation-branded properties. (Other than <em>Metal Gear</em>, Bluepoint's only other third-party project was its 2014 port of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/titanfall/\"><em>Titanfall</em></a> for the Xbox 360.)</p>\n\n<h2>A long history with Sony</h2>\n<p>Rumors that Sony would be buying the developer date back to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/sony-purchases-returnal-developer-housemarque-after-successful-ps5-debut/\">company's acquisition</a> of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/returnal-review-roguelite-arcade-combat-has-never-felt-this-epic-or-hard/\"><em>Returnal</em></a> developer Housemarque in June. That's when the PlayStation Japan Twitter account accidentally tweeted out a PlayStation Studios splash image that included key art from both <em>Returnal</em> and <em>Demon's Souls</em> alongside other established Sony games. Naturally, the tweet was quickly deleted, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338\">not before the image was saved</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799744#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799744&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 21:46:51 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wws-standard-hero-desktop-01-en-03jun21-800x450.png","linkMd5":"e6144e5c2d954f9a0b8bd63cca302736","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn25@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-27-947_05b64aa0349b9f90.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":545979,"destBytes":43158,"author":"Steve Haske","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wws-standard-hero-desktop-01-en-03jun21-800x450.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn25@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-27-947_05b64aa0349b9f90.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-30-081_b3aee5c2eee854f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J9WWVIYGSQQ:TEQXcR3L78Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn93@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_ddbc06a5a371e160.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-003_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-950_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054073186},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:07:53","title":"Settlement forces Amazon to tell workers they can’t be fired for organizing","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799634","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-costa-cunningham-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Rally of tech workers holding signs that say, \" amazon stop silencing workers.><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-costa-cunningham.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1050\" data-width=\"1400\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Tech workers show support for Maren Costa (left) and Emily Cunningham (right) on Sept 16, 2021.
