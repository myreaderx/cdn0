Beijing has ignored the ruling.<br />\n <br />\nOther islands and atolls in the South China Sea are contested by Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines. China considers much of the resource-rich sea its territory — overlapping with the territorial claims of other nations — and has created hundreds of hectares of artificial islands to bolster its territorial claims.<br />\n <br />\nThe U.S. frequently conducts freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea to dispute China's claims and to promote free passage through international waters that carry half the world's merchant fleet tonnage, worth trillions of dollars each year.<br />\n </p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 16:59:09 +0000","feedId":11989,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c10abcbcb589986cd5073375196c07c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1626116352218}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:59:12","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:59:12","feedId":11989,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:59:12 +0000","fetchMs":54895,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":54902,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"79b59b7ab14b8d981e3d8a220e20848a","hostName":"us-005*","requestId":"8eb823e84663403ea09ddcfd97418b9c_11989","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:14","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:29:25","id":11989,"name":"Voice of America - English","url":"http://www1.voanews.com/templates/Articles.rss?sectionPath=/persian/news","subscriber":258,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.voanews.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn64@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-29-22-244_364f38fed0b5c9e2.ico","description":"VOA Articles","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1626116297317,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":54896,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
