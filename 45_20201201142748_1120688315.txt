Then, for the first time, the company attempted to recover the Electron booster's first stage from the ocean after this launch, and now Rocket Lab has provided a preliminary assessment of the vehicle's condition.</p>\n<p>In summary, the company said in <a href=\"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/how-to-bring-a-rocket-back-from-space/\">an update on its website</a>, \"We couldn't have asked for a better outcome of our first recovery attempt and the team is thrilled.\" The rocket came back in such good condition, the company added, \"We will re-qualify and re-fly some components.\"</p>\n\n<p>The November 20 flight marked the first time Rocket Lab has fished an Electron out of the Pacific Ocean. The rocket was picked up in the waters off the coast of New Zealand, where the small booster launches from. Founder Peter Beck said the company wanted to assess the health of the first stage—and make necessary modifications to heat-shield and flight software—before going to the final step of catching the Electron rocket midair with a helicopter.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1726391#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1726391&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:30:05 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Return-to-Sender-1-980x735.jpg","linkMd5":"fafaaad7420cb27135b68e865887c321","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn11@2020_1/2020/12/01/14-27-19-178_74b0897508c6a71a.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":735,"sourceBytes":75966,"destBytes":51314,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Return-to-Sender-1-980x735.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn11@2020_1/2020/12/01/14-27-19-178_74b0897508c6a71a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn28@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-30-722_21c53302d3c8341a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=X4Zk5Q4-T-0:OhKL9HAgcyY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/01/14-27-46-621_5af6d45b7da079bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-40-726_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn23@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-27-20-246_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832838825}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:18","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:18","feedId":45,"fetchDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:27:18 +0000","fetchMs":63,"handleMs":72,"totalMs":29602,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"0ee86a5c743ee2ecbe52c7cbbd91eaa1","hostName":"europe21*","requestId":"c82ee0e4eaee413b9d60d358260525a8_45","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":52860,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":5,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":5,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx24":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx31":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:41","id":45,"name":"Science – Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/science","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn40@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-23-39-453_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
