Since then, we’ve been working with select collaborators to explore how depth can be used across a range of use cases to enhance AR realism. </p><p>Today, we're taking a major step forward and announcing the Depth API is available in ARCore 1.18 for Android and Unity, including AR Foundation, across hundreds of millions of compatible Android devices. </p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bhpSif30EY0/XvOSjkrC7lI/AAAAAAAAI_4/YfBjSqZWzu0SpbyGt6Pzpfs0mhDmq4f7QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/E714_DepthLab_DepthMap_v01.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"653\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bhpSif30EY0/XvOSjkrC7lI/AAAAAAAAI_4/YfBjSqZWzu0SpbyGt6Pzpfs0mhDmq4f7QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/E714_DepthLab_DepthMap_v01.gif\" style=\"width:200px\" /></a><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g5DoeNzZh-Y/XvOSrPtYyCI/AAAAAAAAI_8/Of_8YwymbVs7srF6uKfkOoMhrcLiN4_DwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/depth2.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"235\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g5DoeNzZh-Y/XvOSrPtYyCI/AAAAAAAAI_8/Of_8YwymbVs7srF6uKfkOoMhrcLiN4_DwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/depth2.gif\" style=\"width:200px\"/></a></div><p id=\"imgCaption\">Generate a depth map without specialized hardware to unlock capabilities like occlusion</p> <p>As we highlighted last year, a key capability of the Depth API is occlusion: <i>the ability for digital objects to accurately appear behind real world objects</i>.

Dr. Soo Wan Kim, Camera Technical Product Manager at Samsung commented on the future that the Depth API and ToF unlocks saying, “Depth will enrich user's AR experience in many perspectives. It will reduce scanning time, and can detect planes fast, even low textured planes. These will bring seamless experiences to users who will be able to use AR apps more easily and frequently.” In the coming months, Samsung will update their <i>Quick Measure</i> app to use the ARCore Depth API on the Galaxy Note10+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra. </p><center><a

Manager and Steven Bazyl, Developer Advocate for G Suite</em><p><p>Let’s talk about the basics of G Suite Add-ons. G Suite Add-ons simplify how users get things done in G Suite by bringing in functionality from other applications where you need them. They provide a persistent sidebar for quick access, and they are context-aware -- meaning they can react to what you’re doing in context. For example, a CRM add-on can automatically surface details about a sales opportunity in response to an email based on the recipients or even the contents of the message itself.  </p><p>Up until recently, G Suite Add-ons leaned on Apps Script to build Add-ons, but choice is always a good thing, and in some cases you may want to use another scripting language.. So let’s talk about how to build Add-ons using additional runtimes:  </p><p>First, additional runtimes don't add any new capabilities to what you can build. What it does give you is more choice and flexibility in how you build Add-ons. We’ve heard feedback from developers that they would also like the option to use the tools and ecosystems they’ve already learned and invested in. And while there have always been ways to bridge Apps Script and other backends that expose APIs over HTTP/S, it isn't the cleanest of workarounds. .  </p><p><strong>So let’s look at a side by side comparison</strong> of what it looks like to build an Add-on with alternate runtimes:  </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">function homePage() {<br />  let card = CardService.newCardBuilder()<br />    .addSection(CardService.newCardSection()<br />      .addWidget(CardService.newTextParagraph()<br />        .setText(\"Hello world\"))<br />    ).build();<br />  return [card];<br />}</pre>  <p>Here’s the hello world equivalent of an Add-on in Apps Script. Since Apps Script is more akin to a serverless framework like GCF, the code is straightforward -- a function that takes an event and returns the UI to render. </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Hello world Node.js<br />const express = require('express');<br />const app = express();<br />app.use(express.json());<br /><br />app.post('/home', (req, res) => {<br />  let card = {<br />    sections: [{<br />      widgets: [{<br />        textParagraph: {<br />          text: 'Hello world'<br />        }<br />      }]<br />    }]<br />  };<br />  res.json({<br />    action: {<br />      navigations: [{<br />        pushCard:  card<br />      }]<br />    }<br />  });<br />}</pre>  <p>This is the equivalent in NodeJS using express, a popular web server framework. It shows a little bit more of the underlying mechanics -- working with the HTTP request/response directly, starting the server, and so on. </p><p>The biggest difference is the card markup -- instead of using CardService, which under the covers builds a protobuf, we're using the JSON representation of the same thing.  </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">function getCurrentMessage(event) {<br />  var accessToken = event.messageMetadata.accessToken;<br />  var messageId = event.messageMetadata.messageId;<br />  GmailApp.setCurrentMessageAccessToken(accessToken);<br />  return GmailApp.getMessageById(messageId);<br />}<br /></pre><p>Another area where things differ is accessing Google APis. In Apps Script, the clients are available in the global context -- the APIs mostly 'just work'.  Moving to Node requires a little more effort, but not much. </p><p>Apps Script is super easy here. In fact, normally we wouldn't bother with setting the token when using more permissive scopes as it's done for us by Apps Script. We're doing it here to take advantage of the per-message scope that the add-on framework provides. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">const { google } = require('googleapis');<br />const { OAuth2Client } = require('google-auth-library');<br />const gmail  = google.gmail({ version: 'v1' });<br /><br />async function fetchMessage(event) {<br />    const accessToken = event.gmail.accessToken;<br />    const auth = new OAuth2Client();<br />    auth.setCredentials({access_token: accessToken});<br /><br />    const messageId = event.gmail.messageId;<br />    const res = await gmail.users.messages.get({<br />        id: messageId,<br />        userId: 'me',<br />        headers: { 'X-Goog-Gmail-Access-Token': event.gmail.accessToken },<br />        auth<br />    });<br />    return res.data;<br />}<br /></pre><p>The NodeJS version is very similar -- a little extra code to import the libraries, but otherwise the same -- extract the message ID and token from the request, set the credentials, then call the API to get the message contents. </p><p><h2>Your Add-on, Your way</h2></p><p>One of the biggest wins for alternate runtimes is the testability that comes with  using your favorite IDE, language, and framework--all of which helps you make developing add-ons more approachable.  </p><p>Both Apps Script and alternate runtimes for G Suite Add-ons have important places in building Add-ons. If you’re getting into building Add-ons or if you want to prototype more complex ones, Apps Script is a good choice.. If you write and maintain systems as your full time job, though, alternate runtimes allow you to use those tools to build your Add-on, letting you leverage work, code and processes that you’re already using. With alternate runtimes for G Suite Add-ons, we want to make it possible for you to extend G Suite in a way that fits your needs using whatever tools you're most comfortable with. </p><p>And don't just take our word for it, hear from one of our early access partners. Shailesh Matariya, CTO at Gfacility has this to say about alternate runtimes: \"We're really happy to use alternate runtimes in G Suite Add-ons. The results have been great and it's much easier to maintain the code. Historically, it would take 4-5 seconds to load data in our Add-on, whereas with alternate runtimes it's closer to 1 second, and that time and efficiency really adds up. Not to mention performance, we're seeing about a 50% performance increase and thanks to this our users are able to manage their workflows with just a few clicks, without having to jump to another system and deal with the hassle of constant updates.\" </p><p><h2>Next Steps</h2></p><p>Read the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes-overview\">developer documentation</a> for Alternate Runtimes and sign up for the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK8Tv9VinvMhI_navvsjLbNTcmFr1Xr-bbK3iYVRaZI85IiQ/viewform\">early access program</a>.  </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/po04OFR_b44\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 16:50:00 +0000","feedId":10167,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-woNLs9iCd58/Xz6pdl-1JHI/AAAAAAAAJRE/JGfOlTEoIVklD7kMaYr4Hx2JohaDqr9BQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Untitled%2Bdesign%2B%25284%2529.png","linkMd5":"37efc37cc0dc8d3793ab2d91f5efbf53","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn69@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-46-09-948_36718b6e8f313c78.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":240334,"destBytes":53384,"author":"Google Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-woNLs9iCd58/Xz6pdl-1JHI/AAAAAAAAJRE/JGfOlTEoIVklD7kMaYr4Hx2JohaDqr9BQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Untitled%2Bdesign%2B%25284%2529.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn69@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-46-09-948_36718b6e8f313c78.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/po04OFR_b44":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn33@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-46-36-991_393445ccefc30004.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316369789},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:09","title":"Summer updates from Coral","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GDBcode/~3/7Si33axai8c/coral-summer-2020-updates.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7hpTQLwV7FY/XxdLMJ-YUbI/AAAAAAAAJKc/pD8jCobVq4Ao31abPxEh3Lza1Q5zM642QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Coral_Summer_2020_v3.png\">\n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7hpTQLwV7FY/XxdLMJ-YUbI/AAAAAAAAJKc/pD8jCobVq4Ao31abPxEh3Lza1Q5zM642QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Coral_Summer_2020_v3.png\"> <p><em>Posted by the <a href=\"http://coral.ai\">Coral Team</a></em><p> <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7hpTQLwV7FY/XxdLMJ-YUbI/AAAAAAAAJKc/pD8jCobVq4Ao31abPxEh3Lza1Q5zM642QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Coral_Summer_2020_v3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7hpTQLwV7FY/XxdLMJ-YUbI/AAAAAAAAJKc/pD8jCobVq4Ao31abPxEh3Lza1Q5zM642QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Coral_Summer_2020_v3.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"1043\" /></a><p>Summer has arrived along with a number of Coral updates. We're happy to announce a new partnership with balena that helps customers build, manage, and deploy IoT applications at scale on Coral devices. In addition, we've released a series of updates to expand platform compatibility, make development easier, and improve the ML capabilities of our devices. </p><p><h3>Open-source Edge TPU runtime now available on GitHub</h3></p><p>First up, our Edge TPU runtime is now open-source and <a href=\"https://github.com/google-coral/libedgetpu\">available on GitHub</a>, including scripts and instructions for building the library for Linux and Windows. Customers running a platform that is not officially supported by Coral, including ARMv7 and RISC-V can now compile the Edge TPU runtime themselves and start experimenting. An open source runtime is easier to integrate into your customized build pipeline, enabling support for creating Yocto-based images as well as other distributions. </p><p><h3>Windows drivers now available for the Mini PCIe and M.2 accelerators</h3></p><p>Coral customers can now also use the <a href=\"https://coral.ai/docs/m2/get-started#2b-on-windows\">Mini PCIe and M.2 accelerators on the Microsoft Windows platform</a>. New Windows drivers for these products complement the previously released Windows drivers for the USB accelerator and make it possible to start prototyping with the <a href=\"https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started#1c-on-windows\">Coral USB Accelerator on Windows</a> and then to move into production with our Mini PCIe and M.2 products. </p><p><h3>New fresh bits on the Coral ML software stack</h3></p><p>We’ve also made a number of new updates to our ML tools: </p>\n    <ul> \n     <li>The Edge TPU compiler is now version 14.1. It can be updated by running <code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install edgetpu</code>, or follow the <a href=\"https://coral.ai/software/#debian-packages\">instructions here</a> <li>Our new Model Pipelining API allows you to divide your model across multiple Edge TPUs. The C++ version is currently in beta and the source is <a href=\"https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu/tree/master/src/cpp/pipeline\">on GitHub</a> <li>New <a href=\"https://coral.ai/models/#on-device-retraining-classification\">embedding extractor models</a> for EfficientNet, for use with <a href=\"https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/retrain-classification-ondevice-backprop/\">on-device backpropagation</a>. Embedding extractor models are compiled with the last fully-connected layer removed, allowing you to retrain for classification. Previously, only Inception and MobileNet were available and now retraining can also be done on EfficientNet <li>New Colab notebooks to <a href=\"https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-coral/tutorials/blob/master/retrain_classification_ptq_tf2.ipynb\">retrain a classification model with TensorFlow 2.0</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/google-coral/tutorials\">build C++ examples</a></li></li></li></li>\n    </ul><p><h3>Balena partners with Coral to enable AI at the edge</h3></p><p>We are excited to share that the Balena fleet management platform now supports Coral products! </p><p>Companies running a fleet of ML-enabled devices on the edge need to keep their systems up-to-date with the latest security patches in order to protect data, model IP and hardware from being compromised. Additionally, ML applications benefit from being consistently retrained to recognize new use cases with maximum accuracy. Coral + balena together, bring simplicity and ease to the provisioning, deployment, updating, and monitoring of your ML project at the edge, moving early prototyping seamlessly towards production environments with many thousands of devices. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.balena.io/blog/balena-partners-with-coral-to-enable-ai-at-the-edge/\">Read more</a> about all the benefits of Coral devices combined with balena container technology or get started deploying container images to your Coral fleet with this <a href=\"https://github.com/balena-io-examples/coral-streaming-object-detector\">demo project</a>. </p><p><h3>New version of Mendel Linux</h3></p><p><a href=\"https://coral.ai/software/#mendel-linux\">Mendel Linux</a> (5.0 release Eagle) is now available for the Coral Dev Board and SoM and includes a more stable package repository that provides a smoother updating experience. It also brings compatibility improvements and a new version of the GPU driver. </p><p><h3>New models</h3></p><p>Last but not least, we’ve recently released BodyPix, a Google person-segmentation <a href=\"https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/11/updated-bodypix-2.html\">model</a> that was previously only available for TensorFlow.JS, as a <a href=\"https://github.com/google-coral/project-bodypix\">Coral model</a>. This enables real-time privacy preserving understanding of where people (and body parts) are on a camera frame. We first demoed this at CES 2020 and it was one of our most popular demos. Using BodyPix we can remove people from the frame, display only their outline, and aggregate over time to see heat maps of population flow. </p>\n    <div id=\"flexParent\">\n     <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rFkCjXuhHHY/XxdM5iQ1W8I/AAAAAAAAJKk/2GR4m3KHB10rsw3vT4WNyHAhrrcpcxpKACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/gif1.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"flexImg\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rFkCjXuhHHY/XxdM5iQ1W8I/AAAAAAAAJKk/2GR4m3KHB10rsw3vT4WNyHAhrrcpcxpKACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/gif1.gif\" data-original-width=\"512\" data-original-height=\"288\" /></a>\n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2JSd2PgT2vc/XxdM-yhbzfI/AAAAAAAAJKo/72OuU4KSM085ODUqFqJwlXK1u3r6KCkvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/gif2.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"flexImg\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2JSd2PgT2vc/XxdM-yhbzfI/AAAAAAAAJKo/72OuU4KSM085ODUqFqJwlXK1u3r6KCkvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/gif2.gif\" data-original-width=\"512\" data-original-height=\"288\" /></a>\n    </div><p id=\"imgCaption\">Here are two possible applications of BodyPix: Body-part segmentation and anonymous population flow. Both are running on the Dev Board.</p><p>We’re excited to add BodyPix to the portfolio of projects the community is using to extend our models far beyond our demos—including tackling today’s biggest challenges. For example, Neuralet has taken our MobileNet V2 SSD Detection model and used it to implement <a href=\"https://neuralet.com/docs/tutorials/smart-social-distancing/\">Smart Social Distancing</a>. Using the bounding box of person detection, they can compute a region for safe distancing and let a user know if social distance isn’t being maintained. The best part is this is done without any sort of facial recognition or tracking, with Coral we can accomplish this in real-time in a privacy preserving manner. </p><p>We can’t wait to see more projects that the community can make with BodyPix. Beyond anonymous population flow there’s endless possibilities with background and body part manipulation. Let us know what you come up with at our <a href=\"https://coral.ai/support\">community channels</a>, including GitHub and StackOverflow. </p><p>\n     <center>\n      ________________________\n     </center></p><p>We are excited to share all that Coral has to offer as we continue to evolve our platform.

But as people spend more and more time at home during these challenging times, it’s important that we invest in additional ways to work with developers to build a more useful connected home.  </p><p>Today, at the <a href=\"https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/heyg-smart-home-summit#\">\"Hey Google\" Smart Home Virtual Summit</a>, we gave updates on our latest smart home initiatives, talked more in-depth about the new smart home controls in Android 11, and previewed some platform tools that we're investing in to make devices easier to set up and work with Google Assistant.  </p><h2>Smart Home for Entertainment Device support with Google Assistant</h2>  <p>As many of us continue to stay home, smart devices are being used a lot more. With the biggest growth coming from entertainment devices, we’re increasing our support in this area with our Smart Home API.  </p><p>Last year, we launched Google Assistant support for <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-new-smart-home-shed-types-and-traits.html\">Smart Home for Entertainment Device (SHED)</a> device types and traits, including TVs, remotes, set-top boxes, speakers, soundbars, and even game consoles from top brands like Xbox, Roku, Dish, and LG. And now, we are making these APIs public for any Smart TV, set-top box or game developers to use. SHED gives users the ability to control their favorite entertainment devices from any Assistant-enabled smart display, smart speaker or mobile device.  </p><h2>Smart Home controls in Android 11 </h2><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8hH-uSCmqU/XwXyYFEz_kI/AAAAAAAAJGs/yzXAANQnkC8KzsWFWQaaDjGSws0HtY9yQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/smarthomecontrols.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" style=\"width:200px\" id=\"floatRight\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8hH-uSCmqU/XwXyYFEz_kI/AAAAAAAAJGs/yzXAANQnkC8KzsWFWQaaDjGSws0HtY9yQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/smarthomecontrols.png\" data-original-width=\"450\" data-original-height=\"940\" /></a><p>With the release of Android 11, coming out later this year, we are introducing a dedicated space for Smart Home controls that users can find quickly, and access any time. We’ve redesigned the power menu to make devices linked to Google Assistant just a button-press away.   </p><p>Users with the Home App can choose all, or just their favorite controls to be in the space. For partners, you get this for free - there’s no new development work required. We’ll have sliders which will allow you to adjust specific settings, like the temperature of your thermostat in the morning, or how far to open the blinds. You can also customize what devices are visible from the control space and whether these devices can be accessible in your lockscreen.   </p><h2>Improved state reporting and reliability</h2>  <p>With Android 11, we want to give users a quick and easy way to check or adjust the devices in their home. And as we continue to add new surfaces for device control, it becomes more critical to ensure we have accurate state. In the coming months, we’ll be introducing tools to measure your reliability and latency to help improve and debug state reporting. Once you hit key targets for reliability and latency, we will shift from a default of querying your state to using report state to render stateful controls. This will reduce query volume on your servers and improve the user experience with accurate device state across multiple surfaces. </p><p>In addition to state accuracy, the best user experience comes with strong reliability and low latency. To help achieve both, we launched local execution with the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/local\">Local Home SDK</a> back in April.  As part of the Smart Home platform, local fulfillment can extend your Smart Home Action and routes commands to devices through the local network, benefitting users with reduced latency and higher reliability by removing an additional cloud hop. </p><p>To ease the development process, the Local Home platform supports both Chrome and Node.js runtime environments, as well as building and testing of apps on local development machines or personal servers. Once you've deployed your local fulfillment app, users will benefit immediately without having to upgrade hardware or manually update firmware. Nanoleaf and Yeelight have already enabled local execution for their devices. It’s available to all developers through the Actions on Google Console.   </p><h2>Improving linking</h2>  <p>Implementing a high quality integration is important - it reduces churn and delights users. Yet, it’s still challenging to get users to discover these features, and we’re doing a couple of things on our end to increase the funnel of users linked to your action. We are excited to launch <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/account-linking#oauth-based_app_flip\">OAuth-based App Flip</a> on the developer console today. With AppFlip, we streamline the standard account linking flow by flipping users from the Google Home App to the Partner app to gather consent without requiring the users to re-enter their credentials.  </p><p>To increase awareness of your Action, you will soon be able to initiate the account linking flow within your app. There will also be more opportunities to increase awareness through feature promotion and in-app notification using your app, and we will have more details on discovery and linking opportunities later this year.  </p><h2>Robust monitoring, logging, analytics tools</h2>  <p>We know that visibility into the behavior of your smart home integrations is critical, from debugging in early development to detailed analytics in production. To enhance developer productivity, we've integrated with the powerful monitoring and troubleshooting tools available in Google Cloud Platform to provide detailed event logs and usage metrics for smart home projects. </p><p>We’ve also recently <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/announcing-enhanced-smart-home-analytics.html\">launched</a> new <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/monitoring-logging\">tools</a> to help developers improve the reliability of their integrations and aid in debugging and resolving issues quickly. You can view aggregate metrics directly in the developer console, or build logs-based metrics to find trends and gain deeper insights into common problems. Google Cloud Platform also enables developers to build custom alerts to quickly identify production issues. </p><p>You can also find a new Smart Home Analytics Dashboard accessible from the developer console and pre-populated with charts for common metrics such as Daily Active Users and Request Breakdown — giving you an overall picture of your integration's behavior. This dashboard is powered by new usage and performance metrics in Google Cloud Monitoring, giving you the power to set alerts and be notified if your integration has an issue. Get started today by going to the “Analytics” tab in the Actions console or the Google Cloud console to check out these new logs, metrics, and alerting capabilities for your projects! </p><h2>Updates to Device Access program </h2>  <p>Last year, we announced that we’re moving from the Works with Nest program to Works with Google Assistant and build on a foundation of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access\">privacy and data security</a> to ensure users have confidence in how Google and our partners are protecting the consumer’s home data.  </p><p>As part of that effort, we created the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9539279?hl=en\">Device Access</a> program to provide a way for partners to integrate directly with Nest devices. To support the Device Access program, we will soon launch the Device Access Console, a self-serve console that guides commercial developers  through the different project phases: development, certification and pilot testing, and finally production. </p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XMXoklSvnaI/XwXyJkHZ_aI/AAAAAAAAJGo/k5GCs4ezVzo_0GFg4RNwBzLK8QRYGubVgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/deviceaccess.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XMXoklSvnaI/XwXyJkHZ_aI/AAAAAAAAJGo/k5GCs4ezVzo_0GFg4RNwBzLK8QRYGubVgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/deviceaccess.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"771\" /></a><p>For a commercial developer the console allows them to manage your various projects and integrations. It also provides development guides and trait documentation for all supported Nest devices. Individuals who want to create their own automations with their Nest devices will be able to do so with this console, but only for the homes they are a member of. </p><h2>Expanding routines </h2>  <p>One of the most popular features with Nest users is the ability to automatically trigger routines based on whether users are <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9251759?hl=en\">Home or Away</a>. Later this year, similar functionality will be available with Google Assistant through occupancy detection.  </p><p>Sleep is also a critical part in maintaining our overall well-being as we stay more at home. Last year we <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/home/spring-healthy-habits-help-google-home/\">launched</a> the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9304145?hl=en#:~:text=The%20Gentle%20Sleep%20and%20Wake,minutes%20to%20imitate%20the%20sunrise.\">Gentle Sleep & Wake feature</a> with Philips Hue, which slowly brightens or dims the lights at a specific time or can be tied to your morning alarms. Just say, “Turn on Gentle Wake up” to your bedroom speaker to ‘set it and forget it.’ The <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/traits/lighteffects\">Light Effects trait</a> is now public so all developers can integrate their native Sleep or Wake experiences - in fact LIFX has recently launched! We encourage you to build and integrate your own unique experiences. We’ll have a larger launch moment later this year when we launch emulated Sleep and Wake effects so that it’ll work out of the box for any smart light!  </p><p>Another way partners will be able to innovate on our platform and provide more helpful experiences to users is by extending personal routines with custom routines designed by partners, available in the coming months. Developers will be able to create and suggest routines, not just for their devices, but that can work with other devices in a customer’s home. You’ll be able to create solutions for your customers that are based on your core business and bring value to your customers - whether it’s wellness, cleaning, or entertainment. Users will be able to browse and opt-in to approved routines and choose to have Nest and other devices react and participate in that routine.  </p><p>Our Smart Home efforts have grown significantly over the past several years. We now have integrations with thousands of partners covering all the major connected product categories and devices, and will continue our ambitious goal to build deeper in-home integrations.

We are excited to announce the release of new Smart Home Entertainment Device (SHED) types and traits. These new device types and traits compliment the original set we released earlier this year, and help build out a more complete solution for smart home media and gaming devices. By implementing these types and traits on your entertainment devices, you can enable users to fully access device and media controls from any Assistant surface.</p> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1BpmnMhElkk/XvzLtKaV-zI/AAAAAAAAJDs/YVeXCyyqqEEuDXudtICtR_rYKidYY5lWwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/SHED_updated.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1BpmnMhElkk/XvzLtKaV-zI/AAAAAAAAJDs/YVeXCyyqqEEuDXudtICtR_rYKidYY5lWwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/SHED_updated.png\" data-original-width=\"1182\" data-original-height=\"330\" /></a> <p id=\"imgCaption\">SHED Types and Traits</p> <p>To expand the SHED options, we've released the following new device types for Smart Home: </p><ul> <li>Audio-video receiver  <li>Streaming box  <li>Streaming stick  <li>Soundbar  <li>Streaming soundbar  <li>Speaker </li></ul><p>We've also released the following new trait: </p><ul> <li>Channel </li></ul><p>To ensure a consistent, high-quality experience for all end users, each of these device types require your service to report <code>activityState</code> and <code>playbackState</code> to Google using the ReportState API. This requirement improves the portability between media devices and helps the Assistant better understand user intents for these devices. By implementing the complete set of recommended device traits, you can further improve the quality of your smart home Action and improve device targeting for media playback command fulfilment. </p><p>For more information on how to implement these new device features, check out the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/devices-traits\">docs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/actions-on-google/smart-home-nodejs\">samples</a>.

<p><em>Posted by Meher Vurimi, Product Manager</em><p><p>For more than seven years, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/\">Google Cast</a> has made it easy for users to enjoy your content on the big screen with Chromecast or a Chromecast built-in TV. We’re always looking to improve the casting experiences, which is why we’re excited to introduce <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_tv_receiver\">Cast Connect</a>. This new feature allows users to cast directly to your Android TV app while still  allowing control from your sender app. </p><p><h2>Why is this helpful?</h2></p><p>With <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast?hl=en\">Google Cast</a> your app is the remote control - helping users find, play, pause, seek, stop, and otherwise control what they’re watching. It enables you to extend video or audio from your Android, iOS, or Chrome app to a TV or sound system. With <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tv\">Android TV</a>, partners are able to build apps that let users experience your app's immersive content on their TV screen and control with a remote.  </p><p>With <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_tv_receiver\">Cast Connect</a>, we are combining the best of both worlds; first, by prioritizing playback via the Android TV app to deliver a richer and more immersive experience, and second, by allowing the user to still control their experience from your Android, iOS or Chrome app, and now, also directly using their Android TV’s remote control. Cast Connect helps the user easily engage with other content directly on the TV instead of  only having to use your mobile device to browse for additional content.  </p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZS4A6rR3e0/XyySUJOuHSI/AAAAAAAAJOg/tifV44XDdkwwfBz7dpyHvQllAxHt_ufLgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/STAN_CastConnect_v3%2B3.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZS4A6rR3e0/XyySUJOuHSI/AAAAAAAAJOg/tifV44XDdkwwfBz7dpyHvQllAxHt_ufLgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/STAN_CastConnect_v3%2B3.gif\" data-original-width=\"957\" data-original-height=\"537\" /></a><p id=\"imgCaption\">Cast Connect User Journey on  Stan</p><p><h2>Availability</h2></p><p>We’re working closely with a number of partners on bringing Cast Connect to their Apps and, most recently, we’re excited to announce that <a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/all-access/?gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1275739&ref=__iv_p_1_g_15527027287_w_kwd-170170805047_h_9032188_ii__d_c_v__n_g_c_247169935667_l__t__e__r__vi__&ftag=AAM03c5ced&vndid=google$null$null$cbs.all%20access&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpfDwga3L6gIVXx-tBh05RwXGEAAYASAAEgITYfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&_ivgu=5ed10151-d6e8-4681-b3d6-8b067c2b7fa2\">CBS</a> and our Australian SVOD partner, <a href=\"https://www.stan.com.au/\">Stan</a> have launched Cast Connect. Starting today, the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/atv_receiver/packages\">Cast Connect library</a> is available on Android, iOS and Chrome. To get started with adding Cast Connect to your existing framework, head over to the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_tv_receiver\">Google Cast Developers</a> site.

It's unsurprising that so many engineers find writing documentation is the most painful part of their job. If you would like to teach your colleagues to become writers, the good news is Google's fun and interactive technical writing course materials are free and available for everyone to use! Alternatively, if you're a developer who would like to learn how to write more clearly, you can read through the course work for yourself or convince a colleague to teach the course at your organisation! </p><p>We researched documentation extensively, and it turns out that the best sentences in the world consist primarily of words. Our self-paced and facilitator-led courses will not only help software engineers choose the right words but also help to make the whole writing process a lot less scary. Perhaps software engineers won't become William Shakespeare or even William Shatner overnight, but hopefully they will gain the confidence to write something worth publishing. As working from home becomes more common, good documentation has never been more important in enabling software engineers to work independently.  </p><h2>Courses overview</h2><p>Google introduced the technical writing courses, Technical Writing One and Technical Writing Two, in 2015. Since then, thousands of Google software engineers and product managers have taken and enjoyed the courses. In February 2020, we released the courses to the world.  </p><p>The classes have the following structure: </p><ul> <li>Students complete self-study work before attending the live class. The self-study work is valuable on its own, even for students who will never attend the live class.  <li>A facilitator guides students through a live class. The live class features practical exercises, class discussion, and extensive peer-to-peer feedback. Note that Google does not lead these live courses but provides extensive material to help facilitators prepare to lead them. </li></ul><p>Organizations can choose to host the live classes virtually or in-person. </p><h2>Technical Writing One</h2><p>The first course, Technical Writing One, covers the basics of technical writing. Students learn to start thinking about their audience before even putting pen to paper. For example, in one exercise, students are challenged to write instructions for putting toothpaste on a toothbrush. That might sound relatively simple, but here's the catch - your audience has never brushed their teeth before. That's not to say they have bad oral hygiene, but they don't even know what a toothbrush is. The exercise aims to get students to think about documenting a completely new technology. </p><p>Another important lesson that Technical Writing One teaches you is how to shorten the sentence length in your documentation and how to edit unnecessarily long sentences. Hopefully once you have taken the course, you might edit the preceding sentence down to something like the following: <del>Another important lesson that</del> <strong>Technical Writing One teaches you </strong><del>is</del> <strong>to shorten sentences <del>length in your documentation and how to edit unnecessarily long sentences</del></strong>.  </p><p>The course also advocates using lists instead of walls of text, so here, in list form, are some other topics it covers: </p><ul> <li>Using active voice instead of passive voice.  <li>Revising text into clear paragraphs.  <li>Learning various self-editing techniques. </li></ul><h2>Technical Writing Two</h2><p>Technical Writing Two builds on the techniques from the first course and is for those who already know verbs from adverbs. The course encourages students to express their creative side. For example, in one exercise, students find the best way to illustrate technical concepts.

What’s at the heart of this growth is the simple insight that people want a more natural way to get what they need. That’s why we’ve invested heavily in making sure Google Assistant works seamlessly across devices and services and offers quick and accurate help.  </p><p>Over the last few months, we’ve seen people’s needs shifting, and this is reflected in how Google Assistant is being used and the role that it can play to help navigate these changes. For example, to help people get accurate information on Search and Maps - like modified store hours or information on pick-up and delivery - we have been using <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/covid-19-how-were-continuing-to-help/\">Duplex</a> conversational technology to contact businesses and update over half a million business listings.  </p><p>We’ve also been working with our partners to bring great educational experiences into the home, so that families can continue learning in a communal setting. Bamboo Learning is bringing their voice-forward education platform to Google Assistant, with fun, new ways to learn history, math, and reading. Our <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/google-fit/be-healthy-at-home/\">hand-washing songs</a> continue to be popular. The songs leverage WaveNet's natural expressiveness – allowing us to train Google Assistant to sing across numerous generated voices users can pick from.  </p><h2>Building Google Assistant experiences gets easier</h2>  <p>Great experiences are at the core of what makes Google Assistant truly helpful. To help existing and aspiring developers build new experiences with ease, we are making some major improvements to our core platform and development tools. Rather than needing to hop back and forth between <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/console\">Actions Console</a> and Dialogflow to build an Action, wouldn’t it be great if there were one integrated platform for building on Google Assistant? </p><p>Starting today, we’re releasing <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/announcing-actions-builder-actions-sdk.html\">Actions Builder</a>, a new web-based IDE that provides a graphical interface to show the entire conversation flow. It allows you to manage Natural Language Understanding (NLU) training data and provides advanced debugging tools. And, it is fully integrated into the Actions Console so you can now build, debug, test, release, and analyze your Actions - all in one place.  </p><p>If you prefer to  work in your own tools, you can use the updated <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/announcing-actions-builder-actions-sdk.html\">Actions SDK</a>. For the first time, you’ll have a file based representation of your action and the ability to use a local IDE. The SDK not only enables local authoring of NLU and conversation schemas, but it also allows bulk import and export of training data to improve conversation quality.  The Actions SDK is accompanied by a command line interface, so you can build and manage an action fully in code using your favorite source control and continuous integration tools. </p><p>With these two releases, we are also introducing a new conversation model and improvements to the runtime engine. Now, it’s easier to design and build conversations and users will get faster and more accurate responses. We’re very excited about this suite of products which replaces Dialogflow as the preferred way to develop conversational actions on Google Assistant. </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--IVuvw89EHs/Xuk9n7rekvI/AAAAAAAAI6Q/bC6HOmMRKuYVPgbsyWK4e3hEFgkdviHDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Actions%2BBuilder%2Bscreenshot%2B1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--IVuvw89EHs/Xuk9n7rekvI/AAAAAAAAI6Q/bC6HOmMRKuYVPgbsyWK4e3hEFgkdviHDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Actions%2BBuilder%2Bscreenshot%2B1.jpg\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"996\" /></a></p><h2>New functionality to create interactive voice actions </h2>  <p>Based on feedback from developers, we’re also adding new functionality to build more interactive experience on Google Assistant with Home Storage, updated Media API and Continuous Match Mode.  </p><p>One of the exciting things about speakers and smart displays is that they’re communal. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/storage-home\">Home Storage</a> is a new feature that provides a communal storage solution for devices connected on the home graph and allows developers to save context for all individual users, such as the last saved point from a puzzle game. </p><p>  </p><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ARDnV3HDorc/Xuk9tGLjIDI/AAAAAAAAI6U/w4N8FFNCkUUuGtmT_iUkwsIJO2w-TP5twCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/homeStorage.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ARDnV3HDorc/Xuk9tGLjIDI/AAAAAAAAI6U/w4N8FFNCkUUuGtmT_iUkwsIJO2w-TP5twCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/homeStorage.gif\" data-original-width=\"722\" data-original-height=\"518\" /></a></p><p>Our updated Media APIs now support longer-form media sessions and lets users resume playback of content across surfaces. For example, users can start playback from a specific moment or resume where  they dropped out of their previous session. </p><p>Sometimes you want to build experiences that enable users to speak more naturally with your action, without waiting for a change in mic states. Rolling out in the next few months, Continuous Match Mode allows Assistant to respond immediately to a user’s speech for more fluid experiences by recognizing defined words and phrases set by you. This is done transparently so that before the mic opens, Assistant will announce the mic will stay open temporarily so users know they can speak freely without waiting for additional prompts. For example, CoolGames is launching a game in a few weeks called, “Guess The Drawing” that uses Continuous Match Mode to allow the user to continuously guess what the drawing is until they get it right. The game is also built with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/interactivecanvas\">Interactive Canvas</a> for a more visual and immersive experience on smart displays.  </p><h2>Bringing AMP to smart displays</h2>  <p>In addition to making it easy for you to build new experiences for Google Assistant, we also want to bring the depth of great web content together with the simple and robust <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/amp\">AMP</a> framework to deliver new experiences on Smart Displays. AMP allows you to create compelling, smooth websites that have a great user experience. AMP compliant articles are coming to smart displays later this summer with News. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months as we expand to enable more web content categories for Smart Displays. </p><p>With these tools, we want to empower developers to build helpful experiences of the future with Google Assistant, enabling people to get what they need more simply, while giving them time back to focus on what matters most. </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/d6rNew0LewU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:27:00 +0000","feedId":10167,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--IVuvw89EHs/Xuk9n7rekvI/AAAAAAAAI6Q/bC6HOmMRKuYVPgbsyWK4e3hEFgkdviHDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Actions%2BBuilder%2Bscreenshot%2B1.jpg","linkMd5":"316ff33df050a7639516c9c8bff26d03","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-46-09-922_e13c9a87e9a87ef2.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":996,"sourceBytes":97267,"destBytes":31080,"author":"Google Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--IVuvw89EHs/Xuk9n7rekvI/AAAAAAAAI6Q/bC6HOmMRKuYVPgbsyWK4e3hEFgkdviHDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Actions%2BBuilder%2Bscreenshot%2B1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-46-09-922_e13c9a87e9a87ef2.webp","https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ARDnV3HDorc/Xuk9tGLjIDI/AAAAAAAAI6U/w4N8FFNCkUUuGtmT_iUkwsIJO2w-TP5twCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/homeStorage.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn81@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-46-42-318_ccafc0bf8e8be4ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/d6rNew0LewU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn30@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-46-35-943_c504f34bfcfc101e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316369799},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:09","title":"Join 24 Hours of Google Cloud Talks by DevRel ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GDBcode/~3/9zHGMtBrlxc/join-24-hours-of-google-cloud-talks-by-devrel.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YPiQwJPVK6M/XukBjj1VLoI/AAAAAAAAI50/yfQ5SXnlSv8-xmhKTdtMOhdOAfuUOPf_gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-16%2Bat%2B10.29.40%2BAM.png\"><img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YPiQwJPVK6M/XukBjj1VLoI/AAAAAAAAI50/yfQ5SXnlSv8-xmhKTdtMOhdOAfuUOPf_gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-16%2Bat%2B10.29.40%2BAM.png\"><p><em>Posted by Greg Wilson, Director of Cloud Developer Advocacy</em><p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YPiQwJPVK6M/XukBjj1VLoI/AAAAAAAAI50/yfQ5SXnlSv8-xmhKTdtMOhdOAfuUOPf_gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-16%2Bat%2B10.29.40%2BAM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YPiQwJPVK6M/XukBjj1VLoI/AAAAAAAAI50/yfQ5SXnlSv8-xmhKTdtMOhdOAfuUOPf_gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-16%2Bat%2B10.29.40%2BAM.png\" data-original-width=\"1240\" data-original-height=\"368\" /></a><p>Google Cloud is excited to announce a global, 24-hour event as part of our new <a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/google-cloud-talks\">Google Cloud Talks by DevRel Series</a>.

Building an integration between your software platform and another comes with a laundry list of things to think about: your vision, your users, their experience, your partners, APIs, developer docs, and so on. Caught between two different platforms, many constraints, and limited time, you're probably wondering: how might we build the most intuitive and powerful user experience? </p><p>Imagine making a presentation, with Google Slides you have all sorts of templates to get you started, and you can build a great deck easily. But, to build a seamless integration between two software platforms, those pre-built templates don’t exist and you basically have to start from scratch. In the best case scenario, you’d create your own components and layer them on top of each other with the goal of making the UI seem just about right. But this takes time. Hours longer than you want it to. Without design guidelines, you're stuck guessing what is or is not possible, looking to other apps and emulating what they've already done. Which leads us to the reality that some add-ons have a suboptimal experience, because time is limited, and you're left to build only for what you know you can do, rather than what's actually possible.  </p><p>To simplify all of this, we’re introducing the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/848275628252039675\">G Suite Add-ons UI Design Kit</a>, now live on Figma. With it you can browse all of the components of G Suite Add-ons’ <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/card-interfaces\">card-based interface</a>, learn best practices, and simply drag-and-drop to create your own unique designs. Save the time spent recreating what an add-on will look like, so that you can spend that time thinking about how your add-on will work .  </p><p>While the UI Design Kit has only been live for a little over a month, we’ve already been hearing feedback from our partners about its impact.  </p><p>“Zapier connects more than 2,000 apps, allowing businesses to automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks. When building these integrations, we want to ensure a seamless experience for our customers,” said Ryan Powell, Product Manager at Zapier. “However, a partner’s UI can be difficult to navigate when starting from scratch. G Suite’s UI Design Kit allows us to build, test and optimize integrations because we know from the start what is and is not possible inside of GSuite’s UI.” </p><h2>Here’s how to use the UI Design Kit:</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Find and duplicate design kit </p><ul> <li>Search for G suite on Figma community or use this <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/848275628252039675\">link</a> <li>Open G Suite Add Ons UI Design Kit  <li>Just click the duplicate button. </li></ul><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KnEqsG7lrcM/Xwd1_onTuyI/AAAAAAAAJHQ/o6yKT__5yDoqPcwuyjj9gP88oW7ar2__wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step1.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KnEqsG7lrcM/Xwd1_onTuyI/AAAAAAAAJHQ/o6yKT__5yDoqPcwuyjj9gP88oW7ar2__wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step1.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Choose a template to begin </p><ul><li>Go to UI templates page <li>Select a template from the list of templates</ul><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_cpxSYXkIqs/Xwd2TLTaelI/AAAAAAAAJHY/LrYUoMhrMKESSUGMDt2qjM5cMD3R_wROgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step2.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_cpxSYXkIqs/Xwd2TLTaelI/AAAAAAAAJHY/LrYUoMhrMKESSUGMDt2qjM5cMD3R_wROgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step2.gif\" data-original-width=\"512\" data-original-height=\"338\" /></a><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Copy the template and detach from symbols to start editing</p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F7_rGeJSfEo/Xwd2gJknxXI/AAAAAAAAJHc/bJkelUCJG94JkIbn4jmZFjZI6V4hTdi-ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F7_rGeJSfEo/Xwd2gJknxXI/AAAAAAAAJHc/bJkelUCJG94JkIbn4jmZFjZI6V4hTdi-ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><p><strong>Helpful Hints: Features to help you iterate quickly</strong></p><p>Build with auto layout, you don’t need to worry about the details. </p><ul> <li>Copy paste maintains layout padding & structure. </li></ul><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nte6fdZqbD4/Xwd27kJljPI/AAAAAAAAJHo/W5xCh_hzrPcdezz-bCnHX3qF7cG4h6fmgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3b.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nte6fdZqbD4/Xwd27kJljPI/AAAAAAAAJHo/W5xCh_hzrPcdezz-bCnHX3qF7cG4h6fmgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3b.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><ul><li>Maintained padding & structure while editing.</li></ul><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0Sc7XEuxFAU/Xwd3KQTv_GI/AAAAAAAAJHs/k0XvZQeMhhYVWxlHwa3hLhMDHHdtHcC0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3c.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0Sc7XEuxFAU/Xwd3KQTv_GI/AAAAAAAAJHs/k0XvZQeMhhYVWxlHwa3hLhMDHHdtHcC0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3c.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><ul><li>Built in fixed footer and peek cards.</li></ul><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xz6LLnEOYko/Xwd3bKyerpI/AAAAAAAAJH0/TSdkXqZf6VwuEZgS0JYEPOAZNbldm49fACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3d.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xz6LLnEOYko/Xwd3bKyerpI/AAAAAAAAJH0/TSdkXqZf6VwuEZgS0JYEPOAZNbldm49fACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3d.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><p>Visualize your design against G-Suite surfaces easily.</p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gg-ghXE7f-g/Xwd3lF33SkI/AAAAAAAAJH8/winxa_xuZyo1ehMuNHzP_6yttk0arec-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3e.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gg-ghXE7f-g/Xwd3lF33SkI/AAAAAAAAJH8/winxa_xuZyo1ehMuNHzP_6yttk0arec-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/step3e.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><p>Documentation built right into the template. </p><ol> <li>Go to the component page (e.g section)  <li>Find layout + documentation / api links on respective pages</ol><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x2cFoL7iqWA/Xwd5i8Z0LmI/AAAAAAAAJIU/ACqkt_2b_ywUI_Qf5KO4IZoQqeJFaenFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/lastgif.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x2cFoL7iqWA/Xwd5i8Z0LmI/AAAAAAAAJIU/ACqkt_2b_ywUI_Qf5KO4IZoQqeJFaenFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/lastgif.gif\" data-original-width=\"1531\" data-original-height=\"1012\" /></a><h2>Next Steps to Consider:</h2><p>With G Suite Add-ons, users and admins can seamlessly get their work done, across their favorite workplace applications, without needing to leave G Suite.

As we make changes we must address features that are no longer compatible with the latest architecture and business requirements. </p>\n <p>The JSON-RPC protocol (<a href=\"http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification\">http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification</a>) and Global HTTP Batch (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/classroom/guides/batch\">example</a>) are two such features. Our support for these features was based on an architecture using a single shared proxy to receive requests for all APIs. As we move towards a more distributed, high performance architecture where requests go directly to the appropriate API server we can no longer support these global endpoints.<a name=\"more\"></a></p>\n <p>We had originally planned to decommission these features by Mar 25, 2019. However, it came to our attention that few highly impacted customers might not have received the earlier notification. </p>\n <p>As a result, we are extending the deprecation timeline to Aug 12, 2020, when we will discontinue support for both these features. Please note the timeline extension to Aug 12, 2020 does not apply to Places API. Please visit <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GDBcode/~3/hHSfS_4jwCs/ https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/client-migration\">Places SDK for iOS migration</a> for information on Places API migration. </p>\n <p>Starting February 2020 and running through August 2020, we will periodically inject errors for short windows of time.

Please see the guidance below which will help ease the transition. </p>\n <h2><strong>Planned downtime</strong></h2> \n <p>To enable customers to identify systems that depend on these deprecated features, before the final turndown date is reached, there will be scheduled downtime for Global Batch and JSON-RPC starting from February 2020 and running through August 2020. </p>\n <p>Below are details and schedule of periodic error injection windows, details of the downtime in June and July will be confirmed nearer the time, so please check back this <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/discontinuing-support-for-json-rpc-and.html\">blog post</a> for the latest schedule. </p>\n <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EniMfDvdDgM/XwSwta5ae8I/AAAAAAAAJF0/vPIPsEWo794_UfXbvvoDeUB9kHFQPam6ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/updated.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EniMfDvdDgM/XwSwta5ae8I/AAAAAAAAJF0/vPIPsEWo794_UfXbvvoDeUB9kHFQPam6ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/updated.jpg\" data-original-width=\"1275\" data-original-height=\"1502\" /></a> \n <h2><strong>How do I know if I should migrate ?</strong></h2> \n <h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">JSON-RPC</span></strong></h3> \n <p>To identify whether you use JSON-RPC, you can check whether you send requests to <code><em>\"https://www.googleapis.com/rpc\"</em></code> or <code><em>\"https://content.googleapis.com/rpc\"</em></code>.

Today, we are launching OAuth-based App Flip, a new feature to help you build a better mobile account linking experience. App Flip allows your users to seamlessly link their accounts to Google without having to re-enter their credentials if they have already signed in to your app on their device. This streamlined authorization flow helps minimize users dropping out of the account linking process, and makes it easier for users to integrate your smart devices into their smart homes. This feature is now available for all Smart Home Actions and is available in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZSd7lh675uFZ-Xb49xYx-HBv0jDoN0gsrjj3GBBGgyT5ELg/viewform\">beta</a> for other Conversational Actions.   </p><p>When App Flip is implemented within your application, the Google Assistant or Google Home app automatically flips to your app when users initiate the account linking process. Once users consent to link their accounts, your app then requests an authorization code from your server, and Google handles the remainder of the account linking flow.  </p> <center><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-atnh_wEX2qI/XwNq9C6_ZjI/AAAAAAAAJFQ/ATFbkVMXU3Ad7Uy0ewYyGlSoMzCcOqBvACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/OAuthAccountLinkingFlows.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-atnh_wEX2qI/XwNq9C6_ZjI/AAAAAAAAJFQ/ATFbkVMXU3Ad7Uy0ewYyGlSoMzCcOqBvACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/OAuthAccountLinkingFlows.png\" data-original-width=\"583\" data-original-height=\"627\" /></a></center><p id=\"imgCaption\">Account Linking Flows</p><p>By flipping directly to your local app, users can skip logging in again and can simply choose to link their accounts.   </p><p>You can implement App Flip by enabling your app to accept a deep link that allows Google to connect. We also have test tools available for both <a href=\"https://github.com/googlesamples/identity-appflip-tester-android\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/googlesamples/identity-appflip-tester-ios\">iOS</a> to help you verify your app integration with App Flip.  </p><p>For more details on how to use App Flip with your integration, check out the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/account-linking\">docs</a>, or the sample <a href=\"https://github.com/googlesamples/identity-appflip-android\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/googlesamples/identity-appflip-ios\">iOS</a> apps.

With Hugo the source content is plain files instead of rows in a database.  In the case of my blog those files are in git on GitHub.  But when the source files change, the site needs to be regenerated and redeployed to the CDN.  Also, sometimes it is nice to have drafts available for review.  I setup a continuous delivery pipeline which deploys changes to my prod site on Firebase Hosting and drafts on Cloud Run, using Cloud Build.  Read on for instructions for how to set all this up. </p><h2>Step 1a) Setup A New Hugo Project</h2>If you do not have an existing Hugo project you can create a <a

Note that the service name includes the branch so that you can see drafts from different branches. <br></br><h2>Step 3) Setup Firebase Hosting</h2>To setup your production / CDN'd site, <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com\">login to the firebase console</a> and select your project: <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ar6RW2zlR1w/XyipsG-5QwI/AAAAAAAAJNU/NGeQ4ved7SsW6mcjwWxDVhYs54l49ka6wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebasehosting.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ar6RW2zlR1w/XyipsG-5QwI/AAAAAAAAJNU/NGeQ4ved7SsW6mcjwWxDVhYs54l49ka6wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/firebasehosting.png\" data-original-width=\"1040\" data-original-height=\"804\" /></a><p>Now you'll need your project id, which can be found in the URL on the Firebase Project Overview page.  The URL for my project is: </p><p><a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/jw-demo/overview\">console.firebase.google.com/project/jw-demo/overview</a></p><p>Which means my project id is: jw-demo </p><p>Now copy your project id go into your GitHub fork, select the <code>.firebaserc</code> file and click the \"pencil\" / edit button: </p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9PNXSkk0vYQ/XyiqtWp7AvI/AAAAAAAAJNc/GhBuKHyQEa0nvwtXAweoKg0O-GSy70G1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/hellohugo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9PNXSkk0vYQ/XyiqtWp7AvI/AAAAAAAAJNc/GhBuKHyQEa0nvwtXAweoKg0O-GSy70G1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/hellohugo.png\" data-original-width=\"1040\" data-original-height=\"804\" /></a><p>Replace the <code>hello-hugo</code> string with your project id and commit the changes.  This commit will trigger two new builds, one for the production site and one for the drafts site on Cloud Run.  You can check the status of those builds on the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds\">Cloud Build History page</a>.  Once the default trigger (the one for Firebase hosting) finishes, check out your Hugo site running on Firebase Hosting by navigating to (replacing YOUR_PROJECT_ID with the project id you used above): https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.web.app/ </p><p>Your prod and drafts sites are now automatically deploying on new commits! </p><h2>Step 4) (Optional) Change Hugo Theme</h2><p>There are <a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\">many themes for Hugo</a> and they are easy to change.  Typically themes are pulled into Hugo sites using git submodules.  To change the theme, edit your <code>.gitmodules</code> file and set the subdirectories and url.  As an example, here is the content when using the mainroad theme: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">[submodule \"themes/mainroad\"]<br /> path = themes/mainroad<br /> url = https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git<br /></pre>  <p>You will also need to change the <code>theme</code> value in your <code>config.toml</code> file to match the directory name in the <code>themes</code> directory.  For example: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">theme = \"mainroad\"<br /></pre>  <p>Note: At the time of writing this, Cloud Build does not clone git submodules so the <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesward/hello-hugo/blob/master/cloudbuild.yaml#L2-L11\">does the cloning</a> instead. </p> <h2>Step 5) (Optional) Setup Local Editing</h2><p>To setup local editing you will first need to clone your fork.  You can do this with the <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub desktop app</a>.  Or from the command line: </p>  <pre class=\"prettyprint\">git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/USER/REPO.git<br /></pre>  <p>Once you have the files locally, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/\">install Hugo</a>, and from inside the repo's directory, run: </p>   <pre class=\"prettyprint\">hugo -D serve<br /></pre>  <p>This will serve the drafts in the site.  You can check out the site at: localhost:1313 </p><p>Committing non-draft changes to master and pushing those changes to GitHub will kick off the build which will deploy them on your prod site.  Committing draft to any branch will kick off the build which will deploy them on a Cloud Run site. </p><p>Hopefully that all helps you with hosting your Hugo sites!  <a

/></a>The Google Pay API enables fast, simple checkout for your website.  <p>The Google Pay JavaScript library does not depend on external libraries or frameworks and will work regardless of which framework your website uses (if it uses any at all). While this ensures wide compatibility, we know that it doesn’t necessarily make it easier to integrate when your website uses a framework. We’re doing something about it.</p><h2>Introducing the Google Pay button for React</h2><p>React is one of the most widely-used tools for building web UI's, so we are launching the <a href=\"https://github.com/google-pay/google-pay-button/tree/main/src/button-react\">Google Pay Button for React</a> to provide a streamlined integration experience. This component will make it easier to incorporate Google Pay into your React website whether you are new to React or a seasoned pro, and similarly, if this is your first Google Pay integration or if you’ve done this before. </p><p>We’re making this component available as an open source project on <a href=\"https://github.com/google-pay/google-pay-button/tree/main/src/button-react\">GitHub</a> and publishing it to <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-pay/button-react\">npm</a>. We’ve authored the React component with TypeScript to bring code completion to supported editors, and if your website is built with TypeScript you can also take advantage of type validation to identify common issues as you type. </p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qLHOWEa8GH0/XvDXppDuSFI/AAAAAAAAI7Q/K-EqZBzdIR4ViGxM03gjHtTYK-frsoxJACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/realtimecode.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qLHOWEa8GH0/XvDXppDuSFI/AAAAAAAAI7Q/K-EqZBzdIR4ViGxM03gjHtTYK-frsoxJACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/realtimecode.gif\" data-original-width=\"1095\" data-original-height=\"784\" /></a><p id=\"imgCaption\">Get real time code completion and validation as you integrate with supported editors.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>The first step is to install the Google Pay button module from npm:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install @google-pay/button-react</pre><h3>Adding and configuring the button</h3><p>The Google Pay button can be added to your React component by first importing it:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">import GooglePayButton from '@google-pay/button-react';</pre><p>And then rendering it with the necessary configuration values:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;GooglePayButton<br />  environment=\"TEST\"<br />  paymentRequest={{ ... }}<br />  onLoadPaymentData={() => {}}<br />  /></pre><p>Try it out for yourself on <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/1Lwndx7b/\">JSFiddle</a>.</p><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/google-pay/google-pay-button/tree/main/src/button-react#documentation\">component documentation</a> for a full list of supported configuration properties. </p><p>Note that you will need to provide a Merchant ID in <code>paymentRequest.merchantInfo</code> to complete the integration. Your Merchant ID can be obtained from the <a href=\"https://pay.google.com/business/console?utm_source=google_dev_blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=business_console_launch\">Google Pay Business Console</a>. </p><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xg40TDM3rh8/XvDYcX3QevI/AAAAAAAAI7Y/Hj8bTXoJgsEGfBc3xy7arTluNXXebm3lgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/merchantID.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xg40TDM3rh8/XvDYcX3QevI/AAAAAAAAI7Y/Hj8bTXoJgsEGfBc3xy7arTluNXXebm3lgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/merchantID.jpg\" data-original-width=\"1440\" data-original-height=\"1024\" /></a><p id=\"imgCaption\">Your Merchant ID can be found in the Google Pay Business Console.</p><h2>Support for other frameworks</h2><p>We also want to provide an improved developer experience for our developers using other frameworks, or no framework at all. That’s why we are also releasing the <a href=\"https://github.com/google-pay/google-pay-button/tree/main/src/button-element\">Google Pay button Custom Element</a>. </p><p>Custom elements are great because: </p><ul> <li>They are part of the Web Component specification and are <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1\">supported by most modern browsers</a> <li>They work well with other frameworks (see <a href=\"https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/\">Custom Elements Everywhere</a> for more information)  <li>They work without a framework </li></ul><p>Like the React component, the Google Pay button custom element is hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/google-pay/google-pay-button/tree/main/src/button-element\">GitHub</a> and published to <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-pay/button-element\">npm</a>. In fact, the React component and the custom element share the same repository and large portion of code. This ensures that both versions maintain feature parity and receive the same level of care and attention. </p><p>Try it out on <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/f70e8nx4/\">JSFiddle.</a></p><h2>Google Pay JavaScript library</h2><p>There's no change to the existing Google Pay JavaScript library, and if you prefer, you can continue to use this directly instead of the React component or custom element. Both of these components provide a convenience layer over the Google Pay JavaScript library and make use of it internally.</p><h2>Your feedback</h2><p>This is the first time that we (the Google Pay team) have released a framework specific library. We would love to hear your feedback. </p><p>Aside from React, most frameworks can use the Web Component version of the Google Pay Button. We may consider adding support for other frameworks based on interest and demand. </p><p>If you encounter any problems with the React component or custom element, please raise a <a href=\"https://github.com/google-pay/google-pay-button/issues\">GitHub issue</a>. Alternatively, if you know what the problem is and have a solution in mind, feel free to raise a pull request.

For those who have an online presence, you’re either seeing a lull in traffic or a spike. </p><p><em>If you’re a merchant who’s seeing traffic dwindle</em>, it’s more important than ever to make sure every transaction counts. If you used to see 50 transactions a day and now you see 10, you want to make sure all 10 deliver. Work with your Payment Service Provider (PSP) to make sure your approval ratios are as optimal as possible -- a legitimate customer who gets declined incorrectly may not return to purchase as they have in the past. If your PSP supports alternative payment methods like Google Pay that decrease friction at checkout and local payment methods if you’re selling internationally, that’s ideal. Keep an eye on your PSP’s stacks and uptimes to make sure you’re not missing out on sales due to outages or technical issues.  </p><p><em>If you’re a merchant seeing a spike in traffic</em>, that’s great news! But it’s important to note that a sudden traffic increase without proper operational and infrastructure planning can lead to fraud spikes, decreases in approval ratios, and downtime. With higher sales velocity, risk related issues will multiply.  You’ll see more attempted fraud as fraudsters take advantage of unsuspecting consumers, higher payment declines resulting from outdated issuer risk modeling and excessive chargeback levels, subscription cancellations, buyer’s remorse, among others. How are your payments infrastructure and operations equipped to handle all of this? </p><p>Make sure your infrastructure is capable of scaling up. If you don’t have autoscaling, you’ll need a team and processes in place to scale infrastructure for traffic spikes, and keep in mind this may get harder with people working remotely. Work your PSP and other providers to optimize your payments, risk models and chargeback handling during this challenging time. </p><p>For both types of merchants,  it’s important to pay closer attention to  performance of your payments system. This includes both ensuring that processes are working in an optimal way - especially given remote working situations and also ensuring that you are seeing efficiencies at scale. </p><p><strong>Jose Ugia: How did you think about building a payments infrastructure that was scalable and future-proof at Checkout.com? </strong></p><p>We knew in the beginning we wanted a unified API, which through a single integration gives a merchant access to any market via a range of payment methods and other facilities. We’ve worked hard to get acquiring licenses in as many markets as possible so we can bring acquiring in-house, which in turn gives us greater visibility on the entire payment flow. We have also invested in a gateway that can be consistently deployed in local geographies so that whether the merchant is in Dubai or Singapore, they are getting the most optimal traffic flow.  </p><p>Any engineer knows that tech breaks. Those who win have a better plan for dealing with breakage efficiently, to consistently maintain high levels of service. We spend a lot of time and resources on making sure our stack is resilient and we have the right operational processes in place to both proactively monitor for potential issues and respond correctly when they come up.  </p><p><strong>Jose Ugia: Speaking of where things are headed, where do you see the future of payments going from a payment service provider perspective?</strong></p><p>A few key trends I see: </p><p><em>Risk & Fraud Detection</em>. AI/ML is improving every aspect of tech. Fraudsters will get smarter but so will fraud prevention - it’s a cat and mouse game. In payments, sophisticated risk engines offering ML-based transaction scoring and highly customizable rules builders, among other features, will get better at detecting fraud without compromising sales.  </p><p><em>Global acceptance will continue to be complex but paramount. </em>Offering a variety of payment methods is table stakes these days. More and more, we’ll see that local payment methods aren’t the alternative but instead the primary way consumers pay. For example, you need to have Giropay if you’re selling in Germany and Alipay if you’re selling in China if you want a high conversion rate.  Ensure that you and your local entities have an optimized setup with your acquirer (ideally domestic where possible) focused on achieving the lowest costs and highest approval rates. </p><p><em>Embedded infrastructure. </em>Merchants - especially enterprise players - will want increased visibility and more control on optimizing their payment systems. We offer this level of insight and flexibility to our merchants today via our APIs around risk, reconciliation, disputes, etc. But we’re headed toward a world where dedicated infrastructure will become part of the package and allow for complete data separation and zero contention. </p><p><strong>Jose Ugia: How do you think these changes of payments infrastructure will impact consumers downstream?</strong></p><p>Convenience is king among consumers. I believe that COVID-19 will accelerate the move toward a contactless payments society, with consumers relying more on digital wallets and opportunities to pay through their devices. I personally no longer take my wallet out with me when I leave the house. A couple of years ago that felt like a conscious decision - now it’s just part of everyday life to rely solely on my smartphone to pay. </p><p>In some regions like MENA, which has typically been a cash-on-delivery society, we’re seeing more merchants close off cash and impose digital payments, opening up more adoption of upfront e-commerce payments. As mandated payment methods begin to change consumer behavior (studies say it takes 2 months to change a habit), new ways of paying will be here to stay, even beyond COVID-19. </p><br></br><center>- - - - - - - - - - - </center><br></br><i>Interested in learning more about Checkout.com’s services or speaking to a payments expert on how to optimize your payments stack? <a href=\"https://go.checkout.com/lead-gen/google-pay-blog-interest-capture\">Contact us here</a>.

Today, we’re taking a major step forward in helping you build these custom voice apps and services by introducing a suite of new and improved developer tools:<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/build#actions_builder\"> Actions Builder</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/build#actions_sdk\">Actions SDK</a>. These tools make building <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview\">Conversational Actions </a>for the Assistant easier and more streamlined than ever. </p><h2>Better design and development tools</h2><p>Actions Builder is a web-based IDE that lets you develop, test, and deploy directly in the Actions console. The graphical interface lets you visualize the conversational flow, manage Natural Language Understanding (NLU) training data, and debug with advanced tools. </p><p>For those of you who prefer local IDEs, the updated Actions SDK provides a file based representation of your Actions project. This lets you author NLU training data and conversational flows locally as well as bulk import and export training data. We've also updated the CLI that accompanies Actions SDK, so you can build and manage Actions projects completely with code, using your favorite source control and continuous integration tools. </p><p>Together, Actions Builder and Actions SDK create a seamless, consolidated development experience. No matter what tool you start with, you can switch between them based on what works best for your workflow. For example, you can use Actions Builder to lay out conversational flows and provide NLU training data, Actions SDK to write fulfillment code, and the CLI to synchronize the two. These tools create an environment where all team members can contribute effectively and focus on what they do best: design and code. </p><h2>New interaction model</h2><p>A new, powerful interaction model lets you design conversations quickly and efficiently. Intents and scenes let you define robust NLU training data and behavior for specific conversational contexts. Using scenes as building blocks, you define active intents, declare context specific error handling, collect data through slot filling, and respond with prompts.  </p><p>Scenes also separate conversational flow definitions from fulfillment logic, so you can reuse the same flows across multiple conversations. Transitions between scenes let you define when one conversational context switches to another.  All your scenes and transitions describe a full conversational flow and all possible dialog turns.  </p><p>You can express the entire interaction model with either the Actions Builder or Actions SDK. A typical way to develop is to use Actions Builder to view and edit your scenes and then use Actions SDK to sync changes to your local file system. This lets you version control your project, modify your project files, and build fulfillment in your favorite development environment.  </p><h2>Faster and smarter runtime engine</h2><p>Under the hood, we also made a lot of improvements that your users will appreciate. We sped up the Assistant runtime engine, so users get faster responses and a smoother experience.  We’ve also made the runtime engine smarter, so your Actions can understand users better with the same amount of training data. </p><h2>Production ready platform</h2> <p>We've worked with Pretzel Labs and Galinha Pintadinha to test the capabilities of the new platform and to refine the interaction model and runtime engine improvements. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.pretzellabs.co/\">Pretzel Labs</a> built <a href=\"https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/00000031a66971c9?e=-WebDirectoryEmbeddedWebviewExperiment\">Kids Court</a> with Actions Builder, creating a full conversational flow with no code and added fulfilment for advanced functionality. </p><p><b><em>\"Having the combination of a visual layout with webhook blocks for code helps us collaborate clearly and more efficiently. Something I liked very much about this was the separation between the designer and the developers' parts, making it very intuitive to make design changes without affecting backend logic.\"  <br>-- Adva Levin, founder of Pretzel Labs </em></b></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/juptube\">Galinha Pintadinha</a> runs one of the biggest YouTube channels and built one the most popular Conversational <a href=\"https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000007ec46b5a8f?hl=pt_br&e=-WebDirectoryEmbeddedWebviewExperiment\">Actions</a> in their country.  Their development team migrated to the new platform to optimize their workflow and simplify future Action development. Galinha Pintadinha’s Actions now contain half the number of intents and have a radically simplified conversation tree. Using features like contextual error handling, they were able to improve the user experience and quality with little to no cost. </p><p><b><i>\"Actions Builder is a robust and well designed toolbox for developing conversational apps. <em>The concept of scenes and transitions helped us define the flow of our Action in a much more streamlined way.</em>\"<br>-- Mário Neto, engineer at Galinha Pintadinha</i></b></p><h2>Get started</h2>  <p>To learn more about Actions Builder and SDK and to start developing your next Actions, check out our new developer resources.
