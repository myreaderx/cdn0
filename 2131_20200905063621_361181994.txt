Mostly because it’s fun, but also to explore how AI can make creation more accessible. Its latest project now gives anyone a chance to make quarantine tunes to vibe to—no music training necessary.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/lofi-player\">Lo-Fi Player</a>, designed by Vibert Thio, a technologist and artist who interned with the team this summer, lets users interact with objects in a virtual room to mix their own lo-fi hip-hop soundtracks. The goal is to make the music-mixing experience as simple and friendly as possible. The room is a two-dimensional, pixelated drawing displayed in <a href=\"https://magenta.github.io/lofi-player/\">a web browser</a>. Clicking on different objects, like the clock and the piano, prompts the user to adjust different tracks, like the drum line and melody.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/lofi-player/customize.gif\" alt=\"customize with ease gif\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://magenta.github.io/lofi-player/\"></a>There are two machine-learning models at work in the background. One, tucked away in the radio, generates new melodies when clicked on; the other, hidden in the TV, interpolates between two melodies to create something that sounds a little bit like both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the sounds in the room, however, are not generated by machine learning—and that’s kind of the point. Throughout the process, Thio worked with lo-fi producers to curate bass lines, drum lines, and background ambience that exemplify the genre and sound good. He also wrote four melody options that users can choose from. The machine learning adds just enough of a wild card on top of the scripted tracks to give each user a unique mix. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/skVlTlkQ56tjQGtlFAXc984rh76NbgJ9B1rTm_bfCqdRLADI63PGYLX6d0jmXi40VcnBN60kC8XoTGKlqSU7kq6XVBOp0DEYEr3RSSZ7Q3gpWOnTEZYk1Yfq_7fwL88ekUex5-9N\" alt=\"youtube streaming gif\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial launch of Lo-Fi Player also includes <a href=\"https://magenta.github.io/lofi-player/stream/\">an interactive YouTube livestream</a>, where users can type commands into the chat window to change the music. The idea is to make music creation a more collective experience, with quarantine in mind. “What a tiny, small thing to bring us together during covid,” says Doug Eck, a research scientist who supervised the project.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now the project is in its first version, but Thio already sees more possibilities. His dream project is to make a kind of TikTok for music creation—an interface that makes it really easy for non-musicians to play with music editing, share their creations, and express themselves.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 13:41:23 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/lofi-player/customize.gif","linkMd5":"1ef083b8708aa21e036aab28271d32c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-36-05-840_ff4b4423d52445a5.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":3317605,"destBytes":2334316,"author":"Karen Hao","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/lofi-player/customize.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-36-05-840_ff4b4423d52445a5.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/skVlTlkQ56tjQGtlFAXc984rh76NbgJ9B1rTm_bfCqdRLADI63PGYLX6d0jmXi40VcnBN60kC8XoTGKlqSU7kq6XVBOp0DEYEr3RSSZ7Q3gpWOnTEZYk1Yfq_7fwL88ekUex5-9N":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748684},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1007716","description":"\n<p>Sara Garner had a nagging feeling something wasn’t quite right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A software engineer, she was revamping her personal site, but it just didn’t feel like her. Sure, it had the requisite links to her social media and her professional work, but it didn’t really reflect her personality. So she created a <a href=\"http://www.saragarner.com/museums/\">page</a> focused on museums, which she is obsessed with. It’s still under construction, but she envisions a page that includes thoughts on her favorite museums, describes the emotions they evoked, and invites others to share their favorite museums and what they’ve learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m going for a feeling of wonderment, a connection across time,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the world of “digital gardens.” These creative reimaginings of blogs have quietly taken nerdier corners of the internet by storm. A growing movement of people are tooling with back-end code to create sites that are more collage-like and artsy, in the vein of Myspace and Tumblr—less predictable and formatted than Facebook and Twitter. Digital gardens explore a wide variety of topics and are frequently adjusted and changed to show growth and learning, particularly among people with niche interests. Through them, people are creating an internet that is less about connections and feedback, and more about quiet spaces they can call their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“Everyone does their own weird thing”</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The movement might be gaining steam now, but its roots date back to 1998, when Mark Bernstein introduced the idea of the “<a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html\">hypertext garden</a>,” arguing for spaces on the internet that let a person wade into the unknown. “Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness,” he <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html\">wrote</a>. “The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity.” (His <a href=\"https://www.markbernstein.org/\">digital garden</a> includes a recent review of a Bay Area carbonara dish and reflections on his favorite essays.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new wave of digital gardens discuss books and movies, with introspective journal entries; <a href=\"https://aaronzlewis.com/starterpack/\">others offer thoughts on philosophy and politics</a>. Some are works of art in themselves, visual masterpieces that invite the viewer to explore; others are simpler and more utilitarian, using Google Docs or WordPress templates to share <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16GRHrEqy1p_ZrmLWIn0eUW4ELcEzol619pcZjRpCefM/edit\">intensely personal lists</a>. Avid readers in particular have embraced the concept, sharing <a href=\"https://amandapinsker.com/reading\">creative</a>, <a href=\"https://highlights.melanie-richards.com/\">beautiful</a> <a href=\"https://highlights.sawyerh.com/\">digital</a> bookshelves that illustrate their reading journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nerding hard on digital gardens, personal wikis, and experimental knowledge systems with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_jonesian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@_jonesian</a> today.<br><br>We have an epic collection going, check these out&#8230;<br><br>1. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomcritchlow</a>&#39;s Wikifolders: <a href=\"https://t.co/QnXw0vzbMG\">https://t.co/QnXw0vzbMG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9ri6g9hD93\">pic.twitter.com/9ri6g9hD93</a></p>&#8212; Maggie Appleton (@Mappletons) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beneath the umbrella term, however, digital gardens don’t follow rules. They’re not blogs, short for “weblogs,” a term that suggests a time-stamped record of thought. They’re not a social-media platform—connections are made, but often it’s through linking to other digital gardens, or gathering in forums like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://nesslabs.com/digital-gardeners\">Telegram</a> to nerd out over code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Critchlow, a consultant who has been cultivating <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/\">his digital garden</a> for years, spells out the main difference between old-school blogging and digital gardening. “With blogging, you’re talking to a large audience,” he says. “With digital gardening, you’re talking to yourself. You focus on what you want to cultivate over time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they have in common is that they can be edited at any time to reflect evolution and change. The idea is similar to editing a Wikipedia entry, though digital gardens are not meant to be the ultimate word on a topic. As a slower, clunkier way to explore the internet, they revel in not being <em>the</em> definitive source, just <em>a</em> source, says Mike Caulfield, a digital literacy expert at Washington State University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the whole point of digital gardens is that they can grow and change, and that various pages on the same topic can coexist. “It’s less about iterative learning and more about public learning,” says Maggie Appleton, a designer. Appleton’s digital garden, for example, includes thoughts on plant-based meat, <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/bookshelf/\">book reviews</a>, and digressions on Javascript and magical capitalism. It is “an open collection of notes, resources, sketches, and explorations I’m currently cultivating,” <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden\">its introduction</a> declares. “Some notes are Seedlings, some are budding, and some are fully grown Evergreen[s].”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appleton, who trained as an anthropologist, says she was drawn to digital gardens because of their depth. “The content is not on Twitter, and it’s never deleted,” she says. “Everyone does their own weird thing. The sky’s the limit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That ethos of creativity and individuality was echoed by several people I spoke to. Some&#160;suggested that the digital garden was a backlash to the internet we’ve become grudgingly accustomed to, where things go viral, change is looked down upon, and sites are one-dimensional. Facebook and Twitter profiles have neat slots for photos and posts, but enthusiasts of digital gardens reject those fixed design elements. The sense of time and space to explore is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caulfield, who has researched misinformation and disinformation, wrote a blog post in 2015 on the “<a href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\">technopastoral</a>,” in which he described the federated wiki structure promoted by computer programmer Ward Cunningham, who thought the internet should support a “<a href=\"http://thegovlab.org/a-modern-wiki-for-a-modern-internet-the-smallest-federated-wiki-on-the-govlabs-demos-for-democracy/\">chorus of voices</a>” rather than the few rewarded on social media today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The stream has dominated our lives since the mid-2000s,” Caulfield says. But it means people are either posting content or consuming it. And, Caulfield says, the internet as it stands rewards shock value and dumbing things down. “By engaging in digital gardening, you are constantly finding new connections, more depth and nuance,” he says. “What you write about is not a fossilized bit of commentary for a blog post. When you learn more, you add to it. It’s less about shock and rage; it’s more connective.” In an age of doom-scrolling and Zoom fatigue, some digital-garden enthusiasts say the internet they live in is, as Caulfield puts it, “optimistically hopeful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many people are searching for more intimate communities on the internet, not everyone can spin up a digital garden: you need to be able to do at least some rudimentary coding. Making a page from scratch affords more creative freedom than social-media and web-hosting sites that let you drag and drop elements onto your page, but it can be daunting and time-consuming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Biscardi is trying to get rid of that barrier to entry with a text editor for digital gardens that’s still in its alpha stage. Called Toast, it’s “something you might experience with WordPress,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, whether digital gardens will be an escapist remnant of 2020’s hellscape or wither in the face of easier social media remains to be seen. “I’m interested in seeing how it plays out,” Appleton says.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For some people it’s a reaction to social media, and for others it’s a trend,” Critchlow says. “Whether or not it will hit critical mass … that’s to be seen.”</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"548bed0bf3a4608d40450543f57e52c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Tanya Basu","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748686},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"A brief history of US-China espionage entanglements","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1007609","description":"\n<p>Since the establishment of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in 1949, intelligence services in both Beijing and Washington have vied to uncover secrets in one another’s countries, and to safeguard their own secrets, in pursuit of military, economic, and technological advantage.

Qian, who had questioned Nazi rocket scientists on behalf of the US government after World War II and worked on the Manhattan Project, resigns from Caltech and asks to leave the US for China, at which point he is held under house arrest for five years. In 1955 the US deports him; Qian is greeted as a hero in China and goes on to become the father of Chinese rocketry, helping jump-start China’s space and missile programs. No substantive evidence has ever been released that he was a Chinese spy. Deporting Qian was “the stupidest thing the country ever did,” according to Dan Kimball, undersecretary of the Navy at the time of Qian’s arrest.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LOC-carter-normalized_web.png?w=924\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1007857\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LOC-carter-normalized_web.png 924w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LOC-carter-normalized_web.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LOC-carter-normalized_web.png?resize=768,494 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" /><figcaption>Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping shakes hands with President Jimmy Carter at the White House.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>January 1, 1979</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States normalizes diplomatic relations with China.

The national biometric ID system, conceived as a comprehensive identity program, sought to collect the fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs of all residents. It wasn’t long, Kak remembers, before stories about its devastating consequences began to spread. “We were suddenly hearing reports of how manual laborers who work with their hands—how their fingerprints were failing the system, and they were then being denied access to basic necessities,” she says. “We actually had <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/25/aadhaar-linked-to-half-the-reported-starvation-deaths-since-2015-say-researchers_a_23539768/\">starvation deaths in India</a> that were being linked to the barriers that these biometric ID systems were creating. So it was a really crucial issue.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those instances provoked her to research biometric systems and the ways the law could hold them accountable. On September 2, Kak, who is now the director of global strategy and programs at the New York–based AI Now Institute, released a <a href=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics.pdf\">new report</a> detailing eight case studies of how biometric systems are regulated around the world. They span city, state, national, and global efforts, as well as some from nonprofit organizations. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how different approaches work or fall short. I spoke to Kak about what she learned and how we should move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What motivated this project?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Biometric technology is <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-intro.html\">proliferating and becoming normalized</a>, both in government domains but also in our private lives. The monitoring of protests using facial recognition happened this year alone in Hong Kong, in Delhi, in Detroit, and in Baltimore. Biometric ID systems, which are less talked about, where biometrics are used as a condition to access your welfare services—that’s also proliferated across low- and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the interesting thing is that the pushback against these systems is also at its peak. The advocacy around it is getting more attention than ever before. So then the question is: Where do law and policy figure in? That’s where this compendium comes in. This report tries to pull out what we can learn from these experiences at a moment when it seems like there is a lot of appetite from governments and from advocacy groups for more regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is the current state of play for biometric regulation globally? How mature are the legal frameworks for handling this emerging technology?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are about 130 countries in the world that have data protection laws. Almost all cover biometric data. So if we’re just asking the question of do laws exist to regulate biometric data, then the answer would be in most countries, they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you dig a little deeper, what are the limitations of a data protection law? A data protection law at its best can help you regulate when biometric data is used and make sure that it isn’t used for purposes for which consent was not given. But issues like accuracy, discrimination—those issues have still received very little legal attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, what about completely banning the technology? We’ve seen that concentrated in the US at the city and state level. I think people forget sometimes that most of this legislative activity has been concentrated on public and, more specifically, on police use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a mix of data protection law that provides some safeguards but is inherently limited. And then we have a concentration of these complete moratoriums at the local city and state level in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What were some common themes that emerged from these case studies?</strong>&#160;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, the clearest one was <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-ranganathan.html\">the chapter on India</a> by Nayantara Ranganathan, and <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-goldenfein-mann.html\">the chapter on the Australian facial recognition database</a> by Monique Mann and Jake Goldenfein. Both of these are massive centralized state architectures where the whole point is to remove the technical silos between different state and other kinds of databases, and to make sure that these databases are centrally linked. So you’re creating this monster centralized, centrally linked biometric data architecture. Then as a Band-Aid on this huge problem, you’re saying, “Okay, we have a data protection law, which says that data should never be used for a purpose that was not imagined or anticipated.” But meanwhile, you’re changing the expectation of what can be anticipated. Today the database that was used in a criminal justice context is now being used in an immigration context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, [in the US] ICE is now using or trying to use DMV databases in different states in the process of immigration enforcement. So these are databases created in a civilian context, and they’re trying to use them for immigration. Similarly in Australia, you have this giant database, which includes driver’s license data, that is now going to be used for limitless criminal justice purposes, and where the home affairs department will have complete control. And similarly in India, they created a law, but the law basically put most of the discretion in the hands of the authority that created the database. So I think from these three examples, what becomes clear to me is you have to read the law in the context of the broader political movements that are happening. If I had to summarize the broader trend, it’s the securitization of every aspect of governance, from criminal justice to immigration to welfare, and it’s coinciding with the push for biometrics. That’s one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second—and this is a lesson that we keep repeating—consent as a legal tool is very much broken, and it’s definitely broken in the context of biometric data. But that doesn’t mean that it’s useless. Woody Hartzog’s <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-hartzog.html\">chapter on Illinois’s BIPA</a> [Biometric Information Privacy Act] says: Look, it’s great that we’ve had several successful lawsuits against companies using BIPA, most recently with Clearview AI. But we can’t keep expecting “the consent model” to bring about structural change. Our solution can’t be: The user knows best; the user will tell Facebook that they don’t want their face data collected. Maybe the user will not do that, and the burden shouldn’t be on the individual to make these decisions. This is something that the privacy community has really learned the hard way, which is why laws like the GDPR don’t just rely on consent. There are also hard guideline rules that say: If you’ve collected data for one reason, you cannot use it for another purpose. And you cannot collect more data than is absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Was there any country or state that you thought demonstrated particular promise in its approach to the regulation of biometrics?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, unsurprisingly it’s not a country or a state. It’s actually the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]. In the volume, Ben Hayes and Massimo Marelli—they’re both actually representatives of the ICRC—<a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-hayes-marelli.html\">wrote a reflective piece</a> on how they decided that there was a legitimate interest for them to be using biometrics in the context of distributing humanitarian aid. But they also recognized that there were many governments that would pressure them for access to that data in order to persecute these communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they had a very real conundrum, and they resolved that by saying: We want to create a biometrics policy that minimizes the actual retention of people’s biometric data. So what we’ll do is have a card on which someone’s biometric data is securely stored. They can use that card to get access to the humanitarian welfare or assistance being provided. But if they decide to throw that card away, the data will not be stored anywhere else. The policy basically decided not to establish a biometric database with the data of refugees and others in need of humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, the broader lesson from that is recognizing what the issue is. The issue in that case was that the databases were creating a honeypot and a real risk. So they thought up both a technical solution and a way for people to withdraw or delete their biometric data with complete agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the major gaps you see in approaches to biometric regulation across the board?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example to illustrate that point is: How is the law dealing with this whole issue of bias and accuracy? In the last few years we’ve seen <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/12/1003482/amazon-stopped-selling-police-face-recognition-fight/\">so much foundational research</a> from people like Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru, and Deb Raji that existentially challenges: Do these systems work? Who do they work against? And even when they pass these so-called accuracy tests, how do they actually perform in a real-life context?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data privacy doesn’t concern itself with these types of issues. So what we’ve seen now—and this is mostly legislative efforts in the US—is bills that mandate accuracy and nondiscrimination audits for facial-recognition systems. Some of them say: We’re pausing facial-recognition use, but one condition for lifting this moratorium is that you will pass this accuracy and nondiscrimination test. And the tests that they often refer to are technical standards tests like NIST’s face-recognition vendor test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as I argue in that <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-kak.html\">first chapter</a>, these tests are evolving; they have been proven to underperform in real-life contexts; and most importantly, they are limited in their ability to address the broader discriminatory impact of these systems when they’re applied to practice. So I’m really worried in some ways about these technical standards becoming a kind of checkbox that needs to be ticked, and that then ignores or obfuscates the other forms of harms that these technologies have when they’re applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How did this compendium change the way you think about biometric regulation?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing it did for me is to not think of regulation just as a tool that will help in limiting these systems. It <em>can</em> be a tool to push back against these systems, but equally it can be a tool to normalize or legitimize these systems. It’s only when we look at examples like the one in India or the one in Australia that we start to see law as a multifaceted instrument, which can be used in different ways. At the moment when we’re really pushing to say “Do these technologies need to exist at all?” the law, and especially weak regulation, can really be weaponized. That was a good reminder for me. We need to be careful against that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>This conversation has definitely been revelatory for me because as someone who covers the way that tech is weaponized, I’m often asked, “What’s the solution?” and I always say, “Regulation.” But now you’re saying, “Regulation can be weaponized too.”</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s so true! This makes me think of these groups that used to work on domestic violence in India. And I remember they said that at the end of decades of fighting for the rights of survivors of domestic violence, the government finally said, “Okay, we’ve passed this law.” But after that, nothing changed. I remember thinking even then, we sometimes glorify the idea of passing laws, but what happens after that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is a good segue—even as I read Clare Garvie and Jameson Spivack’s <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-spivack-garvie.html\">chapter on bans and moratoriums</a>, they point out that most of these bans apply only to government use. There’s still this massive multibillion-dollar private industry. So it’s still going to be used at the Taylor Swift concert in very similar ways to the ways in which cops would use it: to keep people out, to discriminate against people. It doesn’t stop the machine. <em>That</em> kind of legal intervention would take unprecedented advocacy. I don’t think it’s impossible to have that so-called complete ban, but we’re not there yet. So yeah, we need to be more circumspect and critical about the way we understand the role of law.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What about the compendium made you hopeful about the future?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s always such a hard question, but it shouldn’t be. It was probably <a href=\"https://www.ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics-coyle-richardson.html\">Rashida Richardson and Stephanie Coyle’s chapter</a>. Their chapter was almost like an ethnography about this group of parents in New York that felt really strongly about the fact that they didn’t want their kids to be surveilled. And they were like, “We’re going to go to every single meeting, even though they don’t expect us to. And we’re going to say we have a problem with this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just really reassuring to learn about a story where it was the parents’ group that completely shifted the discourse. They said: Let’s not talk about whether biometrics or surveillance is necessary. Let’s just talk about the real harms of this to our kids and whether this is the best use of money. A senator then picked this up and introduced a bill, and just in August, the New York state senate passed this bill. I celebrated with Rashida because I was like, “Yay! Stories like this happen!” It’s connected very deeply with the story of advocacy.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:34:41 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ae4cb06ca21695a31950205cd071be91","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Karen Hao","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748683},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"This know-it-all AI learns by reading the entire web nonstop","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1008156","description":"\n<p>Back in July, OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/\">latest language model, GPT-3</a>, dazzled with its ability to churn out paragraphs that look as if they could have been written by a human. People started showing off how GPT-3 could also autocomplete code or fill in blanks in spreadsheets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one example, Twitter employee Paul Katsen tweeted “the spreadsheet function to rule them all,” in which<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pavtalk/status/1285410751092416513\"> GPT-3 fills out columns</a> by itself, pulling in data for US states: the population of Michigan is 10.3 million, Alaska became a state in 1906, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except that GPT-3 can be a bit of a bullshitter. The population of Michigan has never been 10.3 million, and Alaska became a state in 1959.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Language models like GPT-3 are <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/31/1005876/natural-language-processing-evaluation-ai-opinion/\">amazing mimics</a>, but they have little sense of what they’re actually saying. “They’re really good at generating stories about unicorns,” says Mike Tung, CEO of Stanford startup Diffbot. “But they’re not trained to be factual.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is a problem if we want <a href=\"https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/\">AIs to be trustworthy</a>. That’s why Diffbot takes a different approach. It is building an AI that reads every page on the entire public web, in multiple languages, and extracts as many facts from those pages as it can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like GPT-3, Diffbot’s system learns by vacuuming up vast amounts of human-written text found online. But instead of using that data to train a language model, Diffbot turns what it reads into a series of three-part factoids that relate one thing to another: subject, verb, object.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pointed at <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/author/will-douglas-heaven/\">my bio</a>, for example, Diffbot learns that Will Douglas Heaven is a journalist; Will Douglas Heaven works at MIT Technology Review; MIT Technology Review is a media company; and so on. Each of these factoids gets joined up with billions of others in a sprawling, interconnected network of facts. This is known as a knowledge graph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge graphs are not new. They have been around for decades, and were a fundamental concept in early AI research. But constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs has typically been done by hand, which is hard. This also stopped Tim Berners-Lee from realizing what he called the semantic web, which would have included information for machines as well as humans, so that bots could book our flights, do our shopping, or give smarter answers to questions than search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Google started using knowledge graphs too. Search for “Katy Perry” and you will get a box next to the main search results telling you that Katy Perry is an American singer-songwriter with music available on YouTube, Spotify, and Deezer. You can see at a glance that she is married to Orlando Bloom, she’s 35 and worth $125 million, and so on. Instead of giving you a list of links to pages about Katy Perry, Google gives you a set of facts about her drawn from its knowledge graph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Google only does this for its most popular search terms. Diffbot wants to do it for everything. By fully automating the construction process, Diffbot has been able to build what may be the largest knowledge graph ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside Google and Microsoft, it is one of only three US companies that crawl the entire public web. “It definitely makes sense to crawl the web,” says Victoria Lin, a research scientist at Salesforce who works on natural-language processing and knowledge representation. “A lot of human effort can otherwise go into making a large knowledge base.” Heiko Paulheim at the University of Mannheim in Germany agrees: “Automation is the only way to build large-scale knowledge graphs.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Super surfer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To collect its facts, Diffbot’s AI reads the web as a human would—but much faster. Using a super-charged version of the Chrome browser, the AI views the raw pixels of a web page and uses image-recognition algorithms to categorize the page as one of 20 different types, including video, image, article, event, and discussion thread. It then identifies key elements on the page, such as headline, author, product description, or price, and uses NLP to extract facts from any text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every three-part factoid gets added to the knowledge graph. Diffbot extracts facts from pages written in any language, which means that it can answer queries about Katy Perry, say, using facts taken from articles in Chinese or Arabic even if they do not contain the term “Katy Perry.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsing the web like a human lets the AI see the same facts that we see. It also means it has had to learn to navigate the web like us. The AI must scroll down, switch between tabs, and click away pop-ups. “The AI has to play the web like a video game just to experience the pages,” says Tung.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diffbot crawls the web nonstop and rebuilds its knowledge graph every four to five days. According to Tung, the AI adds 100 million to 150 million entities each month as new people pop up online, companies are created, and products are launched. It uses more machine-learning algorithms to fuse new facts with old, creating new connections or overwriting out-of-date ones. Diffbot has to add new hardware to its data center as the knowledge graph grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers can access Diffbot’s knowledge graph for free. But Diffbot also has around 400 paying customers. The search engine DuckDuckGo uses it to generate its own Google-like boxes. Snapchat uses it to extract highlights from news pages. The popular wedding-planner app Zola uses it to help people make wedding lists, pulling in images and prices. NASDAQ, which provides information about the stock market, uses it for financial research.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fake shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adidas and Nike even use it to search the web for counterfeit shoes. A search engine will return a long list of sites that mention Nike trainers. But Diffbot lets these companies look for sites that are actually selling their shoes, rather just talking about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, these companies must interact with Diffbot using code. But Tung plans to add a natural-language interface. Ultimately, he wants to build what he calls a “universal factoid question answering system”: an AI that could answer almost anything you asked it, with sources to back up its response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tung and Lin agree that this kind of AI cannot be built with language models alone. But better yet would be to combine the technologies, using a language model like GPT-3 to craft a human-like front end for a know-it-all bot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, even an AI that has its facts straight is not necessarily smart. “We’re not trying to define what intelligence is, or anything like that,” says Tung. “We’re just trying to build something useful.”</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:13:26 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b5b0f33334d33b85a192485afefdf0c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Will Heaven","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748684},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"Ideas wanted: Help make the world’s biggest covid-19 symptom database useful","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1008045","description":"\n<p><strong>The news:</strong> Since April, the Delphi research group at Carnegie Mellon University has been compiling one of the world’s largest databases for covid-19 symptom tracking. Now it’s launching a new challenge with Facebook and other partners to crowdsource data projects for improving the nation’s pandemic response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The data: </strong>The Delphi group, one of the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/13/905313/cdc-cmu-forecasts-coronavirus-spread/\">best flu-forecasting teams in the US</a>, has been surveying people in the US about their symptoms via Facebook to help with the CDC’s covid forecasting efforts. The latest survey <a href=\"https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html\">asks 36 questions</a> about whether you have or know someone with symptoms, how often you come in contact with other people, whether you’ve been experiencing mental-health or financial challenges, and more. Every day, Facebook randomly selects a population of users to push the survey to in their news feeds. The answers are then sent directly to Delphi without the company ever viewing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of May, the University of Maryland has joined the collaboration and has been administering an international version of the survey. The questions differ slightly because of data privacy regulations and the World Health Organization’s changing needs. Aggregated versions of both data sets will be released to challenge participants, and researchers can request special access to anonymized, de-aggregated versions of the data if they need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://covid-survey.dataforgood.fb.com/?date=2020-08-30&#38;dates=2020-07-04_2020-08-29&#38;region=WORLD\"><img src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-11.32.55-AM.png\" alt=\"Interactive covid symptom map of the world\" class=\"wp-image-1008050\"/></a><figcaption>A map of the covid-19 symptom data collected via the survey. Click on the image to go to an interactive version.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A wealth of analyses:</strong> Since the project began, Delphi says, it’s collected roughly 10 million survey responses in the US and 15 million abroad. More than 85% of US respondents who answer at least two questions fill out the survey to the end—a completion rate that far exceeds the researchers’ initial expectations. The research group has partnered with about a dozen other organizations to analyze the wealth of data for various purposes. Among others, they hope to develop local forecasting models for hospitals and study the impact of lockdowns on mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is so much in this data, or potentially so much in this data, there’s no way that we alone could analyze the data and deliver every insight from it,” says Alex Reinhart, an assistant teaching professor in CMU’s Department of Statistics &#38; Data Science, who is part of the team running the challenge. “To my knowledge, this is one of the largest surveys ever conducted outside of the census. So our feeling is that the symptom surveys would be at their most useful if many researchers who are studying the pandemic are able to use them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fresh ideas:</strong> The challenge organizing team hopes to attract a broad range of participants, from researchers to laypeople, who can contribute fresh ideas for using the data. “I’m interested in basically anything new,” Reinhart says. “Any approach that makes all of the data we collect meaningful to people who just want to know: ‘What should I be doing in my community? How does all this information help me make a specific decision?’” Perhaps this will come in the form of better forecasting methods or simple dashboards, he adds.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge will be accepting submissions through September 29. Once the finalists are selected, the goal will be to connect them with relevant partner organization, public health officials, or other parties that might benefit from the proposed ideas.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:47:00 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-11.32.55-AM.png","linkMd5":"40e20af1b90bc8e0dfd8fd72c42fa16e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-35-49-044_bd7de4ec22528d4d.webp","destWidth":1438,"destHeight":715,"sourceBytes":335340,"destBytes":62458,"author":"Karen Hao","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-11.32.55-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-35-49-044_bd7de4ec22528d4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748685},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"The “staged rollout” of gene-modified babies could start with sickle-cell disease","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1008136","description":"\n<p>In a high-level report precipitated by the birth of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/\">CRISPR babies</a> in China in 2018, scientists say the technology’s next medical use should be narrowly restricted to prospective parents who can’t otherwise have a healthy child, such as Black couples who both have sickle-cell disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/international-commission-on-the-clinical-use-of-human-germline-genome-editing\">200-plus-page report</a>, from the US National Academies and the UK Royal Society, says “heritable genome editing,” or the use of powerful DNA-editing tools like CRISPR to rewrite the genes of human embryos, is not yet safe enough to use in IVF clinics, but anticipates it could become so in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it does get used again, the technology’s initial application should be to help couples with no chance of having a healthy child otherwise, a rare situation but one in which the benefits could most clearly outweigh the risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Zoom call with journalists, Richard P. Lifton, the panel’s co-chairman and the president of Rockefeller University, in Manhattan, described the report as diagramming a “staged rollout of the technology, to make sure [it] is safe.” The panelists said futuristic applications like enhancing intelligence, or making kids with increased disease resistance, remain too uncertain to attempt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since CRISPR was first developed, scientists hoped to self-regulate the technology’s use and avoid legal bans. That suffered a setback in November 2018 after a little-known Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, said he had gone ahead and gene-edited twin embryos to make the baby girls resistant to HIV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Widely denounced and later sentenced to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/30/131061/he-jiankui-sentenced-to-three-years-in-prison-for-crispr-babies/\">a three-year prison term</a> for violating medical regulations, He embarrassed scientific leaders. He’d told many of his plans and even <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/27/1821/rogue-chinese-crispr-scientist-cited-us-report-as-his-green-light/\">cited an earlier report</a> from the National Academies as his ethical green light. That 2017 report had called use of the technology premature but endorsed it as morally permissible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The China debacle directly “precipitated” the current project, says Kay Davies, a geneticist at Oxford University and co-chair of the new panel. Unlike previous reports, this one does not dwell on ethical debates, but instead tackles the practical question of a “responsible translational pathway”—that is, what the technology’s appropriate use in medicine might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everyone needs to pay attention to the initial uses and how they should be limited. That is what this is about,” says Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University, who sat on the panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kahn, Davies, Lifton, and the other panelists said that if the technology matures and countries allow its use, the first applications should be in those rare situations in which two partners suffer from the same serious inherited disease. In such cases, neither parent would have a normal gene to pass down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example would be two people with cystic fibrosis who want to have kids. Such situations are not common, and the panel tried to estimate how often they could arise. For instance, in the US, about one in 13 African-Americans carries the genetic trait for sickle-cell disease. Those who inherit two copies of the mutation (about one in 350) will develop the condition, which affects the red blood cells and can cause painful, life-shortening complications. The report estimates there could be 80 couples in the US where both partners have sickle-cell disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those couples would not be able to have healthy children of their own without genetic editing. In Asia, meanwhile, the blood disorder beta thalassemia is common enough to create similar situations, according to the report, and other such problems can arise in cultures where people frequently marry close cousins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeanne O’Brien, a fertility specialist at Shady Grove Fertility in Maryland, says the panel’s focus on reproductive gene editing for Black people could raise questions about fairness. People with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/18/sickle-cell-pain-treatment/\">sickle-cell disease</a> in the US “have been left behind because they are often Black and poor,” she says, but now they are sought after to participate in gene-therapy experiments. “It’s ironic this group is currently the one in demand for biotech innovation,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scientists who wrote the report still don’t believe that genome editing is ready to use in reproductive clinics. That’s because it’s prone to introducing unexpected mutations that are hard to spot, and it can generate embryos with a mixture of edited and unedited cells. Those problems, and more, were apparent in an <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/03/131752/chinas-crispr-babies-read-exclusive-excerpts-he-jiankui-paper/\">unpublished manuscript</a> describing China’s CRISPR babies, which MIT Technology Review published excerpts of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Benjamin Hurlbut, a sociologist at the Arizona State University, the new project was undertaken “to salvage the damaged reputation of the genome editing field by showing how to do responsibly what [He Jiankui] did irresponsibly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using CRISPR safely in reproductive clinics will require technical improvements. One is a means of distinguishing normal from diseased embryos, even when they consist of a single cell, so that the former aren’t “needlessly” edited and brought to term. Also needed are more precise editing methods able to reproduce exact DNA sequences found in healthy people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Eric Lander, head of the Broad Institute and a member of the panel, the group’s conclusion that genome-editing technology needs several more years of research amounts to an extended moratorium on further CRISPR babies. “The notion of clear thresholds and careful consideration about whether to cross them is an important aspect of the report,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to pinpointing medically legitimate reasons to make CRISPR babies, the panelists also called for an international body to oversee the work. That could be something along the lines of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which inspects nuclear sites and polices treaties. Also needed is a way for whistleblowers to denounce unethical experiments, the panel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our group was very concerned about the potential for rogue scientists to embark on their own,” says Lifton. “This field is obviously moving very rapidly, with a high pace of technological advance. We can’t stay abreast of it without a mechanism.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether would-be baby makers or governments will heed the recommendations is not clear. But many countries already ban the creation of genetically modified humans, whatever their purpose: the procedure is prohibited in the US and at least 66 other countries, according to the results of an unpublished survey by Françoise Baylis, a bioethicist at Dalhousie University, in Canada. Of more than 100 nations whose laws and regulations she reviewed, only a handful would permit the technology’s use.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 22:45:09 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9627f5b075ae6bbbc5968bbf390b2030","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Amy Nordrum","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748687},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"In defense of California","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1008113","description":"\n<p>About a year after graduating from college, I packed my possessions into a rental van I’d split with a near stranger and departed my home state of Ohio. We steered onto I-70 West, bound for San Francisco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I was less drawn to California in any specific way than determined to escape a state that was too conservative, homogenous, and religious for my tastes. Plus, oof, the winters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that soon changed. The more I explored California’s coastline, hiked the trails of the Sierra, stared up at the granite walls of Yosemite, and met others who felt pushed or pulled here, the more I developed what I jokingly call a “zeal of the convert” attitude toward the state. Today, more than two decades after I arrived here in that rental van, this allegiance manifests as knee-jerk defensiveness when others take shots at California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it’s been heartbreaking to watch my adopted state suffer through some of the deadliest and most devastating fire seasons in its history. And it’s been infuriating to see commentators pounce on the tragedies, or the planned electricity blackouts designed to prevent them, and declare that they’ll doom the state or spark a mass exodus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1688\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?w=3000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008114\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg 3000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /><figcaption>Half Dome in Yosemite National Park. </figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">JAMES TEMPLE</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an increasingly popular take, producing ridiculous headlines like “California is becoming unlivable, according to science” and “California is a failed state. How do we know? They’re moving to Arizona in droves.” (Links withheld out of pettiness.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’ll admit that my reaction to such suggestions wasn’t as swift or aggrieved when this year’s outages and fires began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, the state’s main grid operator <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/18/1007212/california-heatwave-rolling-blackouts-grid-climate-change/\">ordered a series of rolling blackouts</a>, California’s first unplanned outages in nearly two decades, as millions of air conditioners strained to keep up with blistering heat waves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same week, hundreds of small lightning-sparked fires converged into conflagrations that soon ripped across more than a million acres, forced more than 100,000 residents to vacate their homes, and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/12/21/138163/the-day-i-tasted-climate-change/\">filled Northern California’s sky with dangerously high levels of particulate matter.</a> Fires have destroyed thousands of properties and killed eight people in the state so far this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s different, of course, is that we’ve already lost so much else in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upsides to living in one of the most expensive parts of the world aren’t as clear when you can’t enjoy its amenities; when its dense collection of restaurants, bars, museums, and concert venues are all empty; when you’re forced to communicate with friends by Zoom whether you’re down the block or three time zones away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, being trapped indoors by smoke felt like a bigger sacrifice. Because of the pandemic, I already couldn’t escape my tiny Berkeley apartment to visit an office, coffee shop, or gym. Then, because of the fires, I couldn’t even go outdoors. For the past few weeks, I’ve largely allowed air quality readings to dictate when I should walk my dog, and whether I can venture out for a hike or run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being stuck indoors is a trifling inconvenience when so many others have lost their homes, loved ones, or lives in recent years. But it adds to a dispiriting sense of fatigue in a year that’s already been so trying in so many ways. And it magnifies the fire risks that most Californians, including those <a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/08/15/berkeley-hills-at-increased-risk-for-fire-over-weekend/\">in my neighborhood</a>, are living with today. Accelerating climate change, development along wilderness boundaries, and rigid forest management practices have all increased <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab83a7\">the dangers of devastating wildfires in the state</a> and <a href=\"http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3343\">across much of the American West</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stay or go?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did find myself asking, out loud on a call with colleagues a few weeks ago: Is this sustainable? Can businesses stay here? Can I?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I never get too far down that thought path before running into the same two questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First: Where else would I go? In this moment, what place feels a whole lot safer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorado is on fire too. A hurricane just hit the Texas and Louisiana coasts, followed by a heat wave. Family members who offered me places to stay live in red or swing states where I’d dread walking into grocery stores packed with people proudly refusing to wear masks. Most of the rest of the world isn’t eagerly welcoming Americans given our covid infection rates, in one of the darkest ironies of US president Donald Trump’s xenophobia-fueled rise to power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1687\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg?w=3000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008116\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg 3000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /><figcaption>Banner Peak, a nearly 13,000-foot mountain in the Sierra Nevada range.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">JAMES TEMPLE</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Second: What other region would I trust more to combat the overlapping problems that climate change will increasingly cause or intensify around the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider how California responded to the covid pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As frightening as life was in early March, when the first cases were reported in the US, I was comforted and at times even proud, watching state and local leaders take fast and decisive steps. Heeding the advice of public health experts, they quickly shut down businesses, enacted shelter-in-place orders, and built up testing and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/08/998758/how-san-francisco-plans-to-trace-every-coronavirus-case-and-contact/\">contact tracing capacity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/30/1004696/theres-not-one-reason-californias-covid-19-cases-are-soaring-there-are-many/\">certainly mistakes</a>. Some areas and businesses reopened too soon; others have been held up too long. But there is at least a basic belief here that expertise matters, that we should base decisions on data and science, and that informed public policy can solve problems. It also helps to have a Democratic supermajority that can occasionally pass substantive laws, as evidenced by the suite of climate regulations pushing the state toward an ever-cleaner mix of energy sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Just the start</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right-wing commentators slam California at every opportunity, primarily not because of its failures but because of its successes. California is a bright, shining example that you can build a humming engine of economic growth, even in a state that embraces relatively high taxes and progressive values—an unforgivable assault on conservative worldviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fairest critique of the Bay Area has to do with its absurd housing costs. It’s a very real and serious problem, but one that actually underlines the state’s appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, some people and some companies move away. And yes, more than usual are relocating now, given the strains of the pandemic and the fact that many people can suddenly work from anywhere. But the region’s world-class universities, cluster of tech companies, stunning natural beauty, leftish politics, and diverse demographics have drawn bright, engaged minds from around the world for decades. And that’s not going to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic will eventually end. Nothing has dimmed the fundamental appeal of urban life, despite what some <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-08-22/bloomberg-new-economy-the-pandemic-can-t-stop-the-rise-of-cities\">premature obituaries for the nation’s great cities</a> may say. And the next set of arrivals will invent new businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won’t underplay the depth and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/15/130892/climate-change-green-infrastructure-us-public-works-building-boom/\">complexity</a> of California’s challenges. Significantly reducing fire dangers here demands sweeping changes in policies and practices, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/15/139070/california-must-reinvent-its-practices-and-policies-for-a-deadly-new-fire-reality/\">as I’ve written</a>. Doing it all without having to shut down electricity service from time to time will require overhauling the state’s antiquated distribution and transmission systems, which could take years and cost billions. And to meaningfully address most of its mounting problems, the state must finally grapple with its fundamental inability <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/15/130892/climate-change-green-infrastructure-us-public-works-building-boom/\">to approve and build housing and infrastructure in reasonable amounts of time</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have some confidence, at least, in the state’s professional, technocratic-minded leaders to make good-faith efforts to address these challenges—and others we’ll face as the planet heats further. In many ways, <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/02/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-enhance-wildfire-mitigation-preparedness-and-response-efforts/\">they’ve already begun</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some areas truly will become unlivable in the years to come, as temperatures soar and sea levels rise. But for those who think people should move at the first signs of the difficulties driven by global warming, I’ve got bad news. This is just the start, and climate change is very likely coming for your town too.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:50:10 +0000","feedId":2131,"bgimg":"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?w=3000","linkMd5":"0e82898f66119e7c235ee75e5c3d4380","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-35-50-171_6729c5a6405c3745.webp","destWidth":3000,"destHeight":1688,"sourceBytes":661994,"destBytes":661994,"author":"James Temple","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC03296-1.jpg?w=3000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-35-50-171_6729c5a6405c3745.webp","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3284-1.jpg?w=3000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-36-07-648_641cdc24710e4636.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287748683},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:35:48","title":"Why do you feel lonely? Neuroscience is starting to find answers.","link":"https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1008008","description":"\n<p>Long before the world had ever heard of covid-19, Kay Tye set out to answer a question that has taken on new resonance in the age of social distancing: When people feel lonely, do they crave social interactions in the same way a hungry person craves food? And could she and her colleagues detect and measure this “hunger” in the neural circuits of the brain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Loneliness is a universal thing. If I were to ask people on the street, ‘Do you know what it means to be lonely?’ probably 99 or 100% of people would say yes,” explains Tye, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute of Biological Sciences.&#160;“It seems reasonable to argue that it should be a concept in neuroscience. It’s just that nobody ever found a way to test it and localize it to specific cells. That’s what we are trying to do.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, a vast scientific literature has emerged linking loneliness to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, and drug abuse. There is even a growing body of epidemiological work showing that loneliness makes you more likely to fall ill: it seems to prompt the chronic release of hormones that suppress healthy immune function. Biochemical changes from loneliness can accelerate the spread of cancer, hasten heart disease and Alzheimer’s, or simply drain the most vital among us of the will to go on. The ability to measure and detect it could help identify those at risk and pave the way for new kinds of interventions.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the months ahead, many are warning, we’re likely to see the mental-health impacts of covid-19 play out on a global scale. Psychiatrists are already worried about rising rates of suicide and drug overdoses in the US, and social isolation, along with anxiety and chronic stress, is one likely cause. “The recognition of the impact of social isolation on the rest of mental health is going to hit everyone really soon,” Tye says. “I think the impact on mental health will be pretty intense and pretty immediate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet quantifying, or even defining, loneliness is a difficult challenge. So difficult, in fact, that neuroscientists have long avoided the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loneliness, Tye says, is inherently subjective. It’s possible to spend the day completely isolated, in quiet contemplation, and feel invigorated.&#160;Or to stew in alienated misery surrounded by a crowd, in the heart of a big city, or accompanied by close friends and family. Or, to take a more contemporary example, to participate in a Zoom call with loved ones in another city and feel deeply connected—or even more lonely than when the call began.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fuzziness might explain the curious results that came back when Tye, before publishing her first scientific paper on the neuroscience of loneliness in 2016, ran a search for other papers on the topic. Though she found studies on loneliness in the psychological literature, the number of papers that also contained the words “cells,” “neurons,” or “brain” was precisely zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-large\"><p>Neuroscientists have long assumed that questions about how loneliness might work in the human brain would elude their data-driven labs.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the nature of loneliness has preoccupied some of the greatest minds in philosophy, literature, and art for millennia, neuroscientists have long assumed that questions about how it might work in the human brain would elude their data-driven labs. How do you quantify the experience? And where would you even begin to look in the brain for the changes brought about by such a subjective feeling?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tye hopes to change that by building an entirely new field: one aimed at analyzing and understanding how our sensory perceptions, previous experiences, genetic predispositions, and life situations combine with our environment to produce a concrete, measurable biological state called loneliness. And she wants to identify what that seemingly ineffable experience looks like when it is activated in the brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Tye succeeds, it could lead to new tools for identifying and monitoring those at risk from illnesses worsened by loneliness. It could also yield better ways to handle what could be a looming public health crisis triggered by covid-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Finding the loneliness neurons</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tye has homed in on specific populations of neurons in rodent brains that seem to be associated with a measurable need for social interaction—a hunger that can be manipulated by directly stimulating the neurons themselves. To pinpoint these neurons, Tye relied on a technique she developed while working as a postdoc in the Stanford University lab of Karl Deisseroth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deisseroth had pioneered optogenetics, a technique in which genetically engineered, light-sensitive proteins are implanted into brain cells; researchers can then turn individual neurons on or off simply by shining lights on them though fiber-optic cables. Though the technique is far too invasive to use in people—as well as an injection into the brain to deliver the proteins, it requires threading the fiber-optic cable through the skull and directly into the brain—it allows researchers to tweak neurons in live, freely moving rodents and then observe their behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tye began using optogenetics in rodents to trace the neural circuits involved in emotion, motivation, and social behaviors. She found that by activating a neuron and then identifying the other parts of the brain that responded to the signal the neuron gave out, she could trace the discrete circuits of cells that work together to perform specific functions. Tye meticulously traced the connections out of the amygdala, an almond-shaped set of neurons thought to be the seat of fear and anxiety both in rodents and in humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS_MITTechnologyReview_KayTye_1742_web.jpg?w=3000\" alt=\"Kay Tye\" class=\"wp-image-1007890\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS_MITTechnologyReview_KayTye_1742_web.jpg 3000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS_MITTechnologyReview_KayTye_1742_web.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS_MITTechnologyReview_KayTye_1742_web.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS_MITTechnologyReview_KayTye_1742_web.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS_MITTechnologyReview_KayTye_1742_web.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /><figcaption>Kay Tye, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute of Biological Sciences, is trying to detect and measure loneliness in the brain&#8217;s neural circuits.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">JENNY SIEGWART</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientists had long known that stimulating the amygdala as a whole could cause an animal to cower in fear. But by following the maze of connections in and out of different parts of the amygdala, Tye was able to demonstrate that the brain’s “fear circuit” was capable of imbuing sensory stimuli with far more nuance than previously understood. It seemed, in fact, to modulate courage too.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Tye set up her lab at MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory in 2012, she was following the neural connections of the amygdala to places like the prefrontal cortex, known as the brain’s executive, and the hippocampus, the seat of episodic memory. The goal was to construct maps of the circuits across the brain that we rely on to understand the world, make meaning of our moment-to-moment experience, and respond to different situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began studying loneliness largely by serendipity. While scouting for new postdocs, Tye came across the work of Gillian Matthews. As a graduate student at Imperial College London, Matthews had made an unexpected discovery when she separated the mice in her experiments from one another. Social isolation—the very fact of being alone—seemed to have changed brain cells called DRN neurons in ways that implied they might play a role in loneliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tye immediately saw the possibilities. “Oh, my gosh—this is incredible!” she recalls thinking. That the signs of social isolation could be traced to a specific part of the brain made total sense to her. “But where is it and how would you find it? If this could be the region, I thought, that would be super interesting.” In all her studies of neurons, says Tye, “I’d never seen anything about social isolation before. Ever.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tye realized that if she and Matthews could construct a map of a loneliness circuit, they could answer in the lab precisely the kinds of questions she hoped to explore: How does the brain imbue social isolation with meaning? How and when does the objective experience of not being around people, in other words, become the subjective experience of loneliness?&#160;The first step was to better understand the role&#160;the&#160;DRN neurons played in this mental state.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h6>DRN neurons are shown here within the dopamine system and downstream circuitry.</h6>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"214\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Image-2_web.jpg?w=214\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008040\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Image-2_web.jpg 214w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Image-2_web.jpg?resize=150,150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"241\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DRN-ChR2-TH-5HT_web.jpg?w=241\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008039\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DRN-ChR2-TH-5HT_web.jpg 241w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DRN-ChR2-TH-5HT_web.jpg?resize=150,150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Image-4_web.jpg?w=524\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008041\" width=\"235\" height=\"232\"/></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first things Tye and Matthews noticed was that when they stimulated these neurons, the animals were more likely to seek social interaction with other mice. In a later experiment, they showed that animals, when given the choice, actively avoided areas of their cages that, when entered, triggered the activation of the neurons. This suggested that their quest for social interaction was driven more by a desire to avoid pain than to generate pleasure—an experience that mimicked the “aversive” experience of loneliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a follow-up experiment, the researchers put some of the mice in solitary confinement for 24 hours and then reintroduced them to social groups. As one would expect, the animals sought out and spent an unusual amount of time interacting with other animals, as if they’d been “lonely.” Then Tye and Matthews isolated the same mice again, this time using optogenetics to silence the DRN neurons after the period in solitary. This time, the animals lost the desire for social contact. It was as if the social isolation had not been registered in their brains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientists have long known that the brain harbors the biological equivalent of a car’s fuel gauge—a complex homeostatic system that allows our gray matter to track the state of our basic biological needs, like those for food, water, and sleep. The purpose of the system is to drive us toward behaviors aimed at maintaining or restoring our natural state of balance.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tye and Matthews seemed to have found the equivalent of a homeostatic regulator for the basic social-contact needs of rodents. The next question: What do these findings mean for people?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Hungry for a smile</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer that question, Tye is working with researchers in the lab of Rebecca Saxe, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at MIT, who specializes in the study of human social cognition and emotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The human experiments are far harder to design because the brain surgery required for optogenetics is not an option. But it’s possible to expose lonely people to pictures of friendly people offering social cues—like a smile—and then monitor and record changes in blood flow to different parts of the brain using fMRI imaging. And, thanks to previous experiments, scientists have a good idea of where in the brain to look—an area analogous to the one Matthews and Tye studied in mice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Livia Tomova, a postdoc who has been overseeing the research in Saxe’s lab, recruited 40 volunteers who self-identified as having large social networks and very low levels of loneliness. Tomova exiled her subjects to a room in the lab and forbade any human contact for 10 hours. For comparison, Tomova asked the same participants to come back for a second 10-hour session that contained plenty of social interaction, but no food.</p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Tomova and Saxe used fMRI scans to measure the brain’s response to food and social interaction after periods of fasting and isolation. The scan on the right shows activity in the midbrain associated with rewards.</h6>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_SNVTA.001.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"fmri scan midbrain\" class=\"wp-image-1008019\" width=\"472\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_SNVTA.001.jpeg 1024w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_SNVTA.001.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_SNVTA.001.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_functional.001.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"fmri scan\" class=\"wp-image-1008018\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_functional.001.jpeg 1024w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_functional.001.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Midbrain_functional.001.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of each session, the subjects were asked to climb into the fMRI scanner and were exposed to different images: some showed people offering nonverbal social cues, and others contained pictures of food.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Tye and Matthews, Tomova was unable to home in on individual neurons. But she was able to track changes in blood flow within larger areas of the scan, known as voxels; each voxel displayed the changing activity of discrete populations of several thousand neurons. Tomova focused in on areas of the midbrain known to be rich in the neurons associated with producing and processing the neurotransmitter dopamine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These areas have already been linked in other experiments to the sensation of “wanting” or “craving” something. They’re areas that light up in response to images of food when a person is hungry, or to drug-related images in people with addiction. Would they do the same in lonely people shown pictures of a smile?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer was clear: after the social isolation, the subjects’ brain scans showed far more activity in the midbrain when they were shown the pictures of social cues. When the subjects were hungry but had not been socially isolated, they exhibited a similarly robust reaction to the food cues, but not to the social ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Whether it’s the drive for social contact or the drive for other things like food, it seems to be represented in a very similar way,” says Tomova.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The pandemic experiment</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how the hunger for social contact is produced in the brain might allow a deeper understanding of the role social isolation plays in some illnesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Objectively measuring loneliness in the brain, as opposed to asking people how they feel, could provide some clarity on the connection between depression and loneliness, for example. Which comes first—does depression cause loneliness, or does loneliness cause depression? And might social intervention applied at the right time help fight depression?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insights into the circuitry of loneliness in the brain might also shed some light on addiction, which isolated animals are more prone to, according to some research. The evidence appears particularly strong in adolescent animals, which seem to be even more sensitive to the effects of social isolation than older or younger ones. Humans between the ages of 16 and 24 are the most likely to report feeling lonely, and this is also the age when many mental-health disorders first begin to manifest. Is there a connection?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-large\"><p>Insights into the circuitry of loneliness in the brain might shed some light on addiction.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most obvious current need may be in response to the social isolation prompted by the covid pandemic. Some <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/15/890777131/video-chats-driveway-dances-and-dino-parades-buffer-pandemics-loneliness\">internet surveys report no overall increase in loneliness</a> since the pandemic began, but what about people at most risk of mental-health problems? When they are isolated, at what point does it begin to endanger their psychological and physical well-being? And what types of interventions might protect them from that danger?

Fed into a media ecosystem with an established bias toward highlighting violence and rioting, the videos have mobilized white militia and vigilante groups to take up arms against Black Lives Matter and “antifa” protesters. This feedback circuit has created a self-fulfilling cycle where white vigilantes feel justified in menacing and physically attacking racial justice protesters—and inspire others to do the same.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The role of video</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Research on social movements has long focused on the ways that media mobilizes people to take direct action. Audio and video clips from protests can evoke an emotional and visceral reaction in those who see them. Over the last decade, we’ve seen this emerge most often with calls for racial and economic justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past summer, the recorded murder of George Floyd—just one in a seemingly endless line of merciless and vicious events perpetrated by police against Black people, from Selma to Mike Brown, from Rodney King to Sandra Bland and Jacob Blake—motivated millions of people worldwide to protest against police brutality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just racial justice protests that benefit from the outrage caused by video. In September 2011, very few people cared about Occupy Wall Street—a bunch of hippies, anarchists, and freaks were sleeping in a park in Manhattan. But after a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moD2JnGTToA\"> video of young white women being “kettled” and pepper-sprayed by NYPD officer Anthony Bologna</a> ricocheted across social media, thousands of people set up Occupy encampments across the globe.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until that moment, the movement was not being widely covered in the mainstream press, but the video’s circulation compelled larger media organizations to pay attention. We don’t know what would have happened in the absence of that video, but over the course of four years I spent interviewing Occupy protesters about their experience, many recalled it as the motivating factor in them getting into the streets.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And visuals can be just as motivating for the right wing—recently, perhaps even more so.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because right-wing reactionaries do not have the same kind of experience in organizing street protests as the left, they instead rely heavily on social media—particularly Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter—to mobilize crowds. Their efforts to counter the wave of public support for Black Lives Matter protests have made extensive use of this tactic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a scholar of social movements and media studies, I see an alarming split between the types of content consumed by right-wing reactionaries and left-wing social justice advocates. Given the way media accounts shape public perceptions about protest and define who has recourse to the “legitimate use of violence,” the kinds of content shared within these hyperpartisan media systems play a powerful yet often invisible role in mobilizing white vigilante groups. If social-media companies do not act swiftly to stop calls for violence against protesters, the situation can only get worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The rise of riot porn</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the George Floyd protests, conservative media outlets including Fox News (particularly Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity), One America News, Glenn Beck’s BlazeTV, and right-wing YouTubers have been covering Black Lives Matter and other left-wing protests daily, specifically highlighting instances of violence, fighting, and property damage. This coverage has come to dominate the right-wing narrative in a new way, flipping the script to suggest that Black protesters—demonstrating because they fear police violence—are themselves a threat to white people.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mainstream media bias toward covering violence in protests is<a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/its-time-to-change-the-way-the-media-reports-on-protests-here-are-some-ideas/\"> well studied</a>, best encapsulated by the saying “If it bleeds, it leads.” Most protests are largely peaceful, but “Citizens gather, grieve, and leave” is no story at all. This directs a disproportionate amount of attention across the entire media ecosystem to violent protesters. Now, with social media as a broadcast system, the right-wing media has upped the ante.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to analysis I conducted using MediaCloud, a research tool from MIT and Harvard, right-wing media outlets wrote five to six times more articles about Seattle’s<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone\"> “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone”</a> than did center or left media. What has been a minor storyline among left-wing audiences has been dramatically overemphasized by right-wing media because these protests provided plenty of visceral content for online content creators. In one case,<a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/fox-news-runs-digitally-altered-images-in-coverage-of-seattles-protests-capitol-hill-autonomous-zone/\"> Fox News manipulated photos</a> to make protesters appear more ominous and threatening, while other right-wing outlets falsely reported that the occupying protesters were extorting local businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>These narratives have been intensified and supplemented by the work of right-wing adversarial media-makers like Elijah Schaffer and Andy Ngo, who collect videos of conflict at public protests and recirculate them to their online audiences. Both have even gone “undercover” by posing as protesters to capture footage for their channels, seeking to name and shame those marching. Their videos are edited, decontextualized, and shared among audiences hungry for a new fix of “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00141844.2013.778309\">riot porn</a>,” which instantly goes viral across the right-wing media ecosystem with the aid of influential pundits and politicians, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/31/trump-falls-video-dallas-clash-edited-cast-machete-wielding-vigilante-victim/\">including President Donald Trump</a>. The footage has a hypnotic, almost balletic quality, designed to influence and overwhelm the sense-making capacity of watchers consuming it from a safe distance online.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riot porn is different from videos of abuse and violence carried out by police, and we should not confuse one for the other. In the recording of the George Floyd murder, the video mobilized hundreds of thousands of people outraged that Floyd’s killer had not been arrested. With riot porn, what moves someone from watching to showing up is the potential for participating in a violent altercation. The motivating factor is the hope to live out fantasies of taking justice into their own hands, à la <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQBkAr1KCSc\">Dirty Harry</a>, the film series about a rogue cop who shirks protocol and murders at will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by the reactions shared by followers of right-wing influencers, riot porn further enrages and traumatizes these audiences from afar, inflaming their perceptions of risk and danger. In chat rooms, watchers actively cheer as cops and other aggressors brutalize Black Lives Matter activists. These emotional reactions help develop an unshakable trust between the partisan content creators and the content consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Propaganda machine</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/25/697052006/anger-can-be-contagious-heres-how-to-stop-the-spread\">Outrage contagion</a> is why the McCloskeys, the husband-and-wife duo who pointed guns at Black Lives Matter marchers in St. Louis, were motivated to take their bizarre stand. It’s also why the couple were invited to address the Republican National Convention—an audience being encouraged to vote for Donald Trump’s reelection. They spoke on topics such as guns, property, and the threat posed by “Marxist liberals.” Peering into the camera from a velvet couch,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ62o7TGQlw\"> they read from the teleprompter</a>: “What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods across our country … Make no mistake: no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America … You’ve seen us on your TV screens and Twitter feeds. You know we’re not the kind of people who back down.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are both the product of riot porn and participants in creating the next cycle of it. First, they consumed coverage of the St. Louis protests, during which a 7-Eleven was burned. This, the McCloskeys claim, prompted them to put fire extinguishers in every room and keep a rifle ready. When Black Lives Matter activists marched on their street, they reacted as if it were a death threat. It wasn’t, and <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/mccloskeys-make-first-court-appearance-in-st-louis-gun-case/article_bf489678-e072-5ea1-8eb4-f2c8679ec73f.html\">their armed display</a> resulted in felony charges. Right-wing media and Republicans have turned them into heroes alongside Rittenhouse, affectionately known as the “Kenosha Kid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem isn’t simply that riot porn exists, or that people with divergent opinions can interpret videos differently depending on their social-media feeds.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just that social-media platforms don’t know what to do with white vigilante organizing. Although they clearly don’t: Facebook’s attempt to limit the spread of propaganda about Rittenhouse by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404518/facebook-search-kyle-rittenhouse-blocked-kenosha-shooting\">blocking searches on his name</a> is a drastic solution to a problem of its own making. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/kenosha-militia-facebook-reported-455-times-moderators\">Facebook took no action</a> on 455 flags marking the Kenosha Guard’s event page as potentially dangerous. Memes in support of Rittenhouse and calls for armed MAGA rallies are on the rise.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real difficulty is that competing accounts circulate in parallel universes that are not even close to balanced in their reach. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/technology/what-if-facebook-is-the-real-silent-majority.html\">Kevin Roose of the New York Times pointed out</a> that the majority of people on Facebook are witnessing a radically different narrative from the one presented to consumers of mainstream media. In August, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1300139878651367425?s=20\">he tweeted</a>, CNN saw 21 million Facebook interactions; the right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro gathered 55 million. This doesn’t mean there’s a silent majority of right-wing media consumers—in fact, it means that the right-wing media ecosystem continues to be dense and insular, which makes the propaganda feedback loop much more effective at shaping audience perceptions and world views. Harvard researchers Yochai Benkler, Rob Faris, and Hal Roberts have described this effect in their study “<a href=\"http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780190923624.pdf\">Networked Propaganda</a>.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Escalation, not reconciliation </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been almost three months since<a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25933\"> an independent group of United Nations</a> experts called on the US government to conduct an independent investigation into <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?474486-1/the-condemnation-blackness\">racial terror</a>. The reaction to the murder of George Floyd suggested for a moment that the US public was awakened to their country’s horrors and might be mobilized to do something.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, as the events of the last week have shown, wave after wave of white vigilante violence has followed. Several cities and towns have become treacherous terrain, where militias, MAGA groups, and conspiracists are carrying out their civil war fantasies by attacking Black Lives Matter protesters as police look on. The optics are reminiscent of the Freedom Rides in the 1960s, when police turned away as local white vigilantes attacked civil rights advocates.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last weekend in Portland, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/us/portland-shooting-explained.html\">long caravan of Trump supporters</a> arrived with blacked-out license plates, paintball guns, actual guns, and bear mace; they drove their trucks straight at protesters. Some of these crimes were streamed live on Facebook and YouTube. Trump later justified their actions, saying that “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-8-31-2020/\">paint is a defensive mechanism; paint is not bullets</a>.” That same night, a member of the far-right group Patriot Prayer was murdered, but no details on the shooter are available. Nevertheless, the media narrative on the right is clear: antifa must have done it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using riot porn to incite fear in white people, the right-wing media ecosystem converts the real pain experienced by Black Americans into fodder for deranged, paranoid fantasies that white vigilantes must take up the functions of the police. Social-media companies need to work actively to prevent militias and vigilante groups from staging these armed standoffs. This includes shutting down event pages that are used as central organizing hubs and removing the accounts of those who are calling for physical violence. What played out in Portland and Kenosha this week is another confirmation that racial terror is real and getting worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Joan Donovan is research director at Harvard Kennedy’s
