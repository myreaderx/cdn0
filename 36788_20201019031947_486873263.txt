Those balls of mercury were really just very reflective drops of water. But something about this plant mesmerized me, and I stopped to take a closer look. The plant, by the way, is a plume poppy (<em>Macleaya cordata</em>). It&#8217;s got these lovely fractalesque, large green leaves and is native to China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Do you notice what struck me as odd about this scene?</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113068\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113068\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/plume-poppy-zoom.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1130681  \" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/plume-poppy-zoom.jpg\" alt=\"plume poppy zoom\" width=\"660\" height=\"660\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><img class=\"photo\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/vendor/condenast/pangea/themes/wired/assets/images/gallery-cam@2x.png\" alt=\"\" /> Aatish Bhatia</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Those water drops are just so.. <em>round</em>.

This leaf must have some kind of natural water-repelling surface that prevents it from getting wet.</p>\n<p>A couple of days later, I snapped off a leaf and brought it to my friend Janine Nunes. Janine is a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University. She&#8217;s a super-skilled researcher, and she also has access to some of the coolest toys in existence.

It&#8217;s sitting on some surface, like your table, your bathtub, or a leaf. This surface pulls down on the water, and squishes the sphere into a pancake. So it looks more like this.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113314\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113314\" style=\"width: 440px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drop0.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1133141\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drop0.png\" alt=\"drop0\" width=\"440\" height=\"268\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113314\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><img class=\"ill-icon\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/vendor/condenast/pangea/themes/wired/assets/images/gallery-illo@2x.png\" alt=\"\" /> Aatish Bhatia</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In fact, you can measure just how &#8216;wettable&#8217; a surface is by calculating its <em>contact angle</em>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113317\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113317\" style=\"width: 440px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drop4.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1133171\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drop4.png\" alt=\"drop4\" width=\"440\" height=\"315\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113317\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><img class=\"ill-icon\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/vendor/condenast/pangea/themes/wired/assets/images/gallery-illo@2x.png\" alt=\"\" /> Aatish Bhatia</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The more a surface attracts the water, the more it squishes the ball into a pancake, and the wetter the surface.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113318\" style=\"width: 308px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dropacute.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-1133181  \" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dropacute.png\" alt=\"dropacute\" width=\"308\" height=\"337\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydrophilic (water-loving) surfaces squish the water ball into a pancake. <img class=\"ill-icon\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/vendor/condenast/pangea/themes/wired/assets/images/gallery-illo@2x.png\" alt=\"\" /> Aatish Bhatia</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On the other hand, <em>hydrophobic</em> (water-hating) surfaces attract the water less, so the drop is more round.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113316\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113316\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drop2.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-1133161\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drop2.png\" alt=\"drop2\" width=\"350\" height=\"340\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><img class=\"ill-icon\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/vendor/condenast/pangea/themes/wired/assets/images/gallery-illo@2x.png\" alt=\"\" /> Aatish Bhatia</figcaption></figure>\n<p>And then you have <em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">superhydrophobic</em> surfaces, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZrjXSsfxMQ\">Never Wet</a>, which barely attract the water at all.

The contact angle works out to about 175 degrees. The leaf is extremely water repellent &#8211; it&#8217;s superhydrophobic.</p>\n<p><strong>But how does a leaf become superhydrophobic?</strong> The trick to this, Janine explained, is that the water isn&#8217;t really sitting on the surface. A superhydrophobic surface is a little like a bed of nails. The nails touch the water, but there are gaps in between them. So there&#8217;s fewer points of contact, which means the surface can&#8217;t tug on the water as much, and so the drop stays round.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1132281\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1132281\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cassie-Baxter.png#mediaviewer/File:Cassie-Baxter.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1132281\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cassie-Baxter.png\" alt=\"Cassie-Baxter\" width=\"630\" height=\"400\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1132281\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">To get superhydrophobic, a drop must lie on a surface that looks like a bed of nails. <img class=\"photo\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/vendor/condenast/pangea/themes/wired/assets/images/gallery-cam@2x.png\" alt=\"\" /> ZanderZ / Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If this explanation is correct, then the surface of the plume poppy&#8217;s leaf must be coated in tiny needles.

These needles are way smaller than your eye can see. <strong>This ability to touch without really touching, by resting the water on a bed of nails, is the secret to the incredible water-repelling powers of this leaf.</strong></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one last thing I wanted to know. Why did this plant, and so many others, evolve this incredible ability to keep water at bay? One common explanation is that this allows the leaves to clean themselves. You see, as water rolls around on a superhydrophobic surface, it scoops up dirt and sand with it. Here&#8217;s Janine demonstrating this neat self-cleaning property of the leaf with genuine Jersey Shore (TM) sand.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RkgAZk5ngjQ?rel=0\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m not sure that I buy this explanation. Why would a plant evolve a method that cleans the under-side of its leaves? Maybe it produces the wax for some other reason, and as an accidental benefit, this wax just happens to keep the leaves clean? Is there a clear evolutionary advantage for these leaves to be superhydrophobic? I don&#8217;t know the answer, but I&#8217;d love to find out.
