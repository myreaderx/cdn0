Chances are that algorithm was trained with data collected by able people, from their point of view — likely standing.</p>\n<p>A person in a wheelchair looking to do the same thing might find the system isn&#8217;t nearly as effective from that lower angle. Similarly a blind person will not know to hold the camera in the right position for long enough for the algorithm to do its work, so they must do so by trial and error.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Or consider a face recognition algorithm that&#8217;s meant to tell when you&#8217;re paying attention to the screen for some metric or another.

The tool is used by people who need help right away in telling, say, whether a cup of yogurt is expired or if there&#8217;s a car in the driveway. Microsoft worked with the app&#8217;s creator, Danna Gurari, to improve the app&#8217;s existing database of tens of thousands of images with associated questions and captions. They&#8217;re also working to alert a user when their image is too dark or blurry to analyze or submit.</p>\n<p>Inclusivity is complex because it&#8217;s about people and systems that, perhaps without even realizing it, define &#8220;normal&#8221; and then don&#8217;t work outside of those norms. If AI is going to be inclusive, &#8220;normal&#8221; needs to be redefined and that&#8217;s going to take a lot of hard work. Until recently, people weren&#8217;t even talking about it. But that&#8217;s changing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is stuff the ALS community wanted years ago,&#8221; said Casey. &#8220;This is technology that exists — it&#8217;s sitting on a shelf. Let&#8217;s put it to use. When we talk about it, people will do more, and that&#8217;s something the community needs as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Eza-1O-ixLg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:01:39 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ORBIT-Hero-Image.png","linkMd5":"9dbf71c48d5b10593984ac4407da84d3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn5@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-27-190_aae8968160354d6f.webp","destWidth":1460,"destHeight":822,"sourceBytes":773268,"destBytes":45704,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ORBIT-Hero-Image.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn5@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-27-190_aae8968160354d6f.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-captioning-1-1024x271-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn2@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-48-578_8666bbe6b3bce006.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn51@2020_4/2020/10/12/17-04-47-455_8e9210b545cdd24a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Eza-1O-ixLg:s5cGSNURK2Q:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-48-119_0cba3958bf417a83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Eza-1O-ixLg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn9@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-507_68ad5b8cec4b69b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266662},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"Twilio confirms it is buying Segment for $3.2B in an all-stock deal","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059118","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/twilio\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twilio\">Twilio <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> today <a href=\"https://investors.twilio.com/news/news-details/2020/Twilio-to-Acquire-Segment-the-Market-leading-Customer-Data-Platform/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a> its biggest acquisition to date, spearheading a stronger move into customer data management alongside its existing API-based tools for building and running communications services.</p>\n<p>Twilio is paying $3.2 billion to acquire <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/segment-io\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"segment-io\">Segment, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> a technology startup that lets organizations pull customer data from one app into another, by way of APIs, and use its platform to better control the movement of that customer data, used for marketing and other applications that benefit from customer identification and segmentation.</p>\n<p>This is an all-stock deal &#8212;

For years, the company has been criticized for not taking down this extremely offensive form of content in favor of allowing free speech and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/7/20/17590694/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial-recode\">distancing itself from taking on the responsibilities</a> of a traditional publisher. Today, it&#8217;s reversing that position, saying it will now update its hate-speech policy to &#8220;prohibit any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company said it made the decision amid a growing number of online hate speech attacks and is a part of Facebook&#8217;s newer efforts to fight the spread of hate speech across its platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have banned more than 250 white supremacist organizations and updated our policies to address militia groups and QAnon,&#8221; explained Facebook in an announcement, authored by Monika Bickert, VP of Content Policy. &#8220;We also routinely ban other individuals and organizations globally, and we took down 22.5 million pieces of hate speech from our platform in the second quarter of this year. Following a year of consultation with external experts, we recently banned anti-Semitic stereotypes about the collective power of Jews that often depicts them running the world or its major institutions,&#8221; the company said.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gRvQ7aVtrQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-gives-more-details-about-its-efforts-against-hate-speech-before-myanmars-general-election/\">Facebook gives more details about its efforts against hate speech before Myanmar&#8217;s general election</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook gives more details about its efforts against hate speech before Myanmar&#8217;s general election&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-gives-more-details-about-its-efforts-against-hate-speech-before-myanmars-general-election/embed/#?secret=gRvQ7aVtrQ\" data-secret=\"gRvQ7aVtrQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Facebook also shared some disturbing statistics representative of how its inaction on this front has impacted the world. It said that according to a recent survey of U.S. adults, ages 18-39, nearly a quarter said they believed the Holocaust was a myth, that it had been exaggerated or that they weren’t sure.</p>\n<p>The company noted, too, that institutions focused on Holocaust research and remembrance, such as Yad Vashem, have stressed that Holocaust education is a key component in combating anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>As many may recall, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg once used Holocaust denial as an example of where he thought Facebook shouldn&#8217;t intervene with regard to what&#8217;s posted to its platform. In a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher\">Recode interview</a> and related follow-up, he suggested that Holocaust denial was a wrong idea that he personally found &#8220;deeply offensive,&#8221; but said Facebook shouldn&#8217;t take that content down because &#8220;there are things that different people get wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The issue and its controversy, however, was not a new one to Facebook. Holocaust-denial content has been a longstanding problem for the company &#8212; and one where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/15/facebook-employees-speak-their-mind-on-holocaust-denial/\">many employees disagreed</a> with Facebook&#8217;s stated position on the matter. Even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/facebook-remains-stubbornly-proud-of-position-on-holocaust-denial/\">back in 2009</a>, Facebook had favored the protection of free speech, arguing that it outweighed the negative consequences.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Facebook was found to not only allow Holocaust denial on its platform, but to actively promote it. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/facebook-algorithm-found-to-actively-promote-holocaust-denial\">a 2020 investigation by U.K.-based counter-extremist organisation Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD),</a> Facebook search results would bring up suggestions for denial pages on Facebook. These would also recommend links to publishers who sold revisionist and denial literature, among other things.</p>\n<p>This summer, ADL and other civil rights organizations, like the NAACP and Color of Change, ran a month-long boycott of Facebook advertising in an effort to get Facebook to step up and do something about hate speech on its platform. The effort gained <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/media/facebook-boycott.html\">over 1,000 advertisers</a> and put pressure on the company to make changes.</p>\n<p>Facebook then moved to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/11/21363815/facebook-bans-blackface-anti-semitic-conspiracy-theories\">ban across Facebook and Instagram (for the first time) anti-Semitic conspiracy theories</a> about Jewish people running the world, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/\">began to ban QAnon</a>, which has some anti-Semitic elements. But it stopped short of taking action on Holocaust denial.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112455086578451\">a public Facebook post</a>, Zuckerberg added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve struggled with the tension between standing for free expression and the harm caused by minimizing or denying the horror of the Holocaust. My own thinking has evolved as I&#8217;ve seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech. Drawing the right lines between what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable speech isn&#8217;t straightforward, but with the current state of the world, I believe this is the right balance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook says its new decision on this matter does not mean users see an immediate clearing of this sort of content from the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Enforcement of these policies cannot happen overnight. There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement,&#8221; Facebook noted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ltlk6u3U7Z\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/\">Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/embed/#?secret=ltlk6u3U7Z\" data-secret=\"ltlk6u3U7Z\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/s9m7AJ1onVs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:37:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"e96716f0ccd7ed19c2776b723ae73da3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn66@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-46-370_9bfe28b70d05d444.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=s9m7AJ1onVs:dxrxPpe-Lo4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_4/2020/10/12/17-04-48-532_79991e6502711855.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/s9m7AJ1onVs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-47-591_4827f7559a337e09.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266663},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"India’s Razorpay becomes unicorn after new $100 million funding round","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059049","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Bangalore-headquartered <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/razorpay\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"razorpay\">Razorpay, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> one of the handful of Indian fintech startups that has demonstrated accelerated growth in recent years, has joined the coveted unicorn club after raising $100 million in a new financing round, the payments processing startup said on Monday.</p>\n<p>The new financing round, a Series D, was co-led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/gic\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"gic\">GIC <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Sequoia India, the six-year-old Indian startup said.

They began to explore opportunities around payments processing business after realizing just how difficult it was for small businesses such as young startups to accept money online less than a decade ago. There were very few payment processing firms in India then and startups needed to produce a long-list of documents.</p>\n<p>The early team of about 11 people at Razorpay shared a single apartment as the co-founders rushed to meet with over 100 bankers to convince banks to work with them. The conversations were slow and remained in a deadlock for so long that the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenge to investors numerous times, they recalled in an interview last year.</p>\n<p>To say things have changed for Razorpay would be an understatement. It’s become the largest payments provider for business in India, said Mathur. Razorpay, which competes with Prosus Ventures&#8217; PayU, accepts a wide-range of payment options including credit cards, debit cards, mobile wallets, and UPI.</p>\n<p>“Razorpay has established itself as a clear leader, with its strong focus on customer experience and product innovation,” said Choo Yong Cheen, Chief Investment Officer for Private Equity at GIC, in a statement. “GIC has a long track record of partnering with leading fintech companies globally and is delighted to partner with Razorpay in its journey to transform payments and banking.”</p>\n<p>Some of Razorpay’s clients include budget lodging decacorn Oyo, fintech firm Cred, social giant Facebook, e-commerce Flipkart top food delivery startups <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zomato\">Zomato <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Swiggy, online learning platform Byju’s, supply chain platform Zilingo, travel ticketing firms Yatra and Goibibo, and telecom giant <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bharti-airtel-ltd\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bharti-airtel-ltd\">Airtel <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p>\n<p>The startup expects to process about $25 billion in transactions &#8212; up five times from last year &#8212; for nearly 10 million of its customers this year, said Mathur.</p>\n<p>He attributed some of the growth to the coronavirus pandemic, which he said has accelerated the digital adoption among many businesses.</p>\n<p>On the neo-banking and capital side, Mathur said, Razorpay expects RazorpayX and Razorpay Capital to account for about 35% of the startup’s revenue by the end of March next year.</p>\n<p>Mathur said the startup’s payment processing service continues to be its fastest growing business and does not need much capital to grow, so the startup will be deploying the fresh funds to expand its neo-banking offerings to include vendor payment, and expense and tax management and other features.</p>\n<p>The startup, which aims to work with over 50 million businesses by 2025, may also acquire a few firms as it explores opportunities around inorganic expansion in the neo-banking category, said Mathur.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to make an impactful contribution to the growth of the industry, aid adoption in the under-served markets and drive new practices and a new thinking for the industry to follow. And this investment fits perfectly with our growth strategy,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the coronavirus pandemic has slowed down deal-makings in India, about half a dozen startups in the country including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/\">online leaning platform Unacademy</a>, and Pine Labs have secured the unicorn status.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/nE5sMKwGyrk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 20:37:33 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"0ee49c0281fd7d4e800bc3f092e44ea0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn68@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-47-471_bfd324accb474cc2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nE5sMKwGyrk:Qx0FZbzr_Uw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn85@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-46-407_14ef19a559df5259.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/nE5sMKwGyrk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn94@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-46-364_65eadf9cdf3f71ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266663},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"AC Ventures announces the first close of its $80 million fund for Indonesian startups","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059026","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As one of the world’s most populated countries, with a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fast-growing internet economy</a>, Indonesia offers plenty of opportunity for startups.

While D2C brands have changed the way we shop, <a href=\"https://www.onequince.com/\">Quince</a> is looking to change retail even more dramatically.</p>\n<p>The brand, which raised $8.5 million in seed funding last year (and only revealed as much today), is looking to rethink the supply chain with its own line of 700 items including men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s apparel, accessories, jewelry and home goods.</p>\n<p>After beta testing for a year as &#8216;Last Brand,&#8217; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/last-brand\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"last-brand\">Quince <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is launching with a new model called &#8216;M2C,&#8217; or manufacturer to consumer.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The idea is that Quince goes directly to factories with designs for essentials &#8212; not overly patterned or branded items &#8212; with an order that can dynamically adjust each week based on demand. As orders start coming in, Quince can work alongside manufacturers to ensure they aren&#8217;t over or under producing on a specific SKU. The factory then ships directly to the customer, rather than shipping to a distribution center or store and then again to the final destination.</p>\n<p>You might think that factories wouldn&#8217;t be as amenable to this model, as they have little to lose when a brand overestimates demand for a SKU and doesn&#8217;t sell it through to the customer. But cofounder and CEO Sid Gupta says that this new model is being presented at a pivotal time in retail. Bigger brands, the ones that place orders for 100,000 units, are struggling during the pandemic and shrinking their SKU portfolio.</p>\n<p>This leaves the factories with two options: turning to D2C brands or selling through a marketplace like Amazon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;D2C demand is really fragmented, and most D2C companies are really sub-scale,&#8221; said Gupta. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to get the efficiency gains out of it. The issue with selling on a marketplace, like Amazon, is you&#8217;ve got to compete with hundreds, if not thousands, of other sellers for the same exact good. If you&#8217;re a factory that actually makes high quality goods, and you pay your workers fairly, and you don&#8217;t damage the environment, your cost might be 3% or 5%, higher.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He added that it&#8217;s difficult for a factory to have those factors shine through to the customer on Amazon, and more difficult still to learn how to play the advertising game.</p>\n<p>This environment has made manufacturers slightly more open to a new way of doing things.</p>\n<p>By working directly with factories, Quince says it&#8217;s able to bring the cost of luxury items down significantly, selling a cashmere sweater for approximately $50 instead of $150+, as you&#8217;ll often find with other brands. Quince works with more than 30 different factories across the world.</p>\n<p>Cofounder and CEO Sid Gupta says the company has also thought very deeply about sustainability, setting standards around the materials used (are they organic or recycled?), the manufacturing process (is it ecologically sound?), worker pay, and more. The company is also looking into giveback programs to share in the profits with the factories and the workers.</p>\n<p>The funding from last fall has allowed Quince to beta test last year and grow the team to 16, including cofounders Becky Mortimer and Sourabh Mahajan. Thirty-five percent of employees are female, and 65 percent of employees are minorities.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s investors include Founders Fund, 8VC and Basis Set Ventures.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/LbA1nKSh-qw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:04:21 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"2a49a1a001b3ec888bd7930697d8688a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jordan Crook","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-47-459_d72574fe4b93d542.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LbA1nKSh-qw:CDMnVYSAm8k:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_4/2020/10/12/17-04-47-818_a2da3ec82214eb23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/LbA1nKSh-qw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn31@2020_4/2020/10/12/17-04-47-385_8ab4dceac6de09d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266662},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"Thailand’s logistics startup Flash Express raises $200 million","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059100","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Flash Express, a two-year-old logistics startup that works with e-commerce firms in Thailand, said on Monday it has raised $200 million in a new financing round as it looks to double down on a rapidly growing market spurred by demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>The funding, a Series D, was led by PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited, the marquee oil and retail businesses of Thai conglomerate PTT. Durbell and Krungsri Finnovate, two other top conglomerates in the Southeast Asian country, also participated in the round, which brings Flash Express’ to-date raise to about $400 million.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://flashexpress.com\">Flash Express</a>, which operates door-to-door pickup and delivery service, claims to be the second largest private player to operate in this space. The startup, which also counts Alibaba as an investor, entered the market with delivery fees as low as 60 cents per parcel, a move that allowed it to quickly win a significant market share.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The startup has also expanded aggressively in the past year. Flash Express had about 1,100 delivery points during this time last year. Now it has over 5,000, exceeding those of 138-year-old Thailand Post.</p>\n<p>Flash Express currently delivers more than 1 million parcels a day, up from about 50,000 during the same time last year. The startup says it has also invested heavily in technology that has enabled it to handle over 100,000 parcels in a minute by fully automated sorting systems.</p>\n<p>Komsan Lee, CEO of Flash Express, said the startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to introduce new services and expand to other Southeast Asian markets (names of which he did not identify). “We are also prepared to create and develop new technologies to achieve even greater delivery and logistics efficiency. More importantly we intend to assist SMEs in lowering their investment costs which we believe will provide long-term benefit for the overall Thai economy in the digital era,” he said.</p>\n<p>Retail Business Public Company Limited plans to leverage Flash Express’ logistics network as it looks to meet the rising demand from consumers, said Rajsuda Rangsiyakull, Senior Executive Vice President for Corporate Strategy, Innovation and Sustainability at Retail Business Public Company Limited.</p>\n<p>Flash Express competes with Best Express &#8212; which, like Flash, is also backed by Alibaba &#8212; and Kerry Express, which <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1975079/kerry-express-thailand-prepares-ipo-for-up-to-300m-shares\">filed</a> for an initial public offering in late August.</p>\n<p>Even as online shopping and delivery has accelerated in recent months, some estimates <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1981603/logistics-set-to-see-b200bn-income-loss\">suggest</a> that the overall logistics market in Thailand will see its first contraction in the history this year. Chumpol Saichuer, president of the Thai Transportation and Logistics Association, said last month Thailand&#8217;s logistics business has already been hit hard by the slowing global economy.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Sty76rWnHzs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 01:38:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"3355f43a25c3e896975a59fddb5d41cb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-47-419_6a1d804cd1448125.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sty76rWnHzs:ycuWvRShwOI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn59@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-46-452_4529f29c8faed516.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Sty76rWnHzs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn89@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-345_c37f9aa12752c9f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266663},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"2020 IPO report card: Are tech’s newest public companies meeting expectations?","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059187","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As the American election looms and the IPO cycle slows some, it&#8217;s a good time to review how well the public offerings we have seen thus far have performed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.

Let&#8217;s find out.</p>\n<h2>Ranking 2020&#8217;s IPOs</h2>\n<p>The fine folks at my former publication Crunchbase News have a <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/heres-who-has-gone-public-in-2020-so-far/\">running list of 2020 IPOs</a>, which will help us not miss any names. Of course, we&#8217;re not going to include <em>every</em> possible deal; there have been some marginal debuts that we can leave behind.</p>\n<p>But, the majors matter. So let&#8217;s get into them now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Snowflake: </strong>It priced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/snowflake-and-jfrog-raise-ipo-ranges-as-tech-markets-stay-hot/\">above its raised range</a>. Then it went up sharply. From an IPO price of $120 per share, Snowflake is worth $250 per share today. That&#8217;s so expensive, compared to the data-focused <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/snowflake-computing\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"snowflake-computing\">Snowflake&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> revenue, that I can hardly figure out what the hell its price means. The company&#8217;s valuation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/19/was-snowflakes-ipo-mispriced-or-just-misunderstood/\">got so rich</a> that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii/\">we wrote that all tech companies should go public to take advantage of the rich market</a>. This year&#8217;s standout IPO. <strong>A+</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity&#8217;s IPO was a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/how-unity-built-a-gaming-engine-for-the-future/\">source of wonder</a> for those curious about the economics of the gaming world. For us finance dorks, it was also a right corker. We <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/unitys-ipo-numbers-look-pretty-unreal/\">were impressed</a>. So were investors. After setting a $34 and $42 per share IPO range, Unity raised it to $44 and $48 per share. Then it went public at $52 per share. Today it&#8217;s worth $94.50 per share, or around $25 billion. It was priced at $6 billion, give or take, in its final private round. A huge win of an IPO. <strong>A<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wfi0cbi7fV0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:30:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300","linkMd5":"61d98c3f8c66cd7848640c8c3da1e4fb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-26-968_ff820b6a4d15b7ae.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31776,"destBytes":31776,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-26-968_ff820b6a4d15b7ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-46-400_21dd1cf01a57a860.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wfi0cbi7fV0:oCDo__XLlWw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-47-394_0cfc9a6b34d1ef96.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wfi0cbi7fV0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-47-479_720d5eb4e0d3098e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266663},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"China’s digital yuan tests leap forward in Shenzhen","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059110","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/shenzhen-eb7c\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shenzhen-eb7c\">Shenzhen, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> known for its maker community and manufacturing resources, is taking the lead in trialing China&#8217;s digital yuan.</p>\n<p>Last week, the city <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GKH3feEEN0nfIdG6xk0QJQ\">issued</a> 10 million yuan worth of digital currency to 50,000 randomly selected residents who applied.

Winners could redeem the 200 yuan red envelope within the official digital yuan app and spend the virtual money at over 3,000 retail outlets in the city.</p>\n<p>There were previous indications of an incoming app. In April, Shenzhen&#8217;s digital currency vehicle launched a <a href=\"https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/136963924\">wave of recruiting</a> for technical positions like mobile app architects and Android developers.</p>\n<p>As its next step, Shenzhen will launch a &#8220;fintech innovation platform&#8221; through its official digital currency institute, said a new <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2020-10/11/content_5550408.htm\">central government document</a> detailing the city&#8217;s five-year development measures, including attracting more foreign investment in cutting-edge technologies. The city will also play a key role in furthering the digital yuan&#8217;s research and development, application and international collaboration.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;fintech innovation platform&#8221; is vaguely defined in the announcement, but Babel&#8217;s Yang offered his interpretation, pointing out that it is &#8220;designed to allow private enterprises and other institutions to participate in these real-world or capital market development projects that aim to collectively grow the adoption of the DCEP [digital currency electronic payment].&#8221;</p>\n<p>The city is well-positioned to test private involvement for it has been a national model for market-driven economic reforms. Established in 1980 as China&#8217;s first special economic zones, it is now home to tech behemoths like Tencent, Huawei and DJI and innovation hubs like HAX and Trouble Maker. President Xi Jinping <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-shenzhen/chinas-xi-to-deliver-speech-in-shenzhen-marking-its-40th-anniversary-state-media-idUKKBN26X08M\">is scheduled to visit the city this week</a> to commemorate the city&#8217;s 40th anniversary.</p>\n<p>While the central bank provides the logic and infrastructure undergirding the digital yuan, there&#8217;s much room for commercial banks and private firms to innovate on the application level. Both ride-hailing platform <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-uber-didi-said-to-trial-pbocs-central-bank-digital-currency\">Didi</a> and <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0yuJ4OhExsrC1wDdfmu-1g\">JD&#8217;s fintech arm</a> have recently unveiled steps to help accelerate the digital yuan&#8217;s real-life implementation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the pilot [in Shenzhen] goes well, we can anticipate other cities will launch their pilot programs, along with new application scenarios, thus accelerating the adoption of the DCEP,&#8221; observed Yang.</p>\n<p><em>The story is updated on October 12 with expert comments.</em></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/BpgERdUCIIc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 04:55:58 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"6c2d0b69e473eeffc32ad6806f1cb181","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Rita Liao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-34-245_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-47-798_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-46-413_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-47-824_b2516603d97fe562.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=BpgERdUCIIc:w1zdNJlR1o8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-46-408_e5ee42c042910f85.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn77@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-48-385_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/BpgERdUCIIc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-47-367_79fe70159acbd544.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522266663},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:26","title":"Nest launches its $129 thermostat with a new design, swipe and touch interface on the side","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2059058","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/nest\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nest\">Nest <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> unit today launched its <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_thermostat\">newest thermostat</a>.

It&#8217;s a shame the team isn&#8217;t using the chip for any gesture controls, something Google did with its Pixel 4 phone, but the team tells me that it decided not to do this because it didn&#8217;t fit the user profile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that was a very conscious decision we made while designing this product, because for this product we really have the user in mind and we really wanted to focus on the features that were really important to this user. And these are brand new to smart home, they really wanted app control &#8212; it seems so basic to us but it&#8217;s a massive upgrade for them, right. And all these energy-saving features that come with the thermostat were something that they valued a lot. So we wanted to focus on the features that these users valued for this product,&#8221; Desai explained.</p>\n<p>Maybe we&#8217;ll see Nest do more with this technology in the next iterations of its more expensive thermostats. For now, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity, though in all fairness, Soli in the Pixel 4 mostly felt like a gimmick and at least the Nest team is putting it to practical use here.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059060\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059060\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2059060\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nest-Thermostat_Lifestyle-1.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059060\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nest</p></div></p>\n<p>Like before, Nest promises that it will only take about half an hour or so to install the new thermostat.

Filled with hate speech and abuse, moderation and anti-abuse tools were an afterthought they&#8217;re now trying to cram in. Meanwhile, personalization engines deliver us only what will keep us engaged, even if it&#8217;s not the truth. Today, a number of new social networks are trying to flip the old model on its head &#8212; whether that&#8217;s attempting to use audio for more personal connections, like Clubhouse, eliminate clout chasing, like Twelv, or, in the case of new social network <a href=\"https://www.telepath.com/\">Telepath</a>, by designing a platform guided by rules that focus on enforcing kindness, countering abuse, and disabling the spread of fake news.</p>\n<p>Many of these early efforts are already facing challenges.</p>\n<p>Private social network <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/\">Clubhouse</a> has repeatedly demonstrated that allowing free-flowing communication in the form of audio conversations is an area that&#8217;s notoriously difficult to moderate. The app, though still unavailable to the broader public, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/private-social-app-clubhouse-courts-fresh-controversy?sref=gni836kR\">courted controversy in September</a> when it allowed anti-Semitic content to be discussed in one of its chat rooms. In the past, it had also allowed users to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse\">harass</a> an NYT reporter openly.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twelv.com/\">Twelv</a>, a sort of Instagram alternative, ditches the &#8220;Like&#8221; button concept and all the other features now overloading Instagram, which had once been just a photo-sharing network. But, unfortunately, this also means there&#8217;s no easy way to find and follow interesting users or trends on Twelv &#8212; you have to push friends to join the app with you or know someone&#8217;s username to look them up, otherwise it shows you no content. The result is a social network without the &#8220;social.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telepath.com/\">Telepath</a>, meanwhile, is a more interesting development.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pursuing an even loftier goal in social networking &#8212; creating a hate speech-free platform where fake news can&#8217;t be distributed.</p>\n<p>No social network to date has been able to accomplish what Telegraph claims it will be able to do in terms of content moderation. Its ambitions are optimistic and, as the network remains in private beta, they&#8217;re also untested at scale.</p>\n<p>Though positioned as a different kind of social network, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/telepath\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"telepath\">Telepath <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> isn&#8217;t actually focused on developing a new sharing format that could encourage participation &#8212; the way TikTok popularized the 15-second video clip, for example, or how Snapchat turned the world onto &#8220;Stories.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead, Telepath, at first glance, looks very much like just another feed to scroll through. (And given the amount of linked Twitter content in Telepath posts, it&#8217;s almost serving as a backchannel for the rival platform.)</p>\n<p>The startup itself was founded by former Quora employees, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/26/marc-bodnick/\">former</a> Quora Business &#38; Community head, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbodnick/\">Marc Bodnick</a>, now Telepath Executive Chairman; and former Quora Product Lead, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-henry-a98a881b3/\">Richard Henry</a>, now Telepath CEO. They&#8217;re aided by former Quora Global Writer Relations Lead, Tatiana Estévez, now Telepath Head of Community and Safety; and Ro Applewhaite, previously research staff for Pete Buttigieg for America, now Telepath Head of Outreach.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s backed by a couple million in seed funding, led by First Round Capital (Josh Kopelman). Other backers include Unusual Ventures (Andy Johns), Slow Ventures (Sam Lessin), and unnamed angels. Bodnick and his wife, Michelle Sandberg, also invested.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2058472\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2058472\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2058472\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot1.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2058472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telepath</p></div></p>\n<p>When talking about Telepath, it&#8217;s clear the founders are nostalgic for the early days of the web &#8212; before all the people joined, that is. In smaller, online communities in years past, people connected and made internet friends who would become real-world friends. That&#8217;s a moment in time they hope to recapture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve benefited a lot by meeting people through the internet, forming relationships and having conversations &#8212; that sort of thing,&#8221; says Henry. &#8220;But the internet just isn&#8217;t fun in the ways that it used to be fun.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He suggests that the anonymity offered by networks like Reddit and Twitter make it more difficult for people to make real-world connections. Telepath, with its focus on conversations, aims to change that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we facilitate a really fun, kind, and empathetic conversation environment, then lots of good things can happen. And it might be that you potentially find someone you want to work with, or you end up getting a job, or you meet new friends, or you end up meeting offline,&#8221; Henry says.</p>\n<h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>\n<p>To get started on Telepath, you join the network with your mobile phone number and name, find and follow other users, similar to Twitter, then join interest-based communities as you would on Reddit. When you launch the app, you&#8217;re meant to browse a home feed where conversation topics from your communities and interesting replies are highlighted &#8212; orange for those replies from people you follow and gray for those that Telepath has determined are worth being elevated to the home screen.</p>\n<p>As you read through the posts and visit the communities, you can &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221; content you like, downvote what you don&#8217;t, reply, mute, block, and use @usernames to flag someone.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059003\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059003\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2059003\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Image-from-iOS.jpg?w=598\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Image-from-iOS.jpg 598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059003\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telepath, screenshot via TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p>Another interesting design choice: everything on Telepath disappears after 30 days. No one will get to dig through your misinformed posts from a decade ago to shame you in the present, it seems.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s most different about Telepath, however, is not the design or format. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s taking place behind the scenes, as detailed by Telepath&#8217;s rules.</p>\n<p>Users who join Telepath must agree to &#8220;be kind,&#8221; which is rule number one. They must also not attack one another based on identity or harass others. They must use a real name (or their preferred name, if transgender), and not post violent content or porn. &#8220;Fake news&#8221; is banned, as determined by a publisher&#8217;s attempts at disseminating misinformation on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Telepath has even tried to formalize rules around how polite conversations should function online with rules like &#8220;don&#8217;t circle the drain&#8221; &#8212; meaning don&#8217;t keep trying to have the last word in a contentious debate or circumvent a locked thread; and &#8220;stay on topic,&#8221; which means don&#8217;t bombard a pro-x network with an anti-x agenda (and vice versa.)</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2058469\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2058469\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2058469\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png 4875w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=1536,968 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=2048,1291 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathRules.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2058469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telepath</p></div></p>\n<p>To enforce its rules, Telepath begins by requiring users to sign up with a mobile phone number, which is verified as a &#8220;real&#8221; number associated with a SIM card, and not a virtual one &#8212; like the kind you could grab through a &#8220;burner&#8221; app.</p>\n<p>In order to the create its &#8220;kind environment,&#8221; Telepath says it will sacrifice growth and hire moderators who work in-house as long-term, trusted employees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All the major social networks essentially grew in an unbounded way,&#8221; explains Henry. &#8220;They had 100 million-plus active users, then were like, &#8216;okay, now how do we moderate this enormous thing?&#8217;,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We&#8217;re in a lucky position because we get to moderate from day one. We get to set the norms.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Moderation</h2>\n<p>&#8220;Day one&#8221; was a long time in the making, however. The team rebuilt the product four times over a couple of years. Now, they say they&#8217;ve developed internal tools that provide moderators with visibility into the system.</p>\n<p>According to moderator head Estévez, these include a reporting system, real-time content streams organized in to buckets (e.g. a bucket for &#8220;only new users&#8221;), as well as various searchable ways to get context around a report or a particular problematic user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Really good tools — including real-time streams of content, classifiers for problematic behavior, searchable context, and making it hard for banned users to return — mean that each moderator we hire will be quite scalable. We think that there are network effects around positive behavior,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2058471\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2058471\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2058471\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot2.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2058471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telepath</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s our intention to scale up fast and high accuracy moderation decision-making, which means that we’re going to be investing a lot of engineering effort in getting these tools right,&#8221; she adds.</p>\n<p>The founders have decided not to use any third-party systems to aid in moderation at this time, they told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We looked at a bunch of off-the-shelf [moderation systems], and we&#8217;re basically building everything that we need from scratch,&#8221; says Henry. &#8220;We just need more control over being able to tweak how these systems work in order to get the outcome that we want.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The investment in human moderation over automation will also require additional capital to scale. And Telepath&#8217;s decision to not run ads means it will eventually need to consider alternative business models to sustain itself. The company, for now, is interested in subscriptions, but hasn&#8217;t made decisions on this front yet.</p>\n<h2>Banning the trolls</h2>\n<p>Though Telepath has only 4,000-plus users in its private beta, the two-person moderation team is already tasked with moderating posts from across the thousands of pieces of content shared on a daily basis. (The company doesn&#8217;t disclose how many violations it takes action against per day, on average.)</p>\n<p>When a user breaks the rules, moderators may first warn them about the violation and may require them to take down or edit a specific post. No one is punished for making a mistake or being unaware of the rules &#8212; they&#8217;re first given a chance to fix it.</p>\n<p>But if a user breaks the rules repeatedly or in a way that seems intentional, such as engaging in a harassment campaign around another user, they are banned entirely. Because of the phone number verification system, they also can&#8217;t easily return &#8212; unless they go out and purchase a new phone, that is.</p>\n<p>These moderation actions don&#8217;t necessarily have to follow strict guidelines, like a &#8220;three strikes rule,&#8221; for example. Instead, the way the rules may be enforced are determined on a case-by-case basis. Where Telepath leans towards stricter enforcement is around intentional and flagrant violations, or those where there&#8217;s a pattern of bad behavior. (As with <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys/\">Reply Guys</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning\">sealioning</a> behavior.)</p>\n<p>In addition, unlike on Facebook and Twitter &#8212; platforms that sometimes seem to be caught off guard by viral trends in need of moderation &#8212; Telepath intends for nothing to go viral on its platform without having been seen by a human moderator, the company says.</p>\n<h2>Fake News</h2>\n<p>Telepath is also working to develop a reputation score for users and trust scores for publishers.</p>\n<p>In the case of the former, the goal is help the company determine how likely the user is to break Telepath&#8217;s rules. This isn&#8217;t developed yet, but would be something used behind the scenes, not put on display for all to see.</p>\n<p>For publishers, the trust score will be how factually correct they are what percentage of the time.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1512343\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1512343\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1512343\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg 2121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fakenews.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1512343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&#38;photographer=Thomas+Faull\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thomas Faull <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, if the most popular article in terms of views from the publisher is just completely factually incorrect or intentionally misleading&#8230;that should have a bigger penalty on the trust score,&#8221; explains Henry. &#8220;The problem is that the incumbent platforms have rules against disinformation, but the problem is that they don&#8217;t enforce them out of this desire to appear balanced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bodnick adds this challenge is not as insurmountable as it seems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our view is that, actually, a handful of outlets are responsible for most of the disinformation&#8230;I don&#8217;t think our intent is to build out some modern-day truth system that will figure out if The Washington Post is slightly more accurate than The New York Times. I think the main goal will be to identify repeat disinformation publishers &#8212; determine that they are perpetual publishers of disinformation, and then crush their distribution,&#8221; says Bodnick.</p>\n<p>This plan, however, involves setting rules on Telepath that fly in the face of what many today consider &#8220;free speech.&#8221; In fact, Telepath&#8217;s position is that free speech-favoring social networks are a failed system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem, in our view, is that when you take this free-speech centered approach that sort of says: &#8216;I don&#8217;t care how many disinformation posts Breitbart has published in the last &#8212; three years, three months, three weeks &#8212; we&#8217;re going to treat every new post as if it could be equally likely to be truthful as any other post in the system,'&#8221; says Bodnick. &#8220;That is inefficient.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how we will scale this disinformation rule &#8212; by determining which relatively small group of publishers &#8212; I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s hundreds, low hundreds &#8212; are responsible for publishing lots of disinformation. And then take their distribution down,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>This opinion on free speech is shared by the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re trying to build a community, which means that we have to make certain tradeoffs,&#8221; adds Estévez. &#8220;In the rules we refer to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance#:~:text=In%201945%2C%20philosopher%20Karl%20Popper,to%20the%20disappearance%20of%20tolerance.\">Karl Popper’s paradox of tolerance</a> — to maintain a tolerant society, you have to be intolerant of intolerance. We have no interest in giving a platform to certain kinds of speech,&#8221; she notes.</p>\n<p>This is the exact opposite approach that conservative social media sites are taking, like Parler and Gab. There, the companies believe in free speech to the point that they&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/07/russian-trolls-graphika-parler-gab/\">left up content posted by an alleged Russian disinformation campaign,</a> saying that no one filed a report about the threat, and law enforcement hadn&#8217;t reached out. These MAGA-friendly social networks <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90522049/i-joined-parler-the-right-wing-echo-chambers-new-favorite-alt-twitter\">are also filled with</a> conspiracies, un-fact checked reports, and, frankly, a lot of vitriol.</p>\n<p>The expectation is that if you go on their platforms, you&#8217;re in charge of muting and blocking trolls or the content you don&#8217;t like. But by their nature, those who join these platforms will generally find themselves among like-minded users.</p>\n<p>Twitter, meanwhile, tries to straddle the middle ground. And in doing so, has alienated a number of users who think it doesn&#8217;t go far enough in counteracting abuse. Users report harassment and threats, then wait for days for their report to be reviewed only to be told the tweet in question didn&#8217;t break Twitter&#8217;s terms.</p>\n<p>Telepath sits on the other end of the spectrum, aggressively moderating content, blocking and banning users if needed, and punishing publications that don&#8217;t fact check or those that peddle misinformation.</p>\n<h2>&#8220;Kindness&#8221; carve-outs</h2>\n<p>And yet, despite all this extra effort, Telepath doesn&#8217;t always feature only thoughtful and kind-hearted conversations.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because it has carved out an exception in its kindness rule that allows users to criticize public figures, and because it doesn&#8217;t appear to be taking action on what could be problematic, if not violating, conversations.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2058470\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2058470\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2058470\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TelepathScreenshot3.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2058470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telepath</p></div></p>\n<p>A user&#8217;s experience in these &#8220;gray&#8221; areas may vary by community.</p>\n<p>Telepath&#8217;s communities today focus on hobbies and interests, and can range from the innocuous &#8212; like Books or Branding or Netflix or Cooking, for example &#8212; to the potentially fraught, like Race in America. In the latter, there have been discussions about the capitalization of &#8220;Black&#8221; where it was suggested that maybe this wasn&#8217;t a useful idea. In another, sympathy is expressed for a person who was falsely <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/us/wisconsin-grad-student-race-trnd/index.html\">pretending</a> to be a person of color.</p>\n<p>In a post about affordable housing, someone openly wondered if a woman who said she didn&#8217;t want to live near poor people was actually racist. Another commenter then noted that gang members can bring down property values.</p>\n<p>A QAnon community, meanwhile, discusses the movement and its ridiculous followers from afar &#8212; which is apparently permitted &#8212; though supporting it in earnest would not be.</p>\n<p>There are also nearly 20 groups about things that &#8220;suck,&#8221; as in GOPSucks or CNNSucks or QuibiSucks.</p>\n<p>Anti-Trump content, meanwhile, can be found on a network called &#8220;DumbHitler.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, online publishers who routinely post discredited information are banned from Telepath, but YouTube is not. So if feel you need to share a link to a video of Rudy Giuliani accusing Biden of dementia, you can do so &#8212; so long as you don&#8217;t call it the truth.</p>\n<p>And you can post opinions about some terrible people in which you describe them as terrible, thanks to the public figure carve-out.</p>\n<p>Cheater and deadbeat dad? Go ahead and call them a &#8220;disgusting human being.&#8221; VP Pence was referred to by a commenter as &#8220;SmugFace mcWhitey&#8221; and Ronny Jackson is described as &#8220;such a piece of sh**.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Explains Estévez, that&#8217;s because Telepath&#8217;s &#8220;be kind” rule is not intended to protect public figures from criticism.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is important to note that toxicity on the internet around politics isn’t because people are using bad words, but because people are using bad faith arguments. They are spreading misinformation. They are gaslighting marginalised groups about their experiences. These are the real issues we’re addressing,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>She also notes that online &#8220;civility&#8221; is often used to silence people from marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don’t want Telepath’s focus on kindness to be turned against those who criticize powerful people,&#8221; she adds.</p>\n<p>In practice, the way this plays out on Telepath today is that it&#8217;s become a private, closed door network where users can bash Trump, his supporters and right-wing politicians in peace from Twitter trolls. And it&#8217;s a place where a majority agrees with those opinions, too.</p>\n<p>It has, then, seemingly built the Twitter that many on the left have wanted, the way that conservative social media, like Gab and Parler, built what the right had wanted.

If you live in the United States, you just endured one of the wildest news weeks ever. Rapid-fire headlines and nigh-panic have been our lot since last Friday when the president announced he was COVID-19 positive. We’re all very tired. You get points for just surviving.</p>\n<p>Second, I wanted to bring you something uplifting this weekend, as you deserve it. Sadly, that’s not what we’re going to talk about.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/funding-for-female-founders-falls-to-2017-levels-as-pandemic-shakes-up-the-vc-market/\">The Exchange covered new data</a> concerning the venture capital results of female founders during the third quarter. The data set was U.S.-focused, but we can presume that it is illustrative of global trends. Regardless of that nuance, the data was depressing.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter, U.S.-based female founders and co-founders raised 136 rounds worth $434 million, <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-female-founders-drops-low\">per PitchBook data</a>. That was a handful more rounds than Q2 2020, but far fewer dollars. And it was down across the board compared to Q3 2019. Even more, as we noted in the piece, the aggregate venture capital world did very well.</p>\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/technology/moneytree.html\">some PwC data making that point</a>, and <a href=\"https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/the-monthly-rundown-startups-to-watch-from-shamus-the-sales-guy-september/?utm_source=twitter&#38;utm_medium=organic&#38;utm_campaign=evergreen&#38;utm_content=blog&#38;utm_term=sales\">a bit more from my old employer Crunchbase</a>. What matters is that female founders are doing worse when VCs are super active. This will only perpetuate inequalities and inequities in the startup market.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, here’s some more bad news. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdhjr/\">Vern Howard Jr.,</a> the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.hallothere.com/\">Hallo</a>, a startup that has raised nearly $2 million, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hallo-348f/company_financials\">according to Crunchbase</a>, compiled some data on Black founders’ VC performance in Q3. Here’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/halloapp/hallo-research-black-founder-funding-cef159448b1e\">what he set out to do</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[W]e wanted to put hard numbers behind the promises of so many venture capitalists and create a benchmark for how we can track the investment into black founders over time. So our team pulled a list from Crunchbase of all the startups globally with a total funding amount of $500,000 — $20,000,000 and who raised a round between July 1 and October 1. There were over 1383 companies here and our team went through one by one, to see how many Black founders there were.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There were 31.</p>\n<p>Now, you could open up the funding bands to include both smaller and larger funding events, but regardless of the data boundaries, the resulting number &#8212; just 2.2% of the total &#8212; is a disgrace.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gVJdgdu0sy\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/funding-for-female-founders-falls-to-2017-levels-as-pandemic-shakes-up-the-vc-market/\">Funding for female founders falls to 2017 levels as pandemic shakes up the VC market</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Funding for female founders falls to 2017 levels as pandemic shakes up the VC market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/funding-for-female-founders-falls-to-2017-levels-as-pandemic-shakes-up-the-vc-market/embed/#?secret=gVJdgdu0sy\" data-secret=\"gVJdgdu0sy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Market Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The OpenDoor-SPAC deal became clearer this week as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/a-quick-peek-into-opendoors-financial-results/\">we got a scratch at its financials</a>.

We don’t, per se, but it is worth noting that VCs are still able to raise during the current crisis. We <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/doing-deals-through-zoom-these-investors-have-some-tips/\">often talk about how founders are managing to raise during COVID</a>, and this is something that VCs have to do, as well.</li>\n<li>TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/investors-founders-report-hot-market-for-api-startups/\">dug into the API startup space</a>, talking to VCs and founders alike about the space and why it’s blowing up in 2020.</li>\n<li>Airbnb’s summer was painful, but its rebound may prove legendary.

Aaron King, the founder and CEO, said in an interview that he believes disclosing it is nothing more than &#8220;grandstanding&#8221; &#8212; which is interesting considering that the industry he focuses on, real estate, is all about public disclosures of valuation &#8212; but he noted that most of the $103 million that the startup has raised to date is still in the bank, which says something about the company&#8217;s overall financial health.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZMdm4Dm6Bd\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/zumper-raises-60m-to-double-down-on-tech-to-grow-its-apartment-rentals-platform/\">Zumper raises $60M to double down on tech to grow its apartment rentals platform</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Zumper raises $60M to double down on tech to grow its apartment rentals platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/zumper-raises-60m-to-double-down-on-tech-to-grow-its-apartment-rentals-platform/embed/#?secret=ZMdm4Dm6Bd\" data-secret=\"ZMdm4Dm6Bd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>And for some further context, according to <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/63692-65/company/profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PitchBook</a> data estimates, Snapdocs was valued at $200 million in its last round, in October 2019.</p>\n<p>Snapdocs&#8217; central premise is that buying a house requires not just a lot of paperwork but also a lot of different parties to be on the same page, so to speak, to set the wheels in motion and get a deal done. There is not just the mortgage (with its multiple parties) to settle; you also have real estate brokers and agents, the home sellers, inspectors and appraisers, the insurance company, the title company and more &#8212; some 15 parties in all.</p>\n<p>The complexity of all of them working together in a quick and efficient way often means the process of buying and selling a house can be long and costly. And that&#8217;s before the pandemic &#8212; with the problems associated with social distancing and remote working &#8212; hit us.</p>\n<p>Snapdocs&#8217; solution has been to build one platform in the cloud that helps to manage the documents needed by all of these different parties, providing access to data and the ability to flag or approve things remotely, to speed the process along. It also has built a number of features, using AI technology and analytics, to also help identify what might be potential issues early on and get them fixed.</p>\n<p>King is not your typical tech startup entrepreneur. He began working in mortgages as a notary when he was still in high school &#8212; he&#8217;s effectively been in the industry for 23 years, he said &#8212; and his earliest startup efforts were focused on one aspect of the complexities that he knew first-hand: he saw an opportunity to lean on technology to get notarized signatures sorted out in a legal, orderly and quicker way.</p>\n<p>He then got deeper into identifying the possibilities of how tech could be used to improve the larger process, and that is how Snapdocs came into existence.</p>\n<p>Given how big the real estate market is &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest asset class in the world, by many estimates &#8212; and how many other industries tech has &#8220;disrupted&#8221; over the years, it&#8217;s interesting that there have been so few attempting to solve it. One of the reasons, it seems, is that there hasn&#8217;t been enough of a crossover between tech experts and mortgage experts, and Snapdocs is a testament to the virtues of building a startup specifically around a hard problem that you happen to know really well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most people have identified this as a tech problem, and a lot of the tech &#8212; such as e-signatures &#8212; has existed for 20 years, but the fragmentation of real estate is the issue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about a mass constellation of companies and workflow. But we&#8217;re obsessed about the workflow of all of these constituents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a position that has helped Snapdocs build its standing with the industry, as well as with investors.</p>\n<p>“I’ve known the Snapdocs team for many years and have always been amazed by their focus and execution toward bringing each stakeholder in the mortgage process online,” said Anu Hariharan, partner at YC Continuity, in a statement. “In 2013, Snapdocs began as a notary marketplace before expanding horizontally to service title companies and, more recently, lenders. By connecting the numerous parties involved in a mortgage on a single platform, Snapdocs is quickly becoming the “operating system” for mortgage closings. Mortgages, much like commerce, will shift online, bringing improved efficiency and a far better customer experience to the outdated home-closing process.” Hariharan has real estate experience herself and is joining the board with this round.</p>\n<p>There have been a number of companies taking new, tech-based approaches to the market to find new and faster ways of doing things, and to open up new kinds of value in the market.</p>\n<p>Opendoor, for example, has rethought the whole process of selling and buying houses, taking on a role as a middleman in the process both to take on a lot of the harder work of fixing up a home, and handling all of the difficult stages in the sales process: it&#8217;s a role that has recently seen the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">catapult to a valuation of $4.8 billion</a> by way of a SPAC-based public listing. An interesting idea, King said, but still only accounting for a small sliver of house sales.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nLP4wUavzS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/\">Opendoor to go public by way of Chamath Palihapitiya SPAC</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Opendoor to go public by way of Chamath Palihapitiya SPAC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/embed/#?secret=nLP4wUavzS\" data-secret=\"nLP4wUavzS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Others, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/orchard-real-estate-platform-raises-69-million-series-c-led-by-revolution-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Orchard</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/reonomy-a-massive-database-of-commercial-property-intel-raises-60m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reonomy</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/zumper-raises-60m-to-double-down-on-tech-to-grow-its-apartment-rentals-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zumper</a>, have all also raised large rounds on the back of a lot of promise of the market continuing to grow and the opportunity to take part in that process through new approaches.

Now this second case was stalled by a lawsuit from Facebook within weeks. This was complete procedural mismanagement by the Irish regulator. We are now trying to kick start the original procedure from 2013 to finally get a decision by the DPC after seven years and five court judgements that all confirmed our position,&#8221; he adds in the statement.</p>\n<p>Schrems/noyb is also making a more pointed allegation against the regulator, saying it saw documents last week that suggest Facebook has been using alternative data transfer mechanisms to take EU users&#8217; data to the U.S. &#8212; and accusing the regulator of knowing about this since 2016, yet failing to pass the information on to it.</p>\n<p>“The documents we received suggest that seven years of procedures and both references to the European Court of Justice were largely irrelevant for the case before the DPC,&#8221; writes Schrems, accusing the regulator of hiding documents from the Courts and his lawyers &#8220;despite our right to be provided with all the files of a case&#8221;. &#8220;We are therefore asking the High Court to clarify that all documents must be put on the table that all parties are properly heard and a quick decision is then made,” he adds.</p>\n<p>We reached out to the DPC with questions but the regulator declined to answer specific points at this stage. “As you can see Mr Schrems’ application to the Court this morning was made ex parte, meaning that any comments/arguments put forward were unchallenged.

A few years ago, it had also launched a simpler version of AR shopping with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/amazon-adds-an-ar-shopping-feature-to-its-ios-app/\">a feature called AR View in its Amazon iOS app</a>, built using ARKit.  It had also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/amazon-adds-shoppable-stickers-to-its-ios-app/?_ga=2.163930047.1634671527.1598275068-508606782.1595599686\">once tried out “shoppable stickers” that used AR</a> to place basic stickers of products in your space, instead of realistic representations of the items.</p>\n<p>With its latest launch of the AR View feature, however, Amazon had done the work to support Apple&#8217;s latest version of ARKit and likely wanted to experiment further with the possibilities. The box-scanning AR app could serve as a way to test consumer demand for more AR products. But Amazon doesn&#8217;t appear to be using this app to collect extensive research data.

That one was easy. The company skipped out on new mobile devices during its recent <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Watch event, owing to COVID-19-related delays. And, of course, the fact that the events are all pre-taped and virtual now means companies can more easily split them up in ways that were harder to justify when people were expected to fly in from all over the world.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean we won’t be getting more than just a phone (or, more like multiple phones). While Apple’s been more inclined to host more, smaller events, there’s a decent chance this is going to be the last major event the company hosts before the holidays. That means it’s going to want to get a lot of bang for its buck this time out.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 12 is expected to be the centerpiece, of course. The headline feature will almost certainly be 5G. Apple’s been a little behind the curve on that front versus its Android competitors (Samsung, for instance, has several devices with next-gen wireless), though another knock-on effect from the pandemic has been a slower than expected adoption of the tech. So in some ways, Apple’s really right on time here. In the U.S., the company is said to offer both the mmWave and sub-6Ghz 5G technologies. Availability may vary depending on the needs of a given market.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KGrgfTXi93\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/apple-september-15-event-roundup/\">Here&#8217;s everything Apple revealed at its September hardware event</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Here&#8217;s everything Apple revealed at its September hardware event&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/apple-september-15-event-roundup/embed/#?secret=KGrgfTXi93\" data-secret=\"KGrgfTXi93\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Rumors point to a bunch of different models. After all, gone are the days a company like Apple could just offer up a big premium device and be done with it. Sales for high-end devices were already drying up well before the virus came along to bring smartphone sales to a screeching halt there for a bit. People were already tired of paying in excess of $1,000 for new phones when the ones they already had still did the job perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>There are supposedly four sizes arriving. There will be higher-end devices at 6.1 and 6.7 inches, and more budget-minded devices at 6.1 and 5.4 inches. It’s a pretty broad price range, from $699 for the “mini” to $1,099 and up for the Pro Max (sandwiched between are the $799 iPhone 12 and $999 Pro). Along with its recently expanded Watch line, Apple’s all about choice this time out.</p>\n<p>Reportedly, however, the company will be bringing OLED tech to all of the models, marking a pretty big change from the days of LCD-sporting budget models. The new models are expected to get a welcome redesign, reportedly returning to something more in line with the iPhone 5. The rounded edges are expected to be dropped in favor of a flatter design, akin to what you get on the iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>Other interesting potential additions include the return of the company’s dearly departed MagSafe life for a pair of wireless charging pads that will hopefully finally lay to rest any memory of the failed AirPower experiment. Available for one or two devices, the new pads will reportedly leverage magnets built into the phones to snap them in place.</p>\n<p>Music has always been a cornerstone for the company, and it’s long overdue for some updates to audio products. This time out, we may finally get the long-awaited AirPods Studio, an over-ear addition to its line of headphones. The models are set to come in two variations, the largest variation being build materials. A smaller version of its smart speaker could be on the way, as well. The HomePod has long been cost-prohibitive for many, so a mini version could finally make it a bit more accessible.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PyGPLqmvqr\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches/embed/#?secret=PyGPLqmvqr\" data-secret=\"PyGPLqmvqr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Another long-rumored addition — AirTags — could finally arrive, as well.

I love steak, especially steak at the perfect temp with a restaurant-style carmelized crust.

It begins to occur in most foods above around 280 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">°</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F or so but even higher temperatures can emphasize the resulting effects to the point where you get this deliciously beautiful light brown crust that adds a crunch and even slight sweetness to your foods, especially meats. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059080 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADE20672-2A87-41FD-81B2-B3D48D606B29_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059093 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"872\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg 872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F82F10EB-753D-4D88-8354-2726F9685ECC_1_106_c.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick of at home Maillard reactions in steak is how to activate and sustain the process long enough to create the desired result while simultaneously not over-cooking your meat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A note: I am reviewing the Otto grill several years after it was initially released (though they do have a new ‘Pro’ model with a really handy drawer and a </span><a href=\"https://product.ottogrills.com/ottos-platform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whole grill system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hitting the market). But when they offered to send me one I went and checked out the reviews that were out there. Gonna be honest, even the ‘good’ reviews are pretty poorly done. Either they are done on YouTube by clear grillmasters that assume people know a lot about grilling and don’t really explain much beyond running a steak or two through the grill or they are on&#8230;ahem&#8230;other sites where they quite clearly have no idea what they are doing. Don’t get me started on the results in some of those reviews. I can’t even. I’m not going to blow up anyone’s spot specifically here, but as a bit of meta I can just say that the current state of food appliance reviews is really, really bad. I think a lot of people do pretty decent jobs reviewing, say, phones or game consoles. Not so much in the kitchen.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059081 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5DDF9B9C-7996-4A64-BB77-8968B8FFA27D_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5DDF9B9C-7996-4A64-BB77-8968B8FFA27D_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5DDF9B9C-7996-4A64-BB77-8968B8FFA27D_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5DDF9B9C-7996-4A64-BB77-8968B8FFA27D_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5DDF9B9C-7996-4A64-BB77-8968B8FFA27D_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5DDF9B9C-7996-4A64-BB77-8968B8FFA27D_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, over-fired broilers are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extremely</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> common in commercial kitchens, where ‘infrared’ heat (basically high heat gas shot through pinholes in a ceramic sheet) and radiant heat are primary options. The Otto Grill is an infrared style OFB, which means that it can get to high heat extremely quickly (about 3-5 minutes to 1,500 degrees) and that it cooks VERY fast because most of the heat goes right to the meat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast, high heat cooking means quicker crust, less gas waste and most importantly, juicier steaks that have less time to dry out. </span></p>\n<p><b>A quick how-to</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that I found surprising when I started researching the Otto was that there are very few direct examples of how to cook a steak with it. To that end, here is my basic process for most steaks. Prior to beginning any of this I salt my steaks generously with a nice sea salt. I do not use anything else personally and I would say beware of any rubs with pepper or other ingredients because they can burn quickly in an oven as hot as the Otto.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2059097\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DAC645E9-1135-4C76-9C89-2968619A4FD0_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the water tray halfway. This prevents grease fires and makes cleanup better, as well as introducing a bit of moisture to the cooking environment. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-heat the Otto at full power. This takes as little as 3 minutes and no longer than 5 from zero to 1,500 degrees. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove the grille and place the steak(s) onto it oriented so that they are covered by one or both burners. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pop it back in and use the adjustment lever to move them within about a half inch of the bottom edge of the flame at the top.

Remove it and check the temp with a meat thermometer to see if it is at your desired temp.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is a thicker cut, reduce the heat to ¾ on both burners and drop the grill to the bottom position.

Larger cuts may require careful rotation and positioning. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steak results</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have cooked a lot of steaks on the Otto over the last couple of months. I’ve done ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, hangar and T-bone</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cooked a wide variety of cuts at a number of different levels of marbling. The fattier cuts obviously benefited much more from the Otto’s high-temp cooking. The way that it absolutely pulverizes fat allows it to crust perfectly across the surface without creating a dry, crumbly texture. Instead it’s crispy and moist at the same time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, because it’s a top firing burner, the fat seeps downward, through the meat instead of outwards. The resulting exterior is super delicious and produces a nearly perfectly sized rind every time, leaving a to-temp interior. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059079 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B28426E9-9FD7-4B15-A623-6B7EBFC394AD_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me a few steaks to get the methodology above down. I burned a few, for sure. This thing is crazy hot and the times involved are hard to wrap your head around at first. But once you have your rhythm, the Otto Grill cooks an insanely tasty steak from nearly any cut or quality of meat. Otto sent me a few frozen steaks to try, but I’ve mostly cooked my own meat purchased locally, which was much better. But even thawed meat was treated pretty well by this grill, the crust makes up for a lot when you’re working with so-so meat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you that know steak, you may be wondering whether it is good at grassfed beef. Yes! It’s actually super killer for grassfed because the high, high heat makes the sear happen super fast, locking in the juice which is at a big premium in leaner grassfed cuts. Grassfed suffers with long cook times, which you won’t find in the Otto. You can cook a very nicely juicy medium rare grassfed cut here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major comparison that I think many people who might be in the market to buy this thing will be interested in is how it stacks up against the very popular sous-vide + cast iron sear method also referred to as reverse searing. Cooking your steak in a water bath to achieve precise interior temp and then searing it for crust and flavor has become uber popular for at home cooks in recent years due to the wide availability of consumer grade immersion circulators. </span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059075\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059075\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2059075 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/79274190-C8EE-4F06-B94B-1321AD9D53AF_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/79274190-C8EE-4F06-B94B-1321AD9D53AF_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/79274190-C8EE-4F06-B94B-1321AD9D53AF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/79274190-C8EE-4F06-B94B-1321AD9D53AF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/79274190-C8EE-4F06-B94B-1321AD9D53AF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/79274190-C8EE-4F06-B94B-1321AD9D53AF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059075\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sous-vide + sear on left, Otto Grill on right</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll say this as simply as possible: I think you can get </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extremely similar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> results with sous vide + cast iron, with some pretty straightforward caveats. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your cast iron has to be super hot.

I also think that it can be very easy to over cook thin steaks while searing if you can’t get your skillet super hot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest overall benefit of course, is time. If you write off the resting time to bring your meat to room temp, which is passive cooking time, then you’re looking at anywhere from 1-3 hours to sous vide a thick cut steak. The Otto heats in 3 minutes and cooks in anywhere from 5-10 minutes. It’s a huge time savings for equal or better results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One design consideration worth mentioning is that because there are two burners with a dead space in between, you must shift larger cuts to allow them to sear evenly if they span two burners. I wouldn’t call it a flaw as it is definitely pushing it to shove a wall-to-wall steak in there. I would love to see future versions of the oven reduce the space between the burners in order to allow more coverage for bigger steaks. This is a non factor if your steak fits under one burner, and most do in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The catch pan, by the way, is pretty instrumental. Filling it with water reduces the chances that your fat will catch on fire, burning portions of your steak, and it makes cleaning up super easy as you can sluice out the still warm grease water and then brush it clean. I will note, at the risk of some ribbing, that I forgot to put some water in the pan once and may have added some&#8230;decorative smoke work to my grill’s face. Cook outdoors.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pizza</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otto says you can make pizza in this thing too &#8212; and they even make a stone and peel. Well, you can, but I&#8217;d say how enthusiastic you get about it is going to sort of depend on what your standards for pizza are. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059066 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C5048398-8BED-4C77-97DA-F5CD6922D7EF_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C5048398-8BED-4C77-97DA-F5CD6922D7EF_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C5048398-8BED-4C77-97DA-F5CD6922D7EF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C5048398-8BED-4C77-97DA-F5CD6922D7EF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C5048398-8BED-4C77-97DA-F5CD6922D7EF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C5048398-8BED-4C77-97DA-F5CD6922D7EF_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059065 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2107C5B0-4408-4289-87D0-3A30AAB58C90_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2107C5B0-4408-4289-87D0-3A30AAB58C90_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2107C5B0-4408-4289-87D0-3A30AAB58C90_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2107C5B0-4408-4289-87D0-3A30AAB58C90_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2107C5B0-4408-4289-87D0-3A30AAB58C90_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2107C5B0-4408-4289-87D0-3A30AAB58C90_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pizzas that I made in the Otto with the stone are, uh, they’re fine I guess. It’s absolutely, totally possible to do a little personal-sized pizza in the Otto, especially if you par bake the crust. But anything you do in here is going to pale next to the Ooni. I’d actually much rather just gin a up a little pan pizza that you can do in your regular home oven. There are a lot of reasons to buy the Otto, but pizza should not be a primary one, in my opinion.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter wp-image-2059067 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0C7BE49A-6984-4C89-847F-7E2A82D95495_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0C7BE49A-6984-4C89-847F-7E2A82D95495_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0C7BE49A-6984-4C89-847F-7E2A82D95495_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0C7BE49A-6984-4C89-847F-7E2A82D95495_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0C7BE49A-6984-4C89-847F-7E2A82D95495_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0C7BE49A-6984-4C89-847F-7E2A82D95495_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2059068 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/084CBF2C-1A41-417A-B7A7-FD1F56A184D5_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/084CBF2C-1A41-417A-B7A7-FD1F56A184D5_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/084CBF2C-1A41-417A-B7A7-FD1F56A184D5_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/084CBF2C-1A41-417A-B7A7-FD1F56A184D5_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/084CBF2C-1A41-417A-B7A7-FD1F56A184D5_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/084CBF2C-1A41-417A-B7A7-FD1F56A184D5_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>I did cook a beautiful batch of naan in it though which was lovely.

Yeah, 100%. Basically anything you can throw in a cast iron pan and sear up will do well in the Otto. Examples I’ve tried include peppers and onions, fruit and veg medleys and crispy potatoes drizzled in oil. Because the cast iron gets nice and evenly hot and you have a top broiler it makes for an ideal searing environment. It is hot as hell even at the lower settings though, so you need to keep an eye on it. </span></p>\n<p><b>Should you buy it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otto Wilde likely have their own ideas about the target market for their grills but for me it&#8217;s: has disposable income, loves steak enough to eat it 3x a week and already owns at least one or two other specialty grilling items. Basically, Big Green Egg owners. While something like a BGE is amazing at low and slow and smoking, it takes a hell of a lot to stoke and maintain the heat you’d need to get a caramelizing sear and in the end your steak would definitely be dryer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Otto Grill is basically the consumerized version of a commercial kitchen staple item. Could you buy </span><a href=\"https://www.katom.com/083-TASM24NG.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw2or8BRCNARIsAC_ppyYnt5zlIyDFcnypw9n9n29GWkxikp5LWegRqC5r8SESlWS6ZD7_NooaAnaJEALw_wcB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something like a Salamander</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for like $1,300? Sure, but at that point you’re a commercial kitchen and you’re gonna need a natural gas plumb and probably a business license. Just rent a strip mall slot or a food truck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall I found the design to be thoughtful, straightforward and reliable. Though I did have some ignition issues as described earlier, this is frank German engineering at its most utility-driven. The Otto Grill is expensive, but does precisely perform the task that it claims to make possible. I have cooked steaks by many different methods over the years and as I mentioned above, some of them are absolute stand-bys because they are really close to restaurant methodology. But for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">steakhouse</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> style crust delivered absolutely consistently with the minimum of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time and effort</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Otto Grill stands alone.</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a
