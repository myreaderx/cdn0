The more you lean back, the tougher this will be.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To start, you can also just hang back to start building some “pull” strength.</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831706\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hang_doorway.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"459\" height=\"258\" /></p> \n<p><b>Pull-up Alternative #2: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Towel Doorway Rows</span></b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our next alternative is to do doorway rows, but this time using a towel.</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831705\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/row_doorwaytowel.gif\" alt=\"A towel can help you do a bodyweight row, as shown here.\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The towel might help you lean back even further, creating a more challenging exercise.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a towel, and fold it twice lengthwise. Then take your long, folded over towel, and tie it around the door on the handle opposite side of you.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure the door opens AWAY from you. You don’t want the door accidentally opening, which could cause an unexpected tumble.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have your towel secured around the doorknob, perform rows by using each side of the towel.</span></p> \n<p><b>Pull-up Alternative #3: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inverted Rows with Chairs</span></b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this pull-up alternative, you’re gonna need two sturdy chairs and a broomstick (or dowel).</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ll be combining them together, Voltron style, to form our own row station:</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831702\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/row_dowel.gif\" alt=\"This gif shows Jim doing a row on chairs\" width=\"459\" height=\"258\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The important thing here is the setup. Give your newly created station a few gentle pushes to check the integrity of the structure. Only when you feel confident should you <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/inverted-row-are-you-missing-out-on-this-great-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">start performing inverted bodyweight rows</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Pull-up Alternative #4: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Towel Pull-ups</span></b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, we’re gonna start doing some actual pull-ups…with towels.</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831693\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chinup_towel.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can either use a couple of sturdy handtowels or washcloths.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tie an overhand knot in the corner of both towels, which will be used as your anchor.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then place these knots over a door and close it. Make sure the knots are secure before you start doing your pull-ups.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, you’ll also want to make sure the door opens AWAY from you.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing towel pull-ups is going to be a great way to </span><a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-wrist-mobility-and-grip-strength/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve your grip strength</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, although if you find them a little too tough, you can use a stool to support your feet as you lift. This will help as you build strength.</span></p> \n<p><b>Pull-up Alternative #5: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Strap Pull-ups</span></b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may or may not have some Forearm Forklifts hanging around, but if you do, you’ll have the perfect equipment for a pull-up alternative.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Forearm-Forklift-Appliances-Mattresses-L74995CN/dp/B008ASBLJI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forearm Forklifts</a> are made to help you and a friend lift heavy furniture or equipment, but Coach Jim has discovered they’re also pretty useful for doing pull-ups.</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3841284\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/doorway-chin-up-straps.gif\" alt=\"This gif shows Coach Jim using Forearm Forklift straps to do this pull-up alternative.\" width=\"460\" height=\"255\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have loops designed to hold your arms, which makes them easier to grip than a towel.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tie a knot in them just like you would with a hand towel and use it to anchor against your door.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><em>For more ideas on how to train with items you may have around the

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you can do 3 sets of 8 reps (each arm), it’s time to pick up a heavier dumbbell.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will allow you to get stronger and stronger.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you can lift a 25-pound (10kg) dumbbell or heavier, consider moving up to the next level.</span></p> \n<h3><b>Level 2 Pull-up

goal here will be to work towards a lower and lower angle, increasing the difficulty of the movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at first, we’ll do rows with the bar higher up:</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"wp-image-3585378 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/staci-incline-inverted-row.gif\" alt=\"Start with

Have them use the least amount of help possible to get you through your workouts.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’re comfortable doing a form of assisted pull-ups, and can do about 10 repetitions, it’s time to advance to the next level.</span></p> \n<p><b>This is probably the TOUGHEST level before getting your pull-ups. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you get stuck on “assisted pull-ups” and “assisted chin-ups”, you’re not alone.

functional movements in our lives.</strong>&nbsp;Let’s talk about the benefits and why you should be squatting all the time.</p> \n<p><strong>#1) We’re designed to squat:</strong> We’ve been squatting since we&nbsp;were&nbsp;babies, but as we get older and sit in unnatural positions all day, our squat form goes from perfect to terrible.</p> \n<p>Crap.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>In many countries, people often sit in a full squat for hours at a time.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3587297\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/third-world-squat-713x475.jpg\" alt=\"In many parts of the world, a squat is a normal position to sit in for hours. \" width=\"335\"

sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" /></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From an evolutionary standpoint – it makes sense that we are genetically designed to, and can be really good at – squatting. </span></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before modern-day furniture and technology you didn’t stop sitting in a full squat once you got older like we do today…you continued squatting your entire life.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">That’s why squatting is one of the <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-for-functional-fitness-exercises-and-workout-plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">key moves for functional fitness</a>.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>#2) Squats are a <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-12-best-compound-exercises-for-beginners-how-to-train-efficiently/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compound movement</a> that recruits most of our muscles –</strong> this means it’s a movement that uses multiple muscle groups and joints (your hip and knee joints) to complete.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3587301\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat.gif\" alt=\"The squat movement as shown here.\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" /></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A simple bodyweight squat</strong> – which I’m demonstrating above –</span>&nbsp;uses almost every <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-for-the-best-core-exercises-how-to-strengthen-your-core/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">muscle in the core</a> and lower body.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you add a dumbbell or barbell into the equation, I would even argue that they use <em>every single</em> major muscle group to complete.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3632262\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/goblet-squat.gif\" alt=\"The goblet squat is a great way to build muscle for women.\" width=\"359\"

Nothing is left out with this monster movement.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the utilization of a large amount of muscle groups, squats cause your body to increase our anabolic hormone production, helping us <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/lose-weight-and-build-muscle-or-do-one-then-the-other/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lose fat and build muscle</a>.<a class=\"fn-ref-mark\" href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/?p=21628#footnote-1\" id=\"refmark-1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>#3) Squats will help strengthen your bones and your muscles (and your knees!), and can also increase flexibility</strong>.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Increasing the strength in your knees and hips (and entire body) reduces your chance of injury while doing both athletic movements and everyday life things (such as shoveling the driveway or standing up and sitting down).</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And by learning to squat deeply, safely, you’re improving your range of motion and helping make you antifragile and protecting yourself against future injury. </span></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bazinga!</span></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3587345\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bazinga.gif\" alt=\"Sheldon knows how amazing squats are for you, as demonstrated by this clever smile. \" width=\"259\" height=\"361\" /></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b>If your goals are to:</b></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build muscle and get stronger, squats will get you there faster.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lose weight and get ‘toned,’ squats will get you there faster.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look better naked, squats will get you there faster.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get healthier and happier, squats will get you there faster.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feel like an absolute badass in the gym, squats will get you there faster. </span></li> \n</ul> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In short, squats are amazing</strong>.</p> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(see what I did there?)</span></i></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My name is Staci Ardison, I’m a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Senior Coach</a>&nbsp;at Nerd Fitness, and my life has been absolutely transformed by barbell training, which is why I’m so excited to share this guide with you.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2011, I could <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/female-powerlifters-meet-staci-ardison/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">barely pick up a pink dumbbell</a>, and now I regularly compete in powerlifting competitions. </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here I am squatting 253lbs for 3 sets of 5 at a bodyweight of 150 pounds:</span></p> \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF;

This puts more pressure on the knee – the force put on your knee is actually reduced as you drop below parallel.</p> \n<p><em>Unfortunately, there’s a&nbsp;lot of misunderstanding&nbsp;about squats and knee issues.</em></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The deeper the squat, the more glutes that are activated as well.</strong> Deeper is typically harder, both strength and flexibility wise.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, depending on your goals, squatting to parallel may make more sense.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re struggling hitting depth there could be many causes – you could have poor ankle mobility, tight hip flexors and/or hamstrings, weak glutes, or poor pelvic alignment (among many other things).</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is something we work closely with our <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coaching clients</a> on, and often prescribe ankle and hip mobility drills to help clients reach proper depth on squats! </span></p> \n<p><b>#3) Knee Positioning&nbsp;</b></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3587895\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-knee-position.jpg\" alt=\"Don't let your knees cave in like this during your squat.\" width=\"196\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-knee-position.jpg 196w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-knee-position-192x300.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" /></p> \n<p>When you squat, you want your knees to track along with your toes.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means if you are looking down at your knees and feet, your knees should be aligned at the same angle as your feet throughout the movement.</span></p> \n<p>Everyone’s exact positioning is going to be slightly different, but they should not be on the outside or the inside of the foot.</p> \n<p><strong>#4) Back Positioning&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3587896\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-back-position.jpg\" alt=\"Don't let your back cave in like so when doing squats. \" width=\"257\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-back-position.jpg 257w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-back-position-252x300.jpg 252w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your chest should be up </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and shoulders should be back</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like you’re King Kong about to pound your chest proudly. </span></p> \n<p>Your body should stay in this position the entire time.</p> \n<p>You don’t want your shoulders to round forward, but you also don’t want to hyperextend your back either.</p> \n<p>Keeping your spine in a neutral position <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will help your spine safe and build a strong foundation throughout the heavy squat movement.</span></p> \n<p><strong>#5) Head Positioning&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /> </strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3587897\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-head-position.jpg\" alt=\"Don't let your head come up like so during your squat movement.\" width=\"253\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-head-position.jpg 253w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/squat-head-position-248x300.jpg 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" /></p> \n<p>Many coaches will tell their lifters to look up, as that is the direction in which you want to be moving, but this is actually the last thing you want to do.</p> \n<p>Take a second quick and look at the ceiling (I’ll wait! 🙂 ).</p> \n<p><strong>Now, see that position your <b>neck vertebrae are in</b>?</strong> That is a very unsafe position for your spine to be in, especially when more weight starts getting included in the equation.</p> \n<p>You also don’t want to be looking directly at the floor.</p> \n<p><strong>Look straight out in front of you the entire time,</strong> with your head in a “neutral” position. Your chin should be in a position where you could hold a tennis ball between your chest and your chin.</p> \n<p><strong>#6) Attempting to keep your shins vertical.</strong></p> \n<p>Unless there is a current underlying knee issue that would cause additional pain – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the shin can and should go past vertical in the squat</span>.

Think about your positioning:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Are your back and core still super tight?</li> \n <li>Is your weight on your heels and your mid foot?</li> \n <li>Is your head in a neutral position?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Great, now stand up by driving your hips upward, don’t let your weight shift forward and onto your toes (drive through your heels!), shoulders and chest up, knees out keeping them lined up with your toes.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>For your first few, feel free to sit on the box while you evaluate your positioning, but as you get better at them, sit back and then quickly stand up again.</em></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You know you’re doing a good squat when&nbsp;</strong>you can stand back up from the bottom of a squat position without having to lean forward and use momentum to get up.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can squat, touch your butt to the box, and then stand back up without having to shift your weight around!</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">KEEP THAT BUTT BACK!</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><a name=\"front_squat\"></a>How to Perform a Front Squat</h2> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3602685\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-713x383.png\" alt=\"Staci doing a front squat\" width=\"649\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-713x383.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-300x161.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-768x413.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-600x323.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location.png 880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>If you’re up for a similar-but-different squat, try…</strong></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The barbell front squat!</strong></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3756986\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/barbell-front-squat.gif\" alt=\"Coach Staci performing the barbell front squat\" width=\"548\" height=\"308\" /></p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">A front squat moves the weight from behind you to in front of you, which requires different muscles and mobility in different places.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">I personally alternate front squats and back squats on my leg days.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Make sure you read our <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-to-squat-properly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full guide on how to do a proper front squat</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p><strong>I know all of this can be overwhelming, so the important thing is that you START!</strong>&nbsp;I realize I sound like a broken record at this point, but I really want you to begin strength training today.</p> \n<p>We created our free guide, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Strength Training 101: Everything You Need to Know</em></span>, just for that purpose.

Right in the middle!</li> \n <li><strong>Keep your abs tight. </strong> Keep your abs tight throughout the whole routine.

No judgment, just reality.</span></b></li> \n <li><b>Fat does NOT turn into muscle – they are two different things. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like oil and water, fat sits on top of muscle. You could have ridiculously strong abs ready to pop out, but if they are buried under a lot of fat, no amount of exercise will give you a flat stomach or make those abs pop, because it doesn’t address the fat on top of your muscles.</span></b></li> \n <li><strong>A flat stomach only appears when you have a <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/body-fat-percentage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">low enough bodyfat percentage</a>.</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason there are 1,000,000,000 ab workouts on YouTube is that people know there’s BIG money in the ab-industry for people desperate to get a flat stomach! And ab exercises are much easier to market as exciting than “eat better, get strong, move more, for a long long time.”</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you want a flat stomach or six-pack abs, we need to create a plan for sustainable weight loss.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know, WAY EASIER SAID THAN DONE.</span></p> \n<p><b>Have no fear, I have a couple resources for you:</b></p> \n<ul> \n <li><b><a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-lose-weight-without-dieting-5-rules-of-weight-loss/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Lose Weight Without Dieting (The 5 Rules of Weight Loss)</a>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you’ve probably been on a diet before.

(Okay maybe not this one).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Because we’ve had to adapt to do all of those things to survive, our bodies LOVE the idea of working with all of our muscles and bones and joints in unison to accomplish movements or overcome obstacles.

I’ve been skipping breakfast since 2014!</span></p> \n<p><b>3) Minimize liquid calories. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beverages with calories in them are probably sabotaging your weight loss efforts. </span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3618336\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/super-troopers.gif\" alt=\"It should go without saying that chugging maple syrup will not help with weight loss.\" width=\"405\" height=\"213\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut out the sodas and lattes and high-calorie smoothies (unless you account for them in your calorie goal!). Stick to sparkling water, black coffee or tea, or other zero-calorie beverages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>4) Cut back on alcohol. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you can still drink alcohol and lose weight, but you still need to account for the calories, of which there might be many! </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you make poor food choices while drunk, it’s going to be tough to lose weight.

For me, my hands are set up so that my middle finger points straight up and away from me.</p> \n<p><strong>2) To alleviate wrist pain</strong> (if you have <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-wrist-mobility-and-grip-strength/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poor wrist flexibility</a>) do your push-ups holding onto push-up handles (so your wrists aren’t as compromised), or a bar:</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3746078\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elevated-push-up.gif\" alt=\"Staci showing you an elevated push-up\" width=\"451\" height=\"254\" /></p> \n<p>If you’re hardcore, you can do them on your knuckles (as long as you’re on a semi-soft surface like grass or carpet<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;or broken glass. Wait, scratch that last one</span>).</p> \n<p><strong>3) Your feet should be set up in a way that feels right and comfortable and in balance.</strong> For some, that might be shoulder-width apart.</p> \n<p>For others, it might be with your feet touching. Generally speaking, the wider apart your feet, the more stable you’ll be for your push-ups.</p> \n<p><strong>4) Think of your body as one giant straight line&nbsp;</strong>– from the top of your head down through your heels. Your butt shouldn’t be sticking way up in the air or sagging.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re essentially holding a plank throughout the entire movement.</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3674909\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/steve-push-up.gif\" alt=\"Here Rebel Leader Steve shows you the classic push-up.\" width=\"459\" height=\"258\" /></p> \n<p><strong>5) If you have a problem getting the proper form with your body, try this:&nbsp;</strong>clench your butt, and then tighten your abs as if you’re bracing to get punched.</p> \n<p>Your core will be engaged, and your body should be in that straight line. If you’ve been doing push-ups incorrectly, this might be a big change for you.</p> \n<p>Record a video of yourself to make sure you’re doing it correctly.</p> \n<p><strong>6) Your head should be looking slightly ahead of you, not straight down.</strong></p> \n<p>I read somewhere that said “if you’re doing them right, your chin should be the first part of your head to touch the floor, not your nose.”</p> \n<p>Looking up helps you keep your body in line, but feel free to look down if that helps you concentrate more.</p> \n<p><strong>7) At the top of your push-up, your arms should be straight and supporting your weight.</strong>&nbsp;You’re now ready to do a push-up.</p> \n<p><b>8) I want to draw special attention to that first step with hand position: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nearly EVERYBODY does push-ups with their arms out far too wide and their shoulders flared.

Check out our article “<a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Can’t I Lose Weight?</a>” to find out why. </span></li> \n <li><strong>Don’t cheat on the last few&nbsp;push-ups&nbsp;</strong>– when you’re tired, it’s easy to skip out on good form for your last few reps. As soon as you do one bad form push-up, you’re done. Finish up your four sets, write down your numbers, and try to beat those numbers next time.</li> \n <li><strong>When starting out don’t do push-ups two days in a row.</strong>&nbsp;You need to give your muscles time to rebuild and recover – take off at least 48 hours in between your push-up adventure. However, when push-ups became a <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/warm-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">warm-up exercise</a> for you – <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can do them every day if you want.

I only go down to parallel and haven’t had any issues, so I’d recommend the same.</li> \n <li><strong>Once you hit parallel, explode back up until JUST before you’re able to lock your elbows.</strong> By not locking your elbows, you keep the tension in your muscles and don’t jack up your joints. w00t.</li> \n <li><strong>Now do another one. </strong>And then another!</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Those are dips.</p> \n<p>Keep your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">elbows as tight as possible</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">engage your abs</span>, and hold your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">body in balance</span> as you go up and down.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3840920\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/steve-ring-dips.gif\" alt=\"A gif of Steve doing bodyweight ring dips\" width=\"460\" height=\"251\" /></p> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you doing it right?</span></i></p> \n<p><b>Check your form by recording a video of yourself and matching it against the videos and gifs here.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If it looks close then you’re doing great!</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to have an expert review your form?

If you start swinging your body as you go up and down, you take the emphasis off the muscles you’re actually trying to work.</p> \n<p>Save swinging for the playground:</p> \n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3656611 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dog-swingset.gif\" alt=\"This dog keeps his swinging to the playground.\" width=\"270\" height=\"260\" /></p> \n<p><strong>#3) Don’t flare out your elbows if you can avoid it </strong>– the more “out” your elbows are, the more emphasis on your chest. Elbows tight = emphasis on shoulders and triceps.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicholas Elorreaga does a good job showing the difference here:</span><br /> <iframe src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/TartUnimportantHarrier\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> \n<p><b>#4) Don’t do half reps </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– again, this could be another </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rule.

As long as you can place your hands to the side so they can face forward, and you have plenty of room to maneuver between them, then you’re solid.</p> \n<p><strong>One thing you should be careful with is bench dips, which could be done off of a couch:</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3840909\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bench-dip.gif\" alt=\"A gif of a woman doing a bench dip\" width=\"417\" height=\"263\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The trouble with this comes from your arms being behind you</span>.</p> \n<p>As we covered in the “How to Do Pain-Free Dips” <a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/?p=3026#tips_to_dip\">video above</a>, this position is a common problem area for causing pain in bodyweight dips.
