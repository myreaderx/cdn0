In the last few months, <a href=\"https://balthazarkorab.com/2020/10/10/toilet-breaks-in-russian-module-on-iss/\">a toilet in that segment went bust</a>, an air leak got larger, and <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Temperature_Increasing_on_Russian_Zvezda_Module_as_Air_Continues_to_Leak_From_ISS_999.html\">temperatures mysteriously increased</a>.</p><p>Then on Wednesday, the Russian segment's oxygen-supply system failed, according to space agency Roscosmos. The Zvezda service module, where the system is located, has been in orbit for 20 years.</p><p>The failure coincided with the arrival of three new crew members, including <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/\">NASA astronaut Kate Rubins</a> – bringing the station's population to six. The crew isn't in danger, however, since the station has two oxygen-supply systems: one on the US side and one on the Russian side. The other system is functioning normally, according to Russian space agency Roscosmos.</p><p>\"Nothing threatens the security of the crew and the ISS,\" a Roscosmos spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/oxygen-supply-has-failed-in-part-of-the-international-space-station\">told the AFP.</a></p><p>The station also keeps extra oxygen onboard in case both systems break down.</p><p>Still, the failure is another sign that Russian side of the orbiting lab is in need of upgrades. The station has already outlived its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/shuttle/sts110/iss-qa.html\">15-year life expectancy</a>.</p><p>\"All modules of the Russian segment are exhausted,\"&#160;cosmonaut Gennady Padalka <a href=\"https://ria.ru/20201015/kosmos-1579901308.html\">told Ria Novosti</a>, a Russian state news agency.</p><p>Roscosmos did not immediately respond to Business Insider's questions about the failure.</p><h2><strong>An oxygen-system failure, a busted toilet, and an elusive leak</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f74f56c0ab50d00184ad71d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"transferchamber\" height=\"664\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Astronaut Jeffrey Ashby moves through the Transfer Chamber hatch into the space station&#39;s Zvezda Service Module with a video camera, May 25, 2011.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The ISS has two sides: the Russian Orbital Segment and the US Orbital Segment. The Russian segment contains the station's oldest module, the Zarya Control Module, which launched in 1998.&#160;</p><p>Its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-roscosmos-found-leak-on-international-space-station-2020-9\">Zvezda Service Module</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/np-2015-05-022-jsc-iss-guide-2015-update-111015-508c.pdf\">launched in 2000</a>, is the Russian segment's main module. It houses cosmonauts' living quarters: the kitchen, bathroom, and life-support systems, including the water-filtration system and the oxygen-supply system that just broke.</p><p>The report of the oxygen failure came after crew members spent months trying to find the source of an air leak on the space station. The ISS has been leaking at an above-average rate since September 2019, but crew members only started investigating in earnest over the summer.</p><p>In September, NASA and Roscosmos <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-roscosmos-found-leak-on-international-space-station-2020-9\">determined the leak was coming from the Zvezda module</a>.</p><p>Daniel Huot, a NASA spokesperson, told Business Insider he wasn't \"aware of any relation between this failure and the leak.\" The agency is working to get additional information, however.&#160;</p><p>Crew members still haven't pinpointed the exact location of the air leak, which they'll need to do in order to fix it. Officials maintain that the leak isn't major, though it seems to have contributed to the decision to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-roscosmos-found-leak-on-international-space-station-2020-9\">push back Crew-1</a>, SpaceX's first official mission for NASA.</p><p>A recent temperature increase that cosmonauts reported, meanwhile, was also in the Zvezda module, <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Temperature_Increasing_on_Russian_Zvezda_Module_as_Air_Continues_to_Leak_From_ISS_999.html\">SpaceDaily reported</a>. So was the toilet that broke down, though it has been repaired, <a href=\"https://ria.ru/20201015/kosmos-1579901308.html\">according to Ria Novosti.</a>&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">dumbbells</a>.</strong></li></ul><p>Working out at home has become a necessity. What was once mostly used as a stop-gap between visits to the gym or to supplement someone's weekly routine turned into standard practice almost overnight. With the future of brick-and-mortar workout facilities <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/workout-at-home-fitness-future-gyms-boutique-studios-2020-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">somewhat murky</a>, keeping fit at home appears likely to be our new normal for the foreseeable future.</p><p>But that sentiment shouldn't be a bleak one — working out at home allows you to hone in on the kinds of exercises you enjoy and provides an opportunity to focus entirely on what works for you. There's also something to be said for having unfettered access to the equipment you need <em>exactly</em> when you need it.&#160;</p><p>Yet therein lies the ultimate dilemma: Where do you even start when outfitting your own home gym? The easy answer is to first buy what you're familiar with while keeping in mind what exactly it is you want to accomplish (and what your fitness goals are), the kinds of workouts you want to do, and what your budget is. The entire process doesn't need to be a wallet-gouging affair, either, even if you're intending to <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/best-garage-gym-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stock an entire garage</a> full of gear.</p><h2>How to shop for home gym equipment</h2><p>When shopping, it's smart to first develop a workout plan detailing what you want to attain. Though workouts of all varieties do well to work together to improve one's overall fitness, starting out by focusing on one or two areas helps you refine your goals. Perhaps you <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/how-often-should-you-strength-train\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">want to strength train</a>; purchasing a set of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-resistance-bands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resistance bands</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-dumbbells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dumbbells</a> is likely where you want to start. If it's cardio or a full-body routine you're after, maybe a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-treadmill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">treadmill</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-rowing-machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">row machine</a> is more appropriate.</p><p>This initial research is important because there's so much more to stocking a proper home gym than attempting to mimic the studios you're used to. Study the <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/resistance-bands-vs-dumbbells-weights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">differences between resistance bands</a> and dumbbells to find what suits you best, download and stream a few <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/work-from-home-workout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at-home workout apps</a>, or figure out <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/when-is-the-best-time-to-workout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the best time to work out</a> each day. Doing this not only informs how exactly you prefer keeping fit and the best methods for doing so but it ultimately teaches you which equipment is right for you and your home gym.&#160;</p><p>If you've winced at building out your own workout space because you think it requires a dedicated room, a huge expenditure of money, or more knowledge than you possess, we're here to help. You can get a great workout whatever your budget and you don't need a ton of space to do it.</p><p>Below is the equipment we've personally tested over several days, weeks, and months of adapting our own workout routines to being strictly home-based. The list is exhaustive and should be viewed as a customizable blueprint — i.e. you don't need <em>everything</em> on this list.

Everything from high-intensity interval training and strength workouts to cardio routines and resistance training can easily be done at home.</p><p>Here are a few basic exercise categories to familiarize yourself with before jumping into any workout routine.&#160;</p><h3>Cardio exercise</h3><p>Cardio &#8212; which comes from cardiovascular &#8212; exercise is defined by the <a href=\"http://www.acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American College of Sports Medicine</a> as any exercise that raises your heart rate and breaths per minute while repetitively and rhythmically using large muscle groups. That's a fancy way of saying that cardio or aerobic exercise is anything that gets you moving fast and hard enough to break a sweat. Typical cardio exercises include running, biking, jumping rope, etc.&#160;</p><p>The benefits of aerobic exercise are many, including weight loss, stronger bones and muscles, better sleep, lowered levels of depression and anxiety, and even the reduced risk of many types of cancer, to name a few.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACSM</a> recommends adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, which can be broken down into multiple sessions as short as ten minutes.</p><h3>Strength training&#160;</h3><p>Strength training &#8212; also called resistance training &#8212; is the use of exercise against resistance to build and strengthen muscle. That resistance might come from your own body weight, a dumbbell or other hand-held weight, or a wide range of resistance machines.</p><p>Along with improved muscle strength and definition, resistance training helps develop bone density and assists with weight loss.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.livestrong.com/article/514068-what-are-the-acsm-guidelines-for-strength-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACSM</a> recommends healthy adults do strength training two or three times per week, engaging in eight to 10 different exercises focusing on a variety of muscle groups. Beginners should aim for eight to 12 repetitions of each exercise, using the amount of weight that leads to muscle fatigue within that set of reps.</p><h3>Balance and flexibility training</h3><p>While various cardio and strength-training exercises help improve balance and flexibility, it's important to incorporate training that specifically targets these two functions. They make daily living much easier and help improve your overall health and mental well-being. Aim for at least two balance or flexibility workouts each week.</p>\n\tHow we test\n\t\n\t<p>Each piece of home gym equipment recommended in this guide went through a series of tests to help determine its effectiveness. We considered each piece's feasibility for use in a home, if there was a steep learning curve or not, its relative value, how portable or easy to stow it might be, and how practical it is for every day or every week use.</p><p>We understand that not all home gyms have the ability to be created in equal fashion, so the equipment tested covers a wide array of use cases that anyone can pick and choose to their liking (and, perhaps most importantly, for what fits their home workout space). This means that if you have the space for a treadmill, you likely won't also be in the market for a stationary bike or a full-on Bowflex workout machine.&#160;</p><p>Some of the testings also took place during the creation of other guides (like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-treadmill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best treadmills</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-dumbbells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best dumbbells</a>), so that experience carried over for input here, as well. Where necessary, we included similar equipment that was also tested, as well as links to our more focused equipment buying guides.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

your cell signal.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\"><strong>Visit Business Insider's Tech Reference library for more stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>You probably hear the question, \"How many bars do you have?\" pretty often. Cell phone signals are an essential commodity these days, since it affects not just your ability to make phone calls, but also send text messages and even connect to the internet when you're away from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wi-fi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wi-Fi</a>.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How to boost your cell signal</strong></h2><p>Any number of factors can affect how well you can keep your phone connected, so here are 10 things you can do to troubleshoot and improve your cell signal.&#160;&#160;</p><h3><strong>Get out from behind materials that block your signal</strong></h3><p>Cell signals are easily blocked, and so if you find your signal is weak, solving the problem might be as simple as moving outdoors.</p><h3><strong>Reboot your cellular radio</strong>&#160;</h3><p>Sometimes your phone can get confused and fail to lock onto the best cell tower. If you suspect a problem, turn your phone's Airplane Mode on and off, or just restart the phone entirely.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f889502d260780019341a5e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How_to_boost_cell_signal 1\" height=\"2409\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Turn Airplane Mode on and off again, or just reboot your phone.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Change your location</strong>&#160;</h3><p>Even if you're outdoors, tall buildings and large bodies of water can block signals, so move to a different spot or go to higher ground.</p><h3><strong>Remove the case</strong>&#160;</h3><p>While unlikely, it's possible your phone's case can be interfering with your cellular signal. If you recently got a new case and noticed a drop in cellular signal, take it out of the case and see if that improves your phone's signal.&#160;</p><h3><strong>Check a coverage map</strong>&#160;</h3><p>All the major carriers publish coverage maps you can check to see if you are in an area with limited or no coverage. You can zoom in on your location on <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">T-Mobile's coverage map</a>, for example, or if you can look at <a href=\"https://www.att.com/maps/wireless-coverage.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AT&#38;T's coverage map</a> if you are a customer there. <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verizon</a> also publishes a coverage map.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8895cc9e9fe4001900993e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How_to_boost_cell_signal 2\" height=\"1289\" width=\"1979\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>All major carriers have maps you can use to assess your coverage area.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Update your carrier settings</strong>&#160;</h3><p>If you have an iPhone, it's possible that your cell service provider has updated its settings, and you need to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-update-carrier-settings-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">update your phone's carrier settings</a> to take advantage of them. To check, make sure you have a good connection (cellular or Wi-Fi) and then start the Settings app. Tap \"General\" and then \"About.\" If there's an update available, install it.&#160;</p><h3><strong>Don't let your battery get too low</strong></h3><p>If your battery gets critically low, your phone automatically enters low power mode, which may dedicate less power to the cellular radio. If you're having trouble connecting, charge your phone – and you can do things like lower screen brightness and make the screen sleep faster to extend the battery life through the day.&#160;</p><h3><strong>Install a signal booster </strong></h3><p>If you live in an area with poor service coverage, you might need to install a signal booster, sometimes called a repeater, in your home. These devices boost the cellular signal and give you a usable signal. Unfortunately, they're often expensive, costing hundreds of dollars. If you think you need one, call your cellular provider – most offer boosters you can purchase, though you can also buy one on your own.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f88967bd260780019341a62?format=jpeg\" alt=\"surecall cell signal booster\" height=\"952\" width=\"824\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can install a signal booster at home if you like in an extremely poor service area.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Surecall</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Change carriers</strong>&#160;</h3><p>If you live or work in an area with especially bad cellular coverage, you might not need to tolerate it. Competing cellular providers might have better coverage where you need it most, so check coverage maps (see the \"check a coverage map\" tip) to see if another provider is better.</p><h3><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Use Wi-Fi instead</strong></h3><p>While this doesn't technically boost your cell signal, it can accomplish the same thing: Whenever possible, use Wi-Fi. Make sure your Wi-Fi is turned on and you join trustworthy Wi-Fi networks when they're available, since that can avoid the need to use spotty or slow cellular.</p><h2><strong>Related coverage

If you have a compatible Watch but don't have watchOS 7, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-update-apple-watch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">be sure to update it</a>.</p><p>Your Apple Watch has the ability to detect when you're sleeping and for how long, based on micromovements that signal respiration during sleep.</p><p>The Sleep app can also detect periods of wake and sleep throughout the night — all put together in a handy little chart that tracks your sleep schedule over time. All your sleep data will also be automatically synced to your iPhone.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8a0dbf9e9fe40019009e6e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"apple sleep2\" height=\"1446\" width=\"1306\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Sleep app generates a chart to track your sleep schedule, which syncs with your iPhone.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>You can use the Sleep app in conjunction with your Watch's Wind Down, Sleep Mode, and Do Not Disturb features. This can help you develop a specialized routine before bed, which can include a customized watch face, bedtime reminders, screen dimming, and more.</p><p>Your Watch also has the ability to wake you up by delivering light vibrations or soft sounds.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8a0cff9e9fe40019009e6c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"apple sleep\" height=\"1134\" width=\"1030\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Sleep app tracks when you go to bed and when you wake up.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Although the Apple Watch Sleep app offers a lot of features to sync your devices together, it doesn't provide as detailed sleep data analysis as some of the other third-party apps available from the App Store.</p><h2><strong>AutoSleep</strong></h2><h3><strong>Cost to download:</strong> $3.99</h3><h3><strong>Paid membership:</strong> No</h3><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-tracker-for-watch/id1164801111?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AutoSleep</a> offers a super quick setup — you don't even need to make an account.</p><p>Perfect for people who like to lay in bed and watch TV or read a book, AutoSleep requires you to tell the app that you're going to sleep (through its Lights Off function). In other words, a six-hour, unmoving Netflix binge will never trick it into thinking you've fallen asleep.</p><p>You can activate Lights Off directly from your Apple Watch and track how long it takes you to fall asleep.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ca51cc8569b5548df4d16e8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"1.PNG\" height=\"390\" width=\"312\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Press &#34;Lights Off&#34; to let AutoSleep know you&#39;re going to sleep.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Christine Kopaczewski/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>You can view your sleep session on a graph that plots how deep your sleep was, as well as your heart rate over time.

This is based on you getting a full eight hours a night. If you sleep less, you'll go into debt, and if you sleep more, you'll have extra credit.</p><p>Overall, AutoSleep provides a decent amount of data and you can compare day-to-day to see how your lifestyle affects your sleep.

I wish I had found other stories about how the transition actually went and what it felt like. But I found surprisingly few first-hand accounts from founders or CEOs transitioning from their initial role, and even fewer that shared their full, authentic story of what really happened when they left and how they truly felt about the process.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With limited precedent to guide me, I found the process extremely hard to manage, both logistically and emotionally.</p><p id=\"f515\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">That's why I'm writing this blog. I'm sure I didn't do everything right in executing my transition, but that isn't the point. I'm not here to share a playbook — I don't think one exists. I want to share my experiences and vulnerabilities with full candor in the hope that other founders can have a resource that I lacked; that they can learn from my experience and feel less lonely than I have through this process. I also hope this piece can help build greater empathy and understanding among the investors, teams, and families that have backed, supported, and lived with founders whose struggles might at first seem opaque or impenetrable but are, in essence, deeply human.</p><h2 id=\"5c60\"><strong>Why I chose to step down as CEO of CircleUp</strong></h2><p id=\"7d08\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Over the past year, when I began telling team members, investors, LPs, and other stakeholders about my transition, their first question was, inevitably, \"Why?\" I typically explained that the average founder/CEO of a startup is in the seat for less than five years; I had been with CircleUp for nine, and I was exhausted. But there was so much more to it than that.</p><p id=\"1938\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I don't remember the first time I told our board that I was exhausted and needed to step down as CEO. I imagine it was around 2016 or 2017, a period defined by stressful business decisions and physical and mental health issues. I later realized that the board interpreted my complaints as \"typical founder/CEO exhaustion.\" I blame myself for that lack of clarity.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For years I did a poor job of communicating the depth of my stress and exhaustion, a problem only compounded by the fact that, at times, I wasn't even sure of my own feelings. There were stretches of time where I felt horrible — lonely; terrified; depressed. Depression exacerbates exhaustion. But I tried to put on a brave face to make sure the board felt comfortable.</p><h2>There were also occasional periods where I felt joy, which complicated matters even more.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The highs kept me going even though I knew the downs were unhealthy and untenable. It was hard for me to measure how much of my pain was because I had young kids at home, the result of specific business challenges or a classic case of founder/CEO exhaustion. What is normal? There was no way to answer that other than to go by my own feelings. From 2011–17, my exhaustion felt \"normal.\" Starting in 2017, it no longer did. I no longer felt like a missionary, I felt like a mercenary.</p><p id=\"da85\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The root of these negative feelings can be boiled down to roughly an 18-month period from mid-2016 through 2017. During that time, we&#160;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryan_caldbeck/status/1118288136918847488\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">pivoted CircleUp</a> away from the original marketplace. We also had to go through a round of layoffs, the first I'd ever had to navigate as a CEO. They were necessary, but they were brutal. The people we let go had joined because they believed in our product and mission. They had done nothing wrong, yet suddenly there was no longer a place for them.</p><h2>I remember letting go of someone I had known since college.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">She turned to me and said, \"I took this job over something that paid more, and now what should I do?\" These agonizing decisions kept me up at night for weeks, and I know it was much harder on those affected.</p><p id=\"2329\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Then we raised our&#160;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/10/31/circleup-fund-brings-moneyball-to-consumer-brands/#2ec9fa142a82\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">first institutional VC fund</a> (just one of the ways in which we monetize our tech). If you have friends in venture and it looks like a cushy job, see if they've raised a first-time fund. It's not as hard as being a CEO, but it is … not cushy. I was doing both — running a technology company while meeting with hundreds of institutional LPs around the world to raise a first-time VC fund.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After the pivot, after the layoffs and after raising that $125 million fund, we raised a meaningful round for the parent company from Temasek and TPG. I don't know how we raised a big round from world-class investors right after a pivot, but we got it done.</p><h2 id=\"8294\">Simultaneously, we were forced to deal with a board member who was beyond counterproductive.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After we bought him out fully in 2019, I sent <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17tEc9ETL4tjfTmNbpwJJ5OSx1c4j10ZBgeYXWGzO30Y/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">this feedback email</a>&#160;detailing the ways in which he had disrupted our board and company. Dealing with this issue was one of the loneliest times I faced as a CEO. To be clear, this email is unlike anything I've sent in my life, and I've thought long and hard about the decision to share it. I'm not doing so to disparage the individual in question; the only objective is to help others who might find themselves in a similar situation. (Nothing has been removed, including typos, from the email except for names.)</p><p id=\"a09e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">That group of professional challenges was more difficult than anything else I've faced in my career. At the time, I told a teammate that it felt like I was playing seven-dimensional chess because of the complexity of the negotiations combined with so many conflicting challenges at work.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">What she didn't know — and what most people didn't know — is that during that same 18-month window, I was also juggling personal challenges that were far more stressful than the hurdles at work.</p><h2 id=\"455d\">It started with absolutely brutal fertility issues that my wife and I went through, beginning in 2016.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As far back as college, I've made hard decisions with the goal of building a great family. That emphasis has impacted everything from which jobs I've pursued to what foods I've eaten — even before I was married. So you can imagine how those fertility issues impacted me and my wife, Kim. We met with five or six of the best fertility clinics in the country. There were so many tests. Eventually, we were blessed with our second child, but it was an extremely painful and isolating process.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of those tests revealed unexpected, terrifying information. I was diagnosed with cancer.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I only remember a pair of words from the first conversation with my doctor: \"two tumors.\" I struggled to process it at first. I barely drink, have never smoked or done drugs and work out five times a week.</p><h2>How could I have cancer? The doctor must not have been speaking clearly.</h2><p id=\"b203\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But he was. Still in shock, and with my hands shaking out of fear, I took the elevator to another floor for immediate tests — before I could even break the news to my wife. Slowly, reality began to sink in and the enormity of the word \"malignant\" hit me in full force.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I remember crying to the nurse as she drew blood. Then I walked outside the UCSF hospital, hid behind a concrete pillar, and finally called my wife. I was losing control, and while she tried to be strong, I could hear the fear in her voice. I'd never really heard her scared before, and I felt helpless being unable to do anything to change the situation.</p><p id=\"d78f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Two days later, I flew to a work conference in Anaheim, CA, while also trying to schedule further tests and treatment. In a 30-minute Uber ride, I told my story multiple times over the phone to multiple administrators at multiple hospitals (for reasons that aren't relevant to this blog post, my medical case was uniquely and extremely complex).</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I remember no one said, \"I'm sorry\" — they just processed the logistics with an icy, clinical precision that is probably required for someone to work in a cancer center. Finally I lost it, shouting, \"Why aren't you just saying 'I'm sorry' right now?\" It wasn't fair to them, and I'm not proud of it, but I cracked.</p><h2>For the next several months, my emotions would sometimes pour out in a tidal wave of tears and yelling.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Anger, frustration, fear, confusion — there were so many feelings to contend with. Throughout the entire Uber ride, my driver hadn't said a word. But as we pulled up to the hotel and I climbed out, he opened his door, stood up and gave me a hug. He then said: \"Hey, I just want you to know I had the same type of cancer. I'm so sorry.\"</p><p id=\"117d\">The cancer diagnosis became even tougher to deal with because I mistakenly believed I shouldn't discuss it with others. CircleUp had just gone through our pivot and we were in the middle of raising that first fund and the parent company round. At the time, I worried that the team would use my diagnosis as an excuse to throw in the towel, that my health would become a distraction, cause the company to fail and make things that much worse.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I told the board and my cofounder about my diagnosis, but no one else at the company knew. I even hid the information from all but a few friends, fearing that word might get out. In retrospect, I think I would have brought our company closer together by being vulnerable and authentic, and I certainly wouldn't have felt as lonely.</p><h2 id=\"0e8e\">I had a successful operation.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Since then, I have undergone regular testing several times a year. To this day, I cry every time I go to the cancer center at Stanford. In hindsight I should have seen a psychologist to process what I was going through — the emotional toll was far worse for me than the physical.</p><p id=\"d079\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Dealing with the fertility problem, cancer, and issues at work all at once was the hardest challenge of my life. I couldn't sleep, couldn't relax, and was constantly on edge. For weeks at a time I had blurred vision. The combination of personal and professional stress was far beyond what I could handle. I hadn't had a headache in 20-plus years and now I couldn't go through a full day without experiencing crippling pain in my head.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The doctors did two MRIs on my brain to see if the cancer had spread there. After the first MRI, they initially thought it had. After the second they said: \"Eleven doctors have looked at this and we have determined it is not cancer.\" I assure you that wasn't as comforting as it may now sound as it begs the question, \"Why did you need eleven?\"</p><h2 id=\"9ef7\">A few weeks later, I started peeing blood, repeatedly.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After more tests, the doctors assured me that this latest symptom was also unrelated to my cancer. These symptoms were one-in-a-million flukes. I told my cancer doctor, \"I like data. That's a lot of one-in-a-million flukes.\" I now had a six-month-old boy at home, a relentless fear of whether the doctors might have missed something and an ongoing slew of professional challenges to face.</p><p id=\"e5a7\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">By the end of 2017, I was completely worn out. Then, suddenly, the major professional challenges were done.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We got the round done for CircleUp. We raised the fund. The pivot was behind us. My personal obstacles were under better control and we now had an infant boy along with our daughter, who was three at the time. A great board member, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-ciporin-198a4/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dan</a>, called me to say, \"Ryan, I've never in my career seen a CEO as worn out as you. Please, you need to take a sabbatical — at least six weeks.\" He, and other board members, tried so hard to do the right thing and convince me to take care of myself.</p><h2>But after a lifetime of gritting things out, I told myself I didn't need to take a break.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I think an element of my reaction is what Jerry Colonna calls \"false grit\" in \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reboot-Leadership-Art-Growing-Up/dp/0062749536/ref=asc_df_0062749536/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=343203979134&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10912074687442815466&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031915&hvtargid=pla-771288719468&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=69360436752&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=343203979134&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10912074687442815466&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031915&hvtargid=pla-77128871946874687442815466&#38;hvqmt=&#38;hvdev=c&#38;hvdvcmdl=&#38;hvlocint=&#38;hvlocphy=9031915&#38;hvtargid=pla-771288719468\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reboot</a>.\"</p><p id=\"fa7b\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But it was hard to turn away from persistence when it has been so crucial to any success I've achieved. Grit (along with undeniable privilege) helped get me to where I am even though I have never been the smartest, tallest, or most skilled person in the room.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When Dan asked me to step back — even just temporarily — I thought about how I had gritted out making the basketball team as a walk-on at Duke just months after double knee surgery and my doctor saying I needed to give up basketball. I thought about how I gritted out getting into business school and securing a job in private equity after being denied by the first 70-plus PE firms I reached out to (even offering my services for free). I thought about what I had said to Rory in 2011 when we were discussing the possibility of launching CircleUp: \"I need you to know that I never give up.\"</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Persistence was my superpower. But now I've now come to understand that persistence is a double-edged sword and my decision not to take a break to not take more off my plate hurt me my family and the company.</p><h2>That was the biggest mistake of my career.</h2><p id=\"2ca6\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">From there, my exhaustion only grew. The job itself was nowhere near as difficult as it had been in the past, but depression and burnout can make even small challenges feel like a big deal. Problems seemed to stack one on top of the other. Moments of happiness were fleeting. A few teammates tried to help me focus only on work that brought me joy, but I failed at that task. I absorbed very little pleasure from our wins, and quite a bit of pain from our losses.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I remember a top VC, who was not one of our investors, posted something very positive about me and CircleUp online. I read it on my phone and immediately said, \"Damnit!\" to my wife. I explained that he couldn't possibly know enough to mean these positive things, and his comments only made me wish that he genuinely did.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I had gotten to a place where I only focused on the losses and couldn't accept positive things.</p><h2 id=\"f8fa\">I've eventually realized that for far too long, I wasn't clear — with myself or others — about what I wanted or needed.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At times I thought I was sending up big red flares that I couldn't sustain my pace, but others were just seeing the normal ups and downs of a founder. I believe hundreds of founders have their own version of this story, but it is rarely told. I hope that my candor helps others to feel more comfortable than I did asking for help and more willing than I was to confront feelings of loneliness and weakening stamina before they reach a breaking point.</p><p id=\"0c80\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For me, that happened in the fall of 2019. There was no final straw at work; frankly the company was doing better than it ever had and my job was actually easier than it ever had been. It didn't matter: I could only feel pain.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Finally, my daughter looked at me and said, \"Daddy, why do you always look so sad?\" She was five.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It was the push I needed to change.</p><h2 id=\"98b6\"><strong>Making the transition</strong></h2><p id=\"4bc2\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In October 2019 I told the board that I planned to transition out as CEO. I prepped for the conversation with my management coach and some CEO friends, but I was still terrified of the potential reaction. I&#160;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/106LwbMxyPqGLwiqcpW4DcSrFVgApwKGbZXGvUjGsTCI/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">then followed up with this email</a>&#160;(included here with their permission). I have changed nothing in the note (not even a typo) other than redacting email addresses. Once again, I'm not sharing this information because I think it was the perfect way to handle the situation, but so others might be able to learn from my experience. I certainly wish I'd had examples to lean on.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The board wasn't happy when I sent that email.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I don't blame them. I knew it would be a difficult transition for CircleUp, but I also believed it was the right move for the company as much as it was the right move for me. They tried to convince me to stay, but I made it clear that wasn't an option, that this wasn't about any issue other than my mental wellbeing.</p><p id=\"bb1a\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After several discussions, the board became aligned with my decision but felt I wouldn't be able to transition within 12 months. Believing that to attract a great CEO we would need more than two years of runway, the board wanted us to raise a round. In their minds, we wouldn't be able to hire a new CEO until that was done, and doing both simultaneously would be impossible to get done in less than a year. I disagreed: Even though I knew how difficult it would be to accomplish both tasks at once, I was confident it could be done.</p><h2 id=\"3ba4\">Raising a round and hiring a replacement in parallel was emotionally draining, in part because I had to show passion and excitement even though I was personally exhausted.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I wasn't misleading them about my belief in the business or my intentions going forward, but I was trying to mask the depression I felt. Who wants to invest in an unhappy CEO? For investors, vulnerability or burnout is often conflated with risk.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So I felt I had no choice but to be a source of energy for potential stakeholders even though I barely had enough energy for myself. Have you ever had to put on a good face when guests come over, even though you're in a horrible mood? It felt like that, with no end of dinner in sight and with much higher stakes than awkward small talk. And, for good measure, we had to get all of this done during a global pandemic.</p><p id=\"32ed\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Still, in less than a year we raised a big round (not announced) on terms both we and the board were happy with. We hired a fantastic president,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-talwar-238333/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nick Talwar</a>, who became CEO on October 13, the day I became Executive Chairman. While I know this is the right decision, there are huge parts of the job I deeply love and will miss.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When it was time for me to sign Nick's offer letter, I stared at my computer screen for 35 minutes. My wife came in and I cried with her. She took this picture.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89e864d260780019341ea6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ryan Caldbeck\" height=\"1050\" width=\"1400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Caldbeck signing the offer letter.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kim Caldbeck</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>More than a few people have asked me what comes next.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">First, I am transferring to a full-time executive chairman role at CircleUp. I'm still here, just with far less stress. I've worked on this transition for a while with my management coach, <a href=\"https://www.edbatista.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ed Batista</a>. I've also talked with countless CEOs (including my <a href=\"https://leadersintech.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LIT group</a>), friends, and advisors.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the better books I've read is \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Changes-Revised-Anniversary/dp/073820904X\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Transitions\" by William Bridges</a>. In it, he talks about becoming comfortable with living in the \"nothingness\" and saying, \"I don't know\" when asked, \"What's next?\" A successful and healthy transition requires one to live in the nothingness between the end of one period and the beginning of another. I need to come to terms with the end of my time as CEO, though I will still be here at CircleUp. Eventually I won't be. I don't know when that day will come. And if you ask me what's after that, my answer is … I don't know.</p><p id=\"4fe5\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Now that I have a chance to reflect, my feelings are complicated. I am relieved that I'm getting help in the form of a new CEO. I feel sad that my journey as CEO of CircleUp has come to an end. I feel fear in that I don't know what's next, even though I believe it's healthy for me not to know. I feel nervous about how people will interpret this transition and what narrative they will tell themselves (and others). When I've talked about my journey in the past, I've had similar concerns, but these ones are greater. I feel frustrated that there are things I could have and should have done differently. I feel insecure about my answer of \"I don't know\" when asked what I'll do next — that it will be viewed as inadequate. I worry about whether I will ever do anything again that I feel as passionate about: being the founder and CEO of CircleUp is the greatest job I've ever had.</p><h2 id=\"29dc\">I feel unsure about how others will react. In venture, doubt isn't respected.</h2><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I am confident some, especially in VC, will inevitably view my story as a lack of grit. Would their perception of me be better if, instead of helping CircleUp pivot and leaving three years later, the company had failed in 2017? Maybe my experience means some VCs will not fund me again. Maybe it means I now have more empathy for entrepreneurs. Could I have stuck it out if not for the personal issues? I think so, but I can't know the answer to that any more than I can know how people will react to this account.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">My only hope is that it might help other founders feel less alone.</p><p id=\"5b25\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Again, everyone has their things. I'm trying to share my experience — the full and honest version — so that you hopefully don't feel as lonely on your journey. I want you to know that there are other founders/CEOs who feel that they have no choice but to \"tough it out\" in front of the teams, customers, or investors, despite what's going on at home.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For me a perfect storm of personal problems unhappily coincided with some of the most critical business decisions and processes possible. Is that just bad luck? I don't think so. Lots of people have to deal with many things happening at once. If you are in this seat for long enough, it will happen to you. But if there's any way to make these things worse it's to ignore the warning signs. I could have made it through for longer had I searched for help sooner — that isn't bad luck, it was me choosing not to lean on a broader team to get through the hardest periods.</p><p id=\"4173\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Primarily, I feel so much pride in what the team has accomplished and have absolute confidence in the company's bright future. CircleUp has built transformational&#160;<a href=\"https://circleup.com/helio/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">tech</a>&#160;and the team has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs thrive by giving them the capital and resources they need. CircleUp now boasts a new CEO with an incredibly relevant background and skill set and fresh legs to take the company to greater heights. I feel excited<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ryancaldbeck/circleups-mission-vision-strategy-5cfc0a4540a4\" rel=\"noopener\">&#160;about our roadmap</a>. I think the investment to build our technology platform, Helio, has set us up to create extraordinary impact and I feel appreciative of the team members that have been here since our first engineer,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brycedrennan/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bryce</a>, took a bet on us in 2011.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I feel thankful for the partnership that <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewchristensen41/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Matt</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewweissman/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Andy</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-ciporin-198a4/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dan</a>, and other advisors and investors have given to CircleUp, and to me personally, for years. I truly feel lucky for their help in steering the ship, particularly through difficult times, with skill, vision, patience, and resolve. I know I am privileged to be in a demographic, time, and geography that makes starting something this audacious feel possible. I feel fortunate to have had the chance to start CircleUp with such a fantastic cofounder, someone who placed our shared values and the Company's mission above personal glory. I cannot fully express how much I trust Rory and how valuable that trust has been both to me and to the business as a whole.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89e9b59e9fe40019009d80?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ryan caldbeck\" height=\"1050\" width=\"1400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Caldbeck and his daughter.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ryan Caldbeck</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p id=\"0c21\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I feel appreciative of my family and parents for helping me dream and also pushing me to see that I needed to make changes to be happy.

I've got the first two covered thanks to my family, but that last one is sometimes tough, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.</p><p>Enter online shopping. Now, I've never been one of those women that stakes an identity around shopping. I've never had the time or money, and after I had kids it became less of a fun way to spend an afternoon, and more of a chore. But lockdown has led to us having a little extra to spend each month, as well as more time for me thanks to my husband helping more around the house, and so — <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/news/how-bad-is-it-that-youve-developed-a-lockdown-online-shopping-habit-050620\">like a lot of people, apparently</a> — I've developed something of a habit.</p><p>Sometimes, receiving a delivery is the most excitement I get all week. I feel like my toddler when I open a \"present,\" even if it's just a 12-pack of toilet paper. It's exceptionally fun when I'm receiving something more out of the ordinary than household paper products — but even ordinary items, I've learned, can feel life-changing.</p><p>Below are the 10 best purchases I've made since the start of our sheltering in place. While \"life-changing\" may be a bit of an overstatement, these simple and mostly inexpensive products have made my home neater, cleaner, nicer, and generally more livable over the past four months.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t1. Jars, jars, and more jars\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f15c2f1f34d0559aa0248a5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"jars.

That said, I've always wanted a Pinterest-worthy pantry, and so I took it as the opportunity to invest in some eco-friendly storage ware. Jars keep everything on hand and free of pests. You can always reuse empty glass jars, but purchasing at least a handful that are identical (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tractorsupply.com%2Ftsc%2Fproduct%2Fball-regular-mouth-jars-32-oz-pack-of-12-4412819%3F\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">like these</a>) will give you a more unified look.</p>\n\t2. Lots of baskets\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f15c33d3ad8615024053053?format=jpeg\" alt=\"baskets.

I tell him to make fun all he wants, but you can never have too many baskets. I order baskets with no intended purpose and &#8212; sure as rain &#8212; they all find a use. When it comes to storing toys, big woven baskets are a beautiful alternative to plastic bins, and make cleaning up that sea of plastic so easy that even a toddler can do it (not that he or she necessarily will). If you want to splurge, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wayfair.com%2Fstorage-organization%2Fsb1%2Fseagrass-storage-baskets-c1860059-a9659%7E494889.html%3F\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Wayfair</a> has some pretty options.</p>\n\t3.

I'm an \"out of sight out of mind\" kind of person, whereas his bugbear is the basement. My husband wants it clean and organized, so he installed <a href=\"https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/H-7791W/Pegboards/Poly-Pegboard-48-x-24-White?pricode=WA9447&#38;gadtype=pla&#38;id=H-7791W&#38;gclid=CjwKCAjwrvv3BRAJEiwAhwOdM9AFeZ-pssIqR0qpCheaV4tKuSSh9HddFSrkdpSmcvY0CRB093awaBoCGoYQAvD_BwE&#38;gclsrc=aw.ds\">pegboards</a> along the walls leading down the stairs to the basement. Turns out, his idea was a good one. A formerly dead-to-me wall has become one of my favorite spaces in the house.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\t4. The impulse buy — canvas storage bags\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f15f825988ee3034e2e9cac?format=jpeg\" alt=\"melissa petro cushions\" height=\"2274\" width=\"3032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Large canvas storage bags can house extra blankets or pillows.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melissa Petro</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Like everyone, I've made more than a couple risky and impulsive purchases this quarantine. When a Facebook ad popped up in my feed advertising these <a href=\"https://www.mangobug.com/products/designer-storage-bags\">enormous canvas storage bags in bright and modern patterns</a> I couldn't resist. Some months later &#8212; unlike the hand-embroidered mask I'd purchased at least two weeks earlier &#8212; the bags actually arrived. The material is a little thinner than I expected, but the zippers are sturdy, and the bags are even roomier than I anticipated &#8212; perfect for the extra blankets that were piled in a corner on the floor in the family room.</p>\n\t5. An outdoor haven\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f15c395f34d055a322c7657?format=jpeg\" alt=\"porch swing Melissa Petro\" height=\"1032\" width=\"972\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A porch swing can add comfortable outdoor seating.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melissa Petro</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>One bulk trash day last summer, I saw the potential in a hideous wooden love seat and dragged it home.

With the money we saved, I splurged on <a href=\"https://theporchswingcompany.com/products/a-l-furniture-co-traditional-english-porch-swing\">this sweet little porch swing</a>. Perfect for when the workday is over and it's time for \"date night\"!</p>\n\t6.

Block it all out with panels of fabric! But seriously, curtains make a room look spacious and stylish &#8212; and when you're stuck at home for an indefinite period of time, it's best to enjoy the view. For those of us that go for the generic farmhouse linen-like look, all the bloggers recommended good old Ikea. I went with the <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lenda-curtains-with-tie-backs-1-pair-bleached-white-30111978/\">Lenda</a> in bleached white.</p>\n\t8.

The pattern was even prettier in person, and as the nights heat up, it's the perfect weight.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\t9. Fresh produce delivered to my door\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f15c417988ee36adb0f445a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"two bird Melissa Petro\" height=\"1184\" width=\"1160\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ordering fresh groceries can help support local farmers during the pandemic.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melissa Petro</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>When our grocery store closed down due to COVID-19, we found ourselves living in a food desert and without any means of transportation. Thankfully, our neighbors at <a href=\"https://www.twobirds.studio/\">Two Birds</a> in Cold Spring, New York had our back. It's a little pricier than C-Town, but the produce is fresher so it lasts longer, and the money we save on eating out covers the difference. Some months later, our grocery store is back up and running, but I'm still ordering local produce and somehow making meals from beet greens and garlic scapes.</p>\n\t10. This $900 oil painting\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f15c4302618b974f97978b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"painting Melissa Petro\" height=\"1046\" width=\"846\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melissa Petro</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>My husband and I had been eyeing this painting since we first bought our home, but could never (under normal circumstances) justify making such a luxurious purchase. For the past four months, we are fortunate that we can both work remotely &#8212; and his income has not been affected &#8212; and so when our stimulus arrived, we put it towards supporting a local business we loved. The Coop in Peekskill, New York sells vintage furnishings, antiques, and unique gifts. Their brick and mortar unfortunately didn't survive the pandemic, but you can still peruse their <a href=\"https://www.thecooppeekskill.com/\">shop online</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>This article was

And with the weather getting colder and family holidays on the horizon, there will be even more occasions to gather indoors.</p><p>The problem is, most people don't have signs in their homes saying \"keep your distance, wear a mask, wash your hands,\" Peter Chin-Hong, MD, professor of medicine at University of California-San Francisco, told Insider. On top of that, you may be more likely to have your guard down among those you'd invite into your home.</p><p>\"People may think of that inner sanctum of your domicile as having a force field around COVID, but of course that isn't the case,\" Chin-Hong said.</p><p>The best way to keep your household safe is to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/prepare-for-winter-with-the-coronavirus-how-to-bubble-2020-9\">form a tight social circle, or bubble</a>, and strictly limit who you see indoors. But bubbles will pop if pushed to their limits — don't let yours burst this winter.</p><h2><strong>If you're going to form a bubble, be prepared to ask some hard questions</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-prevention-study-social-bubbles-2020-6\">Forming a coronavirus bubble</a> is like signing a social contract, Chin-Hong said. You're agreeing to take on whatever level of risk your bubble-mates may incur in their daily lives, and to mitigate the risk you're bringing into the bubble.&#160;</p><p>The least complicated social bubble is a single household where you're forced to be transparent about your day-to-day activities and exposures, said Barun Mathema, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.</p><p>If you want to expand your bubble beyond your household, you need to do your due diligence to create that transparency, Mathema told Insider. <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/how-to-talk-to-partner-about-dating-safely-during-pandemic-2020-9\">Those conversations may be awkward</a>, he said, but you can blame any social discomfort on the pandemic.</p><p>\"I've done this personally myself, saying, 'Listen, this is very awkward, but I just need to ask this question,'\" Mathema said. \"'I would be irresponsible to myself and my family, and to you and your family, if we didn't have this conversation.'\"</p><p>The bigger the bubble, the higher the chance of someone breaking the social contract, Chin-Hong said. Two family units, or eight to ten people, can be manageable, but the risk goes up if you include people from multiple households (say, eight people from four different households).</p><h2><strong>Beware of the 'super-bubble'</strong></h2><p>If you've ever seen a bubble machine churn out a stream of suds, you may have noticed that smaller bubbles tend to stick together and form a giant super-bubble. That bubble can burst at the slightest disturbance.</p><p>Mathema said the same thing can happen with coronavirus bubbles. You may think you know the goings-on within your bubble, but if someone in your group has an additional bubble, you lose control over your potential exposures.</p><p>\"At face value, it's really uncomplicated,\" Mathema said. \"But when you add in social networks and human behavior, and the fact that we are social beings, that's when things start getting very complicated very quickly.\"</p><p>There will always be some risk that comes with social contacts during the pandemic, and your willingness to bubble will depend on your individual risk tolerance, Yvonne Maldonado, MD, professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Stanford University, told Insider. Still, she recommends against letting your guard down completely, as you never know how careful other people are.</p><p>\"Having a pod doesn't mean that you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-social-distancing-might-last-several-months-2020-3\">stop socially distancing</a> and wearing masks,\" Maldonado said. \"You still have to practice some care there.\"</p><h2><strong>This holiday season might challenge your boundaries</strong></h2><p>The combination of cold weather, holiday cheer, and <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/what-is-quarantine-fatigue-how-to-combat-it-2020-5\">pandemic fatigue</a> can spell trouble for even the most carefully curated bubbles. People are tired after nearly eight months of thinking about the coronavirus, and they might be more likely to relax safety measures around family and friends.</p><p>\"It's a time when family members get together and you don't want to think of risk, either because it's the holiday time and you have lots of eggnog in you, so you lose inhibitions,\" Chin-Hong said. \"But mainly because it seems rude to not hug your Aunt Sue or your Uncle Albert when you haven't seen them for a year, and you don't know what their COVID risk is.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/6-questions-to-ask-before-traveling-for-holidays-this-year-2020-10\">Asking the hard questions</a> about risk can feel contentious among family, particularly if there are incompatible risk tolerances and dissenting views on the pandemic, Mathema said.&#160;</p><p>Even if everyone is willing to wear masks inside, there's still a considerable risk. People have to take off their masks to eat, Maldonado said, so distancing is just as important.&#160;</p><p>\"It's sort of like wearing a bike helmet,\" Mathema said. \"Like, wear a bike helmet, but you should still be very careful on the bike.\"</p><p>The best way to minimize risk is to keep your bubble tight and stay vigilant at even the smallest gatherings, he said.

years, I've taught English for 12 hours a week in small, idyllic French cities. It's a lot harder than it sounds.&#160;</p><p>Before you start playing the world's tiniest violin, hear me out: I was an <em>assistante de langue, </em>a classroom aide for English teachers at French public schools. As nice as it may seem to work part-time in the land of baguettes, champagne, and bimonthly vacations, teaching is tough. It's even tougher in a culture that is not your own.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://frenchhighereducation.org/teaching-assistant-program/prospective-applicants/faq\">Teaching Assistant Program in France</a> recruits Americans ages 20-35 to work part-time providing English instruction in French public schools for €785 per month, plus health insurance. I was fresh out of a rigorous graduate program and having conversations in English&#160; for 12 hours a week seemed like a vacation in comparison — I applied, got in, and made plans to move to France.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Lesson learned: Moving to a foreign country is not a vacation.&#160;</strong></h2><p>By the time I applied to TAPIF, it had been three years since I'd spoken a word of my intermediate college French. I tried my best to prepare by watching every French movie on Netflix, but with the school year rapidly approaching, I could still barely string a sentence together.</p><p>Immediately upon arrival in Paris, it became clear that this would be a problem. It's one thing to be an English-speaking tourist, and quite another to be an English-speaking resident. I did my best to express myself using an expansive English vocabulary, my best French accent, and elaborate hand gestures. The result of these attempts was usually tears: tears at the bank, tears at the train station, tears at the phone shop, etc.&#160;</p><p>Once I had cried my way to a French phone number and rail card, I traveled south to the city where I was assigned: Niort. The small city has two main claims to fame: One, it contains the headquarters of several insurance companies, and two, the great writer Michel Houellebecq called it one of the <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.fr/20190104/ugly-french-town-hits-back-at-literary-rebel-houellebecq\">\"one of the ugliest cities\"</a> ever. (For what it's worth, I actually thought Niort was quite charming.)</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f18aba9aee6a8386942dcef?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The view from the Donjon de Niort, a medieval castle in the downtown area of Niort.

With <em>CAF, </em>a government housing supplement, I paid just over 50 euros a month in rent for a small room next to a shared toilet. Not exactly Versailles, <em>mais bon.</em>&#160;</p><h2><strong>My first day on the job, the culture shock hit me before I walked through the door.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Outside of the school gate, dozens upon dozens of teachers and students alike were chain-smoking cigarettes.&#160;</p><p>The school where I would be working was a <em>lycee professionnel, </em>a vocational school, with students ages 15-18 (with some older and younger outliers).&#160; It specializes in automobile repair and bodywork (which I knew nothing about), and the student body was made up of about 95% boys.&#160;</p><p>This turned out not to be much of an issue. Most of my students, regardless of age, gender, or career path, asked me the same questions during class time. \"Do you have a gun?\" \"Do you like Trump?\" \"Have you met XXXTentacion?\" No, no, and no.&#160;</p><p>I turned their questions back on them. Do <em>you</em> have a gun? Do you like France? Have you met Macron? Also no, no, and no. But it provoked a conversation, in English, which was really my only job. And I liked my job, most of the time.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f18ad62f34d0557821db916?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ciara mclaren Good bread, jambon cru, and courgette salad from the local market of Pau, France.\" height=\"2402\" width=\"3203\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Good bread, jambon cru, and courgette salad from the local market in Pau, France.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ciara McLaren</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Speaking English with students was simple, but not easy.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Teenagers are teenagers wherever you go, and discipline was a constant issue.

Despite my part-time hours, I always looked forward to school vacations.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f18accd988ee3675f44f746?format=jpeg\" alt=\"On a hike in the Pyrenees (don’t look too closely as the sheep).

Shortly after I arrived, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\"><em>gilets jaunes</em></a> protests erupted across the country, and more <em>manifestations </em>against austerity and school reform followed throughout the year. Daily life was so disrupted that some days I couldn't get to school, or would arrive to find the gate locked and nobody there.&#160;</p><p>In those moments, I turned to my <em>profs référents, </em>the teachers assigned to look after me. They answered my questions, invited me to their homes, and included me in conversation in the break room. Sometimes, they'd forget to tell me there was a strike going on, but they were always very apologetic afterward.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f18ad85f34d0557da4c73ba?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fresh pastries from Le Pain Pascale in Pau, France.

On the other hand, the job combined two very difficult things: being a foreigner and working with teenagers.&#160;</p><p>In testimonials on the TAPIF website, former assistants describe freedom, friendship, and growth. They don't mention the long hours spent fighting with French bureaucracy to accomplish basically anything, from getting an apartment to validating your visa. They don't mention how hard it is to control your temper when your students won't stop asking you whether you prefer \"French fry or French kiss.\" In Facebook groups and local assistant meet-ups, we would commiserate over our difficulties and celebrate our triumphs.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f18ac1b3f7370799d366832?format=jpeg\" alt=\"In quarantine in Pau, France, in March 2020.

While Pai didn't indicate what the clarifications would include, he implied that social media companies would lose some of the legal immunity currently granted to them by the law.&#160;Two days earlier, Clarence Thomas, associate justice of the Supreme Court and one of the court's conservative justices, issued an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/101320zor_8m58.pdf\">unusual opinion</a> arguing that courts should reconsider how Section 230 is interpreted to offer social media companies fewer protections.</p><p>The new developments mean big tech companies could face a restructured Section 230 in the near future. And by potentially circumventing Congress and the legislative process needed to amend the law, the federal government could act more immediately, and leave those companies without much recourse to fight the new regulations.</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, known simply as Section 230, is part of a 1996 law that allows websites to avoid being treated as traditional publishers like newspapers that would be legally responsible for the content they produce. It has <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">set the legal foundations for the modern internet</a> and enabled sites to host open forums populated by posts from anonymous users. Companies like Facebook and other supporters of Section 230 see it as a fundamental building block for open discussion and innovation on the internet — akin to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/net-neutralityfor-dummies-and-how-it-effects-you-2014-1\">net neutrality</a>. Trump and the law's critics, meanwhile, say that big tech has too frequently wielded the law as a shield for their own bad behavior.</p><p>Republican officials, including Trump's closest allies, have been some of the most high-profile recent drivers advocating a repeal or rewrite of the law. They say actions by Facebook and Twitter to fact-check Trump's false statements are evidence of systemic bias against conservatives, a claim <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/technology/what-if-facebook-is-the-real-silent-majority.html\">without much data to back it up</a>. Meanwhile, some Democrats — including House Speaker <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/12/18307957/nancy-pelosi-donald-trump-twitter-tweet-cheap-freak-presidency-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview\">Nancy Pelosi</a> — have implied tech companies should face harsher penalties for hosting misinformation or hate speech, but have not gone as far as to push to dismantle Section 230.</p><p>Tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google have objected to calls to weaken the law's protections. A Facebook spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/trump-targets-social-media-with-executive-order-after-twitter-fact-checks-him.html\">said in May</a> that limiting Section 230 \"will restrict more speech online, not less\" by penalizing companies \"that choose to allow controversial speech,\" while a Google spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/28/trump-social-media-executive-order/\">said</a> the same month that repealing the law could hurt the US' stature as a leader in internet freedom.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Donald J.

In the rejection, Thomas <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/101320zor_8m58.pdf\">argued</a>&#160;that courts should still reconsider the law at some point in the near future.</p><p>He cited examples of previous lawsuits in the opinion, arguing that Section 230 was interpreted too broadly to shield tech companies.</p><p>In one case, a group called Sikhs for Justice <a href=\"https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/09/facebook-wins-appeal-over-allegedly-discriminatory-content-removal-sikhs-for-justice-v-facebook.htm\">sued Facebook</a>, claiming it removed their page at the request of the Indian government and refused to reinstate it, amounting to racial discrimination. In another case, a man <a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10902194429858/20200902_Goldberg_FCC_Coments_Final.pdf\">sued</a> the gay dating app Grindr for allegedly failing to remove the profile of another man who was impersonating him using his photos.</p><p>Facebook and Grindr won each of their cases. In both, courts didn't rule on whether the plaintiffs' claims were true — rather, they argued that Section 230 protected Facebook from claims of racial discrimination in how it moderates content, and that Section 230 immunized Grindr from complaints about how it removes fake profiles.</p><p>Thomas argued that those cases established an overly broad definition of Section 230 that should be narrowed in the future.</p><p>If Thomas' view prevails, hosting social media platforms would pose a far greater liability for tech companies, opening them up to a slew of new potential lawsuits. Legal experts are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/if-section-230-dies-twitter-facebook-would-likely-ban-trump-2020-5\">divided</a> on what social media would look like without Section 230 protections, but changing the law could massively reshape how open forums are hosted across the internet.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

It still felt like decent value, especially given a generous room upgrade, but the property was obviously still relatively empty. Thankfully, the professionalism of the staff meant it was a positive experience, though, and I would stay here again given some clearer information.&#160;&#160;</p><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-1\">The first impression</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-5\">The room</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-12\">On-site amenities</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-15\">What's nearby</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-16\">What others say</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-17\">What you need to know</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-18\">COVID-19 policies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/loews-hotel-review-new-orleans#-19\">The bottom line</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7745&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loewshotels.com%2Fnew-orleansFnew-orleans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Book the Loews New Orleans Hotel starting at $119 per night</a></li></ul><h2>Keep reading to see why I was so impressed by the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7745&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loewshotels.com%2Fnew-orleansFnew-orleans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Loews New Orleans Hotel</a>.</h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d9b60d6695b583f20756fd3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"1 Hotel Reviews Banner first impression\" height=\"151\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89ad099e9fe40019009bbe?format=jpeg\" alt=\"loews New Orleans hotel lobby\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The grand lobby is one of the hotel&#39;s best features.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Paul Oswell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7745&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loewshotels.com%2Fnew-orleans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Loews New Orleans Hotel</a> is part of the small chain of Loews hotels, which operates 28 high-end, luxe properties across North America.

A dark blue and gold carpet added some subtle color.</p><p>The King-sized bed boasted crisp, high-end linens and a firm mattress for a very good night's sleep. There was a slight level of ambient noise from some very loud street performers below, but thankfully, they didn't last into the night and I imagine they aren't a permanent fixture.</p><p>Traffic and general street noise were muted, and I didn't hear any noise from neighbors or the hotel corridors.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89adffd260780019341cf3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"loews hotel new orleans minibar\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The minibar was locked but the coffee machine was a handy amenity.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Paul Oswell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The hotel promotes its COVID-19 cleaning and general protocols available on their <a href=\"https://cdn.loewshotels.com/loewshotels.com-2466770763/cms/pressroom/lh_safetyprotocols_71820.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a> and it felt as though my stay lived up to them.</p><p>Rooms are given at least 24 hours between guests, and so, it felt fresh and hygienic, although the promised bottle of water and hand sanitizer were missing from my room, which was disappointing &#8212; especially the latter given the pandemic.</p><p>As part of the new policy, many amenities were stripped out, including paper pads, pens, and the minibars, as noted.

With the free upgrade, late checkout, great views, and sofa-enhanced living space that made it feel like a junior suite, the current promotion (and subsequent $25 rate reduction), which runs until January 1, 2021, made this stay one of exceptionally strong value in terms of the room alone.

Talks are ongoing, with a December 3 deadline to close a deal.</p>\n <p>Under the proposed deal, GM would be tasked with manufacturing Nikola's electric pickup truck, the Badger. But Russell said the company was prepared to abandon the Badger if it can't strike a deal with an original equipment manufacturer.</p>\n <p>\"The Badger is part of our discussions with GM. And we've been clear all along that we wouldn't build a Badger without an OEM partner,\" Russell told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.</p>\n <p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-21-potential-future-index-leaders-goldman-sachs-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 21 high-growth stocks that have huge upside potential as future index leaders</a></em></p>\n <p>But Russell said Nikola had a \"base plan\" if the deal with GM is off. \"If we have a partner,\" he added, \"that just enables us to consider going faster and helps reduce the risk.\"</p>\n <p>A deal with GM is still possible. Bloomberg said GM could seek an increased stake in Nikola given its depressed valuation since the deal was announced last month. Another option would be for GM to receive warrants on Nikola.</p>\n <p>Regarding Nikola's hydrogen-fueling-station ambitions, Russell said Nikola was still targeting a deal with an energy company by the end of the year. Bloomberg reported last month that Nikola had held talks with BP, but those were put on hold after the Hindenburg report, which <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nikola-stock-price-founder-trevor-milton-leaves-executive-chairman-hindenburg-2020-9-1029606958#\">led to the resignation of Trevor Milton</a>, Nikola's founder.</p>\n <p>If no deal is reached, Russell said, Nikola plans to develop hydrogen-refueling stations on its own.</p>\n <p><em>Do you work at GM or Nikola?

In 2016, it was close, with&#160; Trump edging out Hillary Clinton by 3.7 percentage points, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1zxyOQDjNOJS_UkzerorUCf2OAdcMcIQEwRciKuYBIZ4/pubhtml/sheet?headers=false&gid=6587268026802\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"c3ef407b6d7b42cb43c23d60804253cd\">according to Ballotpedia</a>.</p><p>\"Even if Trump loses North Carolina, if he can hold on to some other pivotal states in the electoral college — especially Florida and Pennsylvania — he can still manage a narrow win,\" Kiel Williams, author at DDHQ, said about the 2020 election.</p><p>Williams noted that while Trump could win without the state, losing North Carolina would bode poorly for the Trump campaign on election night.

The reason, they say, is a combination of factors: Lockdown measures have lifted, more people are spending time indoors as weather gets cold, residents are feeling fatigued by safety measures, and cases never dropped sufficiently.</p><p>\"If the rates never get that low, and basic public-health measures are not universally adopted, and then you bring people indoors to share a meal together, you're kind of putting together the perfect storm,\" Ingrid Katz, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, told Business Insider. \"Unfortunately this was completely anticipated.\"</p><p>Indeed, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicted in August that <a href=\"http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-ihme-covid-19-forecasts-see-nearly-300000-deaths-december-1\">more than 20 states would need to reimpose lockdown measures</a> before December, including closing nonessential businesses and reinstating stay-at-home orders.

By the second wave this summer, cases had migrated to the South and Sunbelt. Now cases are concentrated in the Midwest, but the virus is more widespread than ever before — it's had 10 months to spread, after all.</p><p>What remains the same, however, is that the US continues to be hamstrung by insufficient contact tracing and a widespread distrust of scientific recommendations.</p><p>\"We still don't have a national coordinated response. We still have a lot of misinformation about simple, basic public-health behavior, like wearing a mask, which we know is effective,\" Katz said, adding, \"in a way, we're battling two pandemics — that of COVID itself and then, of course, the misinformation that surrounds it.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5efbf69c1918245a2749e1a5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"wisconsin reopening\" height=\"1467\" width=\"2200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jonesy&#39;s Local Bar in Hudson, Wisconsin, on May 14.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jerry Holt/Star Tribune via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But it's understandable that some Americans are struggling to follow public safety measures, she added, since many people <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/europes-spike-coronavirus-cases-relaxing-lockdown-pandemic-fatigue-2020-10\">have developed \"pandemic fatigue.\"</a> That could make them less likely to remain at home or stay informed about local transmission. As schools and businesses reopen, others may get the false impression that those environments are now completely safe.</p><p>\"We're seeing a roller coaster in the United States,\" IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray said in a statement. \"It appears that people are wearing masks and socially distancing more frequently as infections increase, then after a while as infections drop, people let their guard down and stop taking these measures to protect themselves and others – which, of course, leads to more infections. And the potentially deadly cycle starts over again.\"&#160;</p><h2>Rising hospitalizations could trigger more lockdowns</h2><p>Though new cases are concentrated in the Midwest, experts said they could quickly spill into other parts of the country.</p><p>At least 14 states have test-positivity rates — the share of coronavirus tests that come back positive — above 10%, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said test-positivity rates should ideally sit below 3%.

class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Apple's iPhone 12 comes with several upgrades like 5G support, a refreshed design, and a camera that's better at taking photos in the dark.</li>\n<li>But there are several useful features found on Android phones that the iPhone still lacks.</li>\n<li>These include a fingerprint sensor and an always-on display.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Apple's iPhone 12, which is available for pre-order starting Friday, brings a number of changes that differentiate it from last year's iPhone 11. These include an updated design, 5G support, improved cameras, and new size options.</p><p>Plus, the iPhone 12 lineup will be compatible with a new line of accessories Apple is launching called MagSafe, which as its name implies uses magnets to quickly and securely attach to the iPhone.</p><p>The addition of 5G and a wider range of sizes and price points certainly gives Apple more leverage to compete with products from Android rivals like Samsung and Google. But there are still a few small but useful features found on Android phones that I had hoped to see on the iPhone 12 lineup.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the top Android features missing from Apple's latest smartphones.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tA fingerprint sensor for quickly unlocking your phone\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c6d537c0d15f55d816ff975?format=jpeg\" alt=\"in display fingerprint sensor\" height=\"2138\" width=\"3181\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S lines have had fingerprint sensors built into their screens since last year.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>When Apple introduced its new iPad Air, which has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apples-ipad-air-new-touch-id-2020-9\">Touch ID built into the top button</a>, I was hopeful that the company would bring its fingerprint-scanning tech back to the iPhone, too.</p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the iPhone 12. Like every modern iPhone with a borderless, edge-to-edge screen, the iPhone 12 lineup only supports Face ID when it comes to biometric authentication.</p><p>At a time when I find myself typing in my passcode more than ever because I'm wearing a mask, it would have been nice to see Apple re-introduce Touch ID to the iPhone.</p><p>Some Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20, Galaxy Note 20, and OnePlus 8 Pro offer both fingerprint detection and face unlock. Google's new Pixel 5 also has a fingerprint sensor, although it lacks facial recognition.</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\tAn always-on display so that you can see the time without picking up your phone\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5efd02102618b96b03618e7d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"TCL 10 Pro Always On Display\" height=\"2751\" width=\"2671\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The Apple Watch has had an always-on display since the Series 5 model debuted last year, but we have yet to see this feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Android phones like the Galaxy S20, Galaxy Note 20, and Google Pixel 5 have displays that can show information like the time, date, battery level, and unread notifications even when the display is turned off. That can make it easier to see information at a glance without having to reach for your phone.</p><p>In my experience, having an always-on display has made it easier to check the time or see which app a notification came from without falling down the rabbit hole of scrolling through Instagram or my overflowing email inbox.</p><p>The iPhone 12 may not have an always-on display, but Apple did improve the iPhone's screen in a couple of other ways, such as by making OLED screens standard across all models and improving their durability with a new ceramic shield coating.&#160;</p>\n\tA higher refresh rate for smoother scrolling\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cc07bc5b14bf43f0e79d5f1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ipad pro\" height=\"1929\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>A number of Android phones such as those from Samsung, Google, and OnePlus also have screens that are capable of reaching a higher refresh rate for smoother scrolling.&#160;</p><p>Phones like the Galaxy S20 lineup, Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and OnePlus 8 Pro can increase their screens' refresh rates up to 120Hz, compared to the 60Hz refresh rate that's considered average on smartphones.&#160;</p><p>The ability to crank up the refresh rate can make navigating the phone's software feel faster, more responsive, and more fluid,&#160; although that <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-to-change-the-galaxy-s20s-refresh-rate\">can also mean compromising</a> when it comes to resolution.&#160;&#160;</p><p>This feature isn't available on the iPhone, but Apple does offer it elsewhere: on the iPad Pro. Apple's high-end tablet has a feature called ProMotion, which boosts the screen's refresh rate up to 120Hz, a capability that Apple has touted as being ideal for use with the Apple Pencil.&#160;&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-launch-missing-features-samsung-galaxy-s20-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oYEiF5z8-nk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 21:24:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f89a9209e9fe40019009ba5?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e1f5d17d79e0f60472b8353d475b1db5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-13-922_8684c6174da5819e.webp","destWidth":1949,"destHeight":1462,"sourceBytes":41100,"destBytes":41100,"author":"leadicicco@businessinsider.com (Lisa Eadicicco)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f85e24491aa9e001880b4fc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn44@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-28-811_33c33925697c17ac.webp","https://i.insider.com/5c6d537c0d15f55d816ff975?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-20-362_a52b4b6858bc3b97.webp","https://i.insider.com/5efd02102618b96b03618e7d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn12@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-19-121_6cb96225b119fb65.webp","https://i.insider.com/5cc07bc5b14bf43f0e79d5f1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn48@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-25-965_5218568bc4b01a61.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-26-160_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-15-214_afd3b9602a5a4c1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn84@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-20-370_78a81dcf9b659abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-21-755_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oYEiF5z8-nk:wRNXGlf5Q4E:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-15-975_0f334f6aa3a1a68d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oYEiF5z8-nk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-26-087_dede28a9e0229cca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901799696},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:59","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:59","title":"How to leave a review and rating on the Apple Podcasts app, and view all of your reviews later","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-leave-a-review-on-apple-podcasts","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89f581d260780019341f18?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple macos catalina apple podcasts\" height=\"816\" width=\"1632\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It&#39;s easy to leave reviews on the Apple Podcasts app.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>You can leave a review on the Apple Podcasts app by heading to a podcast's \"Ratings &#38;

But Buffett also liked to warn people about the dangers of ending up on the wrong side of the compound interest equation.</p><p>While compound interest is arguably the most important component to wealth-building, it can also be one of the best ways to wreck your finances: Having to <em>pay</em> compound interest can cause debt to spiral out of control.&#160;</p><p>Most people only think of interest in terms of how high or low a rate is. But understanding how interest is calculated, or compounds, is important too. Knowing how compound interest works can help you avoid expensive mistakes and make the most of your money, whether you're depositing it, investing it, borrowing it, or spending it.&#160;</p><h2>What is compound interest?</h2><p>All interest is a percentage charged on, or earned by, a lump sum of money. Compound interest is a kind of interest based on adding the original principal — that is, the initial amount invested or borrowed — with the accumulated interest from previous periods.</p><p>For example, say you have $100 in a savings account, and it earns interest at a 10% rate, compounded annually. At the end of the first year, you'd have $110 (100 in principal + 10 in interest). At the end of the second year, you'd have $121 (110 in principal + 11 in interest). At the end of the third year, you'd have $133.10 (121 in principal + 12.10 in interest). And so on.</p><p>In other words, with compound interest, you earn interest on interest.&#160;</p><p>The revelation comes when you realize that compounding interest makes the principal grow exponentially, meaning as interest accrues and the quantity of money increases, the rate of growth becomes faster.</p><p>How quickly your money grows depends on the interest rate, and the frequency of compounding. Interest can be compounded daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually, and the more frequently it's compounded, the faster it accumulates.&#160;</p><p>Over the long term, \"the magic of compounding\" can really add up. Here's how an initial investment of $5,000 would grow if compounded semi-annually over a period of 35 years, at an annualized 5% interest rate:</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"How compound interest can make $5,000 grow\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-OAwWX\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OAwWX/6/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"536\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></div><p>If you're the one <em>earning </em>money off the interest, daily or monthly compounding are preferable to yearly. On the other hand, if you're being <em>charged</em> interest, monthly or yearly compounding will save you money compared to daily.</p><h2>Compound interest vs. simple interest</h2><p>While compound interest is \"interest on interest\" — calculated on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest — simple interest is wholly different. Simple interest is calculated <em>only</em> on the original principal balance or deposit.</p><p>Let's take our $100 savings account again, only this time it's paying 10% in simple interest. That means the 10% interest rate applies only to your original principal amount of $100, so you earn $10 each year. Period. At the end of the first year, you'd have $110. But at the end of the second year, you'd have $120. At the end of the third year, $130 — compared to $133.10 in the compounded interest account.</p><p>Even though we've used small numbers here, you can see how the farther out you go, the more compound interest nets you — and the more it outstrips simple interest.</p><p>Simple interest tends to be used in most student loans, mortgages, and installment loans — when you're paying a store for the purchase of a big appliance over a period of time, for example.</p><h2>How to calculate compound interest</h2><p>Calculating compound interest looks complicated, but it's actually as simple as plugging some numbers into the right formula.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f88cd009e9fe40019009aa3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"formula for compound interest\" height=\"1054\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The compound interest equation basically adds 1 to the interest rate, raises this sum to the total number of compound periods, and multiplies the result by the principal amount.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Let's say you decide to deposit your $10,000 annual bonus into a 5-year certificate of deposit (CD). You leave that money in the CD for the full five years, and it earns a 4% annual rate of interest that's compounded daily. The numbers you'd plug into each variable are as follows:</p><ul><li>P = $10,000</li><li>r = 0.04</li><li>n = 365</li><li>t = 5</li></ul><p>The formula gives you $12,213.89 for A. That's the total amount of money you'd have in your money market account at the end of five years. This means you earned $2,213.89 in interest.</p><h2>How compound interest can work against you</h2><p>As beneficial compounding interest can be for savings, investments, and wealth creation, it's important to note that it can work against you if you're paying off debt. In fact, compounding is part of what makes carrying an outstanding credit card balance so deadly.</p><p>In fact, the above example could be turned upside down by imagining that you carry a $10,000 balance on a credit card (we'll assume it's the same 4% compounded daily, even though credit card APRs are usually much higher). You plan not to put anything else on the card, and to pay it all off in five years. Even though you'd be chipping away at your balance and paying an extremely low interest rate, you could still end up paying a lot in interest charges — more than $1,000 in fact.</p><p>And if you were being charged 18% compounded daily — which is closer to the average credit card interest rate — you would pay $5,236 in interest after five years.</p><h2>How to get the most out of compound interest</h2><p>The best way to take advantage of compound interest is through saving and investing.&#160;</p><p>Opting for a savings account that earns interest — such as high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs — is one way to make compound interest work in your favor. When choosing an account, you'll want to look for one with minimal fees and the highest annual percentage yield (<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-apy-annual-percentage-yield\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">APY</a>), which is the interest you can earn on your deposit in a 12-month period.</p><p>It's worth noting that the interest rates on even the best savings accounts barely outpace inflation, so they're best for short-term savings. If you want to build long-term wealth, whether that's savings for retirement or a goal that's years away, investing your money will really get it working for you.&#160;</p><p>Savings products offer interest rates that typically range from 0.01% to 3%, depending on the state of the economy, while the average historical rate of return on the stock market is 10%, before adjusting for inflation.</p><p>When opening an investment account like a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-in-a-401k-for-retirement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">401(k)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-open-an-ira-for-retirement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IRA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-brokerage-account-first-step-towards-investing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brokerage account</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/etf-vs-mutual-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mutual fund</a>, you have the option to automatically reinvest the dividends or interest your investments earn. Doing so means your returns will compound.</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>Compound interest can be your friend or your enemy, with the power to enrich you or bankrupt you — depending which side of it you're on.</p><p>Luckily, you don't need to be a math genius to understand whether the interest on an account will help or hurt you. If you're borrowing money, you want the lowest interest rate possible, compounded as infrequently as possible. If you're investing money, the opposite applies: You want not only a good interest rate, but one that compounds early and often.</p><p>And when comparing loans, credit card APRs, savings account APYs, or other securities' returns — check the frequency at which the interest compounds, and make sure you're comparing like to like. Two interest rates can be nominally the same, but if they compound at different speeds, it can make a big difference.&#160;</p><p>Whether earning it or paying it, the nature of compound interest means that getting on top of it early on is exponentially — pun intended — better for your wallet.</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\"

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/emulators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emulator</a> is a computer program (or occasionally custom computer hardware) that's designed to simulate another kind of device.&#160;</p><p>For example, WINE is a program that allows you to run Windows software on certain Linux and Mac computers. Dolphin is an app that lets you play Nintendo GameCube and Wii games on your computer. Even Logic Pro X, the popular music recording app for Mac, lets you simulate the sound of a guitar amplifier within your computer.</p><p>These are all different types of emulators. Here's what you should know about emulators, including why people use them, how they commonly work, and what kinds there are.</p><h2><strong>Why people use emulators&#160;</strong></h2><p>Every kind of computer and operating system is unique. This often means that a program or app that works on one system won't work on another.</p><p>This is especially true when comparing operating systems like Windows and MacOS, or completely different devices like a laptop and a PlayStation.</p><p>This is where emulators come in. Emulators can bridge the gap between these devices, allowing programs to work on all sorts of hardware.</p><p>For example, if you have a Windows app that you need to run on your MacBook, you can download the Parallels emulator. Parallels will, in a sense, create a Windows computer inside of your MacBook — this will let you run any Windows app you need.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8778922a400c0019debbe8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac\" height=\"1875\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Here, Windows 10 and an older version of MacOS are running on a new MacBook using emulators.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Parallels Newsroom</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Some emulators can even enhance the hardware that they're simulating. For instance, old video games made for 4:3 televisions can be upgraded to run in widescreen resolution, as well as at a higher framerate.</p><p>If you're someone who likes to be able to run all their programs anywhere, at any time, then an emulator is what you need.</p><p>However, there are some risks that you should be aware of.</p><h2><strong>The downsides to emulators</strong></h2><p>Because emulators need to reproduce the behavior of an entirely different device, without having their own dedicated hardware or power source, emulators are often slower than the system they're simulating.&#160;</p><p>This is especially true if you're emulating a new system. For example, nearly any computer can emulate an '80s-era Nintendo Entertainment System without much delay. But you'll need a powerful graphics card and CPU to emulate the Nintendo Switch, which only came out in 2017. And even then, it might be hard to make that Switch emulator run smoothly.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f877f482a400c0019debbfd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mario Odyssey on Windows\" height=\"710\" width=\"1139\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You&#39;ll need a powerful computer to run most new AAA games.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTWeVBl6xzA\" target=\"_blank\">BSoD Gaming/YouTube</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Users also have to be careful not to download a virus masquerading as an emulator. Be sure to only download emulators and programs from sources that you trust, and always do your research before installing anything.</p><p>Lastly, there's also a legal risk. Although emulators are legal almost everywhere, downloading programs to use on those emulators without paying for them may not be. Look up the regulations surrounding emulated programs in your country before downloading them.</p><h4><strong>The most popular types of emulators in use today</strong></h4><p>The two most common uses for emulators are ones for playing video games, and ones for running other operating systems. Here's a few examples of the most popular emulators around.</p><p><strong>Video game emulators</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dolphin </strong>lets you play Nintendo GameCube and Wii games on a computer, as well as modify them in various ways. Some originally single-player games even have online multiplayer modes added to them.</li><li><strong>MAME</strong> is an open-source emulator originally released in 1997 that's designed to run older arcade games.</li><li><strong>VisualBoyAdvance</strong>, or <strong>VBA</strong>, can run nearly every Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance game ever released.</li></ul><p>There are also various game emulators <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-nintendo-gamecube-games-2017-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that run on Android phones</a>.</p><p><strong>Operating system emulators</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Parallels</strong> and <strong>WINE</strong> both allow you to run Windows on a Mac computer. It'll open a Windows desktop in a new window, just like any other app.</li><li><strong>BlueStacks</strong> lets you download and open Android apps on a desktop computer.</li><li><strong>Xcode</strong> is a program designed and released by Apple that can run iPhone apps on a Mac. Soon, Apple claims that there will be an even easier way to emulate both iPhone and iPad apps on your Mac.</li></ul><h2><strong>Related coverage from&#160;<a

There are four suits (just like playing cards, except the suits are wands, swords, pentacles, and cups; this is referred to as the Minor Arcana) and then there's the Major Arcana, which are cards that are labelled things like The Fool, The Lovers, Death, and The Sun. These are the ones you always see in movies right before something ominous is about to happen, and is why the cards sometimes get a bad rap. There's no reason to fear getting your cards read. A reputable reader isn't going to tell you that anyone is going to die or that you have a curse placed upon you — that's a scam. In a legitimate tarot reading, the cards that are pulled and the way they are spread out will create a unique message that your reader will interpret.&#160;</p><h2>I learned by reading books and getting my own cards read.</h2><p>This was, of course, way before the internet. I practiced on friends and family members, initially reading from the \"LWB,\" (little white book) that comes with the cards. It's a lot like learning another language. Eventually you get to a point where the cards just seem to talk to you. You develop a rapport with them.&#160;</p><p>I started reading professionally in the 1990s.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f231268f0f419017c251034?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The author&#39;s very first deck along with the little white book. Patti Woods\" height=\"360\" width=\"481\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>One of the author&#39;s decks of tarot cards.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Patti Woods</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I'm a freelance writer, which is a solitary profession, so reading cards allows me to connect with people. At first, I started out doing private readings and a few parties, but it wasn't until the past five years or so when I really decided that this was my calling. Now I do more tarot and less writing.</p><p>I know that when I tell people I'm a reader, the first thing they think of is the stereotype: A neon sign that says \"Fortunes Told,\" a shiny crystal ball on the table, and someone telling them they can remove a hex for an extra $50. But that's not how I operate.&#160;</p><p>I read out of my home in Connecticut and at a few local shops. A basic reading is $50 for a half hour. My readings are all about the here and now. The cards are a tool to help you see what factors need to be considered when making a decision. They highlight opportunities, hindrances, helpers, and detractors. A good reading can validate past decisions and help guide you in future choices.&#160;</p><h2>I start every day by prepping my space, which is a spare room in my house.</h2><p>Although I'm currently not seeing clients in person due to COVID-19, I still want to make my space as sacred and still as possible, and cleanse it using sage, palo santo (a medicinal wood) or a crystal-infused oil spray. I set up my desk with whatever cards and crystals I'm using that day, and then I do a meditation in order to be as grounded as possible, because often a lot of heavy emotional stuff will come up in readings. I need to be sure that I don't take on the emotional energy of others.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2312d45fa9a4767a1daef7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Woods&#39; workspace in the spare room of her house where conducts tarot card readings.\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Woods&#39; workspace is in the spare room of her house.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Patti Woods</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>I always tell my clients that our reading is their time.&#160;</strong></h2><p>They can ask me questions and tell me as much or as little as they'd like. Some people come with a list of questions and others just want to see what comes up. I shuffle the cards and lay them out and one by one I turn them over.&#160;</p><p>Each card has its own meaning, but the real story happens when you see how the cards interact.&#160;Once some messages start popping up, the client will often start to make the connections and ask deeper questions.&#160;</p><h2>The first two weeks of quarantine, I didn't read for anyone, but then I realized that people needed the cards more than ever.</h2><p>Clients were reaching out to me with questions like, \"Will I get sick?\" \"When will we be done with this?\" and \"I don't even know what to ask right now, I just need something.\"&#160;</p><p>So, I decided to try virtual readings using Zoom and FaceTime. I wasn't sure if this system would work, because a big part of a successful reading is being able to tap into the client's physical energy. Fortunately, it hasn't been an issue at all. Since we've all had to adapt to a new screen-centered lifestyle, I think the technology doesn't present as much of a psychological hurdle as it would have in the past.&#160;</p><p>Tarot readings have always been popular because people have a need for something less clinical (and cheaper) than therapy, and more objective than just talking to friends. A tarot reading offers a safe space for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings and hopefully gain a little insight.&#160;</p><h2><strong>There is no typical client — I've read for kids and grandparents, doctors and lawyers, stay-at-home moms and people who are unemployed.</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2315a9a6f0e179ef56a73d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Patti Woods The various tools (sage, palo santo, sprays, selenite) that I use to cleanse my decks and space\" height=\"429\" width=\"640\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The various tools (sage, palo santo, sprays, selenite) that Woods uses to cleanse her decks and meeting space.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Patti Woods</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>My clients include those who are completely open to the metaphysical and those who are 100% skeptical. I appreciate their willingness to trust me with their story. I see about 10 people a week for private readings, and try to limit myself to two a day, because the sessions can often bear a heavy energy and I want to be as present as possible for each client.</p><p>I also started doing fun, more casual readings once a week on Facebook just to give the cards a chance to breathe. I know how that sounds, but the cards can get weighed down, too. I still have quite a few regular clients that I hear from on a monthly basis. I love getting feedback from people to see how their readings manifested into their lives.&#160;</p><h2>There are a few main questions I always get from clients.</h2><p>People want to know if they'll ever find love, if their family members are okay, and what their job situation looks like. I think the hardest part of reading for me is when someone comes wanting a definitive answer, when they ask questions like, \"Will I get back together with my ex?\" of \"Will I land the job?\" or \"When will COVID-19 end?\" I don't give absolute, set-in-stone answers, because we all have free will and the ability to change our situations at a moment's notice. I always say to look to the cards for guidance, not answers. My job is to present the options and explore the potential results. The best readings start with the question, \"What do I need to know about you and your current situation?\"&#160;</p><p>My ultimate goal with every reading is to make sure the client feels some sense of hope, purpose, or some clarity. The cards may not necessarily say what they want to hear, but at least they can leave with a plan or a direction.&#160;</p><p><em>Patti Woods is a tarot reader and freelance writer based in Trumbull, Connecticut.

Vaccine by fall, herd immunity, a robust recovery, markets will continue to surge, AI …&#160;</p><p>Yeah, right.&#160;</p><p>Pessimists are underappreciated, as while optimists built the first plane, pessimists suggested seat belts. Both parties have a role. Neville Chamberlain, Charles Keating, and Bobbi Brown were all likely optimists. But I digress.</p><p>So, being angry and depressed doesn't mean I'm wrong. There are good companies that are overvalued (Tesla, Snowflake), good businesses whose emissions are bad for society (Facebook, Twitter), and firms that are just a menace (Uber). There are also firms that are all three (Palantir). However, occasionally there is a firm that is so gangster even I can't help but see the glass as half empty, versus empty. The most valuable private firm in America is Airbnb.</p><p>I believe this time next year, Airbnb will be the most valuable hospitality firm in the world and one of the world's 10 strongest brands. (Note: Rankings of \"the world's best brands\" are a desperate yelp for relevance from ad agencies begging clients to buy more media and cling to the nineties, the Brand Era.) The SF platform will likely be worth more than the three largest hotel firms, combined. Why?</p><h2><strong>The biggest moat in travel</strong></h2><p>Ride hailing requires local supply (drivers) and demand (hailers). Hotels need local supply (hotel rooms) and regional demand (guests). But a global hotel brand requires both local supply and global demand, as guests are from all over the world. Airbnb has global supply, boasting more than&#160;<a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/#:~:text=Airbnb%20is%20one%20of%20the,all%20powered%20by%20local%20hosts.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seven million</a>&#160;listings worldwide — more than Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, InterContinental Hotels Group, Wyndham Hotel Group, and Hyatt Hotels, combined. More impressive, and singular, Airbnb is the only hospitality brand that has the global awareness to generate unrivaled demand.&#160;</p><p>In 2021, there will be more Airbnb&#160;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/346589/number-of-us-airbnb-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">users</a> in the US than <a href=\"https://www.opendatanetwork.com/entity/0400000US06/California/demographics.population.count?year=2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">people</a>&#160;in California.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89f3e09e9fe40019009dcb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway https://www.profgalloway.com/\" height=\"1105\" width=\"1303\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Outside of luxury, which is not relevant/affordable to 90% of travelers, there isn't a truly global brand, until now. Google searches reflect that Airbnb has eclipsed the equity of century-old brands, in one decade, across markets big and small. While competitors may have equity in a specific market, no brand sits on the iron throne across all markets as Airbnb does.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89f40a9e9fe40019009dce?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway https://www.profgalloway.com/\" height=\"1647\" width=\"1303\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This equity also bests that of airlines and online booking engines that may have global awareness (like Qantas) but only regional relevance (i.e., not an option for intracontinental travel in markets outside Australia).&#160;</p><p>So, how to value the gangster of all private gangsters? What is the benchmark and the corresponding multiple? It's clearly not a hotel business, but not a SaaS firm either. However, Airbnb is a tech firm and highly \"disruptive.\" The firm has a greater share of employees with an engineering background than Amazon or Uber.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89f423d260780019341ef6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" height=\"1407\" width=\"1304\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>How to value?</strong></h2><p>The only firms I can think of that have global demand/supply and brand equity, and an asset-light high-margin business are the credit card companies, which trade at 20+ multiples of revenue. Airbnb projects 2021 revenues of $5-6 billion, yielding a potential $100-120 billion valuation.&#160;</p><p>In 2020, in the private markets, Airbnb shares have traded at a valuation ranging between $15-30 billion. The media pegs the IPO valuation at $30 billion. Put on your seatbelts, as the bankers will have no excuse to not price the shares at the high end of a recast (higher) range, and then reward their institutional clients with a Snowflake-like flurry when it begins trading. There's something about weather and cruise analogies that becomes more appealing as you get older.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89f44e9e9fe40019009dd1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"938\" width=\"1303\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Ali versus Holmes</strong></h2><p>In 1980, 38-year-old Muhammad Ali returned to the ring to fight a 30-year-old undefeated Larry Holmes. In the pre-fight examination Ali was unable to consistently touch his finger to his nose, had difficulty coordinating the muscles used in speaking, and could not hop on one foot. Boxing pundits describe the medical clearance to fight as criminal. I'm pretty sure the physician who cleared Ali for the fight now serves on the board of Facebook.&#160;</p><p>It's difficult to identify another sector, this large, that has one player more ascendant while the rest of the industry can't touch its nose. The hospitality sector has experienced an unprecedented shock that dwarfs 9/11 or any recession. Recessions, even wars, take occupancy levels down to 60%, or even 50%. No hotel owner or management firm modeled occupancy dropping to 0%. The result is an entire industry on its heels, except for one player that's on its toes, waiting to spring forward with an information-age Super Bowl ad, the Initial Public Offering, and begin firing a howitzer of capital as other firms return fire with squirt guns.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89f4759e9fe40019009dd2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"1105\" width=\"1303\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Airbnb is also a better value than hotels, offering more space but with less COVID (no check-in, elevators, or common areas) at a <a href=\"https://www.busbud.com/blog/airbnb-vs-hotel-rates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lower</a> cost. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste, and COVID afforded the CEO the cloud cover to cut costs and refocus on the core business. In May, Airbnb laid off a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-to-cut-25-of-workforce-as-coronavirus-stalls-global-travel-11588707183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quarter</a>&#160;of its staff (1,900 employees).

Firing people, sending out d--- pics — tomato/tomahto. Chesky and cofounders relinquished their salaries, cut pay in half for executives, and slashed nearly $1 billion in marketing expenses. The firm is in fighting shape.</p><p>The reduced cost structure and market recovery mean the path to profitability has become bigger, better lit, and shorter.

Despite the echoes of \"It's different this time,\" I believe SPACs are canaries in the digital coal mine and will continue, over the medium- and long-term, to underperform the market (note: this year they have over-performed). My advice, if you want to play SPACs, is to buy a basket, as among the bastards (I'm rewatching all nine seasons of GOT with my son), a dragon will be birthed.

announced a new plan: Instead of participating in a virtual second presidential debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump would appear at a town hall at the same time as his opponent.</p><p>The move was clearly a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-skipping-the-second-debate-for-town-hall-is-mistake-2020-10\">risky one</a> for the president and his campaign, and following the publication of Nielsen television ratings by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/16/media/town-hall-ratings-biden-trump/index.html\">CNN Business,</a> it's obvious that Trump made a mistake by forgoing the second debate.&#160;</p><p>According to CNN, Biden's town hall on ABC drew in 13.9 million viewers. The Trump town hall was broadcast on three channels -- NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC -- and brought in 13 million viewers, or about 1 million fewer than Biden's. These numbers do not take into account online streams for the events, so the final number for both town is likely higher.&#160;</p><p>Before the town halls began, Trump campaign senior advisor Jason Miller predicted, \"We're gonna have a much bigger audience than Joe.\"&#160;</p><p>Miller was wrong, and there may not be enough time to turn the campaign around.</p><p>With 18 days left until election day, Trump trails Biden by 10.5 points, according to a national polling average from <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>.</p><p>Trump needed to be seen by as many potential voters as possible on Thursday night. Instead of an audience of over 60 million, the number of people who watched the <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/second-presidential-debate-of-2016-draws-66-5-million-viewers/\">second presidential debate</a> in 2016, Trump squandered the opportunity and was seen by just 13 million.</p><p>Following the first presidential debate, Biden gained 5 to 7 percentage points in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Florida, according to polling from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/upshot/polls-election-florida-pennsylvania.html\">New York Times and Siena College</a>.</p><p>While Trump can't afford a similar drop in the polls from a second debate this close to election day, now is not the time for the trailing campaign to limit its audience. For Trump to be reelected, he needs to win over any undecided voters, and quickly.</p><p>As of October 16, <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"92235dcf49c8479097fa7c34970cf487\">over 22 million people</a> have already cast their votes through mail-in and early voting in an election expected to receive the most mailed votes in US history.

minor parenting behaviors can have a serious impact.</li>\n<li>Morin says parents who invalidate their children's feelings by telling them not to cry or constantly expect them to behave perfectly can cause long-lasting emotional trauma that their children can carry well into adulthood.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more

Dangerous Man</a>,\" has some people wondering how family dysfunction affects kids. What kind of adults do they become when they've been exposed to toxic parenting behaviors?</p><p>Most people clearly recognize that serious maltreatment, like abuse or neglect, can have a lasting impact on children. But what about toxic parenting strategies that don't rise to an extreme level of abuse? Or what about destructive parenting behaviors that might be less obvious?</p><p>As a therapist, I see some families who appear to function okay to the outside world yet are riddled with dysfunctional family dynamics behind closed doors. And just because these don't constitute abuse, or because they aren't visible to anyone outside the family, doesn't mean they won't prevent kids from becoming healthy adults.</p><p>Here are 10 toxic parenting behaviors that can make children less functional in adulthood:</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">1. Shielding kids from pain</strong></h2><p>While you don't want to expose kids to pain just for the purpose of \"toughening them up,\" you also don't want to shield them from all discomfort.</p><p>Whether a parent insists the coach put their kid on the team or they say their missing cat is \"on vacation,\" kids who lack experience dealing with pain often become adults who crumble when they encounter adversity.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">2. Invalidating their feelings</strong></h2><p>Telling kids to \"stop worrying\" or \"stop crying\" sends a message that their feelings are bad. It teaches them that they need to hide their feelings or fight those emotions. They may grow up to mask their feelings or numb their pain in unhealthy ways.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">3. Praising their achievements only</strong></h2><p>When parents praise kids for getting a perfect score on a math test or the most points in the game, they teach them that their accomplishments matter more than everything else.</p><p>Kids who only hear praise for their achievements (rather than for putting in the hard work it took to get there or a willingness to be brave and try something where they may fail) may grow up to become adults who think they need to succeed at all costs. They might be more willing to lie, cheat, and steal so they can come out a winner.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">4. Living vicariously through their kids</strong></h2><p>Parents have unhealed emotional wounds, too. And it can be tempting to try and live through your kids as a way to heal those wounds.</p><p>But when a parent insists that a child try to reach their own unrealized dreams, their children are likely to grow up without a strong sense of self. They may be resentful toward their parents while also being dependent on them to help make decisions.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">5. Expecting perfection</strong></h2><p>Setting the bar high can be good for kids. It teaches them that they can do more than they think.</p><p>But expecting perfection could cause them to feel like they can't ever measure up. They may grow up to feel as though they aren't good enough because they couldn't achieve what you told them they could.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">6. Using fear to gain compliance</strong></h2><p>Whether a parent shoots kids intimidating looks or threatens to embarrass or hit them, scaring kids into complying can backfire.</p><p>They'll be more likely to make decisions based on fear instead of on what they actually believe is right. This could cause them to become an adult without a healthy moral compass.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">7. Trying to win favor with their kids</strong></h2><p>Whether parents are coparenting after they're divorced or still happily married, some parents work hard to be the \"favorite.\"</p><p>And while winning a child's favor might make a parent feel good momentarily, ultimately the kids lose in the end. They may grow up to become adults who manipulate others as a way to get what they want.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">8. Using guilt trips as a tool</strong></h2><p>Constantly reminding your child how hard you work to pay for their stuff or insisting that they'd listen better if they really loved you might guilt kids into doing what you want.</p><p>But it also means they'll be easy targets for that friend who wants to cheat off their paper or that romantic interest who wants to have sex and use similar guilt trips. Or they may turn into adults who repeat the pattern by using guilt as a weapon against their loved ones as well.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">9. 'Parentifying' their kids</strong></h2><p>Parents who lack adult confidantes or are insecure about their decision-making may depend on their kids to step up.</p><p>Giving kids more information and responsibility than they're capable of handling raises their anxiety and leaves them feeling like you aren't equipped to lead the family. Consequently, they may grow up to become anxious adults who feel as though they need to constantly control everything around them to stay safe.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">10. Being emotionally unavailable</strong></h2><p>It's cliché but it's true — kids need your presence more than presents.</p><p>Parents who are always staring at their phones or too busy and stressed out to support their kids emotionally aren't fostering their child's emotional development. Kids who grow up with emotionally unavailable parents may struggle to develop healthy, meaningful relationships in adulthood.</p><p><em>This article was originally published on Business Insider July

Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin ruled that election officials must accept ballots that are postmarked by November 2 or November 3 and arrive after Election Day only for those rulings to be overturned

2019, the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration's efforts to add a citizenship question on the census.&#160;</p><p>According to The Post, the current battle revolved are the fact that the number of representatives allotted to each state is based on the number of residents in that state, and that historically that has always meant all people living in that state, not just citizens.&#160;&#160;</p><p>In his July memorandum, Trump argued that some states would get more representation than they \"deserved\" because of undocumented immigrants.&#160;</p><p>Since the census does not ask about citizenship, it's not clear how the administration plans to assess this.&#160;</p><p>\"The Census Bureau is still evaluating the extent to which, as a practical matter, administrative records pertaining to immigration status can be used to identify and exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment population count,\" acting solicitor general Jeffrey B.

In Congress, he serves on the Committees on Armed Services, Commerce, and Transportation.</p><p>The senator has heavily focused <a href=\"https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/about/legislation\">his legislative efforts</a> on sponsoring bills addressing military and veterans' affairs and infrastructure, two key issues in Alaska. He's voted in lockstep with President Donald Trump 97% of the time since 2017, according to FiveThirtyEight.</p><p>Gross, his opponent, is running as an independent but would caucus with Democrats if elected, similarly to independent Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine.&#160;</p><p>Gross, an Alaska native and son of former Alaska Attorney General Avrum Gross, is an orthopedic surgeon, commercial fisherman, and affordable healthcare advocate.

As they continue their search, the group encounters disturbing racist threats and monstrous creatures.&#160;</p><p>Though H.P. Lovecraft, who passed away in 1937, is considered a highly influential horror writer, he is also known for racist elements in his work and bigoted opinions in his personal life. These facts did not escape showrunner Misha Green when working on the series. While the show does take some inspiration from Lovecraft's mythology, Green makes a point to address the author's troubling history on race.</p><p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/lovecraft-country-hp-lovecraft-racist-racism-misha-green-series-premiere-hbo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wrap</a>, Green followed a similar strategy used by author Matt Ruff in the book that the show is based on. Speaking to reporters during a virtual press event Green said, \"I think it was that thing that Matt was doing that I was really intrigued about, which is this idea of reclaiming it and not saying that we're going to honor all of your contributions to this genre — and there are many — but we're going to take that, we're going to acknowledge who you are as a person, as well, and we're going to move forward.\"&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"Lovecraft Country\" currently holds an \"87% Fresh\" rating on review aggregation website <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/lovecraft_country/s01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, as well as a score of 79/100 on <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/lovecraft-country/season-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metacritic</a>.&#160;</p><p><em>Updated on 10/16/2020 by Steven Cohen: We've revised this article to remind viewers that the season one finale airs on October 18.</em></p><h2>How to watch 'Lovecraft Country'</h2><p>To watch \"Lovecraft Country\" you'll need access to the HBO cable channel or HBO Max streaming service.

And you can't always predict when history is gonna take place.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> That's Pete Souza, former White House photographer to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> I think it's important for history. I think it's important to have these moments behind the scenes, where you get a real good sense of not only what he was like as a president, but what he was like as a human being.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Pete was behind the camera for iconic Obama-era moments like this and this.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> The photographs can show emotion and context and mood in a way that words can't. The still image is something that is just seared in your brain.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> After documenting the lives of two sitting presidents, Pete Souza knows better than most what it takes to be a White House photographer.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> I started out working for newspapers in Kansas and Chicago. In 1983, the White House photo editor at the time reached out to me about a position at the White House. So that's what led to the job at the Reagan White House.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> After photographing the Reagan administration, Pete worked for National Geographic and as the national photographer for the Chicago Tribune. In 2004, when Barack Obama was elected senator of Illinois, Pete took an assignment to follow and photograph the up-and-coming senator.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> That led to some, you know, real good access with Sen. Obama. I ended up going to five different countries with him. So I got to know him pretty well professionally. And so when he was elected to the presidency, he asked me to become his chief photographer. I don't think my political views play into it at all. I mean, look, I worked for a Republican and Democrat. This job is about documenting the presidency for history. All this other stuff just doesn't really matter.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Pete photographed Reagan and Obama during all eight years of both administrations.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> Well, I think that was the most difficult part of the job for me. It was just, it was physically and mentally exhausting, to essentially put your personal life on hold for eight years.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Just as he did with Reagan, Pete often followed Obama seven days a week.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> Well, I mean, I was with him, like, every day.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> It was because Pete didn't leave Obama's side that he was able to capture this historic moment.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> This is during the bin Laden raid. They're monitoring it as it happens. So we were all jammed into this room for 40 minutes. You've got the most powerful people of the executive branch, and they're essentially helpless. And I think you can feel the tension in that room just by looking at their faces. As the meeting's breaking up at night, they know they have bin Laden, and it was just, like, such a subtle reaction to a momentous event in many ways. I don't know that I knew how widely circulated this photograph would become, but I certainly knew this would be a historic day. I think without the trust, you can't get the access. It's as simple as that. I think he did trust me. I think the people around him trusted me. And I think if not for that, there's no way I would have had the access to some of the things that I did.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Pete's intimate access allowed him to capture some of the most poignant moments of the administration.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> The most difficult times to photograph him were when he was consoling families that had been affected by some tragedy. And oftentimes the emotions were so raw.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Pete says neither he nor the president ever got used to facing such tragedies.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> When I would get to the photographs from Newtown, I would break down, 'cause it's still emotional thinking about that day and thinking about the circumstances of that day.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> But not all the moments he captured were tough ones.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> I think the picture resonates for a couple reasons. One, you got, you know, a 5- or 6-year-old African American kid touching the head of the president of the United States that looks like him. But at the same time, I think it tells you something about Barack Obama, that at the behest of this young kid, you'd go ahead and bend over and let the kid touch your head like that. I don't think that would happen today. You know, one thing that I don't know that the photographs showed necessarily was his sense of humor and his competitiveness. Although I think I actually do a pretty good job in showing those.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Here's a photo where Pete did catch his competitive spirit.</p><p><strong>Pete:</strong> Reggie Love, who was 20 years younger than him, was four inches taller than him, captain of the Duke University basketball team. And here's Barack Obama, who didn't even start for his high-school basketball team. When they finished the game, President Obama starts walking towards me, sweat's dripping down his face, and he just comes up to me. He goes, \"Did you get that block?\" [laughs] 'Cause he was so proud of the fact that he had blocked Reggie. You know, look, I'm not the best photographer in the world. I'll be the first to admit that. But I do think that I was the right photographer to be the chief photographer for Barack Obama. It's one of those jobs that it's not like you apply for the job. They come looking for you. It's a hard job to aspire to do. Just so much of it involves luck. I do tell photographers around the country, photograph your mayor, your governor, because you never know if they, maybe they'll end up becoming a national politician someday. 50, 100 years from now, people will be able to go through all of my photographs and get a real sense of what it was like to be in this moment. What he was like as a person, you know, as seen through my eyes and my photographs. And I think that's the most lasting impact.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-it-takes-to-be-a-white-house-photographer-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/co4XnjYU1To\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 19:07:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f88b94ad260780019341b81?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"513b5a25b13660724494a8b7a4f86086","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn90@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-13-810_e89f6c3958434375.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":768,"sourceBytes":80862,"destBytes":80862,"author":"insider@insider.com (Abby Narishkin,Clayton Dyer)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-26-160_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn83@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-27-668_f26522d0e0de34fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-21-432_c79b217ca864bde6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-21-755_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=co4XnjYU1To:a6cRhvL7U30:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn96@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-24-182_515ec5950cb4811f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/co4XnjYU1To":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-23-060_e4bfc29148b12fcd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901799716},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:59","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:59","title":"Republican lawmaker is symptom-free after attending a concert in Montana that was linked to several coronavirus cases","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/montana-lawmaker-attended-concert-linked-to-a-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89efd8d260780019341edf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"greg gianforte\" height=\"1720\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rep.

You want a box your cat can use \"without having to do any tricks,\" said Dr. Moore. And even though they are convenient, she recommended avoiding self-cleaning boxes because the noises they make can frighten cats. At HSSV, they recommend just using a simple uncovered litter box, said Farel-Friedman.
