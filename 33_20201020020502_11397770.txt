Reflecting on his experience and the how the current President comports himself while in office, Souza published two books: <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780316512589\">Obama: An Intimate Portrait</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780316458214\">Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents</a>. Those books form the basis for a documentary directed by <a href=\"https://www.trilogy-films.com/dawn-porter\">Dawn Porter</a> on Souza and his work called The Way I See It.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Based on the New York Times #1 bestseller comes The Way I See It, an unprecedented look behind the scenes of two of the most iconic Presidents in American History, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, as seen through the eyes of renowned photographer Pete Souza. As Official White House Photographer, Souza was an eyewitness to the unique and tremendous responsibilities of being the most powerful person on Earth. The movie reveals how Souza transforms from a respected photojournalist to a searing commentator on the issues we face as a country and a people.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I didn’t know that Trump’s presidency is not really getting recorded photographically as past presidencies have, but I’m not surprised.</p> \n<p>The film was shown on MSNBS the other day…I don’t know if they’re rerunning it or what. It’s also out in theaters but with many of those still closed, I assume it’ll be out on streaming at some point soonish?</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Dawn%20Porter\">Dawn Porter</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Pete%20Souza\">Pete Souza</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Way%20I%20See%20It\">The Way I See It</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 20:14:41 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"459e76ea1e4b94758e3af38a8694ecf3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159478059},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:38","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:38","title":"Huge Butterfly Murals","link":"https://kottke.org/20/10/huge-butterfly-murals","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/mantra-butterflies-01.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Building-sized mural of butterflies\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/mantra-butterflies-02.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Building-sized mural of butterflies\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/mantra-butterflies-03.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Building-sized mural of butterflies\" /></p> \n<p>I love these building-sized murals featuring butterflies by French street artist <a href=\"http://mantrarea.com/\">Mantra</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mantrarea/\">Instagram</a>). From <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/10/mantra-murals-butterflies/\">a Colossal post</a> about the artist:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>In a conversation with Colossal, Mantra said he’s harbored a lifelong fascination with entomology that stems from spending hours in French gardens and bucolic areas as a kid. “As a child, I was interested, curious, and focused on the small life forms in those places,” he says. His current practice hearkens back to those carefree hours and connects with an adolescent desire to become a naturalist. “My approach is as a scientist,” the artist says, noting that education about environmental care and issues is part of the goal.</p> \n <p>Although Mantra considers all insects and natural life beautiful and crucial to maintaining biodiversity, the focus on butterflies revolves around his artistic ambitions because the vivid creatures allow him to experiment with color, shape, and texture. Each specimen is rendered freehand before the artist adds detail and the illusory shadows that make them appear three-dimensional. By painting various Lepidoptera species again and again, the artist is “repeating a mantra,” a detail of his practice that informs the moniker he works under.</p>\n</blockquote>
