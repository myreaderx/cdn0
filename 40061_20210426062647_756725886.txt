First, the scope of the Journal has been expanded to include the petrology and cosmochemistry of <strong>planetary materials</strong>. In this new area of interest we are welcoming submissions that include the major element, trace element and isotope cosmochemistry applied to petrogenesis and conditions of formation; experimental petrology addressing the genesis of planetary materials; and the petrology, origin, and evolution of rocky planetary bodies, using meteorites or samples from past and current return missions in our Solar System. We welcome Takashi Mikouchi from the University of Tokyo to the Editorial Board as our new Associate Editor, who will handle papers in this exciting area of research.</span>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":40061,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"db4fa2ad6adb9c8a7f50df3706a48c6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Zellmer G.
