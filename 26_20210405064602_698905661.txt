It’s broadly based on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/\">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/newsletters\">here</a>. </em></p>\n<p>Happy Saturday, everyone. I do hope that you are in good spirits and in good health. I am learning to nap, something that has become a requirement in my life after I realized that the news cycle is never going to slow down. And because my partner and I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1378035858264166400\">adopted a third dog</a> who likes to get up early, please join me in making napping cool for adults, so that we can all rest up for Vaccine Summer. It’s nearly here.</p>\n<p>On work topics, I have a few things for you today, all concerning data points that matter: Q1 2021 M&#38;A data, March VC results from Africa, and some surprising (to me, at least) podcast numbers.</p>\n<p>On the first, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danprimack\">Dan Primack</a> shared a few early first-quarter data points <a href=\"https://www.refinitiv.com/en\">via Refinitiv</a> that I wanted to pass along. Per the financial data firm, global M&#38;A activity hit $1.3 trillion in Q1 2021, up 93% from Q1 2020. U.S. M&#38;A activity reached an all-time high in the first quarter, as well. Why do we care? Because the data helps underscore just how hot the last three months have been.</p>\n<p>I’m expecting venture capital data itself for the quarter to be similarly impressive. But as everyone is noting this week, there are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/\">some cracks</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/\">appearing</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/\">in the IPO market</a>, as the second quarter begins that could make Q2 2021 a very different beast. Not that the venture capital world will slow, especially given that Tiger <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/\">just reloaded</a> to the tune of $6.7 billion.</p>\n<p>On the venture capital topic, African-focused data firm <a href=\"https://briterbridges.com/\">Briter Bridges</a> reports that “March alone saw over $280 million being deployed into tech companies operating across Africa,” driven in part by “Flutterwave’s whopping $170 million round at a $1 billion valuation.”</p>\n<p>The data point matters as it marks the most active March that the African continent has seen in venture capital terms since at least 2017 &#8212; and I would guess ever. African startups tend to raise more capital in the second half of the year, so the March result is not an all-time record for a single month. But it’s bullish all the same, and helps feed our general sentiment that the first quarter’s venture capital results could be big.</p>\n<p>And finally, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury\">Index Ventures’ Rex Woodbury</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1378001533741064193\">tweeted</a> some Edison data, namely that “80 million Americans (28% of the U.S. 12+ population) are weekly podcast listeners, +17% year-over-year.” The venture capitalist went on to add that “62% of the U.S. 12+ population (around 176 million people) are weekly online audio listeners.”</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/clubhouse-will-create-billions-in-value-and-capture-none-of-it/\">discussed on Equity</a> this week, the non-music, streaming audio market is being bet on by a host of players in light of Clubhouse’s success as a breakout consumer social company in recent months. Undergirding the bets by Discord and Spotify and others are those data points. People love to listen to other humans talk. Far more than I would have imagined, as a music-first person.</p>\n<p>How nice it is to be back in a time when consumer investing is neat. B2B is great but not everything can be enterprise SaaS. (Notably, however, it does appear that Clubhouse is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1377332954007957508\">struggling to hold onto its own hype</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fHsl6pLZcV\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/private-equity-a-spac-and-an-ipo-walk-into-a-bar/\">Private equity, a SPAC and an IPO walk into a bar</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Private equity, a SPAC and an IPO walk into a bar&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/private-equity-a-spac-and-an-ipo-walk-into-a-bar/embed/#?secret=fHsl6pLZcV\" data-secret=\"fHsl6pLZcV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Look I can’t keep up with all the damn venture capital rounds</h2>\n<p>TechCrunch Early Stage was this week, which went rather well. But having an event to help put on did mean that I covered fewer rounds this week than I would have liked. So, here are two that I would have typed up if I had had the spare hours:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.striim.com/\">Striim’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.striim.com/press/50m-series-c-funding-goldman-sachs-growth-equity/\">$50 million Series C</a>. Goldman led the transaction. Striim, pronounced stream I believe, is a software startup that helps other companies move data around their cloud and on-prem setups in real time. Given how active the data market is today, I presume that the TAM for Striim is deep? Quickly flowing? You can supply a better stream-centered word at your leisure.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://kudoway.com/\">Kudo’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/multilingual_video_conference_platform_kudo_closes_21m_in_an_oversubscribed_series_a_funding_to_support_talent_acquisition_and_more/prweb17829894.htm\">$21 million Series A</a>. I covered Kudo last July <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/kudo-raises-6m-for-its-real-time-translation-and-video-conference-platform/\">when it raised $6 million</a>. The company provides video-chat and conferencing services with support for  real-time translation. It had a good COVID-era, as you can imagine. Felicis led the A after taking part in the seed round. I’ll see if I can extract some fresh growth metrics from the company next week. One to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And two more rounds that you also might have missed that you should not. Holler <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/holler-series-b/\">raised $36 million in a Series B</a>. Per our own Anthony Ha, “[y]ou may not know what conversational media is, but there’s a decent chance you’ve used Holler’s technology. For example, if you’ve added a sticker or a GIF to your Venmo payments, Holler actually manages the app’s search and suggestion experience around that media.”</p>\n<p>I feel old.</p>\n<p>And in case you are not paying enough attention to Latin American tech, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/\">this $150 million Uruguayan round</a> should help set you straight.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oJ2LHAI804\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/\">Is Substack really worth $650M?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Is Substack really worth $650M?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/embed/#?secret=oJ2LHAI804\" data-secret=\"oJ2LHAI804\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Various and sundry</h2>\n<p>Finally this week, some good news. If you’ve read The Exchange for any length of time, you’ve been forced to read me prattling on about the <a href=\"https://cloudindex.bvp.com/\">Bessemer cloud index</a>, a basket of public software companies that I treat with oracular respect. Now there’s a new index on the market.</p>\n<p>Meet the <a href=\"https://www.luxhealthtechindex.com/\">Lux Health + Tech Index</a>. Per Lux Capital, it’s an “index of 57 publicly traded companies that together best represent the rapidly emerging Health + Tech investment theme.” Sure, this is branded to the extent that, akin to the Bessemer collection, it is tied to a particular focus of the backing venture capital firm. But what the new Lux index will do, as with the Bessemer collection, is track how a particular venture firm is itself tracking the public comps for their portfolio.</p>\n<p>That’s a useful thing to have. More of this, please.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex\">Alex</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mYLmr7UoY78\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 03 Apr 2021 20:00:44 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"8385a4a6ed167ed3d892d952c5f7d67f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-45-34-253_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-45-34-253_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn91@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-45-53-682_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-53-160_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn56@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-45-55-395_0a66d757a5dffe87.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mYLmr7UoY78:uGKZAoTBx48:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-53-255_66eee59d3cb00356.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-45-53-940_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mYLmr7UoY78":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn63@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-45-53-387_f96c9695fd07807f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605119098},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:19","title":"Amazon addresses pee bottle denial tweet","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2133811","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Amazon kicked off the holiday weekend by <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan\">backtracking slightly</a> on a social media offensive that unfolded in the waning days of a historic unionization vote.

The Adjust SDK was one that didn&#8217;t yet comply with Apple&#8217;s new App Tracking Transparency guidelines, causing apps that included the SDK to be rejected. That could have been a large number of possible rejections, as Adjust&#8217;s website claims it&#8217;s trusted by more than 50,000 apps. But <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/04/01/apple-rejecting-apps-with-fingerprinting-enabled-as-ios-14-privacy-enforcement-starts/?sh=36ed1ce13d19\">Adjust soon updated its SDK</a> (open-sourced and <a href=\"https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk/commit/8790a5300d00a11b8f51c7cc66c94165ac656f8c\">here</a> on GitHub), to hopefully re-enable app updates for its customers.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Per a number of developers, Apple has begun rejecting app updates that include the Adjust SDK related to its collection of data used for device fingerprinting.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Eric Seufert (@eric_seufert) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eric_seufert/status/1377596078179123202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) changes have thrown a whole industry into disarray as companies scramble to comply and diversify their revenues. Snap, however, was found to be looking into alternative ways to bypass ATT by gathering data like IP addresses from companies that analyze ad campaigns to see if it could then cross-reference that data with its own, in order to continue tracking its users. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd724838-d37f-4894-b986-e4675482161e?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6\">Snap told the Financial Times</a> it had tested the technique, called probabilistic matching, to test the impact of Apple&#8217;s policies, but claimed it intended to discontinue the program after Apple introduced its changes. (Sure Jan!) The company says it believes that tracking individual users will no longer be allowed going forward, but gathering data on &#8220;cohorts&#8221; would be. On Thursday, Apple sent letters to developers warning them to remove code that supported probabilistic matching, just in case.</p>\n<h3>WWDC 2021 announced</h3>\n<p><strong>WWDC will again be virtual,</strong> Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=t5jm3yaz\">announced</a> this week.

Last week, it had been unclear why the AZ Senate skipped the vote on the bill, which had been passed by the AZ House. But <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying\">according to the bill&#8217;s (HB2005) backer</a>, Rep. Regina Cobb, speaking to The Verge, the decision was due to heavy lobbying by Apple and Google, which caused Senate members who had agreed to a vote to waiver. When the votes weren&#8217;t there, the Senate decided to skip bringing it up altogether.</p>\n<p>Cobb, in an email to TechCrunch, confirmed the same. &#8220;We have been working with members on the committee and had the votes a few days prior,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just before the committee was set to proceed, the Chairman notified the lobbyist for App Fairness that the votes were not there so he did not want to waste committee time on the issue.&#8221;</p>\n<h1>Weekly News</h1>\n<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4f1.png\" alt=\"📱\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <strong>Apple <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/31/apple-releases-ios-14-5-beta-6-to-developers-public-release-nears/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29\">released</a> the iOS 14.5 beta 6 to developers, which includes one major change: the release of new Siri voices</strong>.

devices, smart homes, robotics, AI and B2B solutions, and platforms and services.</p>\n<p>The South Korean firm said in a <a href=\"http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/\">statement</a> that its board of directors approved the decision today. The unsurprising move follows the company&#8217;s statement from January when it said it was reviewing the direction of its smartphone business.</p>\n<p>LG, which maintained No. 3 spot in the smartphone market in the U.S. for a long time, said it will continue to sell handsets until the inventory lasts, and will provide software support for existing lineup of smartphones for a certain period of time that would vary by region.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2133874\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2133874\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2133874 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"905\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2133874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">LG&#8217;s smartphone market share over the years.(Counterpoint Research)</p></div></p>\n<p>The company said the status of its employees of phone business will be determined at the local level. In January, reports emerged that said LG was looking to sell its smartphone business. In the same month, the company said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/rollables-are-the-new-foldables/\">launch a rollable phone this year</a>. But it appears all the efforts to keep the business stay afloat failed.</p>\n<p>“Moving forward, LG will continue to leverage its mobile expertise and develop mobility-related technologies such as 6G to help further strengthen competitiveness in other business areas. Core technologies developed during the two decades of LG’s mobile business operations will also be retained and applied to existing and future products,” it said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The poor financial performance of LG’s smartphone business has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/lg-mobile-still-losing-money/\">public information for several years</a>. Like countless other Android smartphone vendors, LG has struggled to turn things around.</p>\n<p>LG focused on mid-range and high-end smartphones, two segments of the market that have become increasingly competitive in the past decade thanks to the rise of Chinese phonemakers such as Huawei, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo and Vivo that are launching better value-for-money models every few months. (Once a rival, HTC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/htc-had-a-terrible-2019/\">has been struggling</a>, too.)</p>\n<p>Several phonemakers today rely heavily on software services such as mobile payments to make money.

By June, Jamaica became one of the first countries to open its borders.</p>\n<p>Tourism represents about <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/05/27/na052720-jamaica-ramps-up-social-and-economic-support-in-covid-19-response\">one-fifth of Jamaica&#8217;s economy</a>. In 2019 alone, four million travelers visited Jamaica, bringing thousands of jobs to its three million residents. But as COVID-19 stretched into the summer, Jamaica&#8217;s economy was in free fall, and tourism was its only way back — even if that meant <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/after-beating-back-the-coronavirus-jamaica-prioritizes-tourism-over-public-health\">at the expense of public health</a>.</p>\n<p>The Jamaican government contracted with Amber Group, a technology company headquartered in Kingston, to build a border entry system allowing residents and travelers back onto the island. The system was named JamCOVID and was rolled out as an app and a website to allow visitors to get screened before they arrive. To cross the border, travelers had to upload a negative COVID-19 test result to JamCOVID before boarding their flight from high-risk countries, including the United States.</p>\n<p>Amber Group&#8217;s CEO Dushyant Savadia boasted that his company developed JamCOVID in <a href=\"https://www.bvibeacon.com/ceo-explains-quarantine-tracking-tech/\">&#8220;three days&#8221;</a> and that it effectively donated the system to the Jamaican government, which in turn pays Amber Group for additional features and customizations. The rollout appeared to be a success, and Amber Group later secured contracts to roll out its border entry system to at least four other Caribbean islands.</p>\n<p>But last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/\">TechCrunch revealed</a> that JamCOVID exposed immigration documents, passport numbers, and COVID-19 lab test results on close to half a million travelers — including many Americans — who visited the island over the past year. Amber Group had set the access to the JamCOVID cloud server to public, allowing anyone to access its data from their web browser.</p>\n<p>Whether the data exposure was caused by human error or negligence, it was an embarrassing mistake for a technology company — and, by extension, the Jamaican government — to make.</p>\n<p>And that might have been the end of it. Instead, the government&#8217;s response became the story.</p>\n<h2>A trio of security lapses</h2>\n<p>By the end of the first wave of coronavirus, contact tracing apps were still <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/apple-google-coronavirus-tracing/\">in their infancy</a> and few governments had plans in place to screen travelers as they arrived at their borders. It was a scramble for governments to build or acquire technology to understand the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>Jamaica was one of a handful of countries using <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/jamaica-reopen-covid-visit-precaution\">location data</a> to monitor travelers, prompting rights groups to <a href=\"https://jamaicansforjustice.org/jfj-geofence-enquiry/\">raise concerns</a> about privacy and data protection.</p>\n<p>As part of an investigation into a broad range of these COVID-19 apps and services, TechCrunch found that JamCOVID was storing data on an exposed, passwordless server.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3vrBSrlZIY\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/\">Jamaica&#8217;s immigration website exposed thousands of travelers&#8217; data</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Jamaica&#8217;s immigration website exposed thousands of travelers&#8217; data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/embed/#?secret=3vrBSrlZIY\" data-secret=\"3vrBSrlZIY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>This wasn’t the first time TechCrunch found <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/coronavirus-albion-security-flaws-app/\">security flaws</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/labcorp-website-bug-medical-data-exposed/\">exposed data</a> through our reporting. It also was not the first pandemic-related security scare. Israeli spyware maker NSO Group left <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/nso-fleming-data-location/\">real location data</a> on an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/nso-group-fleming-contact-tracing/\">unprotected server</a> that it used for demonstrating its new contact tracing system. Norway was one of the first countries with a contact tracing app, but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/norway-pulls-its-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-app-after-privacy-watchdogs-warning/\">pulled it</a> after the country&#8217;s privacy authority found the continuous tracking of citizens&#8217; location was a privacy risk.</p>\n<p>Just as we have with any other story, we contacted who we thought was the server&#8217;s owner. We alerted Jamaica&#8217;s Ministry of Health to the data exposure on the weekend of February 13. But after <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20489174-email-to-jamaica-ministry-of-health\">we provided specific details</a> of the exposure to ministry spokesperson Stephen Davidson, we did not hear back. Two days later, the data was still exposed.</p>\n<p>After we spoke to two American travelers whose data was spilling from the server, we narrowed down the owner of the server to Amber Group. We contacted its chief executive Savadia on February 16, who acknowledged the email but did not comment, and the server was secured about an hour later.</p>\n<p>We ran our story that afternoon. After we published, the Jamaican government <a href=\"https://jis.gov.jm/jamcovid-security-protocols-strengthened/\">issued a statement</a> claiming the lapse was &#8220;discovered on February 16&#8221; and was &#8220;immediately rectified,&#8221; neither of which were true.</p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right\" >\n\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\tGot a tip?

The government said it had contacted its overseas law enforcement partners.</p>\n<p>When reached, a spokesperson for the FBI declined to say whether the Jamaican government had contacted the agency.</p>\n<p>Things didn&#8217;t get much better for JamCOVID. In the days that followed the first story, the government engaged a cloud consultant, Escala 24&#215;7, to assess JamCOVID&#8217;s security. The results were not disclosed, but the company said it <a href=\"https://nationwideradiojm.com/prominent-cyber-security-firm-says-theres-no-current-vulnerability-in-jam-covid-app/\">was confident</a> there was &#8220;no current vulnerability&#8221; in JamCOVID. Amber Group also said that the lapse was a &#8220;completely isolated occurrence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A week went by and TechCrunch alerted Amber Group to two more security lapses. After the attention from the first report, a security researcher who saw the news of the first lapse found <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/jamaica-amber-group-jamcovid-security-lapse/\">exposed private keys and passwords</a> for JamCOVID&#8217;s servers and databases hidden on its website, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/amber-group-jamcovid-data-exposed/\">a third lapse</a> that spilled quarantine orders for more than half a million travelers.</p>\n<p>Amber Group and the government <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/front-page/amber-sees-red-jamcovid-developer-eyes-defamation-action-as-controversy-swirls_215623?profile=1373\">claimed it faced</a> &#8220;cyberattacks, hacking and mischievous players.&#8221; In reality, the app was just not that secure.</p>\n<h2>Politically inconvenient</h2>\n<p>The security lapses come at a politically inconvenient time for the Jamaican government, as it attempts to launch a national identification system, or NIDS, for the second time. NIDS will store biographic data on Jamaican nationals, including their biometrics, such as their fingerprints.</p>\n<p>The repeat effort comes two years after the government&#8217;s first law was <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=24c65ab3-7105-49ee-8907-59639c7df631\">struck down</a> by Jamaica&#8217;s High Court as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Critics have cited the JamCOVID security lapses as a reason to drop the proposed national database. A coalition of privacy and rights groups <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-response-jamaica-digital-id-bill/\">cited the recent issues with JamCOVID </a>for why a national database is &#8220;potentially dangerous for Jamaicans’ privacy and security.&#8221; A spokesperson for Jamaica&#8217;s opposition party <a href=\"https://www.loopjamaica.com/content/jcans-may-hesitate-sign-nids-after-jamcovid-breach-graham\">told local media</a> that there &#8220;wasn’t much confidence in NIDS in the first place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been more than a month since we published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/\">the first story</a> and there are many unanswered questions, including how Amber Group secured the contract to build and run JamCOVID, how the cloud server became exposed, and if security testing was conducted before its launch.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch emailed both the Jamaican prime minister&#8217;s office and Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica&#8217;s Ministry of National Security, to ask how much, if anything, the government donated or paid to Amber Group to run JamCOVID and what security requirements, if any, were agreed upon for JamCOVID. We did not get a response.</p>\n<p>Amber Group also has not said how much it has earned from its government contracts. Amber Group&#8217;s Savadia <a href=\"http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech\">declined to disclose</a> the value of the contracts to one local newspaper.

Prime Minister Andrew Holness said at a press conference that the public &#8220;should know&#8221; about government contracts but <a href=\"http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210302/pm-public-should-see-commish-contracts\">warned &#8220;legal hurdles&#8221;</a> may prevent disclosure, such as for national security reasons or when &#8220;sensitive trade and commercial information&#8221; might be disclosed.</p>\n<p>That came days after local newspaper The Jamaica Gleaner had a <a href=\"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210228/access-denied-transparency-advocates-surprised-states-refusal-disclose\">request to obtain</a> contracts revealing the salaries state officials denied by the government under a legal clause that prevents the disclosure of an individual&#8217;s private affairs. Critics argue that taxpayers have a right to know how much government officials are paid from public funds.</p>\n<p>Jamaica&#8217;s opposition party also asked what was done to notify victims.</p>\n<p>Government minister Samuda initially downplayed the security lapse, claiming <a href=\"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210222/another-alleged-jamcovid-security-flaw-uncovered\">just 700 people</a> were affected. We scoured social media for proof but found nothing. To date, we&#8217;ve found no evidence that the Jamaican government ever informed travelers of the security incident — either the hundreds of thousands of affected travelers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/\">whose information was exposed</a>, or the 700 people that the government <a href=\"http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210222/another-alleged-jamcovid-security-flaw-uncovered\">claimed it notified</a> but has not publicly released.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch emailed the minister to request a copy of the notice that the government allegedly sent to victims, but we did not receive a response. We also asked Amber Group and Jamaica&#8217;s prime minister&#8217;s office for comment. We did not hear back.</p>\n<p>Many of the victims of the security lapse are from the United States. Neither of the two Americans we spoke to in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/\">our first report</a> were notified of the breach.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for the attorneys general of New York and Florida, whose residents&#8217; information <a href=\"https://opm.gov.jm/speech/remarks-by-the-most-honourable-andrew-holness-on-mp-prime-minister-in-parliament-on-july-28-2020/\">was exposed</a>, told TechCrunch that they had not heard from either the Jamaican government or the contractor, despite state laws requiring data breaches to be disclosed.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Qe4sQMQ5WY\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/amber-group-jamcovid-data-exposed/\">Jamaica&#8217;s JamCOVID pulled offline after third security lapse exposed travelers&#8217; data</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Jamaica&#8217;s JamCOVID pulled offline after third security lapse exposed travelers&#8217; data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/amber-group-jamcovid-data-exposed/embed/#?secret=Qe4sQMQ5WY\" data-secret=\"Qe4sQMQ5WY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The reopening of Jamaica&#8217;s borders came at a cost. The island saw <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/after-beating-back-the-coronavirus-jamaica-prioritizes-tourism-over-public-health\">over a hundred new cases</a> of COVID-19 in the month that followed, the majority arriving from the United States. From June to August, the number of new coronavirus cases went from tens to dozens to hundreds each day.</p>\n<p>To date, Jamaica has reported over 39,500 cases and 600 deaths caused by the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Holness reflected on the decision to reopen its borders last month in parliament to announce <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20537859-jamaica-budget-2021\">the country&#8217;s annual budget</a>. He said the country&#8217;s economic decline last was &#8220;driven by a massive 70% contraction in our tourist industry.&#8221; More than 525,000 travelers — both residents and tourists — have arrived in Jamaica since the borders opened, Holness said, a figure slightly more than the number of travelers&#8217; records found on the exposed JamCOVID server in February.</p>\n<p>Holness defended reopening the country&#8217;s borders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Had we not done this the fall out in tourism revenues would have been 100% instead of 75%, there would be no recovery in employment, our balance of payment deficit would have worsened, overall government revenues would have been threatened, and there would be no argument to be made about spending more,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Both the Jamaican government and Amber Group benefited from opening the country&#8217;s borders.

I urged founders to think less about how to bundle and unbundle lecture experience, and more about how to replace outdated systems and methods with new, tech-powered solutions. In other words, don’t simply put engaging content on a screen, but innovate on what that screen looks like, tracks and offers.</p> \n<p>A few months into 2021, the exit environment in edtech…feels like it’s doing exactly that. The same startups that hit billion and multi-billion valuations during the pandemic are scooping up new talent to broaden their service offerings.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rubenharris\">Ruben Harris</a>, the founder of <a href=\"https://careerkarma.com/\">Career Karma</a>, a platform that matches aspiring coding professionals to bootcamps, put together a massive report recently with his team to talk about <a href=\"https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/\">the pandemic’s impact on the bootcamp market.</a></p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>James Gallagher, the author of <a href=\"https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/\">the report</a>, tells me:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>It is important to note that the full potential of bootcamps has not yet been realised. We are now seeing more exploration of niches like technology sales which provide gateways into new careers in tech for people who otherwise may not have been able to acquire training. To scale such models, new businesses will need venture capital.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>He went on to explain how a notable acquisition from 2020 was K12 scooping up Galvanize, “which would give K12 exposure into corporate training and the coding bootcamp space, a market outside of K12’s focus at the moment.”</p> \n<p>To me this report signal two things: the financial interest in boot camps isn’t simply stemming from other bootcamps (although that is happening), but it’s surprising partnerships. Leaving this subsector, we see creative acquisitions such as a Roblox for edtech buying a language learning tool, and a startup known for flashcards scooping up a tech tutoring service.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/ \">How is edtech spending its extra capital</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-us-based-reading-platform-epic/\">Byju’s in talks to acquire US-based reading platform, Epic </a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2133580/ https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/\">The tech-powered wave of smart, not slow, tutoring sessions </a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Readers should know by this point that I love a nonobvious acquisition (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok/\">except when this almost happened</a>), so if you have any more tips on coming deals in edtech, please Signal me or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmasc_\">direct message me on Twitter. </a></p> \n<p>I’ll end with this: Successful startup founders are innately ambitious, finding opportunity in moonshots and convincing others that the odds are in their favor. However, the ceiling for what defines ambition heightens almost everyday.

That’s so pre-pandemic. A number of companies recently announced plans to build their own versions of Clubhouse, after the buzzy app unearthed the consumer love for audio.</p> \n<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> It might be easier to start guessing who isn’t building a Clubhouse clone at this point. Our predictions are already starting, but jokes aside, the rise in clones could mean that Clubhouse might have to make a run for its pre-monetized money (cough, cough, Twitter spaces). It doesn’t matter if a startup is first in unlocking a key insight, all that matters is who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/clubhouse-will-create-billions-in-value-and-capture-none-of-it/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">executes that key insight the best. </a></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/\">Facebook’s Clubhouse rival looks a lot like Clubhouse right now</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/ \">Discord is launching new Clubhouse-like channels for audio events </a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/\">LinkedIn confirms it’s working on a Clubhouse rival, too</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swell-voice-launch/ \">Swell launches its app for asynchronous voice conversations </a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/\">Slack wants to be more than a text-based messaging platform </a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/\">Twitter Spaces arrives on Android ahead of Clubhouse</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/\">Spotify is getting into live audio because of course it is</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera/status/1378037816001716231\">Career Karma built audio rooms</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/chinas-clubhouse-clones\">China’s Clubhouse clones </a>via Protocol</li> \n</ul> \n<p>\n <div id=\"attachment_1918154\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n  <img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1918154\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-1918154\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/audio-mixcloud.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" />\n  <p id=\"caption-attachment-1918154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p>\n </div></p> \n<h2><strong>A strong unicorn, literally</strong></h2> \n<p>Tonal, a fitness tech startup, became a unicorn this week <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/strength-training-startup-tonal-crosses-unicorn-status-after-raising-250m/\">after raising a new tranche of capital. </a></p> \n<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The new status underscores market growth for at-home fitness solutions.
