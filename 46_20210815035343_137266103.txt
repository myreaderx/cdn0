Its opening tutorial is exactly the kind of skill cliff I've rejected a hundred games for in the past. You control a little forklift truck, and are asked to do forklifty things. Lifting. Moving. Uh... forking. But the first thing you're asked is one of the fiddliest things in the game, as you have to slide your prongs inside a pallet at exactly the right position to lift it from another forklift, which of course means you'll spend ten minutes bashing prongs (pronggg) together at the last second and deliberately dropping the barrels in the hope that they explode.</p>\n<p>They do not. But they do flip out now and then, and you have to start the whole job again. I should hate this.

It&rsquo;s not just a place where players can gather, but it completes all the planetary landing zone&rsquo;s for the game&rsquo;s sole solar system. So that's one whole system built, though it's obviously not complete. It never is. They promised over 100 systems at launch, and the Stanton system has taken eight years to craft. Slow and steady wins the space race. \n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizens-cloud-city-is-the-final-port-of-call-for-the-games-single-solar-system\">Read more</a></p><div

At first glance, it would seem the folks participating in the Apex hack were the good guys who only turned to hacking to trying to raise awareness of their troubles. Nope. It turns out the very same group behind the Apex attack are allegedly the cause of Titanfall's issues too, and it's apparently all part of a messy plot to revive the cancelled spin-off, Titanfall

Here's why this monitor is worth the pennies and pounds!</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lgs-phenomenal-27gl850-monitor-is-back-down-to-299\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=Q_BNHgGI0ho:22snFZ-Yl0M:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=Q_BNHgGI0ho:22snFZ-Yl0M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/Q_BNHgGI0ho\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 21:06:17 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/lg-27gl850-monitor.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/lg-27gl850-monitor.jpg","linkMd5":"d046061490e2bd74f75d6dcbcedf27f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-25-175_1133e482e0f0201e.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":103388,"destBytes":68264,"author":"Will Judd","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/lg-27gl850-monitor.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/lg-27gl850-monitor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-25-175_1133e482e0f0201e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/Q_BNHgGI0ho":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn24@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-29-306_95c3f11cd0dc8a7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592696},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT review","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review.jpg\" /> <p>At long last, AMD's answer to <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review\">Nvidia's RTX 3060</a> has arrived.

His cold, edgy demeanor is a result of spending most of his time isolating himself from humans. Don’t worry, though: he also has a soft spot for Almond Tofu and the Traveler (and he’s perfect with almost any team comp!). While other Anemo characters like <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-genshin-impact-venti-build\">Venti</a> focus more on crowd control abilities, Xiao’s strength is in his damage, making him a great main DPS.</p>\n<p>This guide will show you how to create the best Xiao build in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact\">Genshin Impact</a>. Below we'll cover everything you need to know about Xiao, including wishing, weapons, artifacts, ascension materials, talents, abilities, and constellations.</p>\n<p>Xiao’s at his best when he has the <strong>Primordial Jade Winged-Spear</strong>, which grants its user a hefty attack bonus, on hand. <strong>Skyward Spine</strong> is also a great 5-star option thanks to its well-rounded set of buffs. Since 5-star weapons are tedious to obtain, <strong>Blackcliff Pole</strong> and <strong>Deathmatch</strong> are solid 4-star alternates that both grant impressive attack bonuses as well.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-genshin-impact-xiao-build\">Read more</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=DL7AIggjq3Q:fdcY6HWKG2Y:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=DL7AIggjq3Q:fdcY6HWKG2Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/DL7AIggjq3Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 10:05:03 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-xiao-pull.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/genshin-impact-xiao-pull.jpg","linkMd5":"4df9d07b18e1e4acf3264a1089a664f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn80@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-23-267_17d4db7228439aa0.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":308789,"destBytes":161070,"author":"Amelia Zollner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-xiao-pull.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/genshin-impact-xiao-pull.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn80@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-23-267_17d4db7228439aa0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/DL7AIggjq3Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn24@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-28-619_b1bcc2f60d4d58d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592693},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"Carrier Command 2 review: all lost at sequel","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/carrier-command-2-review","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/carrier-command-2-review-6.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/carrier-command-2-review-6.jpg\" /> \n<p>I am terrible at <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrier-command-2\">Carrier Command 2</a>.

Although her kit has been criticized by players, Yoimiya serves as a much stronger version of Amber (sorry, Amber…) and will make for a unique main DPS well-suited for almost any team.</p>\n<p>This guide will show you how to create the best Yoimiya build in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact\">Genshin Impact</a>. Below we'll cover everything you need to know about Yoimiya, including wishing, weapons, artifacts, ascension materials, talents, abilities, and constellations.</p>\n<p>Released during the 2.0 update, <strong>Thundering Pulse</strong> is an incredibly strong bow that works to increase different aspects of damage with a focus on normal ATK. Yoimiya’s versatility means she’s perfect when equipped with this bow. If you can’t get the elusive weapon, though, the 5-star <strong>Skyward Harp</strong> is also a great option that increases CRIT stats. Finally, for players with more 4-star weapons, <strong>Rust</strong> and the newly introduced <strong>Hamayumi</strong> are great options as well. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-genshin-impact-yoimiya-build\">Read more</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=62OnlsbPpT0:n-h__9R24NQ:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=62OnlsbPpT0:n-h__9R24NQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/62OnlsbPpT0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 10:29:42 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-yoimiya-pull.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/genshin-impact-yoimiya-pull.jpg","linkMd5":"56a57fe7608fa9230df205e6c83b5060","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-25-058_5bfa07e51b285f60.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":320275,"destBytes":162466,"author":"Amelia Zollner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-yoimiya-pull.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/genshin-impact-yoimiya-pull.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-25-058_5bfa07e51b285f60.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/62OnlsbPpT0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn54@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-604_e3eee4e19af5c272.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592674},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"Quakecon’s schedule briefly listed a \"revitalized edition\" of Quake","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quakecons-schedule-for-next-week-briefly-listed-a-new-edition-of-quake","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/quake_fXDItRM.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/quake_fXDItRM.jpg\" /> <p>Bethesda released the details of next week&rsquo;s Quakecon 2021, being held virtually between August 19th-21st.

But with the base Steam Deck model starting at &pound;349 / $399 and the option to connect it up to a monitor using a dock accessory, part of me wonders whether Valve also see the Deck as a potential first-time PC for people as well.

Which is to say, the bar for exciting Paris happenings has been set pretty high. Did I expect <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla\">Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</a>&rsquo;s Parisian adventure to meet it? I did not. The previous DLC, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids\">Wrath Of The Druids</a>, was an underwhelming trip to Ireland that recycled the main game&rsquo;s settlement development and conspirator assassinations. These ideas were frayed by the end of the campaign, let alone after enduring the rough baggage handling at Irish border control. Chances of surviving yet another long haul journey? Not good.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou certainly fear the worst at <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris\">The Siege Of Paris</a>&rsquo;s outset: it&rsquo;s another of Eivor&rsquo;s viking pals asking you to visit another farflung region where another local despot is bumping heads with the invaders. That the main story consists of similar regional yarns means any DLC excursions slot neatly into the whole, but it also results in repetition. Go to a place, learn the stakes, make a decision, go home. In this case it&rsquo;s Charles the Fat causing grief, with his habit of decorating the French countryside with headless settlers. He isn&rsquo;t subtle, but I do welcome this ogre of a baddie, given the villain-shaped hole in Valhalla proper. \n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris-review\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=1St348x2KtU:41KCz00tbSM:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=1St348x2KtU:41KCz00tbSM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/1St348x2KtU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 10:00:59 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/ac-valhalla-siege-of-paris-review-3.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/ac-valhalla-siege-of-paris-review-3.jpg","linkMd5":"2afec43a6ad912b12a4e6bb8ea207458","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn68@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-25-456_56394e86d0af9d34.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":57750,"destBytes":37030,"author":"Matthew Castle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/ac-valhalla-siege-of-paris-review-3.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/ac-valhalla-siege-of-paris-review-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn68@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-25-456_56394e86d0af9d34.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/1St348x2KtU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-28-974_f0e9f717e20e6eaa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592674},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"Metal Slug Tactics' latest gameplay trailer teases some towering boss battles","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-gameplay-trailer-boss-battles","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/cobra.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/cobra.jpg\" /> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-slug-tactics\">Metal Slug Tactics</a> adding a third-dimension looks to have been an excellent idea.

always be a rich vein for video game plotlines, but rarely are they as stylish and fiendishly conceived as Thomas Happ's <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/axiom-verge\">Axiom Verge</a> games. The solo dev's first entry in the series was a breakout retro hit back in 2015, harking back to the 16-bit Metroid and Castlevania games of yore with its detailed pixel art and retro sensibilities. It turned heads with its dizzying array of guns and tough bosses, but it was its planet full of glitches that sealed the deal, as it felt like you weren't just playing a great Metroidvania, but you were also getting to peek behind the curtain to see what made it tick.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/axiom-verge-2\">Axiom Verge 2</a>, a semi-sequel that's set in the same universe as Axiom Verge 1 but can be played standalone without any knowledge of what went down beforehand, is a more sedate affair than its predecessor, but Happ's fascination with portals, overlapping worlds and seeing beyond the veil has only grown stronger in the intervening six years. What it lacks in finger-tapping firepower, it more than makes up for with clever puzzles, a more meaningful skillset, and a very, <em>very</em> neat grappling hook.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/axiom-verge-2-review\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=XVtpwzQjxsM:QY24YogLwXA:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=XVtpwzQjxsM:QY24YogLwXA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/XVtpwzQjxsM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/axiom-verge-2-lamassu.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/axiom-verge-2-lamassu.jpg","linkMd5":"330f9b1799b18126523159396e805ef2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn14@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-21-351_09af59309ca7ed03.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1067,"sourceBytes":252255,"destBytes":154186,"author":"Katharine Castle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/axiom-verge-2-lamassu.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/axiom-verge-2-lamassu.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn14@2020_4/2021/08/15/03-53-21-351_09af59309ca7ed03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/XVtpwzQjxsM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn20@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-29-199_a4b6c9dfc6cb2290.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592673},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"Valve \"weren't interested\" in making a Steam Deck that only played low-spec games","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-werent-interested-in-making-a-steam-deck-that-only-played-low-spec-games","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-carry-case.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/steam-deck-carry-case.jpg\" /> <p>Ever since the <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck\">Steam Deck</a> was first unveiled last month, Valve have said one of their top design goals was making sure it could play the entire Steam back catalogue, including games from the last 12 months.

This week, I got to see a glimpse of its Quake City dungeon, a toxic wasteland you'll be picking through around ten hours into the game.

The <strong>Primordial Jade Cutter</strong> is also a great 5-star option that will buff Ayaka&rsquo;s HP and scale an ATK bonus off of her raised HP. If you don&rsquo;t have access to 5-stars, try the 4-star <strong>Blackcliff Longsword</strong> or <strong>The Black Sword</strong>, which offer different buffs to Ayaka&rsquo;s CRIT stats.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-genshin-impact-ayaka-build\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=gpOQzXm9qVg:8JPfzqp9Ybo:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=gpOQzXm9qVg:8JPfzqp9Ybo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/gpOQzXm9qVg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 09:43:13 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-ayaka-pull.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/genshin-impact-ayaka-pull.jpg","linkMd5":"21d95d79cd9f44220ee16ec12ea64d5e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-23-508_64aa936c81b9e6f1.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":288792,"destBytes":148564,"author":"Amelia Zollner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-ayaka-pull.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/genshin-impact-ayaka-pull.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-23-508_64aa936c81b9e6f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/gpOQzXm9qVg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn10@2020_2/2021/08/15/03-53-28-630_784740c847d0e2a2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592693},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"Button City review: an adorable little adventure","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/button-city-review","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/button-city-header.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/button-city-header.jpg\" /> \n<p>Ask the internet what cities you absolutely must visit and it'll suggest somewhere like Tokyo, or Rome, or The Big Apple.

I'm not sure how that happened. I might&rsquo;ve been turned off by the 2001 fan translation of the original SNES game - yes, the same translation that suggested 17-year-old heroine Arche Klein &ldquo;<a href=\"https://legendsoflocalization.com/the-infamous-arche-fs-like-a-tiger-scene-in-tales-of-phantasia/\">[Fornicates] like a tiger</a>.&rdquo; Or maybe it was Tales of Phantasia, in which <a href=\"https://legendsoflocalization.com/how-did-a-kangaroo-sneak-into-tales-of-phantasia/\">all instances of the word &ldquo;Ragnarok&rdquo; became &ldquo;kangaroo&rdquo;</a> thanks to a sloppy localization error. Again, I turned away. Finally, in 2019, a breakthrough. I bought Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition and was quickly enamored. Tales' traditional action-heavy combat system worked well with Vesperia's lush, ruins-dotted world, and its wise-cracking characters are honestly hilarious at times. (Foul-mouthed researcher Rita Mordio is a hoot, especially when she torments Karol, the party&rsquo;s tagalong brat.)</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, there&rsquo;s good and bad about previewing the long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-arise\">Tales of Arise</a> with only Vesperia under my belt. On one hand, I can compare Arise's storytelling and mechanics with one of the best games the series has to offer. On the other hand, I can compare Arise's storytelling and mechanics with one of the best... well, you probably know what I'm getting at, here. </p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-arise-is-fast-furious-fun\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=lSt9XPxHE0Y:LfWkNfmWyI4:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=lSt9XPxHE0Y:LfWkNfmWyI4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/lSt9XPxHE0Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:02:17 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-arise-party.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/tales-of-arise-party.jpg","linkMd5":"b7e98df543cdc0d831320902285dad6e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn10@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-288_e1c86f81e14de803.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":566918,"destBytes":339398,"author":"Nadia Oxford","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-arise-party.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/tales-of-arise-party.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn10@2020_6/2021/08/15/03-53-27-288_e1c86f81e14de803.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_5/2021/08/15/03-53-28-899_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_1/2021/08/15/03-53-28-648_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/lSt9XPxHE0Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn32@2020_3/2021/08/15/03-53-28-623_150c8b5ea3f634f0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1628999592696},{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 11:53:12","title":"No Man's Sky teases its 17th major update called Frontiers","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-teases-its-next-major-expansion-called-frontiers","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/screenshot_2-3_tgH70UV.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/screenshot_2-3_tgH70UV.jpg\" /> <p>\n  At what milestone do we begin contextualizing the age of a game with \"do you want to feel old?\" If it's five years, well, do you?
