Oh, let me Google that. Take this Kleenex. Throw that in the dumpster (yes, &#8220;Dumpster&#8221; used to be a brand). <strong>Netflix</strong> was well on its way to becoming that thing for streaming, with the cheeky &#8220;Netflix and chill&#8221; even becoming a commonly used phrase. But it may lose that chance with the influx of new streaming competitors like <strong>Disney+</strong>, <strong>HBO Max</strong>, and <strong>Peacock</strong>, and of course, its old competitors <strong>Hulu</strong> and <strong>Amazon Prime</strong>. It&#8217;s unquestionable that Netflix is the No. 1 streaming service in the world right now. But can it hold onto that title for much longer? A new report which suggests that Netflix has begun to lose ground in these ongoing streaming wars.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665682\"></span></p>\n<p>A report from <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-streaming-us-market-share-chart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wrap</a> shows that Netflix&#8217;s lead over all the other streaming services is starting to shrink. While Netflix still holds 20% of the U.S. streaming market, its lead has shrunk from 29% in the past year, based on data shared by Ampere Analysis. This means that Netflix lost 31% of its market share since 2020, even as the company recorded 36.58 million new accounts last year.</p>\n<p>So what could have caused this? Well, it was the deluge of new streaming services like WarnerMedia&#8217;s HBO Max and NBCUniversal&#8217;s Peacock, both of which launched in 2020. The pair of them, along with the hundreds of other new streamers that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/streaming-services-discounts-coronavirus-quarantine/\">debuted this year</a>, added to the pressure brought on by other fledgeling streamers like Disney+ and Apple TV+, which launched earlier in 2019.</p>\n<p>Netflix is not the only established streamer to take a hit. Amazon Prime Video dropped from a 21% market share to 16%, though their numbers are &#8220;trickier&#8221; to project, per The Wrap, which notes that not every Prime subscriber is accessing the Prime Video feature, though Ampere&#8217;s data indicates nearly 54 million Prime members use their Prime Video app in the United States. Hulu takes the No. 3 spot, showing that the Big Three of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu still maintain a stronghold over the Top 3 streamers. Though not for long, according to Ampere Research Manager Toby Holleran.</p>\n<p>Holleran told The Wrap he expects &#8220;Disney+ to overtake both HBO Max and Hulu&#8221; within the first half of 2021, and &#8220;finish the year as the third largest streaming service in the U.S., with Hulu taking the fourth spot, and HBO Max taking fifth.&#8221; However, Holleran notes that Netflix&#8217;s place at the top of the streaming hierarchy is &#8220;seemingly cemented,&#8221; though it&#8217;s possible that Disney&#8217;s overall streaming package — which includes both Hulu and ESPN+ — could overtake Netflix worldwide by 2024.</p>\n<p>The rest of the market remains crowded, but with smaller slices of the pie: Apple TV+, NBCUniversal’s Peacock and ViacomCBS’ Paramount+ &#8220;trail far behind the leaders in the category,&#8221; per The Wrap.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/netflix-streaming-competition-lead-shrinking/\">Netflix&#8217;s Lead in the Streaming Wars is Shrinking as More Competitors Enter the Fray</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qSXlQCA-zsY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:30:04 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/steps-netflix-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"0bc4c330ebc400025ea145d26d39375b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn25@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-37-46-939_e56aa4ef4e039010.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":12376,"destBytes":4966,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/steps-netflix-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn25@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-37-46-939_e56aa4ef4e039010.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-24-619_2fe79628ca89e18b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qSXlQCA-zsY:l5Pvdd0i92U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn71@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-24-566_9f27f8ae24434d81.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qSXlQCA-zsY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-24-494_d3d9858e2314b2ed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Girls5eva’ Trailer: Sara Bareilles, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Busy Philipps Reunite Their ’90s Girl Group","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665660","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665689 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Girls5eva-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Girls5eva.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Girls5eva-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Did anyone tell you that the &#8217;90s are back? Well, in the new Tina Fey-produced Peacock comedy <strong><em>Girls5eva</em></strong>, they&#8217;re back and they&#8217;re here to stay. <em>Girls5eva</em> stars <strong>Sara Bareilles, Busy Philipps</strong>, and <strong>Renée Elise Goldsberry</strong> as members of a &#8217;90s girl group who decide to stage a comeback — when they&#8217;re all in their 40s.

Just as real-life boy bands and girl groups stage splashy reunions, so do the fictional girl groups — specifically, the one-hit wonder girl group Girls5eva. And what a girl group that would have been, with <em>Waitress</em>&#8216; Sara Bareilles, <em>Hamilton</em>&#8216;s Renée Elise Goldsberry, and <em>Cougar Town</em>&#8216;s Busy Philipps among its members. But while we didn&#8217;t get that group in real life, they&#8217;re getting ready to stage their comeback in fiction, in the Peacock Original comedy series <em>Girls5eva</em>.</p>\n<p>Created by <strong>Meredith Scardino</strong> and produced by Tina Fey, <em>Girls5eva</em> follows a &#8217;90s girl group who reunite 20 years later to give pop stardom one more shot. But it&#8217;s hard to balance spouses, kids, jobs, debt, aging parents, and their own aging as they chase their music ambitions once again — this time without the problematic messages from their old music (the jailbait bit is very Tina Fey). And somehow, they can never get away from their creepy old manager. Still, it&#8217;s never 2 l8 for music stardom.</p>\n<p>This looks pretty fun, and it&#8217;s always great to see Bareilles and Goldsberry venturing out onto the screen after carving out such amazing careers on the stage and on the music charts. And we&#8217;ll never say no to more Busy Philipps. Starring alongside Bareilles, Goldsberry, and Phillips is <em>Saturday Night Live</em> alum and comedy writer Paula Pell.</p>\n<p>Scardino serves as creator and executive producer for the series, while Jeff Richmond, Tina Fey (Little Stranger, Inc.), Robert Carlock (Bevel Gears), David Miner (3 Arts Entertainment), Eric Gurian (Little Stranger) serve as executive producers. <em>Girls5eva</em> is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the synopsis for <em>Girls5eva</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a one-hit-wonder girl group from the 90’s gets sampled by a young rapper, its members reunite to give their pop star dreams one more shot. They may be grown women balancing spouses, kids, jobs, debt, aging parents, and shoulder pain, but can‘t they also be Girls5eva?</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Girls5eva</em> will premiere Thursday, <strong>May 6, 2021</strong>. All eight episodes will drop at once on Peacock.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/girls5eva-trailer-peacock/\">&#8216;Girls5eva&#8217; Trailer: Sara Bareilles, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Busy Philipps Reunite Their &#8217;90s Girl Group</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SWVoVEQ4_TQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 22:00:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Girls5eva-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"4d936e7f83cc6998ced2f335b00d489c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-37-54-790_83bbebe375d44144.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":49145,"destBytes":34200,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Girls5eva-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-37-54-790_83bbebe375d44144.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn8@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-24-660_7e2dc6ed8b0563fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SWVoVEQ4_TQ:MSh391-PGe0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn54@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-24-945_c163ed67333dc5a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SWVoVEQ4_TQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-30-516_05d335758e133e4a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘The Tomorrow War’ With Chris Pratt Heads to Amazon in July","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665791","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665797\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the tomorrow war release date\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <strong>Chris Pratt</strong> sci-fi action flick <strong><em>The Tomorrow War</em></strong> is headed to Amazon Prime Video in time for the July 4 weekend. The<strong> Chris McKay</strong>-directed pic was originally set up at Paramount and intended to open in theaters on December 25, 2020. But the COVID-19 pandemic put the kibosh on those plans, and earlier this year reports surfaced that Amazon was considering picking up the movie. Now, it&#8217;s official: Amazon has the film and will release it this July.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665791\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>July 2, 2021</strong>, to be exact. That will give viewers a chance to stream the film at home during the 4th of July weekend – unless they want to leave the house and watch <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, which will open in theaters on July 1. Both <em>Tomorrow War</em> and <em>Top Gun</em> come from Skydance Media, which makes Skydance poised to own Independence Day weekend this year.</p>\n<p>In<em> The Tomorrow War</em>, &#8220;the world is stunned when a group of time travelers arrive from the year 2051 to deliver an urgent message: Thirty years in the future mankind is losing a global war against a deadly alien species. The only hope for survival is for soldiers and civilians from the present to be transported to the future and join the fight. Among those recruited is high school teacher and family man Dan Forester (Pratt). Determined to save the world for his young daughter, Dan teams up with a brilliant scientist (<strong>Yvonne Strahovski</strong>) and his estranged father (<strong>J.K. Simmons</strong>) in a desperate quest to rewrite the fate of the planet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>The Tomorrow War</em> will be a global event that will surprise and delight our customers around the world,&#8221; said Jennifer Salke, Head of Amazon Studios. &#8220;Director Chris McKay has brilliantly crafted this unique, action-packed sci-fi escape that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats and tug on their heart strings with its father-daughter storyline. We couldn&#8217;t be happier to continue our relationship with Chris Pratt—who brings such dynamic star power to the film—along with David Ellison and the Skydance team, as we share this exciting film with fans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chris McKay added: &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of this incredible cast and crew who worked under challenging circumstances to create a unique, original sci-fi action movie&#8230; something that’s increasingly rare. Watching this team of actors and artisans effortlessly blend action, horror, comedy, and drama was a dream come true for me &#8230; and I hope will thrill audiences this summer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-tomorrow-war-release-date/\">&#8216;The Tomorrow War&#8217; With Chris Pratt Heads to Amazon in July</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/pbWIJyYVu_o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 16:30:43 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"eeb6e91b61bacf566abd0cae38367289","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-40-365_92e7a817395fc995.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":52938,"destBytes":37238,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-tomorrow-war-release-date-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-40-365_92e7a817395fc995.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-24-795_222146e2763346e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=pbWIJyYVu_o:O176x3BVV0w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-24-665_f67fd89aa52fe6ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/pbWIJyYVu_o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn78@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-24-565_dba47f04c5e9d508.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051865},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Knives Out’ Sequels: Rian Johnson, Daniel Craig, and Producer Ram Bergman Stand to Make $100 Million Each From the Netflix Deal","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665670","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-596900 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-glasses-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Knives Out glasses\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-glasses.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-glasses-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t typically write about Hollywood paydays at /Film unless they&#8217;re especially huge, but a new report brings word of three new instances which absolutely fit that description.

That&#8217;s Robert-Downey-Jr-<em>Avengers</em>-level money.<span id=\"more-665670\"></span></p>\n<p>According to a new piece in <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/knives-out-sequels-the-whodunit-behind-netflixs-469-million-power-play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">THR</a>, &#8220;The pact gave Johnson immense creative control, sources tell <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. He doesn&#8217;t have to take notes from the streamer. The only contingencies were that Craig must star in the sequels and that each must have at least the budget of the 2019 movie, which was in the $40 million range. Sources say that Johnson, Bergman and Craig stand to walk away with upwards of $100 million each.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again, that is a <em>lot</em> of money. Downey is the only person I can think of who&#8217;s in in the same stratosphere. For <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, he&#8217;s rumored to have made around $75 million when you factor in his lucrative back-end profit participation deal.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ll allow me to concern-troll for a moment: when you make that much money, you run the risk of becoming disconnected with reality to a degree and either being unwilling, unable, or uninterested in taking notes and advice from anyone when it comes to creative decision-making on future projects. That may sound great on paper, but it&#8217;s also probably how things like <em>Dolittle</em> end up happening. There is something to be said for the idea of compromises and restrictions being essential to creating the most interesting version of a film. But Johnson knows this, and he&#8217;s one of the most humble and hardworking people in the industry. I fully trust his creative instincts and have no doubt that these sequels will end up being great.</p>\n<p>The THR piece mentions that in January, &#8220;with the pandemic in full swing,&#8221; Johnson and Bergman (who own the rights to <em>Knives Out</em>) &#8220;questioned the near-term viability of theatrical releasing&#8221; and decided to go out to streamers for the sequels, and a bidding war erupted, with Netflix coming out victorious. There may be some grumbling about this deal being a big blow to theatrical moviegoing, but considering the circumstances around which this decision was made (remember, it was long before the vaccine rollout was as effective as it has since become), it&#8217;s tough to blame Johnson and Bergman for doing what they had to do in order to guarantee that these sequels could get made.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/knives-out-sequels-deal/\">&#8216;Knives Out&#8217; Sequels: Rian Johnson, Daniel Craig, and Producer Ram Bergman Stand to Make $100 Million Each From the Netflix Deal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/T1w9bL5f_J4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:30:18 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-glasses-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"f9fede77679b542067aa83ab7491ddc0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-37-32-465_c10438d80589d329.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":30209,"destBytes":17782,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Knives-Out-glasses-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-37-32-465_c10438d80589d329.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn92@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-24-458_f2a6bb7acb0e7d38.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=T1w9bL5f_J4:fQiN2IM5CQA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn65@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-24-577_502b5ebd307c325a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/T1w9bL5f_J4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-24-939_a7adabcf800d3575.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"“A Six-Hour Movie”: How the Weekly Release Schedule for ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ is Killing the Show","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665757","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-661961 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"the falcon and the winter soldier clips\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <strong><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-soapbox/\">The Soapbox</a></strong>, the space where we get loud, feisty, political, and opinionated about anything and everything.)</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last few years, an incredibly, disturbingly common refrain has arisen from the cast and crew working on a slew of big new TV series, from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Little Lies</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stranger Things</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – “It’s really a 6-hour movie”. (Feel free to fill in a larger number to account for shows that have eight or nine episodes per season instead of six.) The war of film and television feels especially foolish to fight as we wind down from a pandemic that kept so many of us away from movie theaters, essentially turning everything into television whether it was intended that way or not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel’s latest show for Disney+, </span><strong><i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is no different, with star Anthony Mackie </span><a href=\"https://collider.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-new-details-anthony-mackie/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saying </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that the show would be like “a six- or eight-hour movie” last summer, and director Kari Skogland emphasizing it again <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-director-interview/\">during an interview with /Film</a>. Leave aside any amount of eye-rolling you might muster at seeing that comment again. Maybe a six-hour Falcon movie appeals to you. That appeal would be more intriguing if Disney+ was treating </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like a movie, instead of&#8230;well, a weekly television show.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665757\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Disney+ opened its virtual doors in the fall of 2019, it zigged where services like Netflix or Amazon Prime zagged when it came to new programs. Yes, Disney+ had a buzzworthy new show with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mandalorian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but episodes weren’t released all at once, instead being treated the way HBO would treat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or any of its many other boundary-pushing shows. By the end of the first season, it was clear that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mandalorian </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">had received an immense benefit by being the rare streaming show that was released week to week, instead of being immediately binge-able. (I </span><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-mandalorian-pacing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this two episodes into the first season, and while I’m still fairly unimpressed by the story of Baby Yoda and friends, I allow that I’m very much in the minority on the idea that the show should’ve been released all at once.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the similarly massive success of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WandaVision</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it’s easy to imagine that Marvel’s next TV venture would be just as compelling, as strange, and as capable of drawing week-to-week interest among even those of us who aren’t incredibly comic-book-literate. But halfway through the season (maybe Marvel has a second </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falcon and the Winter Soldier </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">season planned, but nothing’s confirmed), Anthony Mackie appears to have been right. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feel like a six-hour movie. And releasing its installments once a week is a terrible way to build its momentum.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WandaVision</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was more dramatically interesting in its first stretch of episodes, but the braintrust at Marvel made a wise decision of leaning into the roots of the medium. Even paying lip service to the idea of how television </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to look allowed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WandaVision </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to notably feel appropriate to getting a weekly release. If Wanda Maximoff was going to find herself in the middle of sitcoms from different televisual eras, it made more sense to give her and the audience a week in between to wonder what might happen next. Only on the premiere date did Disney+ break its own rule, releasing the first two installments of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WandaVision</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing for audiences to get a better grasp of how quickly things could change for the Scarlet Witch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That technique would’ve been extremely beneficial to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, considering that its first episode ends before Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes have&#8230;met up. It’s risky, to say the least, to name a show after the two former best friends of Captain America, advertise said show based on these two guys teaming up, and then&#8230;not have them team up in the first episode. (The premiere episode also barely offers up any hint as to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sam and Bucky would even team up.) This isn’t the first show to brag that it’s really like an extended movie; the problem is that most of those shows are released all at once&#8230;like a movie. As Sam and Bucky try to take down the Flag Smashers, recruiting the villainous Baron Zemo to their cause temporarily, it’s becoming more challenging to get invested in a show that truly feels like it was meant to be watched in one fell swoop. This is the inherent problem with advertising your show as being like an extended movie: people may be best served by watching it that way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t the only such Disney+ original struggling through the weekly-release strategy. The streamer also has </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a revival of the 90s film series in TV form, starring Emilio Estevez once more as Gordon Bombay, the formerly grumpy lawyer who has to teach kids hockey who is now&#8230;a currently grumpy ice-rink owner who will have to teach kids hockey. (Everything old is new again.) </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Changers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just two episodes into a ten-episode season, with some basic conceptual roles reversed. This time, it’s the Mighty Ducks themselves who are the bullying team in town, who inadvertently inspire a single mom (Lauren Graham) to start up her own ragtag team simply to offer a less aggressively prepared and scheduled version of the sport to a grab bag of goofball kids.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is, in essence, a 21st-century version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mighty Ducks</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which was itself a cuddlier version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bad News Bears</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). You know. A </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And just like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falcon and Winter Soldier</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Changers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is being released once a week, a decision that only saps whatever momentum the sports-focused show might try to accrue. It’s not just that this show is inspired by a movie (thus raising the question of why this wasn’t a movie too, or at least released all at once). It’s that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Changers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels like Disney+’s response to another streaming service’s TV revival of a sports-focused film series. First on YouTube, and now on Netflix, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cobra Kai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has taken the basic concept of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Karate Kid</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, flipped it on its ear (originally positioning the formerly villainous Johnny Lawrence as a new kind of hero, with Daniel LaRusso as the thorn in his side), and become pretty damn popular in the process. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cobra Kai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t perfect, sometimes avoiding the real-world consequences of the violence being perpetuated in the community of the show. (And like a number of 80s movies, it’s a show that basically ignores the idea of parents in the community being infuriated at their kids being in violent karate attacks.) But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cobra Kai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has the benefit of having its seasons released all at once, and by creating punchy enough cliffhangers on an episode-to-episode basis that encourage immediate viewership of ensuing episodes. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Changers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is, like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cobra Kai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> did in its first season, slowly following the template of the underdog sports movie. In the second episode, the Don’t Bothers (the team Graham’s character starts) have their first game and play horrendously. By the end of the episode, we get more hints that the tetchy Bombay will soften and coach once more (because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of course </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he will). And it’s easy to imagine that by the end of the ten-episode season, the Don’t Bothers may yet be victorious. But where shows like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cobra Kai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allow you to watch the full journey of the underdog in the course of a few hours, treating </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Changers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like a traditional TV show is only serving to highlight its creative inefficiencies. Watching a five-hour underdog sports movie is one thing; watching it over the course of three months in dribs and drabs isn’t terribly rousing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This plea isn’t intended to echo Veruca Salt, begging for something </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, just because. The issue is more fundamental than that: not all streaming shows are created equal. Though it’s kind of funny to watch streamers like Netflix and Disney+ talking about creating a new paradigm of releasing their shows – by which they mean they’ve recreated how broadcast networks have always released their shows – some of these shows don’t benefit from a weekly release. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WandaVision</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – whatever its creative faults were – became a much bigger water-cooler show </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">precisely </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because it wasn’t released all at once. But some shows need that binge-able strategy. The more that creators are encouraged to treat their shows like overlong movies, the wiser it is to release them like movies. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-release-problems/\">&#8220;A Six-Hour Movie&#8221;: How the Weekly Release Schedule for &#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8217; is Killing the Show</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/O2n0w0nwgTw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 17:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-700x291.jpg","linkMd5":"a28ad7335bb15259708b3c170c51001f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-32-436_b035826d706c0e6e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":291,"sourceBytes":31263,"destBytes":18776,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-700x291.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-32-436_b035826d706c0e6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn93@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-653_1213432068d048dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=O2n0w0nwgTw:HMv4NVA5Ubg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-24-499_46b32ea0cc6bf1eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/O2n0w0nwgTw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn19@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-45-271_0bb96f3f5b09dd97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Ghostbusters: Afterlife’ Clip: Paul Rudd Meets Some Mini Stay-Puft Marshmallow Men","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665756","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Clip.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665766\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Clip-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Ghostbusters Afterlife Clip\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Clip-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Clip-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Clip-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Clip.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first clip for <strong><em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em></strong> is here, and it&#8217;s&#8230;well, it&#8217;s questionable, at best.

Watch the clip below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665756\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Ghostbusters Afterlife Clip</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/43CTgfwoa3Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It took me a hot second before I realized this was an actual clip from <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>, and not a tie-in commercial for some sort of product from the film. And now that I know what this is, I&#8217;m even more befuddled. Here, we see Paul Rudd&#8217;s character, a teacher named Mr. Grooberson, browsing a grocery store when he suddenly hears someone cry out. Eerie music reminiscent of Elmer Bernstein&#8217;s score for the first film plays, and then, a bunch of baby Stay-Puft Marshmallow Men show up and start making &#8220;cute&#8221; sounds and also&#8230;*checks notes*&#8230;turn themselves into s&#8217;mores.</p>\n<p>Look, I&#8217;m not going to judge an entire movie based on one out-of-context clip, but if the rest of <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> is like this, I&#8217;m more than a bit worried. There&#8217;s almost nothing here that works – bringing back the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man feels fan-service-y and turning the character into a bunch of mini Marshmallow Men comes across like the producers of this film said, &#8220;We need our own Baby Yoda/Minions for this movie, any ideas?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again: this is a random clip for the movie and perhaps it plays much better in the context of the film itself. But I&#8217;m a little worried here, gang. The original <em>Ghostbusters</em> remains a classic. On top of that, I think <em>Ghostbusters 2</em> is a lot better than people give it credit for, and I even liked the 2016 reboot that lots of people seemed to dislike because it featured *gasp* <em>lady Ghostbusters</em>. With all that in mind, I&#8217;ll give <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> a chance, but I sure hope this clip isn&#8217;t reflective of the film as a whole.</p>\n<p>In <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>, &#8220;After being evicted from their home, two children and their single mother move to a farm inherited from their late grandfather, located in Summerville, Oklahoma. When the town experiences a series of unexplained earthquakes, the children discover their family&#8217;s link to the original Ghostbusters, who have become something of a myth as many have long since forgotten the events of the Manhattan Crossrip of 1984. They discover the secret legacy that their grandfather left behind.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> opens <strong>November 11, 2021</strong>.

But oddly enough, it never found an official wide release – until now. Netflix scooped the adaptation up and will finally release it in May, with the first trailer now available to watch below. The movie follows a seventeen-year-old film student whose entire life gets turned upside down when he&#8217;s charged with felony murder.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665657\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Monster Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hA-lmaz4AM8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Published in 1999, Walter Dean Myers&#8217;s <em>Monster</em> was partially written in screenplay format – so it&#8217;s only fitting that someone would eventually turn it into a movie.  <strong>Anthony Mandler</strong> helms the film adaptation, which was written by <strong>Radha Blank</strong>, <strong>Colen C. Wiley</strong>, <strong>Janece Shaffer</strong>, and stars <strong>Kelvin Harrison Jr.</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong>, <strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong>, <strong>Jharrel Jerome</strong>,<strong> Jennifer Ehle</strong>, <strong>Rakim Mayers</strong>,<strong> Nasir ‘Nas’ Jones</strong>, <strong>Tim Blake Nelson</strong>, and <strong>John David Washington</strong>.</p>\n<p>The story follows Steve Harmon, &#8220;a seventeen-year-old honor student whose world comes crashing down around him when he is charged with felony murder. The film follows his dramatic journey from a smart, likable film student from Harlem attending an elite high school through a complex legal battle that could leave him spending the rest of his life in prison.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the book&#8217;s synopsis adds: &#8220;Guilty or innocent, Steve becomes a pawn in the hands of &#8216;the system,&#8217; cluttered with cynical authority figures and unscrupulous inmates, who will turn in anyone to shorten their own sentences. For the first time, Steve is forced to think about who he is as he faces prison, where he may spend all the tomorrows of his life.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Monster</em> had its world premiere at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and I&#8217;m not entirely sure why it took so long for it to finally be released. Sometimes that will happen with a film that&#8217;s less-than-great, but reviewing for /Film, Steven Prokopy <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/monster-review/\">wrote</a>: &#8220;The film adaptation from music video veteran and first-time filmmaker Anthony Madler is an ambitious, complex, and layered look at how the court system in America is virtually designed to keep defendants like Steve from every getting a chance at actual justice,&#8221; adding: &#8220;This isn’t a film in search of a happy ending; at best, the story hopes that those hurt by these events can salvage relationships and faith in themselves after systematically being torn apart at every step of this process. It sounds gloomy and somber, it’s true, but the emotionally rousing <i>Monster</i> does find threads of hope amid the despair. These days, that’s often more than we’re used to.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Monster</em> hits Netflix on <strong>May 7</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/monster-trailer-netflix/\">&#8216;Monster&#8217; Trailer: The Award-Winning Novel From Walter Dean Myers is Now a Netflix Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EgDOZE_-02M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 21:00:32 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/monster-trailer-netflix-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"8edd6704c1b011e6dd383853dd587f98","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-37-32-327_be0ba4dfd8061579.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":21849,"destBytes":11162,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/monster-trailer-netflix-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-37-32-327_be0ba4dfd8061579.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-24-774_d3898dcf6bec0c84.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EgDOZE_-02M:5EFJ2N55trs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn89@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-24-637_149ef887d928a99d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EgDOZE_-02M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn20@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-25-237_d5b6fefa64029ede.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051865},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"The Morning Watch: What If ‘The Simpsons’ Was British, Analyzing Natural Disasters in Movies & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665667","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665687 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/simpsons-british-kitchen-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"British Version of The Simpsons\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/simpsons-british-kitchen.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/simpsons-british-kitchen-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-morning-watch/\">The Morning Watch</a> is a recurring feature that highlights a handful of noteworthy videos from around the web.

It&#8217;s not clear how much longer they&#8217;ll be sticking around the streaming service, but since most of these characters will be making appearances in the upcoming <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>, I&#8217;m betting they&#8217;ll be holding on to them for a good while.</p>\n<p>These are the shows fans love to know are just sitting around in case they want to take a trip down memory lane without spending hundreds of dollars on Blu-ray and DVD box sets. Even though it will probably end up costing you more in the long run, paying $15 each month to access some of your favorite shows doesn&#8217;t seem so steep.</p>\n<p>Along with the old cartoons, HBO Max also offers <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hbo-max-new-looney-tunes-cartoons-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some solid new <em>Looney Tunes</em> as well</a>, so check them out.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/classic-cartoons-on-hbo-max/\">HBO Max Won&#8217;t Be Losing a Bunch of Classic Cartoons at the End of April After All</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/tMJFSKOZpfc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/looneytunes-hannabarbera-combo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"80439f295c26083a629c84915fac647e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn22@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-46-490_8cb0eb38f2063e23.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":69889,"destBytes":54598,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/looneytunes-hannabarbera-combo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn22@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-46-490_8cb0eb38f2063e23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-24-524_15298d6d1f6fceb6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=tMJFSKOZpfc:tErcXBy3qes:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn30@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-24-491_5327c02d5ae207a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/tMJFSKOZpfc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn45@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-557_b131473401ce05ba.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘One Hour Photo’ Director Mark Romanek Returns With Horror Movie ‘Mother Land’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665676","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665703\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mother land movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Beyond a successful career in music videos, <strong>Mark Romanek</strong> directed three feature films: <em>Static</em> in 1985, <em>One Hour Photo</em> in 2002, and <em>Never Let Me Go</em> in 2010. But then, curiously enough, the feature film work from Romanek stopped coming. He&#8217;s continued to helm music videos and also directed an episode of the Amazon series <em>Tales From the Loop </em>last year, but Romanek&#8217;s movie work has been absent since 2010. Thankfully, that&#8217;s about the change, as the filmmaker is now attached to helm <strong><em>Mother Land</em></strong>, a horror movie for Lionsgate.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665676\"></span></p>\n<p>Mark Romanek seemed like a director destined to helm great movies, but he hasn&#8217;t actually directed a feature film since 2010. At one point, Romanek was going to direct <em>The Overlook Hotel</em>, a prequel to <em>The Shining</em>, but that project never quite came together. And for a while there it was starting to seem like Romanek&#8217;s feature film career was over before it really got started. Thankfully, Romanek is poised for a feature comeback with <em>Mother Land</em>, a horror movie from Lionsgate produced by <strong>Shawn Levy</strong> and<strong> Dan Cohen</strong>.</p>\n<p>Deadline reports that the film &#8220;deals with a family that has been haunted by an evil spirit for years. Their safety and their surroundings come into question when one of the children questions if the evil is real.&#8221; We first wrote about this back in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mother-land/\">2020</a>, before Romanek signed onto the pic. &#8220;To have Mark Romanek board this project says everything you need to know about the quality of this material and where we are taking it tonally and artistically,&#8221; said Erin Westerman, President of Production for the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Coughlin</strong> and<strong> Ryan Grassby</strong>, who wrote the 2016 film <em>Mean Dreams</em> (Bill Paxton&#8217;s final film before his untimely death), wrote the script for <em>Mother Land</em>. That synopsis is a bit too vague for me to feel one way or another about this project, but I definitely love the idea of Romanek helming a movie again. To be clear: it&#8217;s not like Romanek hasn&#8217;t worked in a decade. His music video work has been steady, and he directed episodes of shows like <em>Vinyl</em> and <em>Tales From the Loop. </em>But after the excellent and disturbing <em>One Hour Photo</em>, I wanted even more Romanek horror/thriller movies, and sadly, we never got them. For a while there it looked like Romanek would helm <em>The Overlook Hotel</em>, the prequel to <em>The Shining</em>, but budget problems got in the way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We got the blessing from Stephen King, the script was written, and then I took it upon myself to elaborately rewrite that script,&#8221; Romanek previously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/overlook-hotel-movie/\">said</a>. &#8220;And what it finally got down to was, really, an origin story. It was more like a wilderness tale set in the very early twentieth century. I can’t remember the name of the character that built the hotel now, but it’s the desecration of the Indian burial ground and the construction of the Overlook Hotel in the deep wilderness in 1910, and it builds to the grand opening of the hotel. It was epic, and I think the problem really was just the budget.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With all this in mind, I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how <em>Mother Land</em> shapes up.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mother-land-movie/\">&#8216;One Hour Photo&#8217; Director Mark Romanek Returns With Horror Movie &#8216;Mother Land&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Z96nTY1L0LM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 21:30:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"04f787f9371a0df7e22f748ceeef0040","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-08-855_dc246b1e9d53e20a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":51819,"destBytes":38354,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mother-land-movie-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-08-855_dc246b1e9d53e20a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn71@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-24-891_946267b83ebf10c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Z96nTY1L0LM:dZlekaV21hg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-25-071_3d5fdff193476825.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Z96nTY1L0LM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn64@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-844_f5d215c6830538de.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Cruella’ Trailer: Emma Stone Shows Off Her Killer Instincts as the Infamous Disney Villain","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665741","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665742\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/12_cruella_dtlr1_4k_r709f_still.087962_R-e1617799803888-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"cruella trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/12_cruella_dtlr1_4k_r709f_still.087962_R-e1617799803888-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/12_cruella_dtlr1_4k_r709f_still.087962_R-e1617799803888-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/12_cruella_dtlr1_4k_r709f_still.087962_R-e1617799803888-768x328.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Revenge is a dish best served hot&#8230;but not burned to a crisp, as <strong>Emma Stone</strong>&#8216;s Cruella De Vil should&#8217;ve been when she sets her haute couture cloak on fire in the trailer for her new film. But presenting a dog-killing fashionista like the <em>101 Dalmatians</em> villain as a protagonist is also unlikely, yet here we are.

She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar® winner Emma Thompson (“Howards End,” “Sense &#38; Sensibility”). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Cruella </em>is slated for release on <strong>May 28</strong>,<strong> 2021</strong> in theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cruella-trailer-new/\">&#8216;Cruella&#8217; Trailer: Emma Stone Shows Off Her Killer Instincts as the Infamous Disney Villain</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/C6wcAfVPpMM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:00:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/12_cruella_dtlr1_4k_r709f_still.087962_R-e1617799803888-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"c6ac89151a92778f4bde477acd9ab3e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-44-271_7dacc4ee55aac6e4.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":40066,"destBytes":27104,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/12_cruella_dtlr1_4k_r709f_still.087962_R-e1617799803888-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-44-271_7dacc4ee55aac6e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-24-486_6ff1106d7c949595.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C6wcAfVPpMM:NddIZipbcsg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-25-153_462c313268279764.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/C6wcAfVPpMM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-45-235_8504bbcc1d3d71ae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051865},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"Olivia Colman to Star in Sam Mendes’ Romantic Drama ‘Empire of Light’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665620","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665626\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/olivia-colman-e1617729936292-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"empire of light\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/olivia-colman-e1617729936292.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/olivia-colman-e1617729936292-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Olivia Colman</strong> is teaming up with <strong>Sam Mendes</strong> for a love story.

The Oscar-winning actress has seen an explosion in opportunities since her incredible turn in <em>The Favourite</em>, nabbing the lead role in <em>The Crown</em> and earning acclaim left and right. She&#8217;s also back in the Oscar conversations this year for her performance in <em>The Father</em>, for which she&#8217;s earned high praise and a Best Supporting Actress nod. The days of Colman, A-list star, are here, and getting to see an above-40s actress get the lead in a love story is just a wonderful prospect. Though Mendes has been dutifully delivering prestige drama riffs on Christopher Nolan in recent years, he&#8217;s still a skilled director to look forward to — I joke about the Nolan thing, but <em>1917</em> is actually very good. And, of course, with Deakins involved, you know it will look absolutely stunning. This will be Mendes&#8217; first project since <em>1917</em> became a critical darling and surprise commercial hit in 2019, raking in $384 million at the worldwide box office, including a $159 million domestic haul.</p>\n<p>Mendes is producing <em>Empire of Light </em>with partner Pippa Harris via the duo&#8217;s Neal Street Productions. Overseeing the project for Searchlight are production presidents Matthew Greenfield and David Greenbaum along with head of development &#38; production, Searchlight Pictures UK, Katie Goodson-Thomas.</p>\n<p>A fall 2022 release is being eyed for <em>Empire of Light</em>, per <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sam-mendes-olivia-colman-team-for-love-story-empire-of-light-for-searchlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/olivia-colman-sam-mendes-empire-of-light/\">Olivia Colman to Star in Sam Mendes&#8217; Romantic Drama &#8216;Empire of Light&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/x6JuhmGD70Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 22:30:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/olivia-colman-e1617729936292-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"39a0ad48220a65f15a3ed65a0ca23d08","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-52-994_3ff3d71e6925644e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":21610,"destBytes":11316,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/olivia-colman-e1617729936292-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-52-994_3ff3d71e6925644e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn36@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-36-423_1a8750f0b98402c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=x6JuhmGD70Y:Qa4bJBzr4sE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn69@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-25-254_a0afcdc7971ca308.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/x6JuhmGD70Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn95@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-24-546_9df146be23cf0904.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Those Who We Wish Me Dead’ Trailer: Angelina Jolie Fights a Forest Fire and Deadly Assassins in the New Taylor Sheridan Film","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665773","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665784\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"those who wish me dead trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> has to deal with an army of deadly killers <em>and</em> a raging forest fire in the trailer for <strong><em>Those Who Wish Me Dead</em></strong>. Jolie plays a fire lookout and survival expert who has to protect a teenage boy from some deadly killers, all while a fire rages around them. It&#8217;s kind of looks like the video game <em>Firewatch</em>, but with more guns, and also <strong>Tyler Perry</strong>. The film has Jolie teaming up with <strong>Taylor Sheridan</strong>, the writer of <em>Sicario</em>, <em>Hell or High Water</em>, and <em>Yellowstone</em>. Here, Sheridan directs from a script he co-wrote with <strong>Michael Koryta</strong> and<strong> Charles Leavitt</strong>.

This isn&#8217;t an adaptation of a comic book or a remake of a TV series or a video game adaptation. It&#8217;s based on a novel by Michael Koryta, and it feels like the kind of mid-budget, adult-driven drama Hollywood used to make all the time – before cinematic universes and superhero movies became the norm.</p>\n<p>Described as a &#8220;female-driven neo-western set against a wildfire in the Montana wilderness,&#8221; <em>Those Who Wish Me Dead</em> tells the story of a &#8220;murder witness [who] finds himself pursued by twin assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert tasked with protecting him and a forest fire threatening to consume them all.&#8221; Angelina Jole is that survival expert while <strong>Finn Little</strong> is the imperiled young witness. The cast also features <strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong> (the <em>X-Men</em> films), <strong>Aiden Gillen</strong> (<em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>Peaky Blinders</em>), <strong>Medina Senghore</strong> (<em>Happy!</em>), Tyler Perry (<em>Vice</em>, <em>Gone Girl</em>), <strong>Jake Weber</strong> (<em>Midway</em>, <em>Homeland</em>), and <strong>Jon Bernthal</strong> (<em>Ford v Ferrari</em>, <em>Wind River</em>).</p>\n<p>Taylor Sheridan, who wrote <em>Sicario</em>, <em>Hell or High Water</em>, <em>Wind River</em>, <em>Sicario: Day of the Soldado</em>, and the series <em>Yellowstone</em>, co-wrote the script with novel writer Michael Kortya and Charles Leavitt, whose credits include <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Blood Diamond</em>, and <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>. Sheridan also directs, making this his third feature film in the director&#8217;s chair – he also helmed <em>Vile</em> in 2011 (although, weirdly enough, he doesn&#8217;t like it when people call that his directorial debut), and <em>Wind River</em> in 2017. I like a lot of Sheridan&#8217;s work, although I tend to think of him as a better writer than a filmmaker. Perhaps <em>Those Who Wish Me Dead</em> will change that.</p>\n<p><em>Those Who Wish Me Dead</em> is headed to both theaters and HBO Max on <strong>May 14</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer/\">&#8216;Those Who We Wish Me Dead&#8217; Trailer: Angelina Jolie Fights a Forest Fire and Deadly Assassins in the New Taylor Sheridan Film</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3GpH-W6XmkM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:30:09 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"fb29d7190c85b6647d98e0a38b4a315f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-44-906_1ae3854b6f24ad50.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":29523,"destBytes":16708,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/those-who-wish-me-dead-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-37-44-906_1ae3854b6f24ad50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn100@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-25-192_52299f7b6828694b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3GpH-W6XmkM:I8Ho0mu9BDQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn68@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-25-255_9e6016e64cb1d321.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3GpH-W6XmkM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-24-423_0a651aa4d2fab384.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Mortal Kombat’ Featurette Highlights the International Cast","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665454","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665473\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mortal kombat featurette\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Are you ready for <strong><em>Mortal Kombat</em></strong>? The latest cinematic take on the ultra-violent video game franchise is headed to theaters and HBO Max this month, and ahead of that release, there&#8217;s a new featurette. This behind-the-scenes video highlights the film&#8217;s international cast – or <em>kast</em>, as the video text calls them, because all C&#8217;s are K&#8217;s in the world of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. So <em>watkh</em> the video below! Wait, that doesn&#8217;t work at all.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665454\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Mortal Kombat Featurette</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3O6tW9OX9g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The<em> Mortal Kombat</em> game series doesn&#8217;t exactly have the most nuanced character development, but there&#8217;s a certain respectability that fans demand when someone attempts to bring these games to life. The latest <em>Mortal Kombat</em> adaptation comes from director<strong> Simon McQuoid</strong>, and boasts a big international cast that includes <strong>Lewis Tan</strong> (<em>Deadpool 2</em>, <em>Wu Assassins</em>) as Cole Young; <strong>Jessica McNamee</strong> (<em>The Meg</em>) as Sonya Blade; <strong>Josh Lawson</strong> (<em>Bombshell</em>) as Kano; <strong>Tadanobu Asano</strong> (<em>Midway</em>) as Lord Raiden; <strong>Mehcad Brooks</strong> (<em>Supergirl</em>) as Jackson &#8220;Jax&#8221; Bridges;<strong> Ludi Lin</strong> (<em>Aquaman</em>) as Liu Kang; with <strong>Chin Han</strong> (<em>Skyscraper</em>) as Shang Tsung; <strong>Joe Taslim</strong> (<em>Star Trek Beyond</em>) as Bi-Han/Sub-Zero; and <strong>Hiroyuki Sanada</strong> (<em>Skyscraper</em>) as Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion, with <strong>Max Huang</strong> as Kung Lao; <strong>Sisi Stringer</strong> as Mileena; <strong>Matilda Kimber</strong> as Emily Young; and<strong> Laura Brent</strong> as Allison Young.</p>\n<p>In the featurette above, the cast is on hand to talk about the challenges of playing a video game character – the challenge being playing someone that&#8217;s larger-than-life who is also somehow believable and realistic. That&#8217;s easier said than done with a property like <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, which is full of all sorts of fantastical, improbable things. As McQuoid adds, all of the film&#8217;s detail &#8220;gives the audience a sense of realism and connectivity to this world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, &#8220;MMA fighter Cole Young, accustomed to taking a beating for money, is unaware of his heritage—or why Outworld&#8217;s Emperor Shang Tsung has sent his best warrior, Sub-Zero, an otherworldly Cryomancer, to hunt Cole down. Fearing for his family&#8217;s safety, Cole goes in search of Sonya Blade at the direction of Jax, a Special Forces Major who bears the same strange dragon marking Cole was born with. Soon, he finds himself at the temple of Lord Raiden, an Elder God and the protector of Earthrealm, who grants sanctuary to those who bear the mark. Here, Cole trains with experienced warriors Liu Kang, Kung Lao and rogue mercenary Kano, as he prepares to stand with Earth&#8217;s greatest champions against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe. But will Cole be pushed hard enough to unlock his arcana—the immense power from within his soul—in time to save not only his family, but to stop Outworld once and for all?&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Mortal Kombat</em> hits theaters and HBO Max on <strong>April 23, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mortal-kombat-featurette/\">&#8216;Mortal Kombat&#8217; Featurette Highlights the International Cast</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/-ztSpvBv214\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 23:30:25 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"01cebe259b36fe9993eda22be254bad2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-20-325_7f94ddd035b13152.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":37111,"destBytes":22654,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-featurette-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-20-325_7f94ddd035b13152.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-25-093_d996a1313afa5e48.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-ztSpvBv214:_q80u0rH7YE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn12@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-25-158_7251fcdcecdfe662.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/-ztSpvBv214":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-25-136_3186598438640e79.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Godzilla vs. Kong’ Honest Trailer: No Matter Who Wins, Hong Kong Loses","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665708","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665734 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godzillavskong-hongkong-fight-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Godzilla vs Kong Honest Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godzillavskong-hongkong-fight.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godzillavskong-hongkong-fight-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em></strong> arrived in theaters last weekend, bringing some monster mayhem back to the big screen (and HBO Max) and proving that the box office will have no problem bouncing back when the coronavirus pandemic is over. Unfortunately for Hong Kong, they won&#8217;t have much to go back to now that Godzilla and King Kong have made the city their unofficial tag team partner.

But <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> could certainly give them a run for their money. Sure, there&#8217;s a quick scene that shows Hong Kong being evacuated and emergency shelters made for withstanding Titan attacks. But there&#8217;s also a shot from inside one of the Hong Kong skyscrapers during the fight, and it&#8217;s clear a lot of people didn&#8217;t get a chance to get away before the fight started.</p>\n<p>We may never know how many perished in that fight, but we know that Godzilla and King Kong didn&#8217;t give a shit. Maybe it&#8217;s because they already know enough about the humans that the movie focuses on and they assume that the rest of the human population is just as disposable. We couldn&#8217;t blame them if that&#8217;s what they were thinking. Both Team Godzilla and Team Kong are pretty irresponsible and the roles they play in the movie don&#8217;t make much sense. But I guess we can&#8217;t just have two hours of monster fighting. Why?

Except for Sheldon and Grace&#8217;s kids, who would very much not like to be the &#8220;ideal&#8221; their parents represent. &#8220;Imagine <em>The Incredibles</em>, but the kids were a nightmare,&#8221; Millar said in an <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jupiters-legacy-first-look-photos/\">interview</a> about the Netflix series recently, which seems to accurately capture the tone of <em>Jupiter&#8217;s Legacy</em>. <em>The Incredibles</em> but &#8220;realistic.&#8221; But the problem is that we&#8217;re starting to see a saturation of those kind of &#8220;subversive&#8221; comic book stories, such as with Amazon&#8217;s <em>Invincible</em> animated series, based on the Robert Kirkman comics, and even that <em>Superman &#38; Lois</em> CW series. What does <em>Jupiter&#8217;s Legacy</em> have to offer that the many others don&#8217;t? For one, Josh Duhamel in that white wig. That&#8217;s pretty neat.</p>\n<p><em>Jupiter’s Legacy</em> also stars <strong>Elena Kampouris</strong> (<em>Sacred Lies</em>) and <strong>Andrew Horton</strong> (<em>How to Talk to Girls at Parties</em>).</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Jupiter&#8217;s Legacy</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After nearly a century of keeping mankind safe, the world’s first generation of superheroes must look to their children to continue the legacy. But tensions rise as the young superheroes, hungry to prove their worth, struggle to live up to their parents’ legendary public reputations — and exacting personal standards.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Jupiter&#8217;s Legacy</em> premieres on Netflix on <strong>May 7, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jupiters-legacy-trailer/\">&#8216;Jupiter&#8217;s Legacy&#8217; Trailer: Josh Duhamel&#8217;s Aging Superhero Passes the Torch in Mark Millar&#8217;s Netflix Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZiKkpzpzWOA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:30:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jupiters-legacy-1-700x260.jpg","linkMd5":"bfe853226d3bcf7fa707dcac1429208c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-37-32-372_71c22d52b6da7b43.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":260,"sourceBytes":19155,"destBytes":11596,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jupiters-legacy-1-700x260.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-37-32-372_71c22d52b6da7b43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-25-364_c748f3ed749055f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZiKkpzpzWOA:BnU3JCZeJLU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-25-035_33d2c30f8fb4eb00.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZiKkpzpzWOA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn50@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-24-603_5a8e2ae83373f8f9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"‘Mainstream’ Trailer: Maya Hawke Looks For Internet Stardom and Finds Andrew Garfield Instead","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665705","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665713\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mainstream trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Those darn kids these days, with their smartphones and Snapchats and, uh, LiveJournals! When will they stop looking at the screen and see the big picture? I don&#8217;t know, but in the meantime, here&#8217;s <strong><em>Mainstream</em></strong>, a very loud-seeming movie from director <strong>Gia Coppola</strong>. <em>Stranger Things</em> breakout <strong>Maya Hawke</strong> plays a young woman hoping for internet stardom, and she soon gets her wish when she teams up with a mysterious weirdo played by <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong>. But fame corrupts, as the saying goes, and online celebrity might not be all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. Watch the <em>Mainstream</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665705\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Mainstream Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rlpm36Vi-3U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Mainstream</em> has been playing the festival circuit, having made its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2020. The reaction has been&#8230;not great – it&#8217;s currently sitting at a rotten 36% on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mainstream\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. But soon viewers will have a chance to see this thing for themselves as <em>Mainstream</em> heads to theaters and VOD <strong>May 7, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Mainstream</em>, &#8220;a young woman (Maya Hawke) thinks she’s found a path to internet stardom when she starts making YouTube videos with a charismatic stranger (Andrew Garfield) – until the dark side of viral celebrity threatens to ruin them both.&#8221; Based on this trailer, <em>Mainstream</em> is going to be&#8230;a lot. It looks like a loud, exhausting movie, and watching the trailer just made me feel approximately 150 years old. But hey, Andrew Garfield looks like he&#8217;s having a lot of fun here. In addition to Hawke and Garfield, <em>Mainstream</em> also features <strong>Nat Wolff</strong>, <strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>, <strong>Alexa Demie</strong>, <strong>Johnny Knoxville</strong>, and <strong>Jake Paul</strong>.</p>\n<p>Director Gia Coppola previously said that Elia Kazan&#8217;s <em>A Face In The Crowd</em>, about a grifter who gets drunk with fame, served as an inspiration for <em>Mainstream</em>. &#8220;I connected with it from a female point of view like losing your instincts and morals and getting overshadowed because you want to be loved and to love…Then you put that with someone and the dangers that can come along with that,&#8221; she told Deadline. In a separate interview, she <a href=\"https://www.theitalianreve.com/interview-with-gia-coppola-mainstream-a-film-to-photograph-an-alienating-reality/\">added</a>: &#8220;It took 7 years to get this movie off the ground; when I wrote it I didn’t realize how different and complicated it seems to people, in the film industry if you are not a genre it’s hard to make it; it’s a unique, weird and different film so it took a long time to get financing and that kept falling through but I always believed that the movie kind of tells you when it’s ready and that the right people are all in place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mainstream-trailer/\">&#8216;Mainstream&#8217; Trailer: Maya Hawke Looks For Internet Stardom and Finds Andrew Garfield Instead</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4PQ6GTcdDNU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 23:00:02 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"dfc03ba32087eef81a805fbeae27d533","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn71@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-48-428_8206e46bd7d6b239.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":30011,"destBytes":16512,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mainstream-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn71@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-48-428_8206e46bd7d6b239.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-24-560_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn37@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-30-632_cd2eed3c3e460edd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-566_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4PQ6GTcdDNU:uvTaXzGk7J0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-24-450_6af7d904512bd400.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4PQ6GTcdDNU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn9@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-24-564_8c9805a545af5ea9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817051869},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:31","title":"The Quarantine Stream: ‘Hemingway’ Strives to Deconstruct the Self-Created Myth of Ernest Hemingway","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665715","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hemingway-quarantine-stream.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665726\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hemingway-quarantine-stream-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Hemingway quarantine stream\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hemingway-quarantine-stream-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hemingway-quarantine-stream-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hemingway-quarantine-stream-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hemingway-quarantine-stream.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a series where the /Film team shares what they&#8217;ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Movie: </strong><em>Hemingway</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It:</strong> PBS</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch: </strong>A six-hour, three-part documentary from <strong>Ken Burns</strong> and <strong>Lynn Novick</strong> that explores the life and work of Ernest Hemingway.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Quarantine Viewing: </strong>Ernest Hemingway is a literary giant. With his terse, minimalist prose he changed the face of American writing, influencing countless writers for years to come. His contribution to the printed page cannot be ignored. But for all his greatness he was also a deeply flawed man – someone who built up his own self-image of a man&#8217;s man who liked to fight, drink, and hunt. Despite being inflicted by the horrors of World War I, he reveled in bloodshed. And despite his rigid writing schedule, he created a life of chaos – a life of constant movement, where he would burn through wives, endure multiple head injuries, and ultimately die by suicide.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665715\"></span></p>\n<p>When we think of Ernest Hemingway, we probably tend to think more of his image than of his actual writing. Yes, Hemingway&#8217;s work is monumental, but it&#8217;s more the man himself that tends to captivate. This was primarily Hemingway&#8217;s own doing – he mythologized himself, embellishing his own backstory to create the image of the manliest of men. A man of adventure, and action. A man of pure, unbridled passion. He loved to drink, kill, fight, and fuck, and he wanted everyone to know it.</p>\n<p>To be clear: Hemingway wasn&#8217;t making all of this up out of thin air. He really <em>did</em> do things, and was constantly seeking out adventure, or at least his own personal idea of adventure. But as <em>Hemingway</em>, the new three-part documentary from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick points out, even in Hemingway&#8217;s own era, his uber-masculinity and machismo seemed dated and even comical. While they were quick to praise his prose, critics weren&#8217;t above pointing out the flaws in Hemingway&#8217;s bravado. His almost sadistic love of the barbaric &#8220;sport&#8221; of bullfighting was not above criticism.</p>\n<p><em>Hemingway</em> is a fascinating documentary because it presents Hemingway, flaws and all, without striving to make a statement. Burns and Novik aren&#8217;t trying to &#8220;cancel&#8221; Hemingway, but they&#8217;re not exactly celebrating him, either. Instead, they are presenting us with as complete a picture as possible of the man&#8217;s life, warts and all.</p>\n<p>That means the documentary is equal parts awe for Hemingway&#8217;s work and recoiling horror at some of his detestable behavior. Yes, he could write, and write better than almost anyone else of his era. But he was also blatantly racist and cruel, often verbally and in some cases physically abusing his four wives. These are abhorrent behaviors no matter what the era, but <em>Hemingway</em> also finds sympathy for the man. Clinical depression ran in his family, and Hemingway&#8217;s own father died by suicide. This death disgusted the young Hemingway, who saw his father&#8217;s final decision as weakness. And yet, as Hemingway got older, and his own depression sunk its claws into his brain, he finally began to understand what his father went through.</p>\n<p>Some of the subjects interviewed here are a bit too enamored with Hemingway – Edna O&#8217;Brien seems particularly dismissive of any mention of Hemingway&#8217;s many flaws – but Burns and Novik keep things centered and do their best to tell Hemingway&#8217;s story with often brutal honesty. They also often let the man&#8217;s work speak for itself – in the form of <strong>Jeff Daniels</strong>, who voices Hemingway here and spends long stretches reading out excerpts from the author&#8217;s work.
