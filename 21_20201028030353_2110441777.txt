Obviously, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has felt the biggest impact from the mockumentary sequel, but since he&#8217;s <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8216;s lawyer, the increasingly unstable president has been inundated with questions about the scandal in question. So of course it&#8217;s prompted some verbal sparring between the petty world leader and Borat star and creator <strong>Sacha Baron Cohen</strong>. But that&#8217;s not all.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the release of <em>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</em>, there&#8217;s also been a lawsuit dismissed that was filed by a family member of one of the film&#8217;s most pivotal subjects. Plus, the Kazakhstan tourism board is officially embracing one of Borat&#8217;s catchphrases as part of their marketing campaign. And finally, Sacha Baron Cohen himself has released some unseen footage in which his life was put at risk during a key sequence. Get the lowdown on all of the <em>Borat 2</em> controversy and aftermath below.<span id=\"more-643125\"></span></p>\n<h2>Donald Trump Lashes Out at Sacha Baron Cohen</h2>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that Donald Trump has unkind words (via <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-campaigns-983f1a333b3acd4d5a6311254fb594ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The AP</a>) for Sacha Baron Cohen and his Borat antics, especially since it brought further humiliation upon his administration and all the clowns in it. While flying on Air Force One last Friday, Trump was asked about the <em>Borat</em> sequel, and Trump said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">I don’t know what happened. But years ago, you know, [Sacha Baron Cohen] tried to scam me, and I was the only one who said no way. That’s a phony guy. I don&#8217;t find him funny. To me, he&#8217;s a creep.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ah, yes. After all these years, Donald Trump is the only one who said no way. But in reality, Trump is probably just pissed that he was duped enough to sit down with Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s character Ali G in an interview that didn&#8217;t last very long.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP5ElraFHHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The super smart Donald Trump talks about people doing business as early as &#8220;hundreds of millions of years ago,&#8221; when everyone was trading in rocks and stones. Forget about the fact that humans have only been on Earth for roughly seven million years, but clearly this guy is too smart to be scammed, right?</p>\n<p>For his part, Cohen had the perfect response for the little orange man with the sad face:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald—I appreciate the free publicity for Borat! I admit, I don’t find you funny either. But yet the whole world laughs at you. </p>\n<p>I’m always looking for people to play racist buffoons, and you’ll need a job after Jan. 20.

The daughter of one of the film&#8217;s more prominent subjects filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that her mother was tricked into appearing in <em>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Judith Dim Evans</strong> is the Jewish woman and Holocaust survivor who appears in a pivotal sequence in the Borat sequel. Baron Cohen, as Borat, enters a synagogue dressed as a grotesque representation of a Jewish person with a long nose, a bag of money, and Payot sidelocks (Baron Cohen himself is Jewish and has frequently tackled anti-Semitism in his work). In the synagogue are two women, one being Judith Dim Evans, but rather than shun Borat when he appears in this holy place in such an offensive fashion, she embraces him and takes it as an opportunity to educate him. It&#8217;s a turning point for Borat as a character and one of the rare occasions of a wholly kind and decent person interacting with him.</p>\n<p>However, Evans&#8217; daughter Michelle Dim St. Pierre felt she needed to file a lawsuit and sought a court order that would have forced the producers to remove Evans from the film. She filed the suit on behalf of her mother’s estate, alleging that Amazon and Oak Springs productions misappropriated her mother’s likeness. Well, a Georgia judge disagreed and refused to issue an injunction, and St. Pierre withdrew the lawsuit entirely.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not sure if St. Pierre hadn&#8217;t seen the movie yet and assumed that Sacha Baron Cohen attempted to make her mother the butt of a joke. Judith Dim Evans unfortunately passed away since shooting her interview with Borat, so she couldn&#8217;t speak for herself on the matter. Considering how heart-warming her mother&#8217;s response is to Borat, I don&#8217;t see how the movie is misappropriating Ms. Evans&#8217; likeness.</p>\n<p>In the end, not only is <em>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</em> dedicated to Ms. Evans, but after the scene in question was filmed, Cohen had someone explain who he was and how Borat was being used as a means of calling attention to ignorance and satirizing those who view Jewish people in such a negative way. The filmmakers <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/10/sacha-baron-cohen-borat-sequel-combat-holocaust-deniai-sites-facebook-twitter-evolving-lawsuit-1234598201/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also helped create a website</a> in her honor, and at some point there will be a way to hear her Holocaust story as bonus content through Amazon&#8217;s X-ray feature.</p>\n<p>Russell Smith, the legal representative for Amazon, said in a statement (via <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/borat-lawsuit-holocaust-survivor-interview-dismissed-1234815936/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sacha Baron Cohen was deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with Judith Dim Evans, whose compassion and courage as a Holocaust survivor has touched the hearts of millions of people who have seen the film. Judith’s life is a powerful rebuke to those who deny the Holocaust, and with this film and his activism, Sacha Baron Cohen will continue his advocacy to combat Holocaust denial around the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRGXq4t9wY4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Kazakhstan Tourism Adopts One of Borat&#8217;s Catchphrases</h2>\n<p>While some have chosen to place their crosshairs on Sacha Baron Cohen and his Borat character, there is one organization who is embracing the fictional reporter&#8217;s comedic antics. Kazakhstan&#8217;s tourism board is using Borat as a marketing tool by taking his catchphrase &#8220;Very nice!&#8221; and putting it in advertising spots, as you can see above.</p>\n<p>Kairat Sadvakassov, deputy chairman of Kazakh Tourism added in a statement (via <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54702974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BBC</a>), &#8220;Kazakhstan&#8217;s nature is very nice. Its food is very nice. And its people, despite Borat&#8217;s jokes to the contrary, are some of the nicest in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re throwing a little bit of shade at Borat, but at least they&#8217;re taking the jokes in stride. The idea came from an American advertiser named Dennis Keen and his friend Yermek Utemissov, who produced the advertisements for Kazakhstan, but not everyone with ties to the country is happy about Borat.</p>\n<p>Yet again proving that they just don&#8217;t understand the point of Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s satirical character, The Kazakh American Association said the sequel <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/borat-sequel-promotes-racism-cultural-appropriation-and-xenophobia-kazakh-american-association-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shamelessly promotes</a> &#8220;racism, cultural appropriation and xenophobia.&#8221; In fact, more than 100,000 people signed an online petition demanding a cancellation of the film after the first trailer was released.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0h0vs1bY4w?start=295&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Sacha Baron Cohen Barely Escapes a Right-Wing Rally</h2>\n<p>The people of Kazakhstan aren&#8217;t the only ones who have been angered by Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s trickery. As the comedian revealed during a recent appearance on <em><strong>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</strong></em>, his life was put in danger when his presence at a right-wing rally was brought to the attention of those attending it.</p>\n<p>Sacha Baron Cohen appears as Borat in disguise as a character called Country Steve, who takes to the stage at a right-wing rally to sing a song about how China created the coronavirus pandemic and howe they should chop up journalists &#8220;like the Saudis do.&#8221; Needless to say, the crowd was eating it up. But the rally took a turn for the worse, though we don&#8217;t get to see it in the movie. Cohen recounted the situation and showed footage that we didn&#8217;t get to see (starting around 4:56 in the video above)</p>\n<p>Cohen explains exactly what went wrong with the gag:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone was singing along and the problem was that some of the militia groups that were in this rally had been antagonizing the Black Lives Matter protesters, so as revenge some of the Black Lives Matter protesters were coming over to confront them. One of them went, ‘Oh my God, it’s Sacha Baron Cohen!’ Word got out that it was me, and then the organizers and a lot of people in the crowd got very angry. They tried to storm the stage. Luckily for me, I had hired the security, so it took them a while to actually storm the stage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cohen makes a getaway in an ambulance that appears to belong to the production. However, even though Cohen had security and an escape plan in place, that didn&#8217;t keep him from fearing for his life. He wrote in <a href=\"https://time.com/5897501/conspiracy-theory-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TIME</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Under my overalls, I was wearing a bulletproof vest, but it felt inadequate with some people outside toting semiautomatic weapons. When someone ripped open the door to drag me out, I used my entire body weight to pull the door back shut until our vehicle maneuvered free. I was fortunate to make it out in one piece.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can see that all unfold in the video above, and you can watch <em>Borat</em> <em>Subsequent Moviefilm</em> on Amazon Prime now.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/borat-2-controversy-lawsuit-and-more/\">&#8216;Borat 2&#8217; Round-Up: Sacha Baron Cohen Attacked, A Lawsuit Dismissed, Kazakhstan Tourism, and Donald Trump Sparring</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/vwij2rurPq0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:30:32 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat2-countrysteve-concert-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"d0710fa831268dbc21b2a0e6a4d57bf7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-18-908_527a96e3aea77cfd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32864,"destBytes":18034,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat2-countrysteve-concert-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-18-908_527a96e3aea77cfd.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat2-synagogue-woman-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn6@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-35-441_4dd6609d27e99db2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn72@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-36-286_d90bf93f325c6117.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vwij2rurPq0:BQDHxHPakZs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn92@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-36-323_bfd9266d8f754a0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/vwij2rurPq0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn20@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-35-431_5d89a2778f336d2c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180247},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"‘Freaky’ Trailer: What’s a Girl to Do When She Ends Up Trapped in a Serial Killer’s Body?","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643156","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-643179 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/freaky-kathrynnewton-slomowalk-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Freaky Trailer - Kathryn Newton\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/freaky-kathrynnewton-slomowalk.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/freaky-kathrynnewton-slomowalk-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Sadly, there&#8217;s no Friday the 13th in October.

Taking a familiar comedy formula and mixing it with horror is a stroke of brilliance, and while an idea like this could have easily ended up being extremely stupid, everything we&#8217;ve seen so far makes it look like Landon has done a great job bridging the laughs with the terror.</p>\n<p>Despite the unbelievable premise of the movie, which has been succinctly described as Freaky Friday the 13th, the filmmakers said the key to making the movie work was by keeping the performances <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/freaky-nycc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as grounded as possible</a> so it doesn&#8217;t feel too wacky and fly off the rails.

But when she becomes the newest target of The Butcher (Vince Vaughn), her town’s infamous serial killer, her senior year becomes the least of her worries.</p>\n<p>When The Butcher’s mystical ancient dagger causes him and Millie to wake up in each other’s bodies, Millie learns that she has just 24 hours to get her body back before the switch becomes permanent and she’s trapped in the form of a middle-aged maniac forever.

This HBO doc profiles psychiatrist<strong> Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis</strong>, who has devoted her career to studying serial killers and what makes them act the way they do. There&#8217;s a wealth of documentaries, and docuseries, devoted to serial killers, but so many of them tend to only focus on the crimes themselves rather than the root cause. Sure, it&#8217;s easy to shrug-off the actions of someone like Ted Bundy by saying he was just out of his mind, but Dr. Lewis&#8217; work suggests otherwise. Watch the <em>Crazy, Not Insane</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642993\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Crazy Not Insane Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVrOVlS5TMU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I read and watch a lot about serial killers (maybe I shouldn&#8217;t admit that in print, but here we are!), and I&#8217;m always interested when a film or book tries to take a new approach to the material at hand. A great example came just this year – <em>I&#8217;ll Be Gone in the Dark</em>, HBO&#8217;s excellent portrait of Michelle McNamara&#8217;s quest to find the Golden State Killer. That series bucked convention by focusing more on McNamara&#8217;s hunt, and on the surviving victims, rather than the grisly details and the killer&#8217;s identity, and it felt like a genuinely mold-breaking approach.</p>\n<p>Now, HBO has another serial killer-themed doc on the way: <em>Crazy, Not Insane, </em>which focuses on psychiatrist Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis and her study of serial killers. The doc comes from Alex Gibney, who somehow manages to make about a bazillion documentaries a year. The official press notes for <em>Crazy, Not Insane</em> say that it&#8217;s a &#8220;stylistic departure&#8221; for Gibney, with the filmmaker using &#8220;an eclectic mix of cinema verité, videotapes of psychiatric evaluations, hand-drawn animation and home movies in order to explore the complexities of the human mind. Lewis’s literary voice is read by actress Laura Dern to bring further insight into Lewis’ career and her cases through her writings. From images of Dr. Lewis scribbling on legal pads in her unruly living room to studio art classes she takes in life-drawing, Gibney’s portrait of Lewis intends to show a woman of limitless curiosity willing to explore places others are unwilling to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dr. Lewis began working with children, including violent juvenile offenders. This lead her to further explore &#8220;the way that trauma in childhood – often coupled with some neurological damage – can sow the seeds of murderous impulses in adults,&#8221; which in turn lead her to become an expert in dissociative identity disorder. <em>Crazy, Not Insane</em> arrives on <strong>November 18</strong>. The film will be available on HBO and to stream on HBO Max.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/crazy-not-insane-trailer/\">&#8216;Crazy, Not Insane&#8217; Trailer: A Look Into the Minds Of Serial Killers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BT0TYGDXIPM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 00:00:15 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/crazy-not-insane-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f994957ae87d3872827e20def4c828b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-18-717_04dc28905aabc7d2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":42373,"destBytes":30346,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/crazy-not-insane-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-18-717_04dc28905aabc7d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn62@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-35-422_d9cd78023875ce15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BT0TYGDXIPM:Vlc-Z1eAmU4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn24@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-35-430_7400f0e419ae18cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BT0TYGDXIPM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn100@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-35-384_d5eacafdf2c1c390.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180250},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"John David Washington is ‘Born to Be Murdered’ in Thriller Acquired by Netflix","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643157","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643158\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742-700x355.jpg\" alt=\"born to be murdered\" width=\"700\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742-700x355.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742-360x183.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742-768x390.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>John David Washington</strong> is having a killer year. After becoming the breakout star of Spike Lee’s <em>BlaKkKlansman</em> in 2018, Washington nabbed a role in the Christopher Nolan tentpole <strong><em>Tenet</em></strong>, which hit theaters (to somewhat divisive results both critically and commercially) this year. And now Washington is continuing that killing streak with a thriller produced by <strong>Luca Guadagnino</strong>, <em><strong>Born to Be Murdered</strong></em><em>, </em>which has just been picked up by Netflix.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-643157\"></span></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-picks-up-john-david-washington-thriller-born-to-be-murdered-exclusive?utm_source=Sailthru&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News&#38;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Netflix has acquired the global rights to <em>Born to Be Murdered</em>, a thriller starring John David Washington and produced by Luca Guadagnino that is set to be the English-language debut of director <strong>Ferdinando Cito Filomarino</strong>, who worked as a second unit director on Guadagnino&#8217;s <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>, <em>A Bigger Splash”</em> and <em>Suspiria</em>. <strong>Alicia Vikander</strong> (<em>Earthquake Bird</em>), <strong>Boyd Holbrook</strong> (<em>Logan</em>), and <strong>Vicky Krieps</strong> (<em>Phantom Thread</em>) are also set to star.</p>\n<p>Written by <strong>Kevin Rice</strong>, <em>Born to be Murdered</em> is set in Athens and the Epirus region of Greece and follows &#8220;a vacationing couple, played by Washington and Vikander, who fall prey to a violent conspiracy with tragic consequences.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The movie&#8217;s got a vague synopsis but a great title that recalls that of Alfred Hitchcock suspense films. It&#8217;s too general a description to really be certain that <em>Born to Be Murdered</em> takes cues from Hitchcock, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m deciding, since Hitchcock is seeing renewed appreciation — both as a source of inspiration (see: <em>Parasite</em>, etc.) and in our ongoing rebootmania, with Netflix&#8217;s recent adaptation of <em>Rebecca</em>.</p>\n<p>Guadagnino is producing <em>Born to Be Murdered</em> along with and Morabito for their Frenesy Films, as well as Francesco Melzi d’Eril and Gabriele Moratti for MeMo with Raicinema. Rodrigo Teixeira is executive producing for RT Features. While this is set to be Filomarino&#8217;s English-language debut, the filmmaker (who is related to Italian auteur Luchio Visconti) already made his feature directorial debut with the 2015 biopic <em>Antonia</em>.</p>\n<p>And Filomarino has quite a line-up for his first English-language film. Washington, like I noted before, is having a banner year — having recently starred in Nolan&#8217;s <em>Tenet</em>, and will be seen soon in the upcoming <em>Malcolm &#38; Marie</em> opposite Zendaya, which was filmed in quarantine and also acquired by Netflix. washington has also recently joined the cast of David O. Russell&#8217;s next film opposite Margot Robbie and Christian Bale. Vikander, Holbrook, and Krieps are all solid talents, with Krieps especially impressing in <em>Phantom Thread</em>.</p>\n<p>Netflix is planning a release for <em>Born to Be Murdered</em> in 2021.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/john-david-washington-born-to-be-murdered-netflix/\">John David Washington is &#8216;Born to Be Murdered&#8217; in Thriller Acquired by Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9quec81fmmc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 22:00:54 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742-700x355.jpg","linkMd5":"f85f808f15ca1046a6af1eda9b762448","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-18-705_6bfe2e904fb13942.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":355,"sourceBytes":34457,"destBytes":18836,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-tenet-e1603816325742-700x355.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-18-705_6bfe2e904fb13942.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn36@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-36-446_45ce342ffac0e044.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9quec81fmmc:fw85m3-6GmM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn76@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-35-532_f2196dcf73fd9f5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9quec81fmmc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn99@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-36-489_87b0c522f5ebe5bf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"Mondo Releasing Four Universal Monsters Puzzles for Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, Creature from the Black Lagoon","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643201","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643211\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frankenstein-puzzle-e1603825899925-700x320.jpg\" alt=\"mondo universal monsters puzzles\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frankenstein-puzzle-e1603825899925-700x320.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frankenstein-puzzle-e1603825899925-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frankenstein-puzzle-e1603825899925-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frankenstein-puzzle-e1603825899925.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be a graveyard smash over at Mondo, who are releasing four Universal Monsters puzzles this December.

The pop culture apparel company is debuting four Universal Monsters puzzles for Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, and Creature from the Black Lagoon all designed by poster artist Francesco Francavilla. <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/extras/news/1153266-exclusive-mondo-releasing-four-killer-universal-monsters-puzzles#/slide/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ComingSoon.Net</a> debuted the exclusive first look at the Mondo Universal Monsters puzzles, which are set to go on sale today at <a href=\"https://mondoshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MondoShop.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was so excited when Mondo asked me to turn my Universal Monsters screenprints into puzzles. After seeing how cool and entertaining the <em>Jurassic Park</em> one turned out, I jumped at the prospect to have more puzzle fun with my posters,&#8221; Francavilla told ComingSoon.Net.</p>\n<p>Francavilla also shared how he designed each piece:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For <strong>Frankenstein</strong>, it took me quite a bit to draw the lab and the cavernous walls of the castle. I think those areas will be lot of fun to fit together and see the Monster come alive!</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolf Man</strong> must be the poster where I’ve drawn more hair (fur?) than anywhere else. It’s gonna be thrilling to see the iconic Lon Chaney Jr makeup coming together against the full moon in the background. AROOOOOO!</p>\n<p>Some of my favorite classic <strong>Dracula</strong> posters featured a spider web in the design, so when asked to do my take on this classic, I had to include the web. And Bela’s chilling stare!</p>\n<p><strong>The Creature from the Black Lagoon</strong> is one of my fave designs in movies ever — I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve drawn this guy. For the puzzle, we decided to go with my <strong>Revenge of the Creature</strong> poster because I thought the design and intricacy of the art would be really fun and challenging.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Each puzzle, priced at $20, is 1000 pieces and is 20&#8243; x 28&#8243;. The items are expected to ship in December 2020, making it the perfect spooky holiday gift.</p>\n<p>And this Universal Monster mash is getting even more crowded, with the release of new Universal Monsters items including Figures, Tikis, Apparel, and pins.</p>\n<p>See the preview image for the Frankenstein poster below.

Did we <em>really</em> need another nostalgia-driven rehash of a show from another generation?</p>\n<p>But after watching this new trailer, I&#8217;m surprised to find that I&#8217;ve warmed considerably to the concept. The reason? The trailer seems to indicate that the meta approach seen in the first teaser is not merely a couple of cute, winky jokes sprinkled throughout the series, but an actual exploration of early <em>Saved by the Bell</em> and its characters as seen from a more modern, inclusive perspective. Watch the new <em>Saved by the Bell</em> trailer below.<span id=\"more-643168\"></span></p>\n<h2>Saved by the Bell Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0uCr5-5p5Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The thing this <em>Saved by the Bell</em> trailer reminded me of the most is not the original <em>Saved by the Bell</em>, but Phil Lord and Chris Miller&#8217;s <em>21 Jump Street</em>, a movie which interrogated the premise of its decades-old source material through a contemporary lens.</p>\n<p>Writer/executive producer <strong>Tracey Wigfield </strong>(<em>30 Rock</em>) makes the smart decision to keep some of the original series cast members around, while putting the focus on a whole new batch of kids. Interestingly, she&#8217;s also shifting the power into unexpected hands. Remember when Zack Morris (<strong>Mark-Paul Gosselaar</strong>) used to call &#8220;time out&#8221; and the entire world would freeze in place? That power now belongs to a Latina girl named Daisy (<strong>Haskiri Velazquez</strong>). The new series also directly addresses ideas of class and privilege – topics the original series wasn&#8217;t frequently interested in exploring. And all the while, it is lovingly poking fun at the old show. (I especially appreciated the joke about the Bayside acapella group.)</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the new series, when California governor Zack Morris gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the most well-funded schools in the state – including Bayside High. The influx of new students gives the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can&#8217;t be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality. Elizabeth Berkley Lauren and Mario Lopez star in the new SAVED BY THE BELL series, reprising their roles as Jessie Spano and A.C. Slater. John Michael Higgins also stars as Principal Toddman alongside the new class featuring Belmont Cameli, Dexter Darden, Mitchell Hoog, Alycia Pascual-Peña, Josie Totah and Haskiri Velazquez.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Saved by the Bell</em> premieres on Peacock on <strong>November 25</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/saved-by-the-bell-trailer-full/\">&#8216;Saved by the Bell&#8217; Trailer: This Reboot is Taking the &#8217;21 Jump Street&#8217; Approach</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/hiRztDzVFMo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:30:28 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Saved-by-the-Bell-trailer-new-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"66cee4a319ff6c230bd281f617fb5374","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-14-774_cd5964a344423a71.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":51907,"destBytes":36546,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Saved-by-the-Bell-trailer-new-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-14-774_cd5964a344423a71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn76@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-600_1dadace9986a04e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hiRztDzVFMo:Nw671AO7hqo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-36-399_d7a283585d9a16dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/hiRztDzVFMo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn77@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-35-344_4e921b0c25fbf51f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180247},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"‘I’m a Killer Maid’ TV Series, Based on a Popular Chinese Webcomic, Being Developed by Legendary","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643239","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-a-killer-maid-tv-series.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643255\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-a-killer-maid-tv-series-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"i'm a killer maid tv series\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-a-killer-maid-tv-series-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-a-killer-maid-tv-series-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-a-killer-maid-tv-series-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-a-killer-maid-tv-series.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hey, are you a killer maid? If so, you might be interested in <strong><em>I&#8217;m a Killer Maid</em></strong>, a new TV series being developed by Legendary from a series of popular Chinese webcomics. It&#8217;s being hailed as a &#8220;rare example of Chinese IP being developed for an audience outside China,&#8221; and is being described as &#8220;<em>Mary Poppins </em>turned <em>John Wick&#8230;</em>with shades of <em>Freaky Friday</em> and <em>Killing Eve</em>.&#8221; Which is certainly something!</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-643239\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/global/legendary-entertainment-tencent-pictures-im-a-killer-maid-comic-tv-1234816913/\">Variety</a> has the scoop on the <em>I&#8217;m a Killer Maid </em>TV series, based on the webcomic from Tencent Comics. Per their report, the comic is &#8220;one of the Chinese platform&#8217;s more popular titles, with a total of 1.66 billion views worldwide so far.&#8221; The <a href=\"https://ac.qq.com/Comic/comicInfo/id/535282\">site</a> for the comic has the following synopsis: &#8220;Hao Pingqiong, an obscure otaku cartoonist, hired a maid, Xiao Baicai, to clean the house, but the two exchanged bodies! What was even more unexpected to A Qiong was that Cabbage&#8217;s true identity turned out to be a top killer, and the hilarious life began.&#8221; While another comic site <a href=\"https://1stkissmanga.com/manga/i-am-a-killer-maid/\">adds</a>: &#8220;This is the story of a mangaka, a killer maid, and body swapping ramen, with a side of gratuitous violence and explosions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Variety report adds even more info: &#8220;After retiring from the assassin group Mountain Sea, lead character Bacai tries to live a normal life as a housemaid for a shy, nerdy comic book writer who rarely leaves his house, only to accidentally swap bodies with her boss.&#8221; Legendary hopes that the TV adaptation will focus on &#8220;gender identity and expression, male/female dynamics and genre deconstruction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <em>I&#8217;m a Killer Maid</em> TV series will be produced by Tencent Pictures, with CEO and Tencent Group vice president Edward Cheng Wu serving as executive producer. Tencent Pictures&#8217; Wenxin She will oversee and serve as producer, with Vasco Xu will serving as an independent producer. The plan is to cast &#8220;a strong Asian female lead&#8221; and then surround the lead &#8220;with other diverse supporting characters who will appeal to a global audience, and treat LGBTQ themes with the greater care suitable to Western viewers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was already a made-for-streaming <em>I&#8217;m a Killer Maid</em> movie released in China, but the TV adaptation reportedly hopes to distance itself from the movie&#8217;s tongue-in-cheek approach. Here&#8217;s the trailer.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sa0Ye0jS8kE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the movie&#8217;s synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the bustling comic fair, Hao Pingqiong, a bottom-ranking cartoonist exchanges body with the No. 1 female killer Xiao Baicai. Their lives are intertwined. Now, Qiong lives no longer as a loser because he gains remarkable figure and super power, but he is in danger because he takes role of a killer. Baicai lives no longer as a killer, she doesn&#8217;t need to worry about attack of enemies, but she has to take orders from the editor and is forced to experience the life of cartoonist. Experiencing the exchange of lives, they both have the chance to understand the good things of their own lives.

The production was taking place outside of Sydney, and as reported: &#8220;The film’s outdoor locations, its local cast and crew, and its status as an independent production have meant it was not subject to studio-based furloughs and shutdowns that have hit other film shoots across the country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now it looks like the film is finished. In fact, it&#8217;s not only finished – it&#8217;s already out. In two theaters. <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3638838/new-children-corn-movie-gets-first-image-poster-art-limited-theatrical-release/\">Bloody Disgusting</a> confirmed the film had released quietly (<em>very</em> quietly) last weekend in two places – <a href=\"https://www.atomtickets.com/theaters/cmx-cinebistro-siesta-key/42749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CMX CinéBistro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atomtickets.com/theaters/fl-sarasota\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Burns Court Cinema</a>, both located in Sarasota, Flordia. So if you&#8217;re a <em>huge</em> fan of all-things <em>Children of the Corn</em>, and <em>must</em> see this on a big screen, I guess you better high-tail it to Florida.</p>\n<p>In this latest take on the tale, &#8220;A psychopathic twelve-year-old girl in a small town in Nebraska recruits all the other children and goes on a bloody rampage, killing the corrupt adults and anyone else who opposes her. A bright high schooler who won’t go along with the plan, is the town’s only hope of survival.&#8221; <strong>Kurt Wimmer</strong>, director of the gun-fu trashterpiece <em>Equilibrium</em>, is behind the camera for this latest <em>Corn</em> incarnation.</p>\n<p>First published in 1977 and later collected in the s short story collection <em>Night Shift</em>, Stephen King&#8217;s <em>Children of the Corn</em> story follows a squabbling couple as they get caught in a spooky town where evil kids worship a god who lives out in all that corn. This latest film is said to be a <em>very</em> lose adaptation, which is par for the course for the series, which has never really stuck close to King&#8217;s text. <em>Children of the Corn</em> was adapted into a film in 1984 and spawned seven sequels and two prequels, all of which are kind of terrible.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume this latest <em>Children of the Corn</em> will find its way to home video fairly soon. In the meantime, here&#8217;s a poster.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-poster.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-643225\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-poster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-poster.jpg 520w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-poster-333x500.jpg 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/children-of-the-corn-reboot-release/\">New &#8216;Children of the Corn&#8217; Reboot is Already in Theaters, Apparently (Two Theaters, to Be Exact)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/epLDGBKofig\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 21:30:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-reboot-release-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"68d274e7d71197db1e92589699438a12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-18-822_b142f8f923b2820d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":67205,"destBytes":54176,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-reboot-release-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-18-822_b142f8f923b2820d.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/children-of-the-corn-poster.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-106_c310d8202ee6117d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn88@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-35-557_ab50a1a2716744f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=epLDGBKofig:YRy8NpFmRPQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn87@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-35-457_43b39bb8ef690288.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/epLDGBKofig":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-35-347_849786fc2112f146.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"BlumFest 2020 Halloween Event Brings Together Stars of ‘Freaky,’ ‘The Craft: Legacy,’ and Of Course, ‘Halloween’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643139","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643144\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-lee-curtis-vince-vaughn-kathryn-newton-700x350.jpg\" alt=\"blumfest 2020\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-lee-curtis-vince-vaughn-kathryn-newton-700x350.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-lee-curtis-vince-vaughn-kathryn-newton-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-lee-curtis-vince-vaughn-kathryn-newton-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-lee-curtis-vince-vaughn-kathryn-newton.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Halloween is just around the corner, and there&#8217;s nothing spookier than having to spend it on your own without friends and social fun.

The Lionsgate action-drama starring <strong>Kerry Washington</strong> and <strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong> follows an estranged husband and wife who find themselves on the run from their former shadow ops unit.<strong> Leon Chills</strong> (<em>Spinning Out</em>) and <strong>Joe Carnahan</strong> (<em>Narc</em>) wrote the script.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-643151\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/victoria-mahoney-movie-shadow-kerry-washington-1234815773/\">Variety</a> (and others) are reporting that <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> second unit director Victoria Mahoney will direct <em>Shadow Force</em> for Lionsgate. The film &#8220;follows an estranged husband and wife (portrayed by Washington and Brown) with a bounty on their heads. They are forced to go on the run with their son to avoid their former employer — a unit of shadow ops that have been sent to kill them.&#8221; Mahoney&#8217;s credits include episodes of <em>Lovecraft Country</em>, <em>You</em>, <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em>, and more, along with the upcoming feature film <em>Kill Them All</em>.</p>\n<p>This premise sounds promising, and Washington and Brown are both very talented, charismatic actors, so this is a film to look out for. And sure, <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> was a complete mess from start to finish, but that&#8217;s not Mahoney&#8217;s fault. The <em>Lovecraft Country</em> episode she directed – titled &#8220;A History of Violence&#8221; – was particularly good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Victoria is one of the most impressive and in-demand directors working today,&#8221; said Erin Westerman, president of production for the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. &#8220;Like with all of her work, she will bring iconic action, warmth, style, and gravitas to ‘Shadow Force.’ We know she, along with Kerry and Sterling and the talented production team will elevate this exciting production.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Washington and Brown added in a statement: &#8220;We are absolutely thrilled to be working with Victoria Mahoney. Her vision is inspiring. Her enthusiasm is infectious. Her artistry and insight have already deepened this electrifying project.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Shadow Force</em> will be produced by Stephen Love through his Made with Love Media company, along with Washington, who will produce through her production company Simpson Street and Brown, who will produce through his Indian Meadows Productions. Executive producers include Danielle Reardon, Jennifer Wiley-Stockton, and Katherine Atkinson.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no indication as to when we might see this movie, probably because everything is up in the air right now because we&#8217;re stuck in some sort of nightmarish computer simulation that&#8217;s been collapsing around us for the last few years. Hopefully, that gets sorted out sometime soon, because I&#8217;m kind of over it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/shadow-force/\">&#8216;Shadow Force&#8217;: &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; Second Unit Director Victoria Mahoney Will Helm Kerry Washington and Sterling K.

And oh yeah, gin salesman and occasional actor <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> is one of the executive producers.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-643192\"></span></p>\n<p>Lionsgate just announced <em>Shotgun Wedding</em>, an action-comedy that will bring together Jennifer Lopez and Armie Hammer, a combination sure to make some people in the audience pop their eyeballs out of their heads like horny Tex Avery cartoons. In the film, &#8220;Darcy (Jennifer Lopez) and Tom (Armie Hammer) gather their lovable but very opinionated families for the ultimate destination wedding just as the couple begin to get cold feet. And if that wasn’t enough of a threat to the celebration, suddenly everyone’s lives are in danger when the entire party is taken hostage. &#8216;Til Death Do Us Part&#8217; takes on a whole new meaning in this hilarious, adrenaline-fueled adventure as Darcy and Tom must save their loved ones — if they don’t kill each other first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sounds fun, I guess! Look, I like Jennifer Lopez and Armie Hammer, but they both have a weird track record of making rather lackluster stuff while occasionally reminding us they can be great with stuff like <em>Hustlers</em> and <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>. Will <em>Shotgun Wedding</em> be one of those pleasant surprises? I guess we&#8217;ll find out!</p>\n<p>Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman, producers of <em>Wonder</em>, are producing <em>Shotgun Wedding</em>. Other producers include Jennifer Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina. Jason Moore, director of <em>Sisters</em> and <em>Pitch-Perfect</em>, is at the helm, with a script by Mark Hammer and Liz Meriwether. And Ryan Reynolds is an executive producer, which suggests at one point he was probably going to star in this thing and dropped out, but will still be receiving a credit (and a paycheck). Good for him!</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jennifer and Armie’s irresistible magnetism, separately and together, make them the perfect pairing for this action-comedy,&#8221; said Erin Westerman, President of Production for Lionsgate&#8217;s Motion Picture Group. &#8220;They are both incredibly funny actors that can also deliver on the action, but what sets this movie apart is the way their infectious chemistry commands the screen. You can&#8217;t take your eyes off them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No word yet on when production might begin, or when we might see <em>Shotgun Wedding</em>. Maybe tomorrow! Probably not, though.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/shotgun-wedding/\">&#8216;Shotgun Wedding&#8217;: Jennifer Lopez and Armie Hammer Will Attempt to Get Hitched in New Action-Comedy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lk7rPU-Bp2M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 23:30:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shotgun-wedding-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"d3fa044d502be9ba438b46458befc24d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-34-418_85dddfbb583eb82e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":34435,"destBytes":21104,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shotgun-wedding-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-34-418_85dddfbb583eb82e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn97@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-35-600_1a764d277183c59b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lk7rPU-Bp2M:IPnGQwS5TBw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-35-428_a963bbf0a24bce44.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lk7rPU-Bp2M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-262_7b1b3f97104ad76a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"‘Ginger Snaps’ TV Series Coming From Producers of ‘Killing Eve’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643170","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643185\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"ginger snaps tv series\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ginger Snaps</em></strong>, <strong>John Fawcett</strong>&#8216;s coming-of-age werewolf movie, is transforming into a TV series. Sid Gentle Films, a production company behind <em>Killing Eve</em>, is developing the show, which will presumably follow the formula of the first film: a teenage girl becomes a werewolf around the time of her first period.

Brigette can’t understand this new version of her sister who is violent and sexual. As a bloody trail begins to form in Ginger’s wake, Brigette must find a way to curb her sister’s new cravings or risk losing her forever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The original film starred Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle and was released in 2000. While it wasn&#8217;t even close to being a &#8220;box office success,&#8221; it did garner strong reviews and an even stronger cult following. It also resulted in two sequels, <em>Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed</em>, released in 2004, and <em>Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning</em>, which was <em>also</em> released in 2004, and was also a prequel set in the 19th century. The sequels are somewhat forgettable, but the original remains a high-point in the werewolf movie subgenre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have long been a fan of the brilliant original. It&#8217;s just the kind of twisted, provocative and wildly entertaining story that we love at Sid Gentle,&#8221; said executive producer Sally Woodward Gentle. &#8220;It&#8217;s been 20 years since the world was introduced to the iconic teen girl werewolf and we can’t wait to re-introduce her to already devoted and eager new horror fans alike.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Original director John Fawcett, who also happens to be the co-creator of <em>Orphan Black</em>, added: &#8220;Could it be more socially relevant in this day and age to launch the television series, <em>Ginger Snaps</em>? For me, this is the ultimate follow-up to <em>Orphan Black</em> and I know those fans will find new love with the iconic Ginger and Brigette Fitzgerald. Anna Ssemuyaba is the perfect writer to help us bring our edgy, girl-power horror story to the small screen. I can’t wait for a big bite of this!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ginger-snaps-tv-series/\">&#8216;Ginger Snaps&#8217; TV Series Coming From Producers of &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KlWhswKhnS0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 19:30:45 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"415ab0dfb667822a02d5becf36661f27","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-24-629_abdaa47644ad6235.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":40118,"destBytes":24862,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ginger-snaps-tv-series-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-24-629_abdaa47644ad6235.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn84@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-35-394_3451bbdf83b014ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KlWhswKhnS0:qwHkCCFqfv4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-36-335_ef5003beeb24fd50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KlWhswKhnS0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-35-396_09aa2b7b787a4f4f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"Former ‘Daily Show’ Host Jon Stewart Returns to TV for a Current Affairs Series for AppleTV+","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643221","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-643236 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Jon-Stewart-Show-v2-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Jon Stewart Show\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Jon-Stewart-Show-v2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Jon-Stewart-Show-v2-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>After a five year break, former <em>Daily Show</em> host <strong>Jon Stewart</strong> is coming back to TV.</p>\n<p>Stewart has reportedly signed an &#8220;expansive, multi-year deal&#8221; with Apple, and is set to serve as the host of a new current affairs series on AppleTV+ which will run for multiple seasons. Here&#8217;s what we know so far.<span id=\"more-643221\"></span></p>\n<p>According to a press release, Stewart has signed a first-look deal with Apple and will anchor a new, original current affairs series for the streaming service. The hour-long show will tackle a single topic in each episode, but interestingly, the show will not be pinned down to a nightly or even weekly schedule. From what we can tell in these early days, it sounds as if Stewart will essentially have the freedom to release an episode whenever he wants. The show &#8220;will explore topics that are currently part of the national conversation and his advocacy work,&#8221; and a companion podcast is being developed &#8220;to continue the discussion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stewart stepped down from <em>The Daily Show</em> in 2015 after redefining that Comedy Central show and bringing it to unforeseen heights with his razor-sharp political commentary and fiery-yet-wry personality. For a certain generation, Stewart was viewed as one of the few anchors actively speaking truth to power, and he became the go-to news source for young people in this country in the Bush era. Stewart also helped to launch the careers of people like <strong>Steve Carell</strong>, <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong>, <strong>Samantha Bee</strong>, <strong>Rob Corddry</strong>, <strong>Ed Helms</strong>, <strong>Hasan Minhaj</strong>, and, of course, <strong>John Oliver</strong>, who has since become the sort of de facto successor to Stewart with his HBO series <em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em>.</p>\n<p>Stewart won 20 Emmy Awards while he was hosting <em>The Daily Show</em>, including ten consecutive wins for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Series. The show also won two Peabody Awards during his tenure.</p>\n<p>The host and activist has also become a filmmaker, releasing two feature films over the past six years: 2014&#8217;s <em>Rosewater</em>, and this year&#8217;s <em>Irresistible</em>. Neither of those movies were particularly well-received, which I imagine played into his decision to return to his wheelhouse with a new show. But that first-look deal is an important component to this situation, because – in theory, at least – it leaves the door open for him to continue making movies while executive producing this new show.</p>\n<p>Stewart&#8217;s manager, <strong>James Dixon</strong>, will also executive produce, as will former HBO head <strong>Richard Plepler</strong> through his EDEN Productions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-jon-stewart-show/\">Former &#8216;Daily Show&#8217; Host Jon Stewart Returns to TV for a Current Affairs Series for AppleTV+</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/k1p67poRtsI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 21:00:28 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Jon-Stewart-Show-v2-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"9d6631d1daf1c199f9b5f9ac25d2c166","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn5@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-20-547_2727e29c89fc7e0b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":14314,"destBytes":7774,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Jon-Stewart-Show-v2-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn5@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-20-547_2727e29c89fc7e0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-36-916_e546c9ec93d52c4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k1p67poRtsI:I7MRKXj6Qvw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/k1p67poRtsI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-35-417_cc5f889c0e584764.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"‘Platonic’ AppleTV+ Series Will Reunite ‘Neighbors’ Stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643190","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-643204 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Platonic-cast-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Platonic cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Platonic-cast.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Platonic-cast-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Seth Rogen</strong> and <strong>Rose Byrne</strong> are heading back to television.</p>\n<p>The former <em>Neighbors</em> and <em>Neighbors 2</em> co-stars are joining forces again for Platonic, a new AppleTV+ comedy series which hails from <em>Neighbors</em> director <strong>Nicholas Stoller</strong>. Get details about the new show below.<span id=\"more-643190\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/seth-rogen-rose-byrne-apple-series-platonic-1234816506/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that Rogen and Byrne are set to star in <em>Platonic</em>, a half-hour series that&#8217;s received a ten-episode order at AppleTV+. Here&#8217;s how the show is being described:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Platonic</em> explores the inner workings of platonic friendship. A pair of former best friends who met in their youth (Byrne and Rogen) reconnect as adults and try to mend the rift that led to their falling out. As their friendship becomes more consuming, it destabilizes their lives and causes them to reevaluate their choices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like the type of story that isn&#8217;t often told – not in American pop culture, anyway. But frankly, anything which reunites Rogen and Byrne, who had an easy, fun chemistry together in the <em>Neighbors</em> movies, is worth getting excited about. They&#8217;re both such charismatic actors that you just want to spend time with them no matter what, and it should be interesting to see what types of stories the show gets to tell if it truly takes a romantic relationship off the table for these characters.</p>\n<p>Stoller co-wrote this series with <strong>Francesca Delbanco</strong>, who co-created the Netflix comedy <em>Friends From College</em> with him a couple of years ago. They&#8217;ll both executive produce <em>Platonic</em> along with Rogen and Byrne, and Stoller is set to direct.</p>\n<p>Rogen got his start in the entertainment industry on television, working for producer Judd Apatow on shows like <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> and <em>Undeclared</em>. Rogen has primarily worked in film for the last fifteen years, occasionally popping up for a multi-episode run on a show or lending his distinctive voice to an animated series in a guest spot. Byrne, an underrated actress with a huge range, played Gloria Steinem earlier this year in the FX series <em>Mrs. America</em>, and previously starred for years on <em>Damages</em>.</p>\n<p>This will be Rogen&#8217;s first AppleTV+ project, but it will be the second for Byrne. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-physical/\">word came out</a> that the actress will be headlining a series called <em>Physical</em> for the new streamer in which she plays a tortured 1980s housewife who finds an unconventional path to power through an unlikely source: the world of aerobics. There&#8217;s no word when <em>Platonic</em> or <em>Physical</em> will get in front of cameras, but I&#8217;m looking forward to both.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/platonic-cast/\">&#8216;Platonic&#8217; AppleTV+ Series Will Reunite &#8216;Neighbors&#8217; Stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4T5i9rKzgn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 23:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Platonic-cast-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"f719c39aba479f5b7917553629e6ec18","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn59@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-23-995_e69be6e69fba5839.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32648,"destBytes":18412,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Platonic-cast-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn59@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-23-995_e69be6e69fba5839.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn68@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-36-293_f1f577629a9a0862.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4T5i9rKzgn0:H4K_bZ36UWw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_3/2020/10/28/03-03-35-548_8249132a91c418e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4T5i9rKzgn0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-35-388_8a007fcc675a86b0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","title":"Tim Curry is Doing the Time Warp Again in a ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show’ Livestream Fundraiser","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=643180","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643187\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rocky-horror-picture-show-1-e1603820765763-700x341.jpg\" alt=\"rocky horror picture show livestream\" width=\"700\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rocky-horror-picture-show-1-e1603820765763-700x341.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rocky-horror-picture-show-1-e1603820765763-360x176.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rocky-horror-picture-show-1-e1603820765763-768x374.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rocky-horror-picture-show-1-e1603820765763.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>What do you do if you have a political fundraiser set for Halloween night?

While not technically an encyclopedia or visual dictionary, the book is divided into key subject areas for easy reading— the galaxy, science and technology, the Force, the Skywalkers, galactic governments, their dissidents, and galactic denizens.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a devoted <i>Star Wars </i>fan or a casual reader curious to learn more, <i>The Star Wars Book</i> is an invaluable roadmap to that galaxy far, far away.

He could coax midi-chlorians — the microscopic symbionts present in all body cells that channel the Force — to create new life. His experiments were incomplete but encouraging.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like his former master, Sidious covets vergences in the Force, for such concentrations of power are needed to break the rules that govern life and death. This, of course, explains Sidious&#8217; fascination with young Anakin Skywalker, as well as the Force nexus on Lothal — the gateway beneath the ancient Jedi temple to the World Between Worlds, as seen in <em>Star Wars Rebels</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Obsessed with immortality, Palpatine withdraws from public view so he can probe the secrets of the dark side. In the Unknown Regions, he readies the ancient Sith throne of Exegol to be his permanent seat of power. His cultist underlings experiment with cloning technology to extend his life.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Dark Science, Cloning, Secrets Only the Sith Knew</strong></h2>\n<p><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> wasn&#8217;t the first time Emperor Palpatine was resurrected. In the 1991 Dark Horse comic book series <em>Dark Empire</em> set six years after <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, Palpatine returns from the netherworld of the Force and possesses the body of Jeng Droga, one of the Emperor’s Hands, a group of elite assassins not unlike the Knights of Ren or Snoke’s Praetorian Guard in the Sequel Trilogy. Sate Pestage, one of the Emperor’s advisors, exorcizes Palpatine’s spirit and channels it into a clone created by Palpatine before his death.</p>\n<p>As for how Palpatine returned in canon for <em>Episode IX</em>, <em>The Star Wars Book</em> lays it all out:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When Sidious is defeated at the Battle of Endor, he transfers his consciousness through the Force to a waiting cloned body. The process is imperfect, resulting in his mind being trapped in a rotting corpse. Over the ensuing decades, Sidious continues his obsessive explorations into rejuvenation. Clone offshoots from this process include his &#8220;son,&#8221; who flees Exegol in an attempt to live a life apart from darkness. Another genetic construct becomes Snoke, an underling whom Sidious installs as Supreme Leader of the First Order.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-586333 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TLJ-Snoke-Torture-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TLJ-Snoke-Torture-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TLJ-Snoke-Torture-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TLJ-Snoke-Torture-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TLJ-Snoke-Torture.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Strandcast — Supreme Leader Snoke</strong></h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read my <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/the-emperor-reborn/\"><em>Emperor Reborn</em></a> series or perused the <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/558520/star-wars-the-last-jedi--the-visual-dictionary-by-pablo-hidalgo/\"><em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary</em></a>, you already know that Snoke, while not a member of the Sith, wore a gold ring inscribed with glyphs from the Four Sages of Dwartii, encrusted with obsidian from the Sith cave beneath Fortress Vader on Mustafar. Uncoincidentally, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine kept bronzium statues of the Four Sages in his office and chambers on Coruscant.</p>\n<p>After <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, many fans had questions about who or what Snoke was. The<em> Star Wars Book</em> has the answer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s possible Snoke himself may not know his true nature. Snoke is a <strong>strandcast </strong>&#8211; an artificial genetic construct concocted by the resurrected Darth Sidious to be his proxy in power. Snoke has free will, but his actions and goals are still orchestrated by Sidious.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Through Snoke, Sidious manipulates Anakin Skywalker&#8217;s grandson, Ben Solo, and lures him to the dark side. Sidious also senses the Force awakening within Rey, the offspring of his cloned son, and is determined to capture her.</p>\n<h2><strong>Psychometry, Dyads, and Rare Force Abilities</strong></h2>\n<p>The book also details some rarer force abilities. A small number of Force users, including Rey and Cal Kestis (from the video game <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>), have the unique ability of psychometry, which allows them to learn about people or events by touching an object associated with them. This explains Rey&#8217;s Force visions when she touches items like Anakin Skywalker&#8217;s lightsaber or the Blade of Ochi of Bestoon.</p>\n<p>As for Rey&#8217;s bond with Ben Solo, here&#8217;s the official info:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Ben Solo and Rey are dyads in the Force. This rare connection has not been seen for generations and means that the pair have a Force bond, allowing them to see and feel what the other is experiencing and even pass objects to one another over great distances through the Force. Those in a dyad possess another unusual ability. They can use the Force to heal a wounded person or creature, but this act also requires that the healer transfer some of their Force energy, which can temporarily weaken them. After their battle with Darth Sidious, Ben Solo sacrifices his life and all of his Force energy to bring Rey back from the dead.</p></blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Eternal Hope and Redemption — Ben Solo and Leia Organa</strong></h2>\n<p>What happened to Ben Solo and Leia Organa at the end of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>? The book provides some additional details about their final moments.</p>\n<p>Amid the wreckage of the second Death Star on Kef Bir, Kylo Ren feels the Force presence of his mother, who reminds him of the goodness still within him. Sensing his distraction, Rey strikes a killing blow with her lightsaber. Immediately horrified by her actions and the idea that she may be falling to the dark side, Rey uses the Force to restore him. Meanwhile, on Ajan Kloss, the effort of reaching out to her son is too much for Leia&#8217;s mortal body. She dies but doesn&#8217;t pass into the Force yet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a pivotal turn of events, Kylo faces the memory of his deceased father. Moved by the love of his parents and Rey&#8217;s compassion, he hurls his unstable, red lightsaber into the ocean, renouncing darkness and becoming Ben Solo once more. His final act is to head to Exegol to help Rey face the Emperor. Together, the two defeat the Sith Lord. The effort drains Rey. Without hesitation, Ben transfers his life force to her, resurrecting her and sacrificing himself: redeemed at last.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By transferring all of his Force energy to resurrect Rey, Ben Solo is able to do what his grandfather Anakin Skywalker never could: save the ones he loves from dying. Now one with the force, Leia ferries Ben into the cosmic Force together, finding peace.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-595731 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-rey-kylo-lightsaberclash-700x294.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Split in Two\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-rey-kylo-lightsaberclash-700x294.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-rey-kylo-lightsaberclash-360x151.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-rey-kylo-lightsaberclash-768x323.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-rey-kylo-lightsaberclash.jpg 1149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Finding Her Identity — The Mirror Cave and Rey Skywalker</strong></h2>\n<p>For those who have issues or questions about Rey&#8217;s arc in the Sequel Trilogy, <em>The Star Wars Book</em> does a good job of explaining everything and connecting the thematic dots. For one, we get a full understanding of Rey&#8217;s experience in the mirror cave on Ahch-To in Rian Johnson&#8217;s <em>The Last Jedi</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Below the surface, she asks the Force to show her who her parents are. In answer, the cave reveals not a mother or a father but Rey&#8217;s mirrored image, endlessly reflected. The cave plays upon her darkest fears, that she has always been, and always will be, alone. But it also helps her begin to see that maybe the only person she needs is herself. She is not defined by her parents, but by the choices she makes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And so, determined to forge her own identity, Rey goes to Exegol and battles Palpatine, nearly dying in the process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having accepted all that she is, the voices of many legendary Jedi unite with her, inspiring her to rise and destroy Palpatine with the help of Ben Solo, now returned to the light. On Tatooine, Rey buries Luke and Leia&#8217;s lightsabers and takes on the moniker Skywalker. Her choice, and not her lineage, defines who she is, bringing her peace and purpose.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Hero Business — Lando Calrissian</strong></h2>\n<p>There are some fun tidbits about supporting characters to the saga as well, specifically this interesting backstory for Lando Calrissian that was cut from <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> but still exists as part of the official novelization:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After his days in the Rebellion, Calrissian settles down and starts a family. However, his young daughter is kidnapped. Her disappearance is a mystery, yet it becomes clear later that his only child was targeted by the First Order, as the group had abducted the kids of other former Alliance leaders. Lando joins Luke Skywalker&#8217;s mission to track down the rumors of Sith agents, and when the trail runs cold on Pasaana, Lando decides to remain on the planet, living a quiet, restful existence as a hermit.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With the battle against the Final Order won, Lando offers to join the former stormtrooper Jannah in her search for her family, hoping that together they can find their long-lost relatives, even if the odds are against them:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He empathizes with her as his own child had been kidnapped years before. Jannah, an improbable ally to the Resistance, has found an unlikely ally of her own.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-599180 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mandalorian-8-e1579618298819-700x329.jpg\" alt=\"disney+ coming to europe\" width=\"700\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mandalorian-8-e1579618298819-700x329.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mandalorian-8-e1579618298819-360x169.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mandalorian-8-e1579618298819-768x361.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mandalorian-8-e1579618298819.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>The Mandalorian — Din Djarin</strong></h2>\n<p>In the Mandalorian&#8217;s entry, we learn that before he was rescued by members of Death Watch, Din Djarin called Aq Vetina his home:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although now known as the Mandalorian, he was once the boy named Din Djarin. When his home, Aq Vetina, is assulated by merciless battle droids forces, Din&#8217;s parents hide him in a cellar, hoping to keep him safe. He survives, thanks to the intervention of Mandalorian forces. Armored warriors carrying the mark of Death Watch take the abandoned child to be raised as a Mandalorian foundling. Din receives an orthodox Mandalorian upbringing so he believes he cannot ever take his helmet off in the company of another living being, lest he lose claim to his Mandalorian heritage.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Is Aq Vetina the name of a settlement, or is it a planet? Perhaps we&#8217;ll visit the Mandalorian&#8217;s former home in an upcoming episode of the Disney+ live-action series.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Child </strong><strong>— A Nobody From Nowhere (For Now)</strong></h2>\n<p>As for Din Djarin&#8217;s sidekick, the Child, there isn&#8217;t much new information to report:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Very little is known about the Child, the Mandalorian&#8217;s target-turned-ward. He is found sleeping in a hovering pram in a safehouse on Arvala-7, guarded by Nikto henchmen. Where he came from is unknown. According to a fragmented chain code, the Child is 50 standard years old, but has the look and behavior of a toddler. His species is unknown, but is a match for that of Yoda, the late Jedi master.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While there have been several members of the species to make appearances in the non-canon Expanded Universe (rebranded as Star Wars Legends), there are only three in the official <em>Star Wars</em> canon: Yoda, Yaddle, and the Child. Someday, maybe someday soon, we&#8217;ll discover more about the species and where they come from but until then, much to learn we still have.</p>\n<h2><strong>The New Gospel</strong></h2>\n<p>While there are countless <em>Star Wars</em> reference books out there, <em>The Star Wars Book</em> feels like something new and different. It isn&#8217;t a visual dictionary, nor is it an art book. It&#8217;s more like a hardbound copy of <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page\">Wookieepedia</a> that exhaustively details the major players and events of the saga and binds the universe together. That was a book joke <em>and</em> a <em>Star Wars</em> joke. You&#8217;re welcome.</p>\n<p><em>The Star Wars Book</em> fills in the gaps for those who don’t have the time, money, or obsessive-compulsive need to consume everything that comes out of Lucasfilm and its subsidiaries, while also encouraging those who are curious to seek out stories and experiences they may have missed along the way. It treats the films, series, comics, novels, and video games as equally important parts of the Star Wars canon and is a must-have for fans of saga.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>The Star Wars Book <em>is <a href=\"https://www.dk.com/us/book/9781465497901-the-star-wars-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available now</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-star-wars-book/\">Palpatine, Kylo Ren, Baby Yoda and More: 10 Things You Need to Know From &#8216;The Star Wars Book&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Gr0_8_QMuFs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:00:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-star-wars-book-banner-pablo-hidalgo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ca765434ffb78df6e9b8294cb8a49b51","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-01-381_2ba0c15ef7dd61dc.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33684,"destBytes":22202,"author":"Adam Frazier","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-star-wars-book-banner-pablo-hidalgo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/28/03-03-01-381_2ba0c15ef7dd61dc.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-palpatine-glowingeyes-700x304.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-35-439_8e536d24b01e8dc4.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TLJ-Snoke-Torture-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn93@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-35-542_9c19f0d49aba4e09.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-riseofskywalker-rey-kylo-lightsaberclash-700x294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn73@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-35-352_9c3a1df4f071378d.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mandalorian-8-e1579618298819-700x329.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-35-406_96d87ec55ff8f379.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-37-590_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn69@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-35-763_d871c6c95b065119.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/28/03-03-36-449_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Gr0_8_QMuFs:W76Hg_gzDk0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-35-589_65b5a8b950f865a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Gr0_8_QMuFs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-35-765_280ec8417d3672c1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854180250}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:00","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:03:00 +0000","fetchMs":89,"handleMs":626,"totalMs":53747,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"b7f013d573409428dc92482e3348ccd3","hostName":"us-026*","requestId":"a23bd81d469d425594982a0f7e0373d9_21","contentType":"text/xml;
