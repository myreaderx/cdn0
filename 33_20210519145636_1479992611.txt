This theory states, that you can not measure two separate parameters of a particle simultaneously. You can either determine one parameter and ignore the other or vice versa, but you can never know everything at once.</p> \n <p>Oefner took this idea from the world of physics and created an artistic equivalent of it. The sculptures are made of five different everyday objects: shoes, a clock, a tape recorder and a black box. The artist filled these with resin and carefully sliced them into hundreds of individual parts. He then rearranged the slices into a distorted new version of the object, that lets you see its inner workings.</p> \n <p>Through this transformation, the objects have a peculiar effect on their observer: When you look at them from a distance, you can easily identify the object. However, if you start to get closer to observe its inner workings, the shape of the object starts to get distorted and vanishes completely. As an observer you are never able to observe the object as a whole and its inner workings simultaneously. The more accurately we see one view, the less clearly we see the other.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>When I first glanced at Oefner’s images, I thought they were uninterestingly digital — 3D-generated images digitally manipulated or some such — but they’re real-world things actually sliced apart.

But, until very recently, it was too expensive to capture that power. That’s what has shifted — and so quickly and so dramatically that most of the world’s politicians are now living on a different planet than the one we actually inhabit. On the actual Earth, circa 2021, the report reads, “with current technology and in a subset of available locations we can capture at least 6,700 PWh p.a. [petawatt-hours per year] from solar and wind, which is more than 100 times global energy demand.” And this will not require covering the globe with solar arrays: “The land required for solar panels alone to provide all global energy is 450,000 km2, 0.3% of the global land area of 149 million km2. That is less than the land required for fossil fuels today, which in the US alone is 126,000 km2, 1.3% of the country.” These are the kinds of numbers that reshape your understanding of the future.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>But world governments will need to invest in renewable energy sooner rather than later and fossil fuel companies will fight tooth and nail to slow the transition to renewables. If they win in slow-walking the response to the climate crisis, as McKibben puts it, “no one will have an ice cap in the Arctic, either, and everyone who lives near a coast will be figuring out where on earth to go”.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Bill%20McKibben\">Bill McKibben</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/energy\">energy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/global%20warming\">global warming</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 May 2021 14:01:03 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"95b565850927729387bdecc99ec6927f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161541},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"“Maybe We Need Masks Indoors Just a Bit Longer”","link":"https://kottke.org/21/05/maybe-we-need-masks-indoors-just-a-bit-longer","description":"<p>Since yesterday’s announcement, I’d been feeling uneasy about the CDC’s decision to update its guidance to state that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks in most situations indoors or out. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/opinion/coronavirus-masks-vaccines.html\">Zeynep Tufekci’s piece in the Times</a> nails why.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>It’s difficult for officials to issue rules as conditions evolve and uncertainty continues. So I hesitate to question the agency’s approach. But it’s not clear whether it was responding to scientific evidence or public clamor to lift state and local mandates, which the C.D.C. said could remain in place.</p> \n <p>It might have been better to have kept up indoor mask mandates to help suppress the virus for maybe as little as a few more weeks.</p> \n <p>The C.D.C. could have set metrics to measure such progress, saying that guidelines would be maintained until the number of cases or the number vaccinations reached a certain level, determined by epidemiologists.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The vaccine is on its way to controlling Covid-19 in the US — but we’re not there yet. We’re not the UK or Israel…they’re further along in their vaccination campaigns and their daily cases and deaths are way down, warranting behavioral changes. In the US, over 600 people/day are still dying of Covid-19 and our case positivity rate is still above 3%. Too many people, including almost all children, are still vulnerable and as Tufekci says, the CDC could have waited a few more weeks to more quickly drive down the virus levels.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"May 17, 2021\">Update:</strong> The CDC’s move has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/world/nurses-union-cdc-mask-vaccinated.html\">sharply condemned</a> by National Nurses United, the nation’s largest union of registered nurses:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“The union noted that more than 35,000 new cases of coronavirus were being reported each day and that more than 600 people were dying each day. “Now is not the time to relax protective measures, and we are outraged that the C.D.C. has done just that while we are still in the midst of the deadliest pandemic in a century,” Ms. Castillo said.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KSchultz3580/status/1393972513114189826\">Ken Schultz notes</a> that the needle the CDC is trying to thread here might not work out the way that they’d hoped.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Imagine the social preference ordering is:</p> \n <p>1. Unvaccinated wear masks, vaccinated don’t.<br /> 2. Everyone wears masks.<br /> 3. No one wears masks.</p> \n <p>Selfish, short-sighted behavior and the inability to monitor vaccination status mean that, in trying to get #1, you can end up at #3.</p> \n <p>So I trust the CDC’s position that #1 is socially desirable from a scientific perspective.

Some pillars serve other uses such as flagpoles or iconographic church crosses. Generally the towers are just simulacra. They are water towers that hold no water, windmills that provide no power, and trees that provide no oxygen. Yet they all provide five bars of service.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The photos are also available <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9781942084983\">in book form</a>.

We explore the totalitarian society Hitler built, and see the consequences: genocide and total war.

Which is not and should not be considered an episode of The Underground Railroad. It exists apart from that, outside it. Early in production, there was a moment where I looked across the set and what I saw settled me: our background actors, in working with folks like Ms. Wendy and Mr. and Mrs. King — styled and dressed and made up by Caroline, by Lawrence and Donnie — I looked across the set and realized I was looking at my ancestors, a group of people whose images have been largely lost to the historical record. Without thinking, we paused production on the The Underground Railroad and instead harnessed our tools to capture portraits of… them.</p> \n <p>What flows here is non-narrative. There is no story told. Throughout production, we halted our filming many times for moments like these. Moments where… standing in the spaces our ancestors stood, we had the feeling of seeing them, truly seeing them and thus, we sought to capture and share that seeing with you.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>(via <a href=\"https://themorningnews.org\">the morning news</a>)</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Barry%20Jenkins\">Barry Jenkins</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Underground%20Railroad\">The Underground Railroad</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 14:38:47 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0be42474e9818fc43cd6e1b751d526fd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161540},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"“The Woman Who Made van Gogh”","link":"https://kottke.org/21/05/the-woman-who-made-van-gogh","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/van-gogh-self-hat.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1218\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh\" /></p> \n<p>There are certain writers that, when I see their byline, I read their stuff, even if it takes me a few weeks to find the time. Ever since reading his excellent <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9781400078677\">The Island at the Center of the World</a>, Russell Shorto has been one of those writers. His latest piece, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/magazine/jo-van-gogh-bonger.html\">The Woman Who Made van Gogh</a>, tells the story of Jo van Gogh-Bonger who, after both her husband Theo and her brother-in-law Vincent died within a year and a half of each other, worked tirelessly for decades to get Vincent’s work out into the world.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The brothers’ dying so young, Vincent at 37 and Theo at 33, and without the artist having achieved renown — Theo had managed to sell only a few of his paintings — would seem to have ensured that Vincent van Gogh’s work would subsist eternally in a netherworld of obscurity. Instead, his name, art and story merged to form the basis of an industry that stormed the globe, arguably surpassing the fame of any other artist in history. That happened in large part thanks to Jo van Gogh-Bonger. She was small in stature and riddled with self-doubt, had no background in art or business and faced an art world that was a thoroughly male preserve. Her full story has only recently been uncovered. It is only now that we know how van Gogh became van Gogh.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Because of her work, Vincent van Gogh is a household name all over the world and even the way people think about artists and their art forever changed.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jo%20van%20Gogh-Bonger\">Jo van Gogh-Bonger</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Russell%20Shorto\">Russell Shorto</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Vincent%20van%20Gogh\">Vincent van Gogh</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 21:13:06 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/van-gogh-self-hat.jpg","linkMd5":"a03ef69605973e40d54c12998cfa37b8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn96@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-02-925_881d8946e3abcc46.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1218,"sourceBytes":491218,"destBytes":262160,"author":"Jason Kottke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/van-gogh-self-hat.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn96@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-02-925_881d8946e3abcc46.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161541},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"West Texas Thunderstorm","link":"https://kottke.org/21/05/west-texas-thunderstorm","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/west-texas-thunderstorm.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1334\" border=\"0\" alt=\"a colorful West Texas storm cloud\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lauralouu30/status/1394386482475929602\">Photo by Laura Rowe</a>.
