Gov. Evers initially activated around 125 Guardsmembers to assist first responders, but later increased that number \"to ensure individuals can exercise their right safely, protect safe buildings and critical infrastructure, and support first responders and fire fighters.\"</p><p>In a separate statement on Monday, Evers noted that National Guard assets would not be used \"to impede the ability of people to peacefully protest or impede the ability of the media to report on this situation.\"</p><p>\"I know folks across our state will be making their voices heard in Kenosha and in communities across Wisconsin,\" Evers said in his statement. \"Every person should be able to express their anger and frustration by exercising their First Amendment rights and report on these calls to action without any fear of being unsafe.\"</p><p>Trump has frequently urged state governors to utilize their state-military assets in responding to largely civil protests. During the George Floyd protests, Trump was overheard in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-governors-george-floyd-protests/2020/06/01/430a6226-a421-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html\">leaked conference call</a> disparaging governors by calling them \"weak,\" and suggesting they take control of the situation by using uniformed troops.</p><p>\"You have to dominate,\" Trump said, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post. \"If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time. They're going to run over you. You're going to look like a bunch of jerks.\"</p><p>Gov.

remarks from Jerusalem on the second night of the Republican National Convention, breaking a longstanding precedent and facing accusations of breaking the law in the process.</p><p>Though Pompeo issued a warning to US diplomats just last month against becoming involved in the \"political process,\" America's top diplomat seemingly broke from his own guidance and endorsed President Donald Trump for a second term on Tuesday.</p><p>\"President Trump understands what my great fellow Kansan, President Eisenhower said: 'For all that we cherish and justly desire for ourselves or for our children, the securing of peace is the first requisite,'\" Pompeo said in his speech.</p><p>\"Delivering on this duty to keep us safe and our freedoms intact, this president has led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world. In China, he's pulled back the curtain on the predatory aggression of the Chinese Communist Party. The president has held China accountable for covering up the China virus and allowing it to spread death and economic destruction in America and around the world,\" Pompeo said.&#160;</p><p>The secretary of state went on to tout what he saw as Trump's foreign policy accomplishments, listing out an array of policy decisions and actions. This included Trump's decision to order the drone strike that killed top Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a move that pushed the US and Iran <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-iran-near-brink-of-a-war-that-would-likely-devastate-both-sides-2019-5\">to the brink of war.</a></p><p>Much of what Pompeo said was at odds with reality. He claimed, for example, that \"NATO is stronger\" because of Trump. But the president has spent the past several years bashing the historic alliance while raising the nerves of US allies in the process, and he's repeatedly made misleading assertions <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-nato-budget-is-funded-2018-7\">about how NATO is funded.</a></p><p>At another point, Pompeo said, \"In North Korea, the president lowered the temperature and against all odds, got the North Korean leadership to the table.\"</p><p>But the primary point of Trump sitting down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was to get the rogue state to denuclearize, which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bolton-trump-wanted-pompeo-kim-jong-un-rocket-man-cd-2020-6\">it has not yet done</a> as it continues to engage in aggressive activities that have made US allies in the region uneasy.&#160;</p><p>\"The president exited the US from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran and squeezed the ayatollah, Hezbollah, and Hamas,\" Pompeo said. \"The president, too, moved the US embassy to this very city of god, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.\"</p><p>Pompeo did not discuss the fact that the decision to withdraw from the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-explained\">Iran nuclear deal</a> was condemned by US allies and opened the door for the Iranians to pull away from the landmark pact while increasing tensions between Tehran and Washington.

The state reported 2,600 new virus cases Tuesday compared to the 10,000 new cases it was regularly reporting earlier summer.&#160;</p><p>\"That is why it's so important for Middle America to recognize the mitigation that we talked about ... it's for Middle America too, the Nebraskas, the Oklahomas,\" US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN. \"We don't need to have a third wave in the heartland right now.\"</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, echoed Redfield's concerns, warning that the Midwest could see a rise in cases if officials in those states don't implement measures to help curb the spread.</p><p>\"Some states are not doing that,\" Fauci told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/28/896152597/midwest-could-see-surge-in-covid-19-cases-unless-states-are-more-careful-fauci-w\">NPR</a> about states who aren't taking proper guidelines. \"We would hope that they all now rethink what happens when you don't adhere to that.

figures pushing conspiracy theories and debunked talking points on a wide array of issues.&#160;</p><p>The GOP convention typically attracts the biggest conservative names in the country. That has not been the case for the 2020 convention, as President Donald Trump has so alienated prominent GOP establishment figures that some even chose to speak on Joe Biden's behalf at the Democratic National Convention last week instead.&#160;</p><p>Tuesday night's RNC lineup included several names most Americans have likely never heard of. People like Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion activist who supports <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/1298429588708757504?s=20\">barring women from voting</a> and recently condoned police racially profiling her biracial son.&#160;</p><p>Nicholas Sandmann, a teenager who last year found himself at the center of a culture battle that largely played out on social media, was also a speaker. Sandmann used his speech to decry the media, and declared that he had been \"cancelled.\"</p><p>Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi offered a speech full of conspiracy theories on the Bidens and Ukraine that have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-gas-company-burisma-holdings-joe-bidens-son-hunter-explained-2019-9?utmSource=twitter&utmContent=referral&utmTerm=topbar&referrer=twitterrrer=twitter\">repeatedly been disproven.</a></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;NowThis  (@nowthisnews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1298435980857352194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>One of the people slated to speak, Mary Ann Mendoza, had her speech cancelled at the last minute because she'd shared an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/8/25/21401858/rnc-canceled-mary-ann-mendoza-anti-semitic-conspiracy-theory-protocols-elders-zion\">anti-Semitic conspiracy theory</a> on Twitter earlier in the day.</p><p>While the second night of the RNC lacked the fire and fury of the first night of the proceedings, it filled that void with a series of surreal acts.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Trump, a president who has consistently vilified immigrants, returned to his roots as an entertainer and held a reality TV-style naturalization ceremony with acting Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf.</p><p>Five people became US citizens in the process, but what was not mentioned during that made-for-TV-moment was the fact Trump has separated thousands of migrant children from their parents, consistently sought to build a wall on the border to keep immigrants out, and routinely espoused xenophobic sentiments.&#160;</p><p>Trump, who recently sparked uproar after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-has-trump-pardoned-so-far-arpaio-johnson-scooter-libby-2018-5\">commuting the sentence of his friend Roger Stone</a>, also held a pardoning ceremony during the RNC on Tuesday. The \"law and order\" president, who has spent the summer demonizing people protesting systemic racism in America's criminal justice system, pardoned a convicted bank robber.&#160;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"none\">&#8212;Aaron Rupar  (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1298441939625410563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>The naturalization and pardoning ceremonies both took place at the White House. The president has faced fierce criticism for holding much of the convention at the White House and politicizing what is perhaps the most iconic public building in the US.</p><p>In using the powers of his office to promote his reelection effort in such a blatant fashion, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-abused-the-powers-of-the-presidency-a-the-republican-convention-2020-8\">Trump broke ethical norms in a profound way on Tuesday</a>. And by performing an official duty in what was a campaign event, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/myhlee/status/1298457513684336640?s=20\">Wolf may have violated a law (the Hatch Act)</a> prohibiting federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job.&#160;</p><p>This all came before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an unprecedented speech that broke protocol and saw America's top diplomat participate in a partisan event while on a taxpayer-funded trip to the Middle East. Pompeo has also faced allegations of breaking the law by delivering remarks at the convention, and House Democrats are launching an investigation into his speech.&#160;</p><p>And in the final speech of the evening, First Lady Melania Trump touched on how how \"mean and manipulative social media can be.\" Left unsaid was the president's well-documented, almost hourly tendency to use Twitter as a weapon to spread disinformation and attack his opponents.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

for tens of thousands of coronavirus cases, a <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20178236v1\">new study published</a> online on Tuesday said.</p><p>The was held at the

Globe</a> reported.&#160;</p><p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/coronavirus-biogen-boston-superspreader.html\">reported</a> in April that senior executives from the drug company caught the virus and then traveled to other states, cities, and countries unknowingly carrying the virus.&#160;</p><p>\"The smartest people in health care and drug development &#8212; and they were completely oblivious to the biggest thing that was about to shatter their world,\" John Carroll, editor of Endpoints News, told the Times.&#160;</p><p>At the time, <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-cases-in-massachusetts-as-of-march-26-2020/download\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Massachusetts Department of Public Health</a> said 99 people who had either attended the conference or were in contact with someone who had, had tested positive for the virus in the state.&#160;</p><p>Biogen was criticized, at the time, for moving forward with the conference even though several officials attending were from European countries that already had documented coronavirus outbreaks.&#160;</p><p>The Times added that some of the first coronavirus cases in states like Indiana, Tennessee, and North Carolina were Biogen executives.&#160;</p><p>The study posted on Tuesday has yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal. It also doesn't specifically refer to Biogen, referring to the conference as an \"international business conference held in Boston.\"</p><p>\"We're not trying to point fingers,\" Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen surveillance told the Globe. \"Some [viral] introductions fizzle out, others light fires. The circumstances of this event ― the fact that it happened so early in the epidemic and the timing of where we were with COVID in the public consciousness ― meant it had a disproportionate effect. It happened in a city that wasn't 'woke.' \"</p><p>Researchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studied the genome of 772 coronavirus samples from people in Boston from January and May.&#160;</p><p>More than a third of the samples collected were infected with a strain of the virus that could be traced to the conference.&#160;</p><p>From the 289 cases that could be traced to the conference, 122 of the samples were from people living and working in Boston-area homeless shelters, the study reported.</p><p>\"I'm confident that the scale for measuring this event is in the tens of thousands,\" Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital told the Globe.</p><p>Caroline Buckee, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&#160; did not have anything to do with the study but told the Globe that the findings seem probable. She received a copy of the study before it appeared Tuesday on a preprint server.&#160;</p><p>\"Super-spreading is really a key component of how we ended up with an epidemic of this gravity,\" Buckee said. \"If you think about it, all the cases in the whole world originated from one case. That's the nature of the exponential growth of epidemics.\"</p><p>In an email statement, a Biogen spokesperson told Business Insider that they don't dispute the findings of the study, and have collaborated with the researchers.&#160;</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"February 2020 was nearly a half year ago, and was a period when general knowledge about the coronavirus was limited. We were adhering closely to the prevailing official guidelines. We never would have knowingly put anyone at risk. When we learned a number of our colleagues were ill, we did not know the cause was COVID-19, but we immediately notified public health authorities and took steps to limit the spread,\" the company said.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/february-conference-boston-caused-thousands-covid-19-cases-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:QXVau8BzmBE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/O66IjjtS_WI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 04:31:03 +0000","feedId":13983,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f459e5c89aff80028ab7ef0?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"106b4021c3d7562e0dfde36634df8f7e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn57@2020_3/2020/08/26/09-00-43-958_f4d879308be920c2.webp","destWidth":1746,"destHeight":1310,"sourceBytes":163684,"destBytes":163684,"author":"salarshani@businessinsider.com (Sarah Al-Arshani)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f459e6e42f43f001ddff09c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn1@2020_1/2020/08/26/09-00-54-014_18fcb54d11e559c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-52-638_00f09200df8426be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn22@2020_5/2020/08/26/09-00-52-336_3b5cdb6583900955.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn89@2020_2/2020/08/26/09-00-48-691_0eb0406b34bd27e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=O66IjjtS_WI:3hgoDw5Jyy4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn14@2020_3/2020/08/26/09-00-54-309_1871f290a3111759.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_5/2020/08/26/09-00-52-311_767e235117808cfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-51-477_edf0fa9b5dde1c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/O66IjjtS_WI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn45@2020_1/2020/08/26/09-00-50-127_e3b3caa67f0de837.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598432350848},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 16:59:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 16:59:10","title":"The CEO of secretive data analysis startup Palantir made over $12 million last year, and will get $800,000 in travel stipends in 2020","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-ceo-karp-800k-in-travel-stipend-in-2020-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4592af42f43f001ddff088?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Alex Karp — CEO of Palantir Alex Karp speaks to the press as he leaves the Elysee Palace in Paris, on May 23, 2018 after the &#34;Tech for Good&#34;

Thursday announce their new leader as the pro-European party attempts to regain its confidence after a disappointing set of results in last December's UK general election.</p><p>After three months of campaigning, the party will on Thursday decide who should be tasked with breathing new life into the party after their anti-Brexit stance failed to make the sort of breakthrough many had predicted.</p><p>Either Ed Davey of Layla Moran will be announced as the new leader at 11:30 am and party figures believe the contest could be on a knife-edge as ballots close on Wednesday.</p><p>The party, encouraged by strong polling earlier in the year, went into December's election pledging to stop Brexit and hoping for major gains. However, despite increasing its vote share by over 4%, the Liberal Democrats ended up with one fewer seat in the House of Commons and then-leader Jo Swinson losing her own seat to Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party.</p><p>Speaking to Business Insider this week, the party's former leader Sir Vince Cable said the result in December had crushed the party's spirit after \"spectacular\" results in local and European elections earlier in the year.</p><p>\"The party is not in a good place and it'd be dishonest and ridiculous to pretend it is,\" he told Insider.</p><p>\"The impact of the general election was really bad. It wasn't just a bad result &#8212; it deflated what was a big return of optimism to the party and we have been struggling ever since.\"</p><p>With the Liberal Democrats currently languishing at around 6% in the opinion polls, the victor faces a challenge in making the party relevant again.</p><p>Davey, a former carer, has vowed to make the Liberal Democrats the party of social care, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ed-davey-lib-dems-work-keir-starmer-defeat-boris-johnson-2020-7?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">describing</a> the Conservative government's handling of care homes during the coronavirus pandemic as \"negligence on a dramatic scale.\" Moran, who has warned the party that it faces a \"revival or irrelevance,\" wants to lead on education and has caught the eye with radical policies like Universal Basic Income. She also chairs an all-party parliamentary group on the government's response to the coronavirus ahead of a potential second wave this winter.</p><p>Sources close to Davey and Moran expect it to be close, with some suggesting the pair could be separated by just a few percentage points, with the result possibly as tight as the 2007 contest when Nick Clegg won by a margin of just 511 votes. A close result would represent a major turnaround for Moran, who in January was far behind Davey <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/01/ed-davey-ahead-liberal-democrat-leadership-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a YouGov poll of members.</a></p><p>Davey, the party's caretaker leader, is the bookies' favourite having secured the backing of most of the party's MPs, including a surprise nomination from highly-rated Daisy Cooper. A member of Parliament of over 20 years and former minister in the last coalition government, Davey's pitch has focused on his campaigning experience. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ed-davey-lib-dems-work-keir-starmer-defeat-boris-johnson-2020-7?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">He told Business Insider</a> he was the best-placed candidate to \"get the party winning again\" after the disappointment of the snap election in December.</p><p>However, Moran says only she can deliver a clean break from the party's controversial past as unlike Davey, she did not serve in government with the Conservatives. Her campaign got off to a shaky start when <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moran-starmer-labour-should-fear-me-lib-dem-leader-2020-6?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in an interview with Business Insider,</a> she vowed to be \"more radical\" than the Labour Party, a statement that was seized on by opponents as a plan to be more left-wing than Labour. Sources close to the MP for Oxford West &#38; Abingdon say she has enjoyed momentum in the final few weeks of the campaign, winning over undecided members and previous backers of Davey.</p><p>However, party officials and both campaigns admit that in the absence of official polling of members, it is difficult to say with confidence exactly how the contest looks heading into the announcement on Thursday.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f44e86889aff80028ab7b00?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Davey Layla Moran\" height=\"729\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">PA/PA Images via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Cable told Business Insider he was \"genuinely torn\" over who to vote for. He said Davey was a \"very competent guy\" who is \"economically very literate\" and has a \"very good track record on environmental issues.\" However, he added that Moran is \"very good, very sparky,\" an \"impressive operator,\" and appeals to members \"who want a fresh, new approach,\" Cable said.</p><p>A major talking point during the contest has been how the Liberal Democrats should position itself in relation to the opposition Labour party. <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/where-next-liberal-democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As discussed in The New Statesman</a>, with the vast majority of seats the party can realistically win at the next election held by Conservatives, both Davey and Moran agree that the Liberal Democrats should be a centre-left party, taking the fight to what they see as a Conservative party that has lurched further to the right under Boris Johnson.</p><p>Cable told Business Insider that Starmer being Labour leader was a \"good thing\" for the Liberal Democrats as \"it's easier to function as an anti-Tory opposition party when you're dealing with a Labour Party that is electable.\"</p><p>\"One of the big problems we had at the December election was that in the target seats controlled by Conservatives, the dominant mood was 'we like the Lib Dems and agree with you on Europe, but we can't possibly risk having Corbyn run the government.' A lot of those soft Tory Remainers stuck with the Conservatives,\" he said.</p><p>Cable said the next leader of the Liberal Democrats should establish an \"implicit understanding\" with Labour that the priority at the next general election is defeating Conservative candidates, not each other. \"Our future with Labour is complimentary, not competitive,\" he said.</p><p>Both <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ed-davey-lib-dems-work-keir-starmer-defeat-boris-johnson-2020-7?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Davey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moran-starmer-labour-should-fear-me-lib-dem-leader-2020-6?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moran</a> told Business Insider that they'd be prepared to work with Labour leader Starmer to defeat the Conservatives at the next general election by encouraging tactical voting.</p><p>Whoever wins on Thursday will inherit a party scarred by December and faced with questions about its long-term viability. But as Liberal Democrat figures like to stress, the party is second in 91 seats and has four years to rebuild until the next general election. The challenge facing the new leader may be large, but it is not insurmountable.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/liberal-democrats-new-leader-announcement-ed-davey-layla-moran-election-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:QXVau8BzmBE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/JDf1TUJiTB8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 08:55:59 +0000","feedId":13983,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f44e87b89aff80028ab7b01?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"37a6e5708cc4f224e72f35d30888182e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn42@2020_4/2020/08/26/09-00-42-925_14b2204c44ec67a0.webp","destWidth":971,"destHeight":728,"sourceBytes":45344,"destBytes":45344,"author":"apayne@businessinsider.com (Adam Payne)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5b509f4019032f1d008b47b1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn78@2020_1/2020/08/26/09-00-55-722_343d07670ae9555e.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f44e8d889aff80028ab7b02?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn33@2020_4/2020/08/26/09-00-46-922_16451b59effc6dcf.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f44e86889aff80028ab7b00?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn17@2020_3/2020/08/26/09-00-52-450_ad899e538c316012.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-52-638_00f09200df8426be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-51-736_7d0dd268c1e512f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/26/09-00-56-114_68d8bb10118abdfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=JDf1TUJiTB8:bYoffo-NATE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn46@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-47-384_ddb08e62cfb43673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_5/2020/08/26/09-00-52-311_767e235117808cfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-51-477_edf0fa9b5dde1c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/JDf1TUJiTB8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn57@2020_4/2020/08/26/09-00-55-229_2ac5ebfbe873de4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598432350848},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 16:59:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 16:59:10","title":"Read the letter Palantir's CEO wrote attacking Silicon Valley companies as unpatriotic 'engineering elites' and allying itself with the Trump administration","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-s1-ipo-silicon-valley-military-tech-patriotic-alex-karp-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f458fb989aff80028ab7edd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Palantir\" height=\"1854\" width=\"2472\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>In its filing for a direct listing made public on Tuesday, secretive data-crunching firm Palantir is distancing itself from Silicon Valley &#8212;

In times of crisis, effective software can be essential to an organization's survival.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our software platforms are used by the United States and its allies around the world. Many of the world's most vital institutions, from defense and intelligence agencies to companies in the healthcare, energy, and manufacturing sectors, rely on the software platforms that we have built.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The challenges that we face, and the crises that we have and will continue to confront, expose the systemic weaknesses of the institutions on which we depend. Our industrial infrastructure and manufacturing supply chains were conceived of and constructed in a different century. Government agencies have faltered in fulfilling their mandates and serving the public. Some institutions will struggle to survive. Others will collapse.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our customers come to us because their technological infrastructure has failed them. The enterprise software industry's focus on custom software tools and applications is misplaced. Those approaches often only work briefly, if at all. The problems and needs of an organization often change before the software can even be deployed.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our partners require something more. They need generalizable platforms for modeling the world and making decisions. And that is what we have built.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>II.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our company is a creative enterprise, filled with strong personalities who are immensely talented and care deeply about their work.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The culture of our company is more than a mere byproduct of the people we choose to hire. Our culture and means of organizing ourselves are preconditions for the creation of effective software.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We identify what needs to be done and organize ourselves around the outcomes that we hope to achieve. This requires that we stay flexible about who should be leading what and when.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>At many organizations, employees spend their days, even their careers, posturing for others, concerned with claiming credit for success and avoiding blame for failure.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Entire companies can subsist for years on a business model that may have made sense at some point in the past. In the short term, there are often profits to be extracted from the enterprise, and from customers.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We have rejected this way of working. The alignment of interests between our employees and our company, and between our company and our customers, is one of the principal reasons we have come as far as we have.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>III.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our work and the use of our software present difficult questions.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The construction of software platforms that enable more effective surveillance by the state of its adversaries or that assist soldiers in executing attacks raises countless issues, involving the points of tension and tradeoffs between our collective security and individual privacy, the power of machines, and the types of lives we both want to and should lead. The ethical challenges that arise are constant and unrelenting.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We embrace the complexity that comes from working in areas where the stakes are often very high and the choices may be imperfect.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The more fundamental issue is where authority to resolve such questions &#8212; to decide how technology may be used and by whom &#8212; should reside.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our society has effectively outsourced the building of software that makes our world possible to a small group of engineers in an isolated corner of the country. The question is whether we also want to outsource the adjudication of some of the most consequential moral and philosophical questions of our time.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The engineering elite of Silicon Valley may know more than most about building software. But they do not know more about how society should be organized or what justice requires.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>IV.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our company was founded in Silicon Valley. But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector's values and commitments.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>From the start, we have repeatedly turned down opportunities to sell, collect, or mine data. Other technology companies, including some of the largest in the world, have built their entire businesses on doing just that.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Software projects with our nation's defense and intelligence agencies, whose missions are to keep us safe, have become controversial, while companies built on advertising dollars are commonplace. For many consumer internet companies, our thoughts and inclinations, behaviors and browsing habits, are the product for sale. The slogans and marketing of many of the Valley's largest technology firms attempt to obscure this simple fact.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The world's largest consumer internet companies have never had greater access to the most intimate aspects of our lives. And the advance of their technologies has outpaced the development of the forms of political control that are capable of governing their use.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The bargain between the public and the technology sector has for the most part been consensual, in that the value of the products and services available seemed to outweigh the invasions of privacy that enabled their rise.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Americans will remain tolerant of the idiosyncrasies and excesses of the Valley only to the extent that technology companies are building something substantial that serves the public interest. The corporate form itself &#8212; that is, the privilege to engage in private enterprise &#8212; is a product of the state and would not exist without it.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our software is used to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe. If we are going to ask someone to put themselves in harm's way, we believe that we have a duty to give them what they need to do their job.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We have chosen sides, and we know that our partners value our commitment. We stand by them when it is convenient, and when it is not.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>V.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The ability of our most vital institutions to protect and provide for the public requires the right technology.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And we believe that as a result, over the long term, the strength and survival of democratic forms of government do as well.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Alexander C.

physical distancing and mask-wearing, is not required to test for the virus unless they're in an at-risk population.&#160;</p><p>As a caveat, the newly released guidelines also state: \"It is important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms.\"</p><p>Experts told&#160;&#160;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=HomepageHomepage\">The New York Times</a> they're concerned about the revision because it's important to identify infection before there are symptoms as that's when people are most contagious.&#160;</p><p>Last week, the World Health Organization said the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-coronavirus-being-transmitted-by-young-asymptomatic-people-2020-8\">virus is mainly being spread by young people who are unaware</a> that they are infected.&#160;</p><p>\"The epidemic is changing,\" WHO's Western Pacific regional director, Takeshi Kasai, said at a virtual briefing <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who/pandemic-now-driven-by-20s-30s-40s-group-many-asymptomatic-who-idUKKCN25E0AZ\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"66e139c93e8faea6ad4fd71de9c06bcd\">reported Reuters</a>.</p><p>\"People in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are increasingly driving the spread,\" he said. \"Many are unaware they are infected. This increases the risk of spillovers to the more vulnerable.\"</p><p>In July, the CDC itself estimated <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"89ae91847e7947c9522a3fa9a5dcd20a\">that 40% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic.</a>&#160; Additionally, the agency said that the chance of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-estimate-40-percent-infected-with-covid-19-asymptomatic-2020-7\">transmission from those who show no symptoms</a> was 75%.</p><p>\"This is potentially dangerous,\" Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician in Palo Alto, California told the Times.&#160;</p><p>Kuppalli said that restricting the testing just to those who are showing symptoms means&#160; \"you're not looking for a lot of people who are potential spreaders of disease.\"</p><p>Neither the CDC nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to Business Insider's request for comment.</p><p>A representative from the HHS told the Times: \"The decision to be tested should be one made in collaboration with public health officials or your health care provider based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread.\"</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-modified-covid-19-testing-guidelines-to-exclude-asymptomatic-people-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:QXVau8BzmBE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/sw9-zG8VhsM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 23:16:16 +0000","feedId":13983,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f458d4a89aff80028ab7ed9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"316d8dc344dbbc9d5206e5832685a43b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_1/2020/08/26/09-00-43-992_ad3f2d8e39ba782d.webp","destWidth":957,"destHeight":717,"sourceBytes":18088,"destBytes":18088,"author":"salarshani@businessinsider.com (Sarah Al-Arshani)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f458d5a42f43f001ddff083?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn45@2020_1/2020/08/26/09-00-52-863_87a6b13638bb5cc5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-52-638_00f09200df8426be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn66@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-50-831_5ed44d0f267590cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/26/09-00-56-329_52c60a48e88a3f44.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=sw9-zG8VhsM:IRI5hzfyRII:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn81@2020_5/2020/08/26/09-00-51-454_5c786bcf5fea650e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_5/2020/08/26/09-00-52-311_767e235117808cfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/26/09-00-51-477_edf0fa9b5dde1c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/sw9-zG8VhsM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn14@2020_4/2020/08/26/09-00-49-340_6f7ac8d20acbccf2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598432350847},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 16:59:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 16:59:10","title":"10 things in tech you need to know today","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-in-tech-you-need-to-know-today-august-26-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f04f09cf0f419627b46a878?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Alex Karp — CEO of Palantir Alex Karp speaks to the press as he leaves the Elysee Palace in Paris, on May 23, 2018 after the &#34;Tech for Good&#34;

like brick-and-mortar stores and most retailers are already &#8212; which would be the first such law in the US.</p><p>The original version of the bill exempted online sales of auctioned and handmade goods, as well as classified ads sites, meaning most products sold on marketplaces like Etsy, eBay, and Craigslist.</p><p>But on Monday, days after Amazon said in a <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/amazon-stands-ready-to-support-ab-3262-if-all-stores-are-held-to-the-same-standards\">blog post</a> that it would support a version of the bill that applied to all online marketplaces, lawmakers amended AB-3262 to do exactly that.</p><p>Silverman accused Amazon of \"working back channels to redirect this legislation to their advantage\" by lobbying lawmakers to extend its scope to all stores, which he said would harm smaller marketplaces who don't have the resources to comply with its complicated provisions as well as small businesses and consumers onto whom smaller marketplaces would likely pass off those new costs.</p><p>\"While AB 3262 will be an inconvenience to the e-commerce behemoth, it could be crushing to smaller e-commerce players,\" Silverman wrote.</p><p>\"This is an abuse of market power play,\" he added, noting recent criticism of Amazon's potentially anti-competitive behavior from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-antitrust-hearing-recap-bezos-cook-zuckerberg-pichai-testimony-2020-7#:~:text=Wednesday's%20tech%20antitrust%20hearing%20was,about%20their%20companies'%20market%20power.\">lawmakers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-sellers-slam-ceo-jeff-bezos-following-antitrust-testimony-2020-7\">third-party sellers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249\">startups</a> the company has invested in.</p><p>\"Injured consumers should be able to seek compensation regardless of how a particular online marketplace makes money,\" Amazon head of public policy Brian Huseman argued in the Friday blog post. \"For AB 3262 to be a successful, lasting, and meaningful law, it cannot leave open loopholes for some marketplaces to escape accountability.\"</p><p>Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-amazon-dodges-responsibility-for-unsafe-products-the-case-of-the-hoverboard-11575563270\">successfully evaded legal liability</a> for dangerous and defective products for years, but a California court ruled earlier this month that the retail giant should be on the hook after a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/court-rules-amazon-liable-defective-third-party-seller-product-sales-2020-8\">woman alleged she was severely burned</a> when a replacement laptop battery she purchased on Amazon exploded.</p><p>Amazon argued in the case that it wasn't liable because \"it did not distribute, manufacture, or sell the product,\" which was sold by a third-party seller, but the court disagreed.</p><p>\"Whatever term we use to describe Amazon's role, be it 'retailer,' 'distributor,' or merely 'facilitator,' it was pivotal in bringing the product here to the consumer,\" the judge in the case concluded.</p><p>In recent years, more pressure has mounted on lawmakers and regulators to hold online marketplaces and tech platforms &#8212;

href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843953/#RSIF20090407C19\">Carl Fl&#252;gge had a hunch</a>: maybe if you maintain enough physical distance between people who are sick and those who are well, you can prevent the spread of pathogens from person to person.</p><p>At the time, it was just a hypothesis, one that scientists like him often tried to test out using glass plates.</p><p>But it would take another four decades for technology to advance enough to confirm the idea, with the advent of high-speed photography.&#160;</p><p>In the early 1940s, scientists finally got their first glimpses of people's sneezes hurtling through the air in real time, at a capture rate of 30,000 frames per second, confirming that indeed, most of the stuff that we throw into the air when we sneeze, cough, or yell, tends to settle down to the ground within about a wingspan or so (say, 3 to 6 feet).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1531372/\">Here</a> is

class=\"copyright\">Bettmann/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>When 'the dogma was born'</h2><p>Back then, scientists maintained that most of the infectious gunk people expel (say, around 90% of their pathogens) travel less than six feet away.</p><p>Their study measurements were never meant to be taken as hard and fast rules about how far we should stand from other people during a pandemic, though.&#160;</p><p>Nevertheless, these three-to-six-foot rules of thumb have become easy-to-follow protocols for keeping potentially sick people at arm's length during the coronavirus outbreak.&#160;</p><p>\"The dogma was born,\" Professor Lidia Morawaska, a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798\">leading aerosol scientist</a> in Australia, said of the 80-year-old 6-foot rule. \"Like any dogma, it's extremely difficult to change people's minds, and change the dogmas.\"&#160;</p><p>But as the coronavirus pandemic drags on for months on end, Morawaska and other leading air and virus scientists and engineers are starting to lead a charge towards dismantling the old six-foot, dogmatic rule, and taking a more thoughtful, nuanced approach to managing the novel coronavirus's spread.</p><p>Instead of always being on super-high alert, or assuming that a distance of six feet (or wearing masks, or washing hands) keeps us 100% safe all the time, we should be learning how better to assess the situations we're in every day, letting our guard down now and again when it's relatively safe, and moving back onto high-alert when it's appropriate.&#160;</p><h2>Can we start thinking differently?</h2><p>On Tuesday, hoping to inject a little more of such empowerment into the ways that people protect themselves from the virus' spread, <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-08/b-rsd082420.php\">researchers from Oxford and MIT released a new traffic light system</a> that they hope will help people do away with antiquated dogmas, and live life to its fullest, while still being careful <em>enough</em> during the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>\"With knowledge and tools that are relatively simple to use, that distill complex information, our hope is that decision makers, local community leaders, school leaders, and everybody that is organizing anything like a barbecue or party or a wedding, is empowered to be more resilient, by having the tools to make the right decisions and to impose the right restrictions,\" Professor Lydia Bourouiba, Director of the <a href=\"https://lbourouiba.mit.edu/home\">Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission&#160;Lab</a> at MIT, told Business Insider, shortly before her <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3223\">new tool was released in the BMJ</a>.&#160;</p><p>\"We equip people with understanding to adapt in various situations so that they know when they need to be absolutely vigilant, and when they can let their guard down,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>The most important things to keep in mind when assessing the riskiness of any situation include taking a look at the environment you're in, acknowledging the density of the crowd, and the activities that people are doing.&#160;</p><h2>The coronavirus doesn't follow binary hard-and-fast rules about infection, and neither should you</h2><figure>\n\t<img

What matters most is how much virus has a chance to get into your body, regardless of how it gets there.</p><p>\"There are three modes of transmission, and all three modes of transmission have to be controlled,\" she said.</p><p>Those three modes include people (the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-coronavirus-spreads-droplets-aerosols-poop-2020-5\">most common source of infection</a>), surfaces, and the air.&#160;</p><p>\"These things happen at the same time, and therefore distinguishing what's what is very difficult,\" Morawaska said.</p><p>Life is more dangerous, then, in places where people become animated, excited, or otherwise loud in close confines, with stale air.&#160;</p><p>\"Breathing out, singing, coughing, and sneezing generate warm, moist, high momentum gas clouds of exhaled air containing respiratory droplets,\" Bourouiba and her co-authors wrote in the BMJ.&#160;</p><p>In such instances, a distance of even 20 to 30 feet may not be enough to protect you from an infection.&#160;</p><p>Meatpacking plants are then understandably ripe for viral spread, because \"the combination of high levels of worker contagion, poor ventilation, cramped working conditions, background noise (which leads to shouting), and low compliance with mask wearing\" all contribute to viral spread, Bourouiba and her co-authors noted.</p><p>The same issue pops up easily in bars, gyms, indoor music venues, churches, and clubs.&#160;</p><h2>We need to be able to adapt to different environments with different levels of vigilance, so we're not constantly on max alert</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f1afd85f0f4190ad95e38b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coronavirus risk infographic\" height=\"1134\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A different risk chart, similar to the one that Bourouiba and her co-authors invented for the BMJ, which weighs the relative risks of different activities during the pandemic, based on various criteria.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.covid19reopen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel - University of Pennsylvania, Dr. James Phillips - George Washington University, Saskia Popescu - University of Arizona/George Mason University</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Engineers, virologists, and environmental scientists all stress that learning how to live with the virus can be done.</p><p>\"I think everybody understands what traffic lights are in the general public,\" Bourouiba said.&#160;</p><p>She says it's important to have such guides in mind as we weigh how to reopen, gather, and socialize during the pandemic, keeping both our environment, and our behaviors in it, top of mind.</p><p>\"We need to be able to adapt so that we are not constantly at max alert,\" she said. \"Not just the six foot rule, or the mask on its own.\" she added.&#160;</p><p>The simple questions to ask include: How long is the contact? Are people wearing face masks? Is the setting well-ventilated? And will it be quiet or loud?&#160;</p><p>\"It's not rocket science to work out what needs to be done to minimize the risk of infection transmission,\" Morawaska said.&#160;</p><div

celebrated her husband's record as president and offered a solemn call to action at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night.&#160;</p><p>\"I'm here because we need my husband to be our president and commander for four more years,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>Unlike most speakers at the Republican convention, Trump acknowledged the severity of the Covid-19 crisis and offered sympathy for those who've been impacted by it. She specifically offered encouragement to mothers faced with schooling their children at home this fall.&#160;</p><p>Trump's speech, controversially delivered in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-melania-trumps-renovations-to-the-white-house-rose-garden-2020-8\">newly-renovated</a> Rose Garden at the White House, was heavy in praise for her husband and light on policy. About 50 supporters, including the president and other family members, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence attended her speech in person.&#160;</p><p>Ethics experts <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-abused-the-powers-of-the-presidency-a-the-republican-convention-2020-8\">have criticized the president</a> and first lady for using the White House as the backdrop for their RNC appearance this week &#8212; a possible violation of the Hatch Act.&#160;</p><p>The first lady mentioned her experiences visiting members of the military and their families \"around the world\" and those in hospitals, and thanked them for \"inspiring\" her. She told the story of a young hospitalized boy she met in Rome, Italy who received a heart transplant shortly after she visited him.&#160;</p><p>Trump focused on her signature \"Be Best\" campaign, which raises awareness about online bullying and opioid addiction, particularly among children. She said her initiative had shined a light on people and organizations who are working to protect children.&#160;</p><p>\"I continue to believe that by shining a light on these positive examples, others across the country and the globe will be inspired to do their part,\" she said. \"Helping children is not a political goal.\"&#160;</p><p>The initiative doesn't have any concrete policy aims and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-opposed-melania-cyberbullying-campaign-because-of-his-twitter-habits-2018-8\">critics have accused</a> the first lady of hypocrisy for discouraging cyber bullying while her husband uses his Twitter account to attack his critics and political opponents.&#160;</p><p>The first lady said in her second term in the White House, she'd like to work with states to pass legislation to protect children from addiction, abuse and neglect.&#160;</p><p>She also spoke about the \"racial unrest\" in the country and urged Americans to \"focus on our future, while still learning from our past.\"&#160;</p><p>She added, \"I also ask people to stop the looting and violence done in the name of injustice.\"&#160;</p><p>\"While the debates rage on about the issues of race, let's focus on the progress we have made,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>She concluded the address by praising her husband's \"honesty\" and \"authenticity.\"</p><p>\"Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking,\" she said, an apparent joke about his tweets.&#160;</p><p>Trump's speech, which closed the night, contrasted with the first two days of the Republican convention, which were dominated by dark warnings of a socialist takeover, crime, and chaos if the president loses reelection.&#160;</p><p>The second night of the convention featured a series of speakers who highlighted partisan divisions on key issues including immigration and abortion, and attacked Democrats as socialists.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Tuesday night's address was the first lady's most prominent public remarks since her scandal-plagued 2016 convention speech, which included a passage that appeared to be plagiarized from former First Lady Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic convention speech. (A Trump campaign official was blamed for the alleged plagiarism).&#160;</p><p>The first lady rarely speaks at length in public and has remained almost entirely out of the public eye in recent weeks. She's more private and less involved in White House affairs than any other first lady in modern history. The former model and jewelry designer hosts fewer events, travels less, almost never sits for an interview, and rarely campaigns for her husband.&#160;</p><p>She has publicly disagreed with her husband's policies on a few occasions, including publicly criticizing his administration's separation of migrant children from their parents and calling for peaceful demonstrations over police brutality as the president threatened violence against protesters.&#160;</p><p>Trump's speech comes as her former close friend and adviser, socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, prepares to release a book documenting their tumultuous relationship, which reportedly ended after Wolkoff raked in millions for her work on the 2017 inauguration. Wolkoff said she was \"thrown under the bus\" by the first lady amid scrutiny of the inauguration's spending.&#160;</p><p>The book's publisher, Simon &#38; Schuster, says Wolkoff will provide new details about Melania's reactions to the Access Hollywood tape, her husband's alleged affairs and hush money payments, and why the first lady wore a controversial jacket with the words, \"I really don't care, do u?\" printed on it.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

surfaced in a lawsuit involving Google's data collection and location tracking practices, including admissions by the company's own engineers that its privacy settings were confusing to both users and employees.</p><p>In May, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich's office sued Google, accusing the company of deceiving users about when and how it tracked their locations and continuing to track them even after they tried to opt out.</p><p>In a version of the lawsuit that was made public on Friday with additional sections unredacted, multiple Google employees acknowledged that Google's privacy settings and design choices made it difficult for users to actually opt out of location tracking.</p><p>\"The current [user interface] feels like it is designed to make things possible, yet difficult enough that people won't figure it out,\" one employee said, according to the new complaint, which was earlier reported by the <a href=\"https://www.azmirror.com/2020/08/24/unsealed-google-lawsuit-docs-show-its-own-engineers-were-confused-by-privacy-settings/\">Arizona Mirror</a>.</p><p>\"Definitely confusing from a user point of view if we need googlers [to] explain it to us,\" another said.</p><p>\"Privacy controls have long been built into our services and our teams work continuously to discuss and improve them,\" a Google spokesman told the Arizona Mirror. \"In the case of location information, we've heard feedback, and have worked hard to improve our privacy controls. In fact, even these cherry picked published extracts state clearly that the team's goal was to 'Reduce confusion around Location History Settings.'\"</p><p>The lawsuit stemmed in part from a 2018 report by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb/AP-Exclusive:-Google-tracks-your-movements,-like-it-or-not\">Associated Press</a> that found Google continued to track users even after they explicitly changed a privacy setting telling it not to by collecting location information from other Google products.</p><p>While Google defended itself in a statement to the AP at the time, newly unredacted evidence in the lawsuit reveals that even some employees felt the company's settings were deceptive.</p><p>\"I agree with the article. Location off should mean location off, not except for this case or that case,\" one employee said.</p><p>\"Speaking as a user, WTF? More specifically I **thought** I had location tracking turned off on my phone,\" one&#160; engineer said, according to the Arizona Mirror, adding: \"So our messaging around this is enough to confuse a privacy focused (Google software engineer). That's not good.\"</p><p>The attorney general's office alleged in the complaint that \"even top-level Google employees do not understand under what conditions Google collects location data.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20385392/arizona-v-google-exhibits-20-23.pdf\">New exhibits</a> released along with the less redacted complaint also showed how Google scrambled to respond to the AP article, holding an \"oh sh--\" meeting to discuss its PR reponse and changes to its privacy settings.</p><p>\"Both comms and policy are looking for an update on where we are in terms of fixing 'location history' fixes and having one single place to turn off instead of 3,\" one employee wrote in a recap of the meeting, according to the exhibit.</p><p>Google also tracked the story's reach in daily reports, according to <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arizona-v-google-exhibit-219-225.pdf\">another exhibit</a>, identifying more than 60,000 mentions on social media and characterizing 100% of related media coverage as \"negative.\"</p><p>This is not the first time Google has faced legal scrutiny over how it collects and uses data.</p><p>Last December, the European Union opened an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-faces-eu-investigation-over-collection-of-data-2019-12\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"0d29e179cb4b558b169bb0fa2944436a\">antitrust investigation</a>&#160;into how Google leverages data months after slapping the company with its third multibillion-dollar fine in just three years.</p><p>Regulators in the US have also been looking into whether Google's data practices unfairly give it an edge in its online ads and search businesses. A group of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/state-attorneys-general-launch-antitrust-probe-into-google-2019-9\">state attorneys general</a> (including Brnovich) and the US Justice Department
