Previous studies reported that minority patients with ACS have distinct clinical, genetic and socioeconomic backgrounds that may affect clinical outcomes.Hypothesis:To investigate post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes according to race/ethnicity in a contemporary ACS population.Methods:We included consecutive patients undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation for STEMI, non-STEMI or unstable angina (UA) between 2012-2017. The study population was stratified into Caucasian, African American, Hispanic and Asian. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) defined as a composite of death, spontaneous myocardial infarction or stroke at 1 year.Results:Of the 6800 patients included, 3377 (49.7%) were Caucasian, 1408 (20.7%) Hispanic, 1156 (17.0%) Asian and 859 (12.6%) African American. Caucasians were the oldest, Hispanics and Asians had the highest prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and African Americans had more insulin dependent DM and chronic kidney disease. Hispanics and African Americans had the highest STEMI rate, while Asians were more likely to present with UA, have private insurance and be discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel. Compared to Caucasians, Asians had a lower rate of MACCE at 1 year (3.9% vs. 7.1%; p&amp;lt;0.01) whereas Hispanics (6.2% vs. 7.1%; p-value=0.17) and African Americans (8.0% vs. 7.1%; p-value=0.38) had comparable outcomes. Differences were driven by fewer deaths in the Hispanic (2.1% vs. 4.2%; p&amp;lt;0.01) and Asian (1.7% vs. 4.2%; p&amp;lt;0.01) subgroups. Findings remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounders [Figure].Conclusions:Among patients undergoing PCI for ACS, Asian race is associated with favorable cardiovascular outcomes compared to Caucasian. No significant differences were observed for Hispanics and African Americans.","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:10:45 +0000","feedId":42832,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"715423112fe9b74a6f4b1d0538696536","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"\nAnastasios Roumeliotis\nBimmer E Claessen\nSamantha Sartori\nDavide Cao\nWon-Joon Koh\nJohny Nicolas\nHanbo Qiu\nRishi Chandiramani\nMauro Chiarito\nRidhima Goel\nJoseph Sweeny\nNitin Barman\nPrakash Krishnan\nAnnapoorna Kini\nSamin K Sharma\nGeorge Dangas\nRoxana Mehran\nMount Auburn Hosp, Cambridge, MA\nMount Sinai Hosp, New York, NY\nICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MT SINAI, New York, NY\nIcahn Sch of Medicine, NEW YORK, NY\nDrexel Univ, PA\nIcahn Sch of Medicine, New York, NY\nMount Sinai Med Cntr, New York, NY\nMount Sinai, New York, NY\nScarsdale, NY\n","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605683517400}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 15:11:57","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 15:11:57","feedId":42832,"fetchDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 07:11:57 +0000","fetchMs":1205,"handleMs":5332,"totalMs":26722,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":3230,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"37ff164ed8700febcc02ea7a26d1d1bb","hostName":"europe69*","requestId":"ebd809a30f4d4437a0c356d7d5836592_42832","contentType":"application/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:28:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:46:01","id":42832,"name":"WoltersKluwer: Circulation: Table of Contents","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&feed=rss&jc=circ","subscriber":75,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.ahajournals.org/cms/asset/404ced4a-62a7-4f32-b099-db30c56c856e/default_cover.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn28@2020_3/2020/09/06/21-46-00-373_60b749c493cbdcd6.webp","description":"Table of Contents for Circulation.
