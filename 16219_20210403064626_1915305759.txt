Not only has she shown her work all over the world, she was also the head of the painting program at <a href=\"https://cranbrookart.edu/\">Cranbrook</a> for 26 years. Yeah. Anyway, long story short &#8211; I asked, she said yes, and here we are! I&#8217;m so excited for you to hear this episode&#8230; it’s filled to the brim with stories, insights, and no-nonsense roll up your sleeves &#8216;n get to work advice. You can listen right up there under Bev and her jaw-dropping work, or subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/jealous-curator-art-for-your/id996338562\">Apple Podcasts</a> and/or <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2ELjX4nIVWpI3XMNW139WN\">Spotify.</a></p>\n<p>First, the group of Bev&#8217;s paintings <em>{!?}</em> I posted a few months ago:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/03/19/never-let-the-world-define-you/bev_fishman2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38186\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38186\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bev_fishman2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"7375\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yes, they&#8217;re paintings. Craziness.. they are literally glowing!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the piece I was referring to when I asked Beverly about titles. This is <em>&#8220;Untitled (Digestive Problems, Asthma, Depression, Depression)&#8221;</em>, 2019, Urethane paint on wood:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/03/19/never-let-the-world-define-you/bev_fishman3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38187\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38187\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bev_fishman3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"1217\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gorgeous &#8230; who knew digestive problems, asthma, depression, and depression could be so fabulous!?

Speaking of which&#8230; from paintings of pills, to pills made with glass:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/03/19/never-let-the-world-define-you/bev_fishman_5-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38192\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38192\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bev_fishman_5-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"2722\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Gasp!</em> Aren&#8217;t those STUNNING?
