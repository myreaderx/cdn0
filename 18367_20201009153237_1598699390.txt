It&#8217;s been just three months since 1.12, yet this release brings lots of small and two big improvements. For those two I have to thank two people in particular.</p>\n<p>First, Damian Mooyman, heavily improved the error message display implementation. From the outside, nothing really changed (this is a minor release after all, so backwards compatibility is a given). Though once you switch the bad default for the <code>errorPlacement</code> option to something like a <code>&#60;span></code> (this default will change in 2.0), the error label gets associated to the element using <code>aria-describedby</code>. Along with the other ARIA attributes the plugin is already using, this gives screenreader users a much better experience. There&#8217;s lots of details involved, which don&#8217;t quite fit into this blog post. If you&#8217;re interested, check out the discussion for the two pull requests that made this happen, <a href=\"https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/1083\">#1083</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/1140\">#1140</a>.</p>\n<p>The other big one is support for AMD, implemented by Lars Laade. While there was a lot less discussion, he had to update most of the source files. I especially like that the UMD wrappers are added as part of the build step, keeping them out of the source files themselves. Again, if you&#8217;re interested in the details, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/1106\">pull request #1106</a>.</p>\n<p>I also want to thank Nick Schonning and Markus Staab, who have been helping out with ticket triage and lots of smaller details.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://jqueryvalidation.org/files/jquery-validation-1.13.0.zip\">Download this release.</a></strong></p>\n<p>If you use the plugin, please <a href=\"http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159\">donate or ask your boss to make a donation</a>!
