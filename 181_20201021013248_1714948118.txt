Our engineers work to offer the best search engine possible, constantly <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/search-on/?_ga=2.205527636.693664702.1602605439-678249610.1600277824\">improving and fine-tuning it</a>. We think that’s why a wide cross-section of Americans <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/04/25/how-much-would-you-pay-to-keep-using-google\">value</a> and often <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/most-loved-brands-2020/\">love</a> our free products. </p><p>Today’s lawsuit by the Department of Justice is deeply flawed. People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to, or because they can't find alternatives. </p><p>This lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers. To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>The Department's dubious complaint</h3><p>Let's talk specifics. The Department's complaint relies on dubious antitrust arguments to criticize our efforts to make Google Search easily available to people. </p><p>Yes, like countless other businesses, we pay to promote our services, just like a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at the end of a row or on a shelf at eye level. For digital services, when you first buy a device, it has a kind of home screen “eye level shelf.” On mobile, that shelf is controlled by Apple, as well as companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon, Samsung and LG. On desktop computers, that shelf space is overwhelmingly controlled by Microsoft. </p><p>So, we negotiate agreements with many of those companies for eye-level shelf space. But let's be clear—our competitors are readily available too, if you want to use them. </p><p>Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software. Other search engines, including Microsoft’s Bing, compete with us for these agreements. And our agreements have passed repeated antitrust reviews. </p><p>Here's more detail:</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Apple devices</h3>Apple features Google Search in its Safari browser because they say Google is “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90269911/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-this-is-the-best-search-engine-out-there\">the best</a>.” This arrangement is not exclusive—our competitors Bing and Yahoo! pay to prominently feature, and other rival services also appear.</div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"Bing and Yahoo! pay Apple to be featured in Safari. iPhone 11 and Macbook Pro showing iOS 14 and MacOS Catalina with callouts showing Yahoo!, Bing and Google icons\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Safari_Searches_with_Copy.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Changing your search engine in Safari is easy.

These agreements enable us to distribute Android for free, so they directly reduce the price that people pay for phones. But even with these agreements, carriers and device makers often preload numerous competing apps and app stores.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"Rival apps and app stores are often preloaded onto Android devices.

This isn’t the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0\">dial-up 1990s</a>, when changing services was slow and difficult, and often required you to buy and install software with a CD-ROM. Today, you can easily download your choice of apps or change your default settings in a matter of seconds—faster than you can walk to another aisle in the grocery store. </p><p>This lawsuit claims that Americans aren’t sophisticated enough to do this. But we know that’s not true. And you know it too: people downloaded a record <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/\">204 billion apps</a> in 2019. Many of the world's most popular apps aren't preloaded—think of Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>The data shows that people choose their preferred service: take Mozilla’s Firefox browser as an example. It’s funded almost entirely by revenue from search promotional agreements.  When Yahoo! paid to be the default search engine in Firefox, most Americans promptly switched their search engine to their first choice—Google. (Mozilla later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/14/mozilla-terminates-its-deal-with-yahoo-and-makes-google-the-default-in-firefox-again/\">chose</a> Google to be its default search provider, citing an “effort to provide quality search” and its “focus on user experience.”)</p><p>It’s also trivially easy to change your search engine in our browser, Chrome.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Setting your search engine on Chrome mobile.

It claims that we compete only with other general search engines. But that’s demonstrably wrong. People find information in lots of ways: They look for news on Twitter, flights on Kayak and Expedia, restaurants on OpenTable, recommendations on Instagram and Pinterest. And when searching to buy something, around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3617671-amazon-first-stop-for-60-of-all-online-shoppers\">60 percent</a> of Americans start on Amazon. Every day, Americans choose to use all these services and thousands more.</div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Next steps</h3><p>We understand that with our success comes scrutiny, but we stand by our position. American antitrust law is designed to promote innovation and help consumers, not tilt the playing field in favor of particular competitors or make it harder for people to get the services they want. We’re confident that a court will conclude that this suit doesn’t square with either the facts or the law. </p><p>In the meantime, we remain absolutely focused on delivering the free services that help Americans every day. Because that’s what matters most.</p><p>You can learn more about our approach to competition at <a href=\"https://g.co/competition\">g.co/competition</a>. <br/></p></div></div></body></html><img
