One strong, unique password lets you into your entire bank of passwords. They&#8217;re great for storing your passwords and other secrets, but also for encouraging you to use better, stronger, unique passwords. And because many are cross-platform, you can bring your passwords with you. Plenty of password managers exist — from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/free-lastpass/\">LastPass</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/mozillas-free-password-manager-firefox-lockbox-launches-on-android/\">Lockbox</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dashlane-series-d/\">Dashlane</a>, to open-source versions like KeePass. Many are free, but a premium subscription often comes with benefits and better features. And if you&#8217;re a journalist, 1Password has <a href=\"https://1password.com/for-journalism/\">a free subscription</a> just for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Many free; premium offerings start at $36 &#8211; $45 annually<br />\n<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/\">1Password</a> | <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/premium/payment\">LastPass</a> | <a href=\"https://www.dashlane.com/plans\">Dashlane</a> | <a href=\"https://keepass.info/\">KeePass</a></p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t forget about a physical two-factor key</h2>\n<p>Your online accounts have everything about you and you&#8217;d want to keep them safe. A security key is a physical hardware device that offers far greater protections than a two-factor code going to your phone. A security key plugs into your USB port on your computer (or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/yubikey-dual-usb-c-lightning/\">the charging port on your phone</a>) to &#8220;prove&#8221; to online services, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, that you are who you say you are. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/yubico-launches-a-new-nfc-security-key-and-preps-iphone-support/\">YubiKeys</a> are by far our favorite and come in all shapes and sizes. The latest YubiKey 5 series has something for everyone, no matter what kind of devices they have. They&#8217;re also cheap. Google also has a range of its own branded <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/google-titan-security-key-usb-c/\">Titan security keys</a>, one of which also offers Bluetooth connectivity.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> From $25 &#8211; $55, depending on device type, from <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/products/compare-yubikey-5-series/\">Yubico Store</a> or <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key\">Google Store</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"a-webcam-cover-to-hide-your-modesty\">A webcam cover to protect your privacy</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re all living through this pandemic together, and most of us are still working from home. If you, like me, have accidentally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/08/sorry-i-gatecrashed-your-zoom-meeting/\">joined a video call by mistake</a>, you&#8217;ll be more thankful for your webcam cover than you could ever know. Webcam covers slide open when you need to access your camera, and slides to cover the lens when you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that easy. You can buy webcam covers from practically anywhere — just make sure you get a thin cover that supports your device so as to not damage its display when you close the lid. You can support local businesses and nonprofits — you can search for unique and interesting webcam covers on Etsy or from your favorite internet rights group.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $5 &#8211; $10.<br />\n<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/market/webcam_covers\">Etsy</a> | <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/shop/laptop-camera-cover-set-ii\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"a-microphone-blocker\">A microphone blocker to prevent hot mics (and malware)</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your webcam cover, what about your microphone? Just as hackers can tap into your webcam, they can also pick up on your audio. Microphone blockers contain a semiconductor that tricks your computer or device into thinking that it&#8217;s a working microphone, when in fact it&#8217;s not able to pick up any audio. Anyone hacking into your device won&#8217;t hear a thing. Some modern Macs already come with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/\">a new Apple T2 security chip</a> which prevents hackers from snooping on your microphone when your laptop&#8217;s lid is shut. But a microphone blocker will work all the time, even when the lid is open.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPQJGA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=techcrunchgg-20&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01LPQJGA2&#38;linkId=e78b907f7bb41f37fbd6a0478aa177aa\">$7</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V9T14N3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=techcrunchgg-20&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07V9T14N3&#38;linkId=3b38295afe79ddde59bc38485389254d\">$20</a> on Amazon</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>More gifts for the security and privacy minded</h1>\n<h2 id=\"pi-hole-to-block-pesky-ads-and-online-trackers\">A Pi-hole to block pesky ads and online trackers</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2073779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2073779\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2073779 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2073779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Image: Pi-hole)</p></div></p>\n<p>Think of a Pi-hole as a &#8220;hardware ad-blocker.&#8221; A Pi-hole is a modified Raspberry Pi mini-computer that runs ad-blocking technology as a box that sits on your network. It means that everyone on your home network benefits from ad blocking. Online ads generate revenue for websites but are also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/apple-online-ads-private/\">notorious for tracking users</a> across the web. Until ads can behave properly, a Pi-hole is a great way to capture and sinkhole bad ad traffic. The hardware may be cheap, but the ad-blocking software is free.

It&#8217;s not as much of an issue when we&#8217;re all at home — but we&#8217;re also all getting pretty comfortable with having whatever on our screens right now, which might not be the best habit to develop. Privacy screens can help protect you from &#8220;visual hacking.&#8221; These screens make it near-impossible for anyone other than the device user to snoop at what you&#8217;re working on.

The company has been working on wearable airbag systems for motorbikes.</p>\n<p>Integrated in a vest, the airbag is completely autonomous and can detect crashes in 60 milliseconds. The company has worked on a device called the In&#38;box that analyzes movements in real time. Thanks to different sensors, the device can determine when it’s time to activate the airbag.</p>\n<p>In&#38;motion has worked on different profiles for different types of activities. For instance, if you’re riding a motorcycle on a MotoGP track, chances are you’re going to move faster and change your trajectory quite often. You can choose between traditional motorcycle riding, track and off-road.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Professional racers are increasingly using airbag systems. In addition to MotoGP racers, participants in the 2021 Dakar Rallye will have to use airbags.</p>\n<p>The go-to-market strategy is interesting as the startup isn’t selling its system directly to end users. In&#38;motion has partnered with existing motorcycle brands so they can integrate the system in some vests. This way, In&#38;motion doesn’t have to build out a network of resellers from scratch. So far, the company has sold tens of thousands of systems.</p>\n<p>There’s also a <a href=\"https://www.inemotion.com/myinemotion/en/moto-membership\">subscription component</a>, with unlimited warranty and the ability to replace the In&#38;box device with a new model after three years.</p>\n<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to expand beyond its home country with a focus on Germany and the U.S. The company plans to double the size of its team.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2086064\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Building so much of the app using Snap&#8217;s developer tools could have made porting the tech to Twitter&#8217;s infrastructure a more complicated task, especially when considering how often Snap Kit apps are tied quite closely to the Snapchat user graph.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zWMpXWdZ1M\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/squad-the-anti-bro-startup/\">Squad, the &#8216;anti-bro startup,&#8217; is creating a safe space for teenage girls online</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Squad, the &#8216;anti-bro startup,&#8217; is creating a safe space for teenage girls online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/squad-the-anti-bro-startup/embed/#?secret=zWMpXWdZ1M\" data-secret=\"zWMpXWdZ1M\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Squad raised $7.2 million in venture capital from First Round, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"y-combinator\">Y Combinator, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> betaworks, Halogen Ventures, ex-TechCrunch editor <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/alexia-tsotsis\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"alexia-tsotsis\">Alexia Bonatsos&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Dream Machine and a host of other investors.

One way of blocking radiation is a Faraday cage, but this is usually a metal mesh of some kind, making everyday use difficult. Researchers at Drexel University have managed to create a Faraday fabric by infusing ordinary cotton with a compound called MXene — meaning your tinfoil hat is about to get a lot comfier.</p>\n<p>Faraday cages work because radiation in radio frequencies is blocked by certain metals, but because of its wavelength, the metal doesn&#8217;t even have to be solid — it can be a solid cage or flexible mesh. Many facilities are lined with materials like this to prevent outside radiation from interfering with sensitive measurements, but recently companies like <a href=\"https://silent-pocket.com/\">Silent Pocket</a> have integrated meshes into bags and cases that totally isolate devices from incoming signals.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be frank here and say that this is definitely paranoia-adjacent. RF radiation is not harmful in the doses and frequencies we get it, and the FCC makes sure no device exceeds certain thresholds. But there&#8217;s also the possibility that your phone or laptop is naively connecting to public Wi-Fi, getting its MAC number skimmed by other devices, and otherwise interacting with the environment in a way you might not like. And honestly&#8230; with the amount of devices emitting radiation right now, who wouldn&#8217;t mind lowering their dose a little, just to be extra sure?</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That may be much easier to do in the near future, as Yury Gogotsi and his team at the Drexel Nanomaterials Institute, of which he is director, have come up with a way to coat ordinary textile fibers in a metallic compound that makes them effective Faraday cages — but also flexible, durable and washable.</p>\n<p>The material, which they call MXene and is more of a category than a single compound, is useful in lots of ways, and <a href=\"https://nano.materials.drexel.edu/publications/\">the subject of dozens of papers by the team</a> — this is just the most recent application.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have known for some time that MXene has the ability to block electromagnetic interference better than other materials, but this discovery shows that it can effectively adhere to fabrics and maintain its unique shielding capabilities,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/du-ff121120.php\">said Gogotsi in a news release</a>.

In this case it&#8217;s a liquid — a solution of tiny MXene flakes that adhere to the fabric quite easily and produce a Faraday effect, blocking 99.9% of RF radiation in tests. After sitting around for a couple years (perhaps forgotten in a lab cupboard) it kept 90% of their effectiveness, and the treated fabric can also be washed and worn safely.</p>\n<p>You wouldn&#8217;t necessarily want to wear a whole suit of the stuff, but this would make it easier for clothing to include an RF-blocking pocket in a jacket, jeans or laptop bag that doesn&#8217;t feel out of place with the other materials. A hat (or underwear) with a layer of this fabric would be a popular item among conspiracy theorists, of course.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still a ways from showing up on the rack, but Gogotsi was optimistic about its prospects for commercialization, noting that Drexel has multiple patents on the material and its uses. Other ways of infusing fabric with MXenes could lead to clothes that generate and store energy as well.</p>\n<p>You can read more about this particular application of MXenes <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0008622320311982?via%3Dihub#!\">in the journal Carbon</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SCBqI6fE4ko\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:13:58 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg","linkMd5":"5164c71e24822f826712349e1c658f98","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-43-296_1205fce26ae1daa7.webp","destWidth":2438,"destHeight":1578,"sourceBytes":323645,"destBytes":45608,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-43-296_1205fce26ae1daa7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-390_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-401_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-52-385_ac69d064996149e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SCBqI6fE4ko:Y_KEfrplxhI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn62@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-428_7abc1b0e57af3a26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-53-434_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SCBqI6fE4ko":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn41@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-53-290_f6f2aabc96628d06.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759129894},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","title":"What to expect while fundraising in 2021","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2083793","description":"<div class=\"article__contributor-byline-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"article__contributor-byline\">\n\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__contributor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"byline__author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-name\">Russ Heddleston</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-title\" style=\"display: block;\">Contributor</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"contributor__twitter\">\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/rheddleston\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--twitter icon--white\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" version=\"1.1\" aria-labelledby=\"title\">\n\t\t<title>Share on Twitter</title>\n\t\t<path d=\"M20,4c-0.7,0.3-1.5,0.6-2.4,0.7c0.9-0.5,1.5-1.4,1.8-2.3c-0.8,0.5-1.7,0.8-2.6,1C16.1,2.5,15,2,13.8,2c-2.3,0-4.1,1.9-4.1,4.2c0,0.3,0,0.7,0.1,1C6.4,7,3.4,5.4,1.4,2.9C1,3.5,0.8,4.1,0.8,4.9c0,1.4,0.7,2.7,1.8,3.5C2,8.4,1.4,8.2,0.8,7.9v0.1c0,2,1.4,3.7,3.3,4.1c-0.4,0.1-0.7,0.2-1.1,0.2c-0.3,0-0.5,0-0.8-0.1c0.5,1.7,2,2.9,3.8,2.9c-1.4,1.1-3.2,2-5.1,2c-0.3,0-0.7,0-1-0.1c1.8,1.2,4,1.7,6.3,1.7c7.5,0,11.7-6.4,11.7-12V6.1C18.8,5.6,19.4,4.8,20,4z\"/>\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tRuss is the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.docsend.com/\">DocSend</a>.

Now we are staring down the end of 2020 and looking toward what we all hope is a better, safer 2021. What will this new year bring? With an end-of-year sprint to close deals, the anticipation of a new presidential administration and the hope of a COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon, startups and VCs know that change is on the horizon — but how much of that change will be positive?</p>\n<p>As 2020 proved, no one can say for sure what 2021 will bring, but I’d like to put a few predictions on the table based on DocSend’s data and research, including the <a href=\"https://www.docsend.com/index/2020-docsend-startup-index/\">DocSend Startup Index</a>, as well as some trends I’ve seen and my own experiences. These predictions center around how we’ll fundraise post-pandemic, how the funding divide may widen for some, what fundraising activity could look like into 2021, a few sectors we think will fare well and will incorporate some tips on how to succeed in the new year, no matter what comes our way.</p>\n<h2>We’ll interact through a mix of the old and the new</h2>\n<p>The pandemic forced all of us to drastically change how we work and interact with colleagues and clients. When the pandemic subsides and vaccines are widely available, in-person meetings and gathering back at the office will definitely resume, but it’s safe to say the old ways of networking and fundraising won’t shift back 100%. Founders and VCs alike have navigated the ups and downs of remote networking and fundraising interactions and will stick to what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Is traveling to a conference the best way for a founder to have a chance at meeting the VC who is right to support their business? Will a VC want to drive an hour through Bay Area traffic for an in-person status update meeting on their latest investment? Zoom fatigue aside, video conference calls do have some benefits — efficiency, no travel time — although not all meetings are best conducted virtually.</p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tNo matter what 2021 has in store, founders can still take proactive steps to help them succeed in their fundraising efforts.\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t</div>\n\t</p>\n<p>The extent to which businesses go in-person or stick to virtual meetings could depend directly on what round of fundraising they are working toward or have completed. Businesses in the <a href=\"https://try.docsend.com/fundraising-report\">pre-seed round</a> might stick with more Zoom meetings in order to conserve resources.</p>\n<p>Founders in the seed round will likely split between video and in-person meetings as they are under pressure to show traction in this round, as we found in <a href=\"https://try.docsend.com/seed-report-webinar\">our report on seed fundraising</a>, yet will also need to conserve resources and time. For <a href=\"https://try.docsend.com/series-a-fundraising-report-webinar\">Series A</a>, they might have to meet less in person because they have established relationships with their investors. Series B might see more in-person meetings as their business has reached a level of complexity that is difficult to communicate via a deck or video conference.</p>\n<h2>The funding divide may widen for those outside Silicon Valley<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/LB6VRwN2J4Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 19:12:59 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"e238e69c1bf45e2e42f693226558def5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-390_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-401_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-52-407_cf76940169730ea2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LB6VRwN2J4Q:2K6GsfAUSl8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn63@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-52-387_c475591ffc03d4c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-53-434_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/LB6VRwN2J4Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn58@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-53-405_b77dc7c6104cbb19.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759129882},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","title":"FDA grants emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, distribution to begin within days","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2086344","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/pfizer-vaccine-authorized.html?smtyp=cur&#38;smid=tw-nytimes\">granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the COVID-19 vaccine</a> developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, the New York Times first reported on Friday night, and later <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-is-authorized-in-the-u-s-11607740101?mod=e2tw\">supported by The Wall Street Journal</a>.

Most American shouldn&#8217;t expect the vaccine to be available until at least late Q1 or Q2 2021, given the pace of Pfizer&#8217;s production and the U.S. order volume.</p>\n<p>Still, this is a promising first step, and a monumental achievement in terms of vaccine development turnaround time, since it&#8217;s been roughly eight months since work began on the Pfizer vaccine candidate. Moderna has also submitted an EUA for its vaccine candidate, which is also an mRNA treatment (which provides instructions to a person&#8217;s cells to produce effective countermeasures to the virus). That could follow shortly, meaning two vaccines might be available under EUA within the U.S. before the end of the year.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9SDq3TRmbt0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 02:40:44 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"99dd5c94510fe74a60d1a48bb11fddfd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-390_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-401_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn74@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-53-401_f4ca29eab4f7e31e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9SDq3TRmbt0:d0CU0NpNnR8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn50@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-52-508_540a81f7ff3c1f1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-53-434_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9SDq3TRmbt0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-317_c8207fdb031660df.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759129876},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","title":"Benchmark fills out its, yes, bench, with Miles Grimshaw","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2086146","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/benchmark\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"benchmark\">Benchmark, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the storied venture firm, has brought aboard a fifth general partner: 29-year-old Miles Grimshaw, a Yale graduate who joins the outfit from Thrive Capital, where he similarly joined a team of four other partners back in 2013, helping them raise the firm&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/miles-grimshaw/?sh=3622f9f3612c\">fourth and fifth funds</a> (per Forbes).</p>\n<p>From his post as a general partner with New York-based Thrive, Grimshaw had sourced deals in some of today&#8217;s buzziest startups and served on their boards, including Lattice, Mapbox, Benchling and Airtable, getting to know fellow investors at Benchmark in the process.</p>\n<p>He represented Thrive on the board of <a href=\"https://www.benchling.com/\">Benchling</a> &#8212; whose software helps lab scientists manage their biotech research &#8212; with Eric Vishria, a former entrepreneur and operator who joined Benchmark as a general partner in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/eric-vishria-benchmark/\">2014</a>.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Grimshaw also represented Thrive on the board of the cloud collaboration software company <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">Airtable</a> with Peter Fenton, who became the longest-serving general partner at Benchmark this year, as famed VC Bill Gurley began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/\">transitioning out</a> of an active role at the firm.

These corporations are not publishers, they are not distributors, they are not merely adtech providers; they are indiscriminate, radically indifferent all-you-can-eat extractors of everything forever, all for the sake of prediction that become more lucrative as they approach certainty,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Knowledge at this kind of scale produces a new kind of power over people. This is what data scientists call the shift from monitoring to actuation. Where there&#8217;s actually sufficient data about a machine system to be able to control it remotely.

Not least because a key EVP involved in shaping the new digital strategy, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"margrethe-vestager\">Margrethe Vestager, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is also the competition commissioner &#8212; so she&#8217;s simultaneously tasked with deciding whether to waive the tech giant&#8217;s latest data acquisition through, even as she puts the finishing touches on ex ante rules for gatekeepers that won&#8217;t likely come into force for years.</p>\n<p>Vestager told the EU parliament&#8217;s <a href=\"https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-economic-and-monetary-affairs_20201210-0900-COMMITTEE-ECON_vd\">Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs</a> this week that the Commission&#8217;s incoming proposals for a major overhaul of digital regulations are necessary to tackle the challenges of the platform economy.</p>\n<p>The scale and the scope of the platform economy is &#8220;unprecedented and it&#8217;s increasing&#8221;, she said, acknowledging that the digitization process has &#8220;given us a concentration of data, intellectual property, capital &#8212; and because of that there&#8217;s a lot of power in the hands of a few global players&#8221;.</p>\n<p>That in turn is making it &#8220;really urgent&#8221; to complement existing EU competition law enforcement with dedicated regulation for digital services and platform giants, said Vestager.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The DSA will propose a clear set of due diligence obligations and operate the e-commerce framework for all Internet services within the EU and the point is to ensure that digital services face no borders within the EU, define clearer responsibilities and accountability for online platforms such as social media and marketplaces,&#8221; she told MEPs &#8212; saying the overarching aim is to ensure consumers have the same protections online as they already do offline.</p>\n<p>The aim of the DMA &#8212; and its incoming list of &#8220;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8221; for platforms that the EU will define as gatekeepers &#8212; is to make sure digital markets &#8220;stay open and contestable&#8221;, and thus to serve consumers in &#8220;the best possible way&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>&#8216;Trust but verify&#8217; via audit authority</h2>\n<p>In her keynote, Zuboff suggested EU regulators should follow two key principles as they consider what to do.</p>\n<p>Firstly, &#8220;trust but verify&#8221; is how to treat with surveillance capitalists &#8212; so no more &#8220;taken at face value&#8221; pledges swallowed naively and later regurgitated under the one-way logic of extraction maximization. (She raised the awkward example of Facebook&#8217;s reversal of an earlier pledge to EU regulators not to combine WhatsApp user data with Facebook data.)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;Secondly we have to keep in mind so often we reduce the harms back to that originating context of targeted advertising &#8212; when in fact this whole economic logic has moved way beyond targeted advertising to many other markets,&#8221; she also said, warning against EU regulators taking too narrow a view on any concessions made by Google as it works to push open another data gate.  </span></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Commission for comment on Zuboff&#8217;s remarks.</p>\n<p>Zuboff also spoke to concerns that EU regulators don&#8217;t believe they have legal grounds to deny Google-Fitbit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the decision to approve Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit was made because of a determination that EU laws are not strong enough to defend the acquisition denial in the European courts then let us please stop talking this minute; let&#8217;s suspend our event while the parliament moves into an emergency session to pass new laws that are strong enough to take this kind of rejection through the courts. Because we need those laws,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>It would certainly be ironic if the Commission green-lit the Google-Fitbit merger because it was worried about losing a legal challenge down the line &#8212; given how frequently tech giants resort to legal action to try to thwart the application of existing EU regulations. Not to mention how fiercely these giants lobby against <em>any</em> new regulation or legislative proposal that would dare to put limits on their ability to continue maximizing their data extraction.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MEOwlUdXbe\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/google-pushes-europe-to-limit-gatekeeper-platform-rules/\">Google pushes Europe to limit &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platform rules</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Google pushes Europe to limit &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platform rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/google-pushes-europe-to-limit-gatekeeper-platform-rules/embed/#?secret=MEOwlUdXbe\" data-secret=\"MEOwlUdXbe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Zuboff said the forthcoming DMA &#8220;is the legal instrument to accomplish this necessary lawmaking [against the surveillance capitalists]&#8221;, addressing her remarks to those in the EU who have the power to pass laws.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Make no mistake: This is your opportunity to make a bold intervention to defend democracy against the surveillance capitalists.

In Europe we do not have a ban of monopolies. They have a different legal basis in the U.S. We would say you&#8217;re more than welcome to be successful but with success comes responsibility &#8212; which is why we have article 102 [against abusing a dominant position],&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a last resort in Europe we would also be able to ask our [institutions] to split up companies but then we would also have to prove that this was the only thing to solve a competition problem and I don&#8217;t think we have been there yet,&#8221; Vestager added.</p>\n<p>Responding to other questions from MEPs she described her department as doing its &#8220;best&#8221; across a number of big tech investigations &#8212; pointing it&#8217;s recently opened case against Amazon and has others ongoing into Google&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s use of data for advertising.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a couple of ongoing investigations into the Facebook ecosystem &#8212; on the use of data from customers and consumers into advertising and how the Facebook marketplace is functioning,&#8221; she noted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These cases are not as advanced as they are in the U.S. when it comes to Facebook but I find [the U.S. action] very encouraging,&#8221; she added, saying it&#8217;s a sign that &#8220;the global debate about tech dominance has been shifting over the last couple of years&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Asked about Facebook&#8217;s reversal of an earlier promise not to combine Facebook and WhatsApp user data, Vestager said EU regulators had performed an analysis at the time &#8212; looking into whether such a move would still allow for competition &#8212; and &#8220;found there would be room for others services of the same kind&#8221;.</p>\n<p>There were no follow-up questions in the event format so MEPs were unable to ask whether Vestager believes that analysis was sound or flawed. But it&#8217;s not a good look that the EU&#8217;s competition authorities were left so wrong-footed on Facebook&#8217;s market power.</p>\n<p>Off her own bat, Vestager merely said: &#8220;It remains to be seen what will be the outcome of the U.S. [Facebook antitrust] case; as I said they have a different legal basis &#8212; to see if by acquiring this company you have entrenched monopoly position.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She was also asked what the Commission intends to do about companies using self-serving tactics to artificially prolong investigations (and thus delay competition enforcement) &#8212; such as by procrastinating or handing out requested information only with substantial delay.</p>\n<p>Vestager said its approach is to aim to &#8220;always try to balance things out&#8221; but she argued it&#8217;s important to give businesses enough time to respond properly even though it extends the length of investigations.</p>\n<p>During the session she did also note that the aim for the DMA is to enable competition authorities to be &#8220;so much quicker&#8221; &#8212; because the ex ante rules will bake in &#8220;self-executing obligations&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The gatekeeper status also means regulators will not need to do the work of establishing dominance first &#8212; &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">which means you&#8217;ll get to the sanction must faster and should prevent damages in the marketplace&#8221;, she noted. </span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether or not the forthcoming legislative package will feature a new competition tool for specifically tackling digital markets &#8212; which the Commission consulted on earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Reports have suggested this has been dropped after a standard EU pre-regulatory review process. But the commissioner did not confirm either way.</p>\n<p>She was also asked about interim measures &#8212; an existing tool she dusted off <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/europe-issues-interim-antitrust-order-against-broadcom-as-probe-continues/\">last year</a> after an extended period when it had not been used, applying it in a case against chipmaker Broadcom.</p>\n<p>On this she said the tool has been shown to have been useful &#8212; noting the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/european-antitrust-regulators-settle-with-broadcom-a-year-after-interim-measures-flex/\">Broadcom case was settled in a year</a> (which is a very speedy turnaround for a competition case) &#8212; and she suggested the tool could be used more frequently in the future. &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">I think that we will see we can use it more often,&#8221; she told the MEPs. </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qqqlNnvhvO\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/big-techs-blackbox-algorithms-face-regulatory-oversight-under-eu-plan/\">Big tech&#8217;s &#8216;blackbox&#8217;

Coatue’s Daniel Senft and Bennett Siegel will join Gorillas‘ board.</p>\n<p>Noteworthy, Accel and Index were <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-startups.de/2020/11/02/dealmonitor-02-11-2020/\">reportedly</a> in the running, but ultimately didn’t invest. Atlantic Food Labs previously backed Gorillas in a seed round thought to be around €1.2 million.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Founded by Kağan Sümer and Jörg Kattner in May this year and operating in Berlin and Cologne, Gorillas delivers groceries within an average of ten minutes. Unlike gig economy models, it employs riders directly and is emphasising its ability to get fresh groceries, along with other household items, to shoppers at very short notice and at “retail prices”. The idea is that the startup can address a large part of the groceries market that falls outside of a weekly bulk shop.</p>\n<p>Some have dubbed the model that Gorillas is attempting to make work, &#8220;dark&#8221; convenience stores, in reference to the dark kitchens that run on top of Deliveroo and UberEats and operate as delivery only restaurants. In this instance, Gorillas and other European competitors, such as Dija (which we reported is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/\">closing its own large funding round</a>) and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/\">Weezy</a>, are building out local delivery only grocery/convenience stores. These startups are also often compared to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/\">goPuff</a> in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Gorillas CEO Kağan Sümer says that mass supermarkets, including their delivery models, are designed so that the consumer organises their grocery shopping around the needs of the supermarket and supply chain, rather than the supermarket being designed around the needs of the consumer.</p>\n<p>This sees an emphasis on long shelf life products, where even fresh goods are treated for longer expiry dates, and a model that serves the weekly bulk shop well, but at the detriment of two other use-cases: “emergency” shopping, such as when you’re missing a key ingredient, or quickly replenishing your fridge based on what you fancy consuming right now.</p>\n<p>“The biggest problem is that bulk purchases are super served. What I mean by that is this: all of the supermarket infrastructure is shaped around bulk purchases,” Sümer tells me, arguing that this leaves one third of the market underserved.</p>\n<p>“You have penne but no Arrabiata; how do you get that sauce that you need now? [There is] no way.</p>\n<p>“So we asked ourselves, what would happen if a company pops up and serves people with what they need when they need it? Our hypothesis was that people would appreciate it and shift their interaction with groceries to more on demand purchases”.</p>\n<p>With a slogan that reads: “Faster than you,” and a delivery fee of just €1.80, one question mark over Gorillas (and others in the space) is if the unit economics can ever stack up, especially at scale and if the company really isn’t marking up prices significantly. “Through our procurement relationships, we have healthy margins which allow us to sell at retail prices,” says Sümer, pushing back. “Taking into account the solid basket sizes and procurement margins we are able to build a long-term sustainable business”.</p>\n<p>He says the average delivery time is 10 minutes. “Through our network of centrally located fulfillment centers we are able to service customers in a small delivery radius. Ultimately we strive to deliver an efficient and fast service with full transparency on delivery times,” adds the Gorillas CEO.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Gorillas says the new funding will be used for expansion across Germany and will accelerate its rollout across more of Europe &#8212; first stop, Amsterdam.

Earlier this year it was reported that Twitter was among those interested in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">potentially acquiring TikTok</a> when the popular app, owned by China&#8217;s ByteDance, found itself in some regulatory hot water over national security interests (that is a different story, still playing out and seemingly in limbo right now).

(Or indeed, what could have happened <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rus/status/791681274339622913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E791681274339622913%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&#38;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2016%2F10%2F27%2Ftwitter-is-shutting-down-vine%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">if it never sold to Twitter in the first place</a>, but that is also a different story.)</p>\n<p>If Periscope sinking away is on the cards, it&#8217;s a question that probably still bears asking &#8212; what could have been? Even with live video within Twitter&#8217;s app, it&#8217;s not the star of the show. One can&#8217;t help but wonder if live video might next appear front and center elsewhere, made by a different company, much like short-form video finally had its day in a ByteDance way.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"A6Z4KThhAc\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/\">Twitter rolls out Stories, aka &#8216;Fleets,&#8217;

We&#8217;ve spoken to folks like Aileen Lee, Mark Cuban, Roelof Botha, Charles Hudson and many, others. You can browse the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/ecl\">full library of episodes here</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our full conversation with Boyce and Boyle in the YouTube video below, or skim the text for the highlights.</p>\n<h2>Which personality traits are most important in founders</h2>\n<p><strong>Katherine Boyle:</strong> I look for what I would call this obsessive trait, where they are learning more about the regulatory complications, where they are constantly trying to figure out how to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say that the common theme among the founders that I support are that they have this sort of obsessive gene or personality, where they will go deeper and deeper and deeper. When we invest in these companies, it becomes very clear that they often have sort of a contrarian view of the industry. Maybe they are not industry-native. They come at it from a different perspective of problem solving. They&#8217;ve had to defend that thesis for a very, very long time in front of a variety of different customers and different people. In some ways, that makes them much stronger in terms of the way they approach problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter Boyce:</strong> I think the first would be being magnetic for talent. It ends up influencing the speed of learning and development. Really incredible founding teams that can be magnetic for talent and learning just kind of spirals out of control in really good ways over time. I really look for the speed and the sources of learning. And can folks be really intentional? Can they get the right set of advisors and teammates around them?</p>\n<p>The second would be the personal connection to the problem space. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s this kind of deep-seated source of energy and fuel that actually isn&#8217;t going to run out. Catherine and I&#8217;ve been lucky to work across a number of different particular thematic areas, but the thing they have in common is just this personal connection to how and why their business needs to exist. Because I just think that that fuel doesn&#8217;t run out, you know what I mean? Like, that&#8217;s renewable.</p>\n<h2>On fundraising and building trust remotely</h2>\n<p><strong>Boyle:</strong> If you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s comfortable presenting on Zoom, making connections on Zoom, or using Signal and using Twitter and being very online, then I 100% think that you can make investments, build community and build connections through digital worlds and digital platforms. If you really like that in-person connectivity, then you might consider staying in a tech hub, or you might consider sort of these distanced walks until things go back to normal. <div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/WG6XuLX4C6o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:00:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"a0141d8d3e2b26046fe655284e31989e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jordan Crook","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-390_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-401_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn62@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-388_1cfdc649265f0b28.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WG6XuLX4C6o:ejwBBn4AROU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn53@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-409_da50f15e67e1e663.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-53-434_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/WG6XuLX4C6o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn74@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-52-419_9354614c816453b3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759129865},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","title":"Watch SpaceX launch a SiriusXM broadcasting satellite live during its 25th flight of 2020","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2086019","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gONuvx4hU6A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p><em>UPDATE 12:55 PM EST: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"space-exploration-technologies\">SpaceX <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> called a hold in the countdown with 30 seconds remaining.

At the very least, Hyundai is a more logical home for the company, after being owned by a firm whose best-known robot is Pepper, the humanoid hospitality &#8216;bot.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iSxz07VGq1\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/\">Hyundai reportedly in talks to buy SoftBank-owned Boston Dynamics</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Hyundai reportedly in talks to buy SoftBank-owned Boston Dynamics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/embed/#?secret=iSxz07VGq1\" data-secret=\"iSxz07VGq1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As we noted while reporting on earlier rumors about the acquisition, Hyundai has been making some big investments in the category. The list includes a recent joint venture with Aptiv to commercialize autonomous driving systems. There’s also the recently announced ultimate mobility vehicles, or UMV &#8212; a borderline sci-fi vehicle with legs.</p>\n<p>“Boston Dynamics’ commercial business has grown rapidly as we&#8217;ve brought to market the first robot that can automate repetitive and dangerous tasks in workplaces designed for human-level mobility,&#8221; CEO Rob Playter said in a release tied to the deal. &#8220;We and Hyundai share a view of the transformational power of mobility and look forward to working together to accelerate our plans to enable the world with cutting edge automation, and to continue to solve the world’s hardest robotics challenges for our customers.”</p>\n<p>Boston Dynamics, of course, has been blurring the lines between science fiction and reality for several decades now. More recently, however, it’s taken a much stronger interest in commercializing its advanced technologies. Under SoftBank, the company launched Spot, a quadruped robot that draws on years of robotic innovation, including the iconic Big Dog.</p>\n<p>Spot went up for sale last year in limited quantities. It’s now available for anyone in the U.S. with $74,500 burning a hole in their pocket. The company is also pushing to commercialize its wheeled Handle robot for warehouse and fulfillment related purposes. That robot is due out some time next year. While the sophistication and resulting price tags for the company’s robots have drawn a fair bit of skepticism, investors have taken increased interest in robots and automation firms in the wake of year-long COVID-19-related shutdowns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hyundai Motor Group will provide Boston Dynamics a strategic partner affording access to Hyundai Motor Group’s in-house manufacturing capability and cost benefits stemming from efficiencies of scale,&#8221; according to the release. &#8220;Boston Dynamics will benefit substantially from new capital, technology, affiliated customers, and Hyundai Motor Group’s global market reach enhancing commercialization opportunity for its robot products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The deal is expected to close in by June.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"SmuMBj3xv2\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/boston-dynamics-puts-its-robotic-quadruped-spot-up-for-sale/\">Boston Dynamics puts its robotic quadruped Spot up for sale</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Boston Dynamics puts its robotic quadruped Spot up for sale&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/boston-dynamics-puts-its-robotic-quadruped-spot-up-for-sale/embed/#?secret=SmuMBj3xv2\" data-secret=\"SmuMBj3xv2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/WXiTaZeKVUc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 11:34:41 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"139d3972e43eea71112d4541bc05d033","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-30-256_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-53-390_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-52-401_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-52-373_ba8e1187b8bd7d56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=WXiTaZeKVUc:3PhbwTkibU8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn6@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-53-500_f6854ebcb51135f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-53-434_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/WXiTaZeKVUc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-52-471_dd3c3916fa6f51cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759129866},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:29","title":"Cloud-gaming platforms were 2020’s most overhyped trend","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081039","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It was an unprecedented year for [insert anything under the sun], and while plenty of tech verticals saw shifts that warped business models and shifted user habits, the gaming industry experienced plenty of new ideas in 2020. However, the loudest trends don&#8217;t always take hold as predicted.</p>\n<p>This year, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon each leaned hard into new cloud-streaming tech that shifts game processing and computing to cloud-based servers, allowing users to play graphics-intensive content on low-powered systems or play titles without dealing with lengthy downloads.</p>\n<p>It was heralded by executives as a tectonic shift for gaming, one that would democratize access to the next generation of titles. But in taking a closer look at the products built around this tech, it&#8217;s hard to see a future where any of these subscription services succeed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Massive year-over-year changes in gaming are rare because even if a historically unique platform launches or is unveiled, it takes time for a critical mass of developers to congregate and adopt something new — and longer for users to coalesce. As a result, even in a year where major console makers launch historically powerful hardware, massive tech giants pump cash into new cloud-streaming tech and gamers log more hours collectively than ever before, it can feel like not much has shifted.</span></p>\n<p>That said, the gaming industry did push boundaries in 2020, though it&#8217;s unclear where meaningful ground was gained. The most ambitious drives were toward redesigning marketplaces in the image of video streaming networks, aiming to make a more coordinated move toward driving subscription growth and moving farther away from an industry defined for decades by one-time purchases structured around single-player storylines, one dramatically shaped by internet networking and instantaneous payments infrastructure software.</p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tToday&#8217;s products are far from dead ends for what the broader industry does with the technology.\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t</div>\n\t</p>\n<p>But shifting gamers farther away from one-off purchases wasn&#8217;t even the gaming industry&#8217;s most fundamental reconsideration of the year, a space reserved for a coordinated move by the world&#8217;s richest companies to upend the console wars with an invisible competitor. It&#8217;s perhaps unsurprising that the most full-featured plays in this arena are coming from the cloud services triumvirate, with Google, Microsoft and Amazon each making significant strides in recent months.</p>\n<p>The driving force for this change is both the maturation of virtual desktop streaming and continued developer movement toward online cross-play between gaming platforms, a trend long resisted by legacy platform owners intent on maintaining siloed network effects that pushed gamers toward buying the same consoles that their friends owned.</p>\n<p>The cross-play trend reached a fever pitch in recent years as entities like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"epic-games-2\">Epic Games&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Fortnite developed massive user bases that gave developers exceptional influence over the deals they struck with platform owners.</p>\n<p>While a trend toward deeper cross-play planted the seeds for new corporate players in the gaming world, it has been the tech companies with the deepest pockets that have pioneered the most concerted plays to side-load a third-party candidate into the console wars.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s already clear to plenty of gamers that even in their nascent stages, cloud-gaming platforms aren&#8217;t meeting up to their hype and standalone efforts aren&#8217;t technologically stunning enough to make up for the apparent lack of selection in the content libraries.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=w6-o2QAiAJ0:32O7doWznMA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img
