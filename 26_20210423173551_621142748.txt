The rules require payments firms to store all Indian transaction data within servers in the country.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Visa, Mastercard, and several other firms, as well as the U.S. government, have previously requested New Delhi to reconsider its rules, which is designed to allow the regulator “unfettered supervisory access.”</p>\n<p>Visa, Mastercard, and American Express had also lobbied to either significantly change the rules or completely discard it. But after none of those efforts worked, most firms began to comply.</p>\n<p>In a statement Friday evening (local time), an Amex spokesperson said the company was “disappointed that the RBI has this course of action,” but said was working with the authority to resolve the concerns “as quickly as possible.”</p>\n<p>With about 1.5 million customers, American Express has amassed the highest number of customers among foreign banks in India.</p>\n<p>“We have been in regular dialogue with the Reserve Bank of India about data localization requirements and have demonstrated our progress towards complying with the regulation.

Next week, JOCO will be the first shared operator in New York City to launch a network of e-bike stations on private property for public use.</p>\n<p>The service, powered by shared mobility platform Vulog, will start with 30 stations and 300 e-bikes located around Manhattan, expanding to 100 stations and 1,000 bikes by June. This is not the first new shared operator to hit the streets of New York this year. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/\">Last week, the city announced the winning companies of the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx</a>. But while Bird, Lime and Veo are restricted to operating in a section of the Bronx, far from any Citi Bike territory, JOCO is under no such constraints.</p>\n<p>The company’s bikes will initially be stationed at parking garages around the city, including at Icon Parking garages, the city’s largest parking operators, but the company says it hopes to expand to residential and commercial buildings in the near future. The company essentially pays landlords to provide this amenity, while absolving them from having to operate or maintain the e-bikes.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>“What differentiates us from Citi Bike is, first of all, our bikes are 100% electric, 100% premium,” co-founder Jonathan “Johnny” Cohen from New York told TechCrunch.

JOCO&#8230;get it?). “You can reserve our bikes in advance, and as we’re on private property, there is hand sanitizer at our stations, the bikes aren’t getting rained on every night, they’re a bit cleaner and easier to access.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1hQtg0pVJ1\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/\">Bird, Lime and Veo selected for NYC e-scooter pilot</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Bird, Lime and Veo selected for NYC e-scooter pilot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/embed/#?secret=1hQtg0pVJ1\" data-secret=\"1hQtg0pVJ1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142696\" style=\"width: 503px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142696\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2142696\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?w=493\" alt=\"A map of JOCO's launch e-bike dock locations\" width=\"493\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=109,150 109w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=218,300 218w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=768,1059 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=493,680 493w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142696\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A map of JOCO&#8217;s 30 launch e-bike dock locations in NYC. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> JOCO</p></div></p>\n<p>Citi Bike’s fleet is about 30% electric. To charge the e-bikes, the Lyft-owned company must manually take the drained vehicles from their stations to charge them, whereas JOCO’s vehicles are charged at the stations. Like Citi Bike, each e-bike can last for about 30 miles on a charge.</p>\n<p>“That’s enough to get around Manhattan several times,” said London Jo (another moniker for differentiating between the two Cohens). “We expect our vehicles to always be charged and ready to go for the customer. It defeats the purpose when you’re taking a bike that’s extremely sustainable, and then come along in a gas-burning vehicle to swap the battery. We’re looking to be a truly environmentally friendly company and provide a more consistent and reliable service.”</p>\n<p>Founded in 2019 and funded privately by a group of former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and specifically investors with technology and real estate backgrounds, JOCO offers e-bikes at a price point that’s comparable, if not directly competitive, to Citi Bike. It’ll cost riders $1 to unlock the bike and .25 cents a minute, so a 10 minute ride will come out to $3.50. If you can find an electric Citi Bike, it’ll cost a rider $3.50 to unlock and .18 cents a minute, which comes out to about $5.30.</p>\n<p>“That’s significantly cheaper in our opinion for a brand new, gorgeous, full-electric premium bike,” said NY Jo.</p>\n<p>Neither company charges unlock fees for members. JOCO’s monthly membership is $49 per month with unlimited use, and Citi Bike’s is $20 per month, with monthly members continuing to pay 18 cents per minute, and annual members paying 12 cents per minute. Under Citi Bike’s annual membership, if a rider is averaging out about five 10-minute rides per week, the monthly spend is comparable between the two companies.</p>\n<p>“Citi Bike has been around since 2013 and has done a tremendous job at driving cycling adoption on the streets of NYC,” Monica Wejman, Vulog’s North America managing director, told TechCrunch. “And now you have JOCO entering this space, powered by Vulog, really there to complement Citi Bike and satisfy what we’re seeing as a significant increase in demand for access to e-bikes. We’re truly empowering mobility operators to launch mobility programs at scale.”</p>\n<p>While JOCO will not be reliant on the NYC Department of Transportation to carve out street and sidewalk space for docking stations, the operator is still taking steps to ensure a good working relationship with the city.</p>\n<p>London Jo says JOCO’s bikes are made with safety-critical features, like hidden cables to make them less susceptible to vandalism, puncture-proof airless tires and bike-tracking, provided by Vulog’s backend.</p>\n<p>“In addition, by operating in private spaces, we’re eliminating that problem of sidewalk clutter for the city,” said the British Cohen. “And they don’t have to worry about what has to go to fit 50 new bikes on the street. We’re taking a big headache off them, and it’s allowing us to stay in control a little bit more and not have to depend on the city.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8TxN4Lxx4E\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/why-micromobility-is-poised-to-come-out-of-the-pandemic-stronger-than-before/\">Why micromobility may emerge from the pandemic stronger than before</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Why micromobility may emerge from the pandemic stronger than before&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/why-micromobility-is-poised-to-come-out-of-the-pandemic-stronger-than-before/embed/#?secret=8TxN4Lxx4E\" data-secret=\"8TxN4Lxx4E\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HJ310sSxtBo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:39:27 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?w=493","linkMd5":"9ccc985f3e6418b0729133f26d108616","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-931_f15c39e9f7ffb89c.webp","destWidth":493,"destHeight":680,"sourceBytes":155536,"destBytes":155536,"author":"Rebecca Bellan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?w=493":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-931_f15c39e9f7ffb89c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-747_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-37-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-37-444_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn96@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-37-711_43360fdbccd359c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HJ310sSxtBo:DAces2euImI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn25@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-37-629_bd939c3b8a4b64cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn72@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-37-693_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HJ310sSxtBo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-37-272_dea7c9020e3eb6c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199321617},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:21","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:21","title":"After going public, once-hot startups are riding a valuation roller coaster","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2142960","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">To close out the week, a short meditation on value, or, more precisely, how assets are valued in today&#8217;s markets.</p>\n<p>Do you recall the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/\">pre-direct-listing hype</a> Coinbase enjoyed?

The Exchange has watched with something akin to polite confusion as the value of Root, a neoinsurance company, fell to a third of its public-market highs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/\">after going public</a>, even though it <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3666921-root-eps-misses-0_07-beats-on-revenue\">beat growth expectations</a> in its most recent quarterly report.</p>\n<p>We could toss UiPath into our trend of wildly meandering value.

Today it&#8217;s worth $76.75 per share in pre-market trading.</p>\n<p>No one knows what anything is worth, again. This is the feeling I get while watching the markets work to determine how to value assets as diverse as startups crossing the private-public divide to the value of Bitcoin, which was supposed to keep going up. Until it suddenly reversed gear.</p>\n<p>Frankly, we&#8217;re still dealing with new-enough models &#8212; or big-enough guesses about the future baked into business models &#8212; that it&#8217;s hard to really value the most uncertain (and therefore most exciting) companies, let alone cryptocurrencies.

As mentioned, liftoff time is set for 5:49 AM EDT, but SpaceX will begin streaming live hours in advance at approximately 1:30 AM EDT on Friday (10:30 PM PDT on Thursday).</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Sz8OYpPDIx\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/spacexs-spin-out-startups-are-helping-build-las-startup-ecosystem/\">SpaceX alumni are helping build LA&#8217;s startup ecosystem</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;SpaceX alumni are helping build LA&#8217;s startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/spacexs-spin-out-startups-are-helping-build-las-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=Sz8OYpPDIx\" data-secret=\"Sz8OYpPDIx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mA7QIBT_Wek\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:01:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"d505f3fb0b413eaf42d852784d0b87c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-747_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-747_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-37-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-37-444_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn31@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-37-260_b35408d79f7346f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mA7QIBT_Wek:8zu0aiHvOao:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn70@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-37-265_b3df0b06309797c3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn72@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-37-693_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mA7QIBT_Wek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-37-689_e4c5b569ea2cf19d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199321613},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:21","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:21","title":"Deepfake tech takes on satellite maps","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2142553","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">While the concept of &#8220;deepfakes,&#8221; or AI-generated synthetic imagery, has been decried primarily in connection with involuntary depictions of people, the technology is dangerous (and interesting) in other ways as well. For instance, researchers have shown that it can be used to manipulate satellite imagery to produce real-looking — but totally fake — overhead maps of cities.</p>\n<p>The study, <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/04/21/a-growing-problem-of-deepfake-geography-how-ai-falsifies-satellite-images/\">led by Bo Zhao from the University of Washington</a>, is not intended to alarm anyone but rather to show the risks and opportunities involved in applying this rather infamous technology to cartography. In fact their approach has as much in common with &#8220;style transfer&#8221; techniques — redrawing images in an impressionistic, crayon and arbitrary other fashions — than with deepfakes as they are commonly understood.</p>\n<p>The team trained a machine learning system on satellite images of three different cities: Seattle, nearby Tacoma and Beijing. Each has its own distinctive look, just as a painter or medium does. For instance, Seattle tends to have larger overhanging greenery and narrower streets, while Beijing is more monochrome and — in the images used for the study — the taller buildings cast long, dark shadows. The system learned to associate details of a street map (like Google or Apple&#8217;s) with those of the satellite view.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The resulting machine learning agent, when given a street map, returns a realistic-looking faux satellite image of what that area would look like if it were in any of those cities. In the following image, the map corresponds to the top right satellite image of Tacoma, while the lower versions show how it might look in Seattle and Beijing.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142604\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142604\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2142604\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png\" alt=\"Four images show a street map and a real satellite image of Tacoma, and two simulated satellite images of the same streets in Seattle and Beijing.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1082\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=768,811 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=644,680 644w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=47,50 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zhao et al.</p></div></p>\n<p>A close inspection will show that the fake maps aren&#8217;t as sharp as the real one, and there are probably some logical inconsistencies like streets that go nowhere and the like. But at a glance the Seattle and Beijing images are perfectly plausible.</p>\n<p>One only has to think for a few minutes to conceive of uses for fake maps like this, both legitimate and otherwise. The researchers suggest that the technique could be used to simulate imagery of places for which no satellite imagery is available — like one of these cities in the days before such things were possible, or for a planned expansion or zoning change. The system doesn&#8217;t have to imitate another place altogether — it could be trained on a more densely populated part of the same city, or one with wider streets.</p>\n<p>It could conceivably even be used, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/ai-ancient-maps-satellite-images\">as this rather more whimsical project was</a>, to make realistic-looking modern maps from ancient hand-drawn ones.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GZXJia1KHP\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/deep-science-alzheimers-screening-forest-mapping-drones-machine-learning-in-space-more/\">Deep Science: Alzheimer&#8217;s screening, forest-mapping drones, machine learning in space, more</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Deep Science: Alzheimer&#8217;s screening, forest-mapping drones, machine learning in space, more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/deep-science-alzheimers-screening-forest-mapping-drones-machine-learning-in-space-more/embed/#?secret=GZXJia1KHP\" data-secret=\"GZXJia1KHP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Should technology like this be bent to less constructive purposes, the paper also looks at ways to detect such simulated imagery using careful examination of colors and features.</p>\n<p>The work challenges the general assumption of the &#8220;absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data,&#8221; said Zhao in a UW news article, and certainly as with other media that kind thinking has to go by the wayside as new threats appear.

A human must be in the loop or present in some way for autonomous mobility to exist, even in 10 or probably 20 years from now.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; conclusion led Rosenzweig to found teleoperations startup <a href=\"https://ottopia.tech/\">Ottopia</a> in 2018. (His brother, Oren Rosenzweig is also in the autonomous vehicle business via the lidar company he co-founded, Innoviz.) Ottopia&#8217;s first product is a universal teleoperation platform that allows a human operator to monitor and control any type of vehicle from thousands of miles away. Ottopia&#8217;s software is combined with off-the-shelf hardware components like monitors and cameras to create a teleoperations center. The company&#8217;s software also includes assistive features, which provide &#8220;path&#8221; instructions to the AV without having to remotely control the vehicle.</p>\n<p>Since launching, the small 25-person company has racked up investors and partners such as BMW, fixed-route AV startup <a href=\"https://maymobility.com/\">May Mobility</a> and <a href=\"https://bestmile.com/\">Bestmile</a>. Ottopia said Friday that it has raised $9 million from Hyundai Motor Group as well as Maven and IN Venture, the Israel-focused venture capital arm of Sumitomo Corporation. Existing investors MizMaa and Israeli firm NextGear also participated.</p>\n<p>Hyundai and IN Venture also gained board seats. Woongjun Jang, who heads up Hyundai&#8217;s autonomous driving center, and IN Venture managing partner Eyal Rosner, are now on Ottopia&#8217;s board.</p>\n<p>Ottopia has raised a total of $12 million to date, and Rosenzweig has already set his sights on a larger round to help fund the company&#8217;s growth.</p>\n<p>For now, Rosenzweig is focused on doubling his workforce to 50 people by the end of the year and opening an office in the United States. Rosenzweig said the company is also expanding into other applications of its teleoperations software, including defense, mining and logistics. However, most of Ottopia&#8217;s resources will continue to be dedicated to automotive, and specifically the deployment of autonomous cars, trucks and shuttles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The motivation is really simple — it&#8217;s simple but it&#8217;s hard to do — and that&#8217;s to make affordable autonomous transportation closer to reality,&#8221; Rosenzweig said. &#8220;The problem of course is that when an AV does not have any kind of backup or any kind of safety net in the form of teleoperations and it gets stuck, passengers are going to get anxious, &#8216;what&#8217;s going on, why, why is this not moving&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The other problem, Rosenzweig noted, is that AVs need to be combined with an efficient transit service. That&#8217;s where he sees his newest partner, on-demand shuttle and transit software company Via, coming in.</p>\n<p>Under the partnership, which was also announced this week, Via will offer autonomous vehicle fleets that combine its fleet management software with Ottopia&#8217;s teleoperations platform. Via is not developing its own self-driving software system. In November 2020, Via <a href=\"https://maymobility.com/may-mobility-and-via-announce-partnership-that-will-integrate-on-demand-avs-into-public-transit/\">announced it had partnered</a> with May Mobility to launch an autonomous vehicle platform that integrates on-demand shared rides, public transportation and transit options for passengers with accessibility needs.</p>\n<div class=\"embed

This is why well <a href=\"https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/permanent_detour_underemployment_report.pdf\">over 50% of new and recent graduates are underemployed</a> in their first jobs out of college (two-thirds of whom will be underemployed five years later, and half a decade later).</p>\n<p>There must be a better way. A way that empowers young people to achieve in-demand skills while avoiding the decades-long burden of student loans. A way that doesn’t discriminate based on socioeconomic background while exposing talent-hungry employers to a new pool of qualified, driven individuals.</p>\n<p>In the explosion of edtech businesses with new approaches, we are in danger of overlooking an established model that can be adapted to solve these challenges. That model is apprenticeships.</p>\n<h2>The apprenticeship movement</h2>\n<p>There’s a lingering perception in America that apprenticeships are the province of construction and building trades, or even medieval guilds like smithing and glass-blowing. Well, not anymore. While we’ve been focused on edtech, or despairing over the widening skills gap, apprenticeships have been rebooted. Modern, tech-driven apprenticeships are emerging as a faster, cheaper and more impactful alternative to higher education.</p>\n<p>In Europe, tech companies — and nontech companies <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/ibm-salaries-jobs-training-new-collar-covid-economy/\">increasingly hiring entry-level workers</a> with discrete tech skills — are already leveraging<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/ibm-salaries-jobs-training-new-collar-covid-economy/\"> apprenticeships</a> to provide a direct route into the labor market for diverse talent. From software engineers to data analysts, the apprentice of the 21st century is as likely to wield a keyboard as a wrench.</p>\n<p>Fully employed from day one, apprentices earn a wage while they learn on a program that is entirely free to the individual. Their training is delivered alongside their role, with this applied learning approach ensuring relevant skills are tested and embedded right away.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iz2bt8UmN9\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/\">13 investors say lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;13 investors say lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/embed/#?secret=iz2bt8UmN9\" data-secret=\"iz2bt8UmN9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Part of the challenge presented by the existing system is that college provides a single shot of learning at the start of a career, with a focus on knowledge rather than skills. Instead of time-consuming traditional education models, we should be encouraging companies to focus on training individuals for highly skilled jobs and adapting training as roles shift through a lifelong learning journey.</p>\n<p>Against a college system churning out graduates armed with knowledge of limited applicability in the workplace, apprentices have real-work experience and transferable skill sets in the tech and digital spaces.</p>\n<p>As we write this, tech <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dol.gov_agencies_eta_apprenticeship_about_statistics&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&#38;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&#38;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&#38;s=lh-GS1bPsHrzsbzOgSkhYGdgop6VmM2MpUREk013alE&#38;e=\">apprenticeships represent less than 1% of American apprenticeships </a>, while <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dol.gov_agencies_eta_apprenticeship_about_statistics&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&#38;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&#38;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&#38;s=lh-GS1bPsHrzsbzOgSkhYGdgop6VmM2MpUREk013alE&#38;e=\">78% of apprentices are white</a>. But change is in the air. In recent weeks, the Biden administration has gone out of its way to highlight tech as a growth area for apprenticeships.</p>\n<p>The president also announced <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.whitehouse.gov_briefing-2Droom_statements-2Dreleases_2021_02_17_fact-2Dsheet-2Dbiden-2Dadministration-2Dto-2Dtake-2Dsteps-2Dto-2Dbolster-2Dregistered-2Dapprenticeships_&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&#38;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&#38;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&#38;s=iRWri3Hob0ohVZ8HwRyyF3b9musmHkEyUmPWiFdtUlo&#38;e=\">his commitment to raising apprenticeship standards</a>, starting with casting off industry-recognized apprenticeship programs lacking in quality and training rigor.</p>\n<p>These aren’t just words, either. The apprenticeship reboot will be powered by a new <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/447\">National Apprenticeship Act </a>. This proposed legislation commits $3 billion over the next five years to expanding registered apprenticeship programs across a range of industries. If it’s done right, tech will be front and center.</p>\n<h2>The benefit to businesses</h2>\n<p>All this is welcome good news for businesses desperate to close skills gaps. As roles evolve at an ever-faster pace, it’s becoming more and more difficult to know what a college degree actually says about an individual’s ability. Yes, they went to a “good” school. But when <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-young-americans-say-college-isnt-necessary-2019-08-06\">half of Americans say their degree is irrelevant to their current role</a>, how does prestige translate to jobs, let alone ability to perform in the workplace?</p>\n<p>Increasingly operating in the dark, tech businesses and nontech managers hiring for tech roles are competing with each other to poach experienced talent into senior roles. It’s continuing to fish in a very limited, homogeneous pool and an expensive short-term solution.</p>\n<p>Professional apprenticeships allow business leaders to be more strategic and proactive in their hiring practices. They can mold apprentices to the roles they actually need to fill while focusing on their organization’s specific requirements. It beats relying on uniform, outdated education models.</p>\n<p>Better still, by training apprentices from the start of their career, companies inspire loyalty and eliminate the tricky transition phase recent grads and external hires usually need. Once converted to full-time employees, apprentices tend to persist for twice as long as traditional direct hires.</p>\n<p>While skills gaps are created by the future racing toward us, racial inequalities are rooted in our past. Professional apprenticeships help break down entrenched structural barriers to careers in industries like tech.</p>\n<p>Most important, they look beyond the degree requirements that screen out 67% of Black and 79% of Hispanic Americans. Because apprenticeships are paid pathways to economic opportunity, they truly level the playing field and allow companies to make genuine advances toward racial equality &#8212; beyond a few neatly crafted Instagram posts. Meanwhile, by tapping into diverse talent pools early, businesses can develop individuals and build real, recognizable routes to the boardroom.</p>\n<p>They would be right, too. A 2020 report by McKinsey found companies with the highest diversity <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.mckinsey.com_business-2Dfunctions_organization_our-2Dinsights_why-2Ddiversity-2Dmatters&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&#38;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&#38;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&#38;s=nkaIrANwm3SsODk5tOu6CCoL5GD9gNjXTD2GnkuxMPo&#38;e=\">earned 35% more than their industry average</a>. Similarly, the share returns of the most diverse companies in the S&#38;P 500 outperformed the least diverse by a staggering 240%.</p>\n<p>The time for change is now. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.insidehighered.com_quicktakes_2020_02_18_41-2Drecent-2Dgrads-2Dwork-2Djobs-2Dnot-2Drequiring-2Ddegree&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&#38;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&#38;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&#38;s=j38_kYCF6Jer06vbpAMLko-hKZj7SVnEu38MpfpEdsk&#38;e=\">41% of grads end up in roles that don’t require a degree</a>. With COVID-19 hitting young workers particularly hard, this figure is set to rise unless we embrace new approaches, including professional apprenticeships. In creating a direct and meaningful career pathway for young adults, they can help businesses close skills gaps and hit their much-vaunted diversity targets.</p>\n<p>There’s no single solution to these challenges.

When we opened, it didn’t occur to us that one could have an idea and then go knock on someone’s door and ask for money.</p>\n<p>Bootstrapping forced us to be a bit more creative about how we would go about building our company. In the early days, it was a distraction to growth, because we were doing other revenue-generating activities like consulting, development work, whatever we could find to keep ourselves afloat while we built Yellowfin. It meant we couldn’t be 100% focused on our idea.</p>\n<p>However, it also meant we had to generate income from our new company from Day One — something funded companies don’t have to do.

Next came conference platforms like Hopin (which has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/\">raising money at a mind-boggling clip</a>). But Manolache argued that even Hopin represents a &#8220;Band-Aid&#8221; that customers are hoping will tide them over until in-person events can resume — particularly when organizers have to point attendees to a third-party platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One size does not fit all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Band-Aid solution that was only supposed to last for a couple months has had big benefits as companies grew their customer base and revenue targets. Now we&#8217;ve reached the third wave, as organizations want to bring solutions to their own universe and own their relationship with the audience.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>San Francisco-based Introvoke is a Techstars Accelerator graduate aiming to provide this third-wave solution. It&#8217;s announcing today that it has raised $2.7 million in funding led by Struck Capital, while Comcast, Social Leverage, Great Oaks, V1vc, Time CTO Bharat Krish and Resy co-founder Mike Montero also participated.</p>\n<p>The startup offers components like virtual stages, chat rooms and networking hubs, all customizable and embeddable on a customer&#8217;s website. Manolache said Introvoke (the name comes from the idea of &#8220;thought-provoking introductions&#8221;) is designed for a hybrid future, which will take multiple forms: &#8220;Hybrid is going to mean virtual-only events, in-person only events and events that have in-person and<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> virtual elements.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143138\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143138\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2143138\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Introvoke\" width=\"680\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=768,573 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143138\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Introvoke</p></div></p>\n<p>Introvoke charges customers based on live event minutes, a model that it says is accessible to companies large and small.

This is not an uncommon occurrence when I’m around Imagineers, but this time is special. The character isn’t a costume, it’s a robot. And, unlike the m​any animatronic figures you’ve seen in the parks, it’s not stuck in one place. No, this character is walking toward me, attached only by a thin cable used for programming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you’d expect it to. There’s no other way to say it, it’s ambling. This is Project Kiwi, a small-scale, free-roaming robotic actor — the first of its kind for Disney and a real robotics milestone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Holy Grail of themed entertainment has been established for decades now: a fully mobile, bipedal character that matches the appearance, personality and scale of the original. Various non-mobile levels of this vision have been achieved at parks around the world, including the incredibly lifelike <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/disney-showed-us-the-inner-workings-of-its-avatar-robot-and-its-just-incredible/\">Na’Vi Shaman</a>, The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/\">A1000 figure</a> that powers characters like Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge’s Hondo Ohnaka and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJtNxaTwgz0\">smoothly expressive Belle</a> from Beauty and the Beast at Tokyo Disneyland. There have also been some cool mobile experiments like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/panzer/status/918301474404175874?s=20\">the self-piloting droid “Jake”</a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The pint-sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize. This is a real, walkaround character that is at the proper scale, kid scale.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A couple of weeks ago at Walt Disney Imagineering in Southern California, I saw just how close they finally are to making that dream come true. A bipedal platform, developed completely in house over the past three years by WDI researchers and roboticists — dressed up to look like a roughly two and a half foot tall Groot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even though the version of Kiwi that I’m looking at is Groot-flavored, it’s important to stress that this is a platform first and foremost, which means that it could take this form when it gets to the parks, or another form entirely. It’s important while developing a character to have a target character that can tell you whether or not you’re hitting an established mark of believability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kiwi also is still very much a work in progress. I wouldn’t expect to see this in the wild soon; there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people, and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But even at this stage it’s an incredible feat of engineering that genuinely radiates that elusive characteristic that Disney always searches for with its figures: presence.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6spi7nBqrro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">How did we get here?</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I was able to speak to the lead on Project Kiwi, R&#38;D Imagineer Principal Scott LaValley, as well as Advanced Development Studio Executive SVP Jon Snoddy, about how the platform came together over the past few years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Project KIWI started about three years ago to figure out how we can bring our smaller characters to life at their actual scale in authentic ways,” LaValley says. “It’s an exciting time for bipedal robotics and with an incredible team and our combination of technology, artistry and magic, we are bringing characters to life that could not have happened anywhere but Disney.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’ve talked a bit about the unique Imagineering process in my previous pieces on how Disney <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots/\">builds reactive robotics</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles/\">autonomous stuntbots</a> and even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/\">entire lands</a>. Imagineering works a lot like a startup in the way that it comes up with a problem to solve and then goes about pulling in other departments to help it get a solution. There is a remarkably ego-free nature to much of the way that WDI actually finds those solutions, too. They are as likely to find a key component off the shelf as they are to design, develop and patent it in house.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zU0CvsKdFs\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots/\">Disney has begun populating its parks with autonomous, personality-driven robots</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Disney has begun populating its parks with autonomous, personality-driven robots&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots/embed/#?secret=zU0CvsKdFs\" data-secret=\"zU0CvsKdFs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The interconnected nature of Imagineering departments like ride design, show systems, special effects, animatronics department, Tech Studio R&#38;D and Disney Research means that they share solutions across the stack as well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The guiding thread to all of it, of course, is storytelling.

Unfortunately, due to the scale and complexity of the figure and the requirements for interaction and walking, no &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; platforms would do. The fact is that there are actually only a handful of truly viable bipedal robotics platforms anywhere in the world and the vast majority of them are being created for industrial applications, with a handful of &#8220;human-scale&#8221; solutions that are designed as marketing set pieces rather than truly autonomous systems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So to hit that goal, Imagineering turned to R&#38;D and LaValley’s team. LaValley came to Disney from Boston Dynamics, where he worked on the first version of its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQni8Uz3Q0I\">biped robot Atlas</a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The project scope was that they needed a biped robot that was battery powered and could be programmed to handle autonomous interactions with park guests and striped gestures and emotes. The team would take the next three years to build what they needed — much of which was custom for reasons we’ll get into shortly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142973\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142973\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142973\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg 3272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=1536,988 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142973\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc.</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s clear at a glance that Kiwi has no operator inside. The human brain is pretty good at instinctually understanding whether a space is just too small to have a person in it. In order to achieve the small size, the team had to first build a custom skeleton that had room for every motor and actuator Kiwi would need to achieve 50 degrees of freedom, all while keeping it humanoid in shape so that it could be &#8220;dressed up&#8221; as any number of characters.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First came the frame. Prototypes were built from custom-printed polymer and then eventually custom metal parts using industrial printers. The armatures and segments that they needed to house the critical components were just too complex to mill or cast. The cleverly printed metal skeleton is hollow throughout, allowing a &#8220;marrow conduit&#8221; for air which rushes through the body cooling the motors and actuators. In the current Kiwi prototype the air comes in through the collar area of the suit, flows throughout the body, propelled by fans embedded in the skeleton and exhausts near the bottom of the unit. Eventually it will use the clothing as a shroud to help air flow out near the feet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though there is some audible noise, even in this early state it is <i>very</i> low, allowing audio playing out of a speaker to enable conversation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As you can see in the exclusive progress video embedded above, the lower sections were built first. Early testing around the office shows the legs and torso sneaking, bouncing, shuffling and strutting through Imagineering. This is probably the only workplace in the world where the bottom half of a torso can tiptoe past your office while you’re eating lunch and it doesn’t even merit a pause between bites.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An enormous amount of completely custom robotics work went into the Kiwi platform. In the demonstration I saw, young Groot had a safety tether and control cable for live programming, but nothing on the rig itself needed support, it was free roaming with on-board battery power that LaValley says hits around the 45 minute mark currently, with more longevity hoped for in the final version. In fact, a next-generation skeleton is already under development that is lighter and more efficient.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142971\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142971\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142971\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg 3544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1207 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142971\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc. / Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc.</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The legs use a system that offers a kinetic counter-balance, allowing the force of having to move and plant a foot to be off-set, making motions more power efficient and quicker. Think of a spring-loaded heavy gate that makes it easier for you to swing open — but no springs, and a robotic limb instead of a gate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The feet plant realistically for the very simple reason that they must actually support the figure. This gives it an additional layer of believability that just doesn’t happen with externally supported characters that “fake” a foot plant. LaValley demonstrated that the figure could easily stay afoot even if it was shoved gently or if a hand was rested on its shoulder. This kind of self-balancing is something that humans do unconsciously and continuously, but it must be built and programmed in to an ambulatory robot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D7TGB2slpL\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles/\">Disney Imagineering has created autonomous robot stunt doubles</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Disney Imagineering has created autonomous robot stunt doubles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles/embed/#?secret=D7TGB2slpL\" data-secret=\"D7TGB2slpL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200369333A1\">patentable inventions</a> went into this creation. One of them is a clever system of gears that translates energy across joints, allowing them to share motors with one another even across a joint like a knee or wrist. This means fewer components and the ability to keep motor and actuator packages small and compact enough to fit underneath theming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In order to minimize the amount of wiring throughout Kiwi — since wires are always the biggest points of failure — the team created a set of origami-like circuit boards joined by integrated flex cabling. Think of your standard computer circuit board but sliced into segments and mounted to the exterior of the hollow &#8220;bones.&#8221; They wrap around the limbs and other body parts, binding the control systems and motors being controlled into a local group that reduces the amount of harnessing that needs to be spread across joints and throughout the structure.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No actuators — the components that decide how to move a limb — that exist had the capabilities that the team needed, so they built them from scratch. At one point, LaValley handed me a ring holding iteration after iteration of a dozen actuator elements. I was holding years&#8217; worth of engineering, experimentation, failure and progress on a simple bit of wire twisted together at the end.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Up next for Project Kiwi is a new set of actuators that can dynamically apply torque plus added sensing capabilities for more stability and reaction to uneven ground or interactions. You can imagine that, as a free-roaming character people will want to take pictures with it and I doubt kids would be able to resist running up for a hug. The skeleton must be able to sense and react quickly and smoothly to those sudden external inputs in order to stay upright and keep looking natural.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142970\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142970\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142970\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"748\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg 2884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc. / Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc.</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moving from a pure IK system to a fully torque-sensing system will allow for the platform to make on the fly adjustments that compensate for terrain or interaction with other performers or guests.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All of the work the team put into custom gearing, motors and actuation has paid off in spades with the ridiculously smooth and natural-looking movements of Kiwi’s arms and legs. Quick waves, shrugs, dance moves and even boxing jabs all look like a real — if slightly gentle — creature is performing them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The team also demonstrated the custom-built performance software that they designed, which allows Kiwi to have different kinds of gaits with personality layered on top. The bottom layer is an IK-style gait system that keeps Kiwi upright and walking, but then layering the personalities on top adds character to the walk while still maintaining stability. Bouncy, jaunty walks, limps, sad or downhearted walks, all with the other motions of arms and head contributing to a constantly shifting center of mass and momentum. The paddling duck&#8217;s feet under the water is that gait system that takes the external inputs and integrates it into the walk naturally.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dpJ3y7M9mG\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/\">How Disney Built Star Wars, in real life</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;How Disney Built Star Wars, in real life&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/embed/#?secret=dpJ3y7M9mG\" data-secret=\"dpJ3y7M9mG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The current prototype software has a series of set behaviors, with a timeline that allows them to program new behaviors and actions by toggles or adjusting curves that control movement. With a series of tweaks in the software the changes become evident immediately, with Groot’s “mood” becoming immediately evident in his walk.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One moment he is bouncing along swinging his arms jauntily, clearly happy to be there. Then the next moment his arms are slumped, his head is hung and he is slowly plodding — clearly sad to be leaving the fun behind. It’s a remarkable bit of performance software.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And even though the expressive eyes are already impressive — the team is not done. Up next on the agenda is a sensory package that allows Kiwi to more fully understand the world around it and to identify people and their faces. This becomes important because eye contact is such an emotive and powerful tool to use in transporting a participant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even without the sensing software, I can tell you that the experience of this 2.5ft Groot locking eyes with me, smiling and waving was just incredibly transportive. Multiple times throughout my interaction I completely forgot that it was a robot at all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142990\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/groot-walk-dance.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142990\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2142990 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/groot-walk-dance.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"364\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142990\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc. / Walt Disney Imagineering R&#38;D Inc.</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As I mentioned at the top, the Project Kiwi platform still has a lot of work left to do before it makes any appearances in the parks. But it’s already well on the road to being viable for things like stage performances, photo ops and eventually free-roaming deployment in the parks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That is really the vision. Snoddy says that the goal is to move the characters we love from across Disney’s pantheon into the spaces of the guests, elevating the entirety of the park to a live transportive experience, rather than a single ride or dark room. And to do it <i>at the proper scale</i> to make them genuine and capable of making guests believe. With these kinds of platforms, the possibilities are there to make the entire parks themselves a living, breathing home for the characters, rather than the tightly controlled environments of the rides themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The arc of history in this Imagineering journey is drawn in robots. From Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, to incredibly expressive characters like the Na’Vi Shaman anchored inside a dark ride, to characters that hold up in bright, well-lit spaces. Project Kiwi is the next frontier, allowing them to step off of the pedestal and right into the world of the guest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the most fascinating fields in robotics currently is HRI, or human-robot interaction. This multidisciplinary effort to help humans and robots communicate better is often focused on safety and awareness in industrial settings. But I’ve long said that the most incredibly interesting work in this space is being done in Imagineering R&#38;D. More than 100 million people pass through Disney’s parks per year, and the number of opportunities that they have to react to and interact with robotic characters grows yearly. And with projects like Kiwi on the horizon, this field is going to explode with new kinds of data and learnings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And, of course, we’ll get to meet some of our favorite characters looking and acting as real as we’ve ever seen them in our world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9ytAPNcscwU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:57:41 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.08.50-AM.jpg","linkMd5":"e37bf7fbe7a8b79baeb904e41908bc90","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-30-567_a58f0c6b1ad012de.webp","destWidth":3564,"destHeight":2132,"sourceBytes":1069866,"destBytes":256516,"author":"Matthew Panzarino","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.08.50-AM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-30-567_a58f0c6b1ad012de.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn67@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-37-654_a1574e8acabb62cd.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn87@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-37-921_e1db1e0f9d58d15a.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn53@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-38-037_8b146068065db6c2.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/groot-walk-dance.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-42-443_7cdf1367c03b4fba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-747_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-37-787_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-37-444_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-37-304_de3ca9a1d8ba84b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9ytAPNcscwU:U-YAlu6bQV8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn47@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-37-263_1b996c3eba912c6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn72@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-37-693_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9ytAPNcscwU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn42@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-37-233_08aa48d811faf705.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199321635},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:21","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:21","title":"SpaceX successfully launches astronauts with a re-used Dragon spacecraft for the first time","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2142941","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">SpaceX has another successful human space launch to its credit, after a good takeoff and orbital delivery of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Friday morning. The Dragon took off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM EDT). On board were four astronauts, including NASA&#8217;s Megan McArthur and Shane Kimbrough, as well as JAXA&#8217;s Akihiko Hoshide and the ESA&#8217;s Thomas Pesquet.</p>\n<p>This was Spacex&#8217;s second official astronaut delivery mission for NASA, after its Crew-1 operation last year. Unlike Crew-1, Crew-2 included use of two re-flown components in the spacecraft system, including the first-stage booster, which was used during the Crew-1 launch, and the Dragon capsule, which was used for SpaceX&#8217;s first-ever human spaceflight, the final demonstration mission of its spacecraft certification program for NASA, which flew Bob Behnken (side note: this mission&#8217;s pilot, McArthur, is Behnken&#8217;s wife) and Doug Hurley to the ISS. SpaceX has characterized the use of re-flown elements as arguably even safer than using new ones, with CEO Elon Musk noting that you wouldn&#8217;t want to be on the &#8220;first flight of an airplane when it comes out of the factory&#8221; during a conversation with Xprize&#8217;s Peter Diamandis on Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>Now that the Crew Dragon is in its target transfer orbit, it&#8217;ll be making its way to rendezvous with the Space Station, which will take just under 24 hours. It&#8217;ll be docking with the station early tomorrow morning, attaching to a docking port that was just cleared earlier this month when SpaceX&#8217;s other Crew Dragon relocated to another port on the ISS earlier this month.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>This launch also included a recovery attempt for the booster, with a landing at sea using SpaceX&#8217;s drone landing pad. That went as planned, meaning this booster, which has already flown two different sets of human astronauts, could be used to fly yet another after refurbishment.</p>\n<p>SpaceX&#8217;s Commercial Crew program with NASA continues to be the key success story in the agency&#8217;s move to partner with more private companies for its research and space exploration missions. NASA also recently tapped <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/\">SpaceX to develop the human landing system for its Artemis program</a>, which will return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo program, and which will use SpaceX&#8217;s Starship spacecraft. For SpaceX&#8217;s human spaceflight program, the next big milestone will be its first flight of a mission made up entirely of paying private citizens, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/\">which is currently set to take place this fall</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WuIGJlicdw\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/\">Last two crewmembers named for SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Last two crewmembers named for SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/embed/#?secret=WuIGJlicdw\" data-secret=\"WuIGJlicdw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"643JVncd0R\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/whats-next-for-spacetech-9-vcs-look-to-the-future/\">What&#8217;s next for space tech?

But the text includes wide-ranging exceptions, and digital and humans rights groups were quick to warn over loopholes they argue will lead to a drastic erosion of EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights. And last week a cross-party group of MEPs urged the Commission to screw its courage to the sticking place and outlaw the rights-hostile tech.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The EDPS, whose role includes issuing recommendations and guidance for the Commission, tends to agree. In a <a href=\"https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2021/artificial-intelligence-act-welcomed-initiative_en\">press release</a> today Wojciech Wiewiórowski urged a rethink.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPS regrets to see that our earlier calls for a moratorium on the use of remote biometric identification systems &#8212; including facial recognition &#8212; in publicly accessible spaces have not been addressed by the Commission,&#8221; he wrote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPS will continue to advocate for a stricter approach to automated recognition in public spaces of human features &#8212; such as of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals &#8212; whether these are used in a commercial or administrative context, or for law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A stricter approach is necessary given that remote biometric identification, where AI may contribute to unprecedented developments, presents extremely high risks of deep and non-democratic intrusion into individuals’ private lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wiewiórowski had some warm words for the legislative proposal too, saying he welcomed the horizontal approach and the broad scope set out by the Commission. He also agreed there are merits to a risk-based approach to regulating applications of AI.</p>\n<p>But the EDPB has made it clear that the red lines devised by EU lawmakers are a lot pinker in hue than he&#8217;d hoped for &#8212; adding a high-profile voice to the critique that the Commission hasn&#8217;t lived up to its much trumpeted claim to have devised a framework that will ensure &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; and &#8220;human-centric&#8221; AI.</p>\n<p>The coming debate over the final shape of the regulation is sure to include plenty of discussion over where exactly Europe&#8217;s AI red lines should be. A final version of the text isn&#8217;t expected to be agreed until next year at the earliest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPS will undertake a meticulous and comprehensive analysis of the Commission’s proposal to support the EU co-legislators in strengthening the protection of individuals and society at large. In this context, the EDPS will focus in particular on setting precise boundaries for those tools and systems which may present risks for the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy,&#8221; Wiewiórowski added.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qpk9eW29m4\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/\">Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221;
