When the sack is empty, the cardinals open their fists, and the chapel fills with murmured prayers of relief. Most of these men will live another year.

Like a lot of people, I have almost pathologically fond memories of the original Startopia, a management sim about running a donut-shaped space station (so in this case, the nostalgia beast is some kind of tentacled monster that lives in a space bin and eats robots). Any reboot, sequel or remake of Startopia has a lot of built-in good will, but also a lot of rose-tinted expectations to meet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spacebase-startopia\">Spacebase Startopia</a> is not technically a sequel to - or indeed a remaster or remake of - the Startopia of 2001, and I'm not entirely sure what the deal is with the IP or how anyone is getting away with this. Spacebase Startopia might be thought of as three small aliens stacked in a Startopia coat, I suppose? Or, to put it another way: it's a fun strategy-management game set in space, with jokes and fun scenarios and all that good stuff. It's sort of what you remember Startopia being like to play if you think of it now. But not exactly.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spacebace-startopia-review\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=R9vBM5KbuKE:7TOeKIETePY:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=R9vBM5KbuKE:7TOeKIETePY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/R9vBM5KbuKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/spacebase%20startopia%20review%203.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/spacebase%20startopia%20review%203.jpg","linkMd5":"49c7506433f23a02fbbbafb384fd6ee9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-33-745_6bf66a71756c219c.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":139092,"destBytes":99788,"author":"Alice Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/spacebase%20startopia%20review%203.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/spacebase%20startopia%20review%203.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-33-745_6bf66a71756c219c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-23-070_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-23-010_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/R9vBM5KbuKE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn66@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-22-535_dd4c91f85227baeb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425360803},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","title":"Balan Wonderworld, the new platformer from some Sonic creators, is out now","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balan-wonderworld-3d-platformer-is-out-now","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/balan%20wonderworld.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/balan%20wonderworld.jpg\" /> <p>\n  Opening night is here, kids.

It was conceived in 2000, in what was arguably the apex of the company&rsquo;s influence. It was a period when a company like Square might think, &ldquo;Disney would gladly let us put their best characters in our games.&rdquo; Legend has it that started as a literal elevator pitch, with a chance meeting between Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto and a Disney executive sowing the seeds for a crossover series that would span two decades and nearly a dozen entries, and <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-pc\">next week is coming to PC for the first time</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt&rsquo;s a release that&rsquo;s apt to inspire equal parts excitement and bemused laughter among PC fans. Excitement because Mickey, Donald, and Goofy in 4K is pretty neat; bemused laughter because Kingdom Hearts is just that weird.

While it&rsquo;s set up to give you as much freedom as possible in every aspect of your zoo&rsquo;s design, it still steers you firmly towards being good to the animals which live there. Unlike Frontier&rsquo;s other animal husbandry game, Jurassic World Evolution, where everyone knows the management layer is just a way of killing time until the inevitable monster deathmatches, Planet Zoo does absolutely nothing to signpost &ldquo;nightmare animal supermax&rdquo; as a valid playstyle. Personally, I think that&rsquo;s a good decision.</p>\n<p>But as I already mentioned, it puts a genuinely phenomenal range of construction tools at your disposal: if you can think of a habitat concept, the chances are you can build it. And inevitably, when a game gives me that much freedom to do my own thing, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before I move things into deeply unsettling territory. This week, I had Planet Zoo&rsquo;s new Southeast Asia DLC pack to play with, featuring eight new beasts and a huge bundle of new construction assets. I made a new zoo, in sandbox mode. And while it was pleasant enough for the animals which lived in it, I did everything I could to inflict profound psychic damage on the visiting public.

It combined two of my most favourite things in the whole wide world, in what was rapidly becoming my new favourite genre of games. It should have been a match made in heaven. Then disaster struck, and its name was Phil. </p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-should-have-been-my-goat\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=yQuhyI4pkf0:pbzAKuo8Jx0:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=yQuhyI4pkf0:pbzAKuo8Jx0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/yQuhyI4pkf0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:30:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom%20hearts1.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/kingdom%20hearts1.jpg","linkMd5":"775b91c3c3be1968725edb4995ba67a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn90@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-21-126_ce7deac52b68a57f.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":157951,"destBytes":85646,"author":"Katharine Castle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom%20hearts1.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/kingdom%20hearts1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn90@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-21-126_ce7deac52b68a57f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-23-070_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-23-010_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/yQuhyI4pkf0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-23-635_4f1a66a3d10fb0e2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425360803},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","title":"Monitor makers AOC are getting into gaming headsets","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monitor-makers-aoc-are-getting-into-gaming-headsets","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/aoc%20gh300.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/aoc%20gh300.jpg\" /> <p>AOC are best known for their <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-gaming-monitor-2021\">excellent gaming monitors</a>, but now the display makers are getting into a new area of PC gaming: the humble headset.

A generator just exploded. A superspy has infiltrated the vault. This is <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-genius-2\">Evil Genius 2</a> at its most hectic, a game of base-building and minion management, with a bit of tower defense thrown in. In true supervillain style, this game has two dramatically different faces. One reveals a handsomely animated base-building game of trap-setting and floor-planning, with a fun theme, appropriately silly voice-acting and plenty of panicked fire-fighting. The other shows a gurning numbers game, a stubborn goblin of timers and clicky icons, withholding resources and chuckling. I like one of these faces a lot more than the other.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-genius-2-review\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=gWwZgNer_2U:-ZX8fz3jNY0:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=gWwZgNer_2U:-ZX8fz3jNY0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/gWwZgNer_2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-genius-2-review-6-fire.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/evil-genius-2-review-6-fire.jpg","linkMd5":"51472f9b67a2738a5bf6cd980b617a0e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn63@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-21-229_935b6264a37cf803.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":374283,"destBytes":308036,"author":"Brendan Caldwell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-genius-2-review-6-fire.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/evil-genius-2-review-6-fire.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn63@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-21-229_935b6264a37cf803.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-23-070_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-23-010_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/gWwZgNer_2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn2@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-22-551_284d6ee3e6f9551d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425360798},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","title":"The Kingdom Hearts series is out now on PC","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kingdom-hearts-series-is-out-now-on-pc-via-the-epic-games-store","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-3-tips-controls-file-size-tutorial.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/kingdom-hearts-3-tips-controls-file-size-tutorial.jpg\" /> <p>I grew up in the late '80s and the '90s and, without access to streaming services, would do nearly anything to be able to watch more cartoons.

Sounds good.</p>\n<p><em>Update: Annnd now the patch is now out on PC and consoles, with Stadia following later in the week. 28.8GB to download for me on Steam.</em></p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-12-will-bring-fixes-for-perfomance-crashes-and-more\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=eVT3fc3-1CY:GS1HTfFgsfM:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=eVT3fc3-1CY:GS1HTfFgsfM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/eVT3fc3-1CY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:14:45 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-johnny-silverhand-a.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/cyberpunk-2077-johnny-silverhand-a.jpg","linkMd5":"9b0b394f1c876ef05558ac062240b55d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-24-068_4c4d98aa7ea72cee.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":316167,"destBytes":190166,"author":"Alice O'Connor","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-johnny-silverhand-a.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/cyberpunk-2077-johnny-silverhand-a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-24-068_4c4d98aa7ea72cee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-23-070_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-23-010_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/eVT3fc3-1CY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-23-757_195783f4b1223129.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425360800},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:20","title":"Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life review","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-review","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza%206%20bestest%20best.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/yakuza%206%20bestest%20best.jpg\" /> \n<p>After I completed <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life\">Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life</a>, I don't think I recovered for weeks. It was almost new year's day, and I watched as it faded to black, the roll of the credits followed by the tinkle of piano. It hit me then: that was it, Kiryu's chapter had come to a close. As the music swelled, I remember thinking about all the great times I had shared with my buff boy. \"Man, what a journey\", I thought to myself, \"but what a send-off.\"</p>\n<p>And now I've revisited the action-RPG on PC, I'm not surprised at my response.

You have to set goals with these things. But what game would irk the most readers? \"The hardcore strategy of <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us\">Among Us</a>\", maybe. Is there a Mario game on PC? I could get dark gags out of lives as strategic resources. Call Of Duty would surely make it too obvious?\n</p>\n<p>\nI left those questions to my brain while I had a go at something I'd had my eye on already anyway. It's called <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-empire\">Shadow Empire</a>. It is a grand strategy 4X wargame. I have been playing it almost every day since.
