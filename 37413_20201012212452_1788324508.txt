It answers a question I often get asked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do I need to use dither before encoding to mp3 ?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I always say <em>&#8220;Yes, just in case&#8221;</em> when people ask me that &#8211; but am I right ?</p>\n<p>In this video, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/DanWorrallTutorials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Worrall</a> answers that question and many others about dither, using simple, real-world tests. For example you&#8217;ll find answers to questions like <em>&#8220;is it OK to dither twice ? (or more)&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;what happens if I forget to dither ?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re reading this and thinking <em>&#8220;WTF is dither anyway?&#8221;</em>, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; he answers that question, too !</p>\n<p>Fantastic stuff from Dan, as always &#8211; and if you want to jump straight to the answer about dithering for mp3 encoding, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2iDrbgfPjPY?t=958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>And if you want to know more about why I think dither really is important (but not worth losing sleep over), here&#8217;s another post you may like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/no-stair-steps-in-digital-audio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why there are no &#8220;stair steps&#8221; in digital audio &#8211; IF you use dither</a></p>\n<p>&#8230;but these are only if you&#8217;re a real glutton for punishment !</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/when-to-dither/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When should you use dither ?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/when-in-doubt-dither/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When in doubt, dither</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/dither-for-mp3/\">Dither for mp3 &#8211; is it needed ?</a> is a post from Ian Shepherd's: Production Advice Subscribe to the newsletter for great content from the archives, special offers and a free interview - for more information, click here</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:47:44 +0000","feedId":37413,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"aedaed52b2bf50770399131035f10034","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Ian Shepherd","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602537892032}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 05:24:52","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 05:24:52","feedId":37413,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 21:24:52 +0000","fetchMs":13218,"handleMs":13691,"totalMs":26974,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"dedd5ccb1467a2e80e3f6fe114b81f8e","hostName":"europe68*","requestId":"1a0414049be845e094da449d231e2a24_37413","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:10:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 03:10:50","id":37413,"name":"Production Advice","url":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/feed/","subscriber":86,"website":null,"icon":"https://productionadvice.co.uk/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"make your music sound great","weekly":null,"link":"https://productionadvice.co.uk"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602537865060,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":13281,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":13691,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
