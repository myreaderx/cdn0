This post describes our journey from troubleshooting an issue to fixing it and delivering faster upload speeds to the global Internet.</p><p>We <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/test-your-home-network-performance/\">launched</a> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/test-your-home-network-performance/\">speed.cloudflare.com</a> in May 2020 to give our users insight into how well their networks perform. The test provides download, upload and latency tests. Soon after release, we received reports from a small number of users that sometimes upload speeds were underreported. Our investigation determined that it seemed to happen with end users that had high upload bandwidth available (several hundreds Mbps class cable modem or fiber service). Our speed tests are performed via browser JavaScript, and most browsers use HTTP/2 by default. We found that HTTP/2 upload speeds were sometimes much slower than HTTP/1.1 (assuming all TLS) when the user had high available upload bandwidth.</p><p>Upload speed is more important than ever, especially for people using home broadband connections. As many people have been forced to work from home they’re using their broadband connections differently than before. Prior to the pandemic broadband traffic was very asymmetric (you downloaded way more than you uploaded… think listening to music, or streaming a movie), but now we’re seeing an increase in uploading as people video conference from home or create content from their home office.</p><h3 id=\"initial-tests\">Initial Tests</h3><p>User reports were focused on particularly fast home networks. I set up a <code>dummynet</code> network simulator to test upload speed in a controlled environment. I launched a linux VM running our code inside my Macbook Pro and set up a <a href=\"https://www.saturnsoft.net/tech/2020/06/07/macosx-dummynet/\">dummynet between the VM and Mac host</a>.  Measuring upload speed is simple – create a file and upload using curl to an endpoint which accepts a request body. I ran the same test 20 times and took a median upload speed (Mbps).</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">% dd if=/dev/urandom of=test.dat bs=1M count=10\n% curl --http1.1 -w '%{speed_upload}\\n' -sf -o/dev/null --data-binary @test.dat https://edge/upload-endpoint\n% curl --http2 -w '%{speed_upload}\\n' -sf -o/dev/null --data-binary @test.dat https://edge/upload-endpoint</code></pre><p>Stepping up to uploading a 10MB object over a network which has 200Mbps available bandwidth and 40ms RTT, the result was surprising. Using our production configuration, HTTP/2 upload speed tested at almost half of the same test conditions using HTTP/1.1 (higher is better).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-4.44.56-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><p>The result may differ depending on your network, but the gap is bigger when the network is fast. On a slow network, like my home cable connection (5Mbps upload and 20ms RTT), HTTP/2 upload speed was almost identical to the performance observed with HTTP/1.1.</p><h3 id=\"receiver-flow-control\">Receiver Flow Control</h3><p>Before we get into more detail on this topic, my intuition suggested the issue was related to receiver flow control. Usually the client (browser or any HTTP client) is the receiver of data, but in the case the client is uploading content to the server, the server is the receiver of data. And the receiver needs some type of flow control of the receive buffer.</p><p>How we handle receiver flow control differs between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. For example, HTTP/1.1 doesn’t define protocol-level receiver flow control since there is no multiplexing of requests in the connection and it’s up to the TCP layer which handles receiving data. Note that most of the modern OS TCP stacks have auto tuning of the receive buffer (we will revisit that later) and they tune based on the current <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product\">BDP (bandwidth-delay product)</a>.</p><p>In the case of HTTP/2, there is a <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5.2\">stream-level flow control</a> mechanism because the protocol supports multiplexing of streams. Each HTTP/2 stream has its own flow control window and there is connection level flow control for all streams in the connection. If it’s too tight, the sender will be blocked by the flow control. If it’s too loose we may end up wasting memory for buffering. So keeping it optimal is important when implementing flow control and the most optimal strategy is to keep the receive buffer matching the current BDP. BDP represents the maximum bytes in flight in the given network and can be used as an optimal buffer size.</p><h3 id=\"how-nginx-handles-the-request-body-buffer\">How NGINX handles the request body buffer</h3><p>Initially I tried to find a parameter which controls NGINX upload buffering and tried to see if tuning the values improved the result. There are a couple of parameters which are related to uploading a request body.</p><ul><li><code><a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering\">proxy_buffering</a></code></li><li><code><a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_buffer_size\">client_body_buffer_size</a></code></li></ul><p>And this is HTTP/2 specific:</p><ul><li><code><a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_body_preread_size\">http2_body_preread_size</a></code></li></ul><p>Cloudflare does not use the <code>proxy_buffering</code> directive, so it can be immediately discounted.  <code>client_body_buffer_size</code> is the size of the request body buffer which is used regardless of the protocol, so this one applies to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 as well.</p><p>When looking into the code, here is how it works:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-10-at-3.51.05-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>\n<li>HTTP/1.1: use <code>client_body_buffer_size</code> buffer as a buffer between upstream and the client, simply repeating reading and writing using this buffer.</li>\n<li>HTTP/2: since we need a flow control window update for the HTTP/2 DATA frame, there are two parameters:\n<ul>\n<li><code>http2_body_preread_size</code>: it specifies the size of the initial request body read before it starts to send to the upstream.</li>\n<li><code>client_body_buffer_size</code>: it specifies the size of the request body buffer.</li>\n<li>Those two parameters are used for allocating a request body buffer during uploading. Here is a brief summary of how unbuffered upload works:\n<ul>\n<li>Allocate a single request body buffer which size is a maximum of <code>http2_body_preread_size</code> and <code>client_body_buffer_size</code>. This means if <code>http2_body_preread_size</code> is 64KB and <code>client_body_buffer_size</code> is 128KB, then a 128KB buffer is allocated. We use 128KB for <code>client_body_buffer_size</code>.</li>\n<li>HTTP/2 Settings <code>INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</code> of the stream is set to <code>http2_body_preread_size</code> and we use 64KB as a default (<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-6.9.2\">the RFC7540 default value</a>).</li>\n<li>HTTP/2 module reads up to <code>http2_body_preread_size</code> before sending it to upstream.</li>\n<li>After flushing the preread buffer, keep reading from the client and write to upstream and send <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> frame back to the client when necessary until the request body is fully received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To summarise what this means: HTTP/1.1 simply uses a single buffer, so TCP socket buffers do the flow control. However with HTTP/2, the application layer also has receiver flow control and NGINX uses a fixed size buffer for the receiver. This limits upload speed when the current link has a BDP larger than the current request body buffer size. So the bottleneck is HTTP/2 flow control when the buffer size is too tight.<br></p><h3 id=\"we-re-going-to-need-a-bigger-buffer\">We're going to need a bigger buffer?</h3><p>In theory, bigger buffer sizes should avoid upload bottlenecks, so I tried a few out by running my tests again. The previous chart result is now labelled \"prod\" and plotted alongside HTTP/2 tests with <code>client_body_buffer_size</code> set to 256KB, 512KB and 1024KB:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><p>It appears 512KB is an optimal value for <code>client_body_buffer_size</code>.</p><p>What if I test with some other network parameter? Here is when RTT is 10ms, in this case, 256KB looks optimal.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><p>Both cases look much better than current 128KB and get a similar performance to HTTP/1.1 or even better. However, it seems like the optimal buffer size is a moving target and furthermore having too large a buffer size can hurt the performance: we need a smart way to find the optimal buffer size.</p><h2 id=\"autotuning-request-body-buffer-size\">Autotuning request body buffer size</h2><p>One of the ideas that can help this kind of situation is autotuning. For example, modern TCP stacks autotune their receive buffers automatically. In production, our edge also has <a href=\"https://sysctl-explorer.net/net/ipv4/tcp_moderate_rcvbuf/\">TCP receiver buffer autotuning</a> enabled by default.</p><pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf = 1</code></pre><p>But in case of HTTP/2, TCP buffer autotuning is not very effective because the HTTP/2 layer is doing its own flow control and the existing 128KB was too small for a high BDP link. At this point, I decided to pursue autotuning HTTP/2 receive buffer sizing as well, similar to what TCP does.</p><p>The basic idea is that NGINX doubles the size of HTTP/2 request body buffer size based on its BDP. Here is an algorithm currently implemented in our version of NGINX:</p><ul><li>Allocate a request body buffer as explained above.</li><li>For every RTT (using linux <code>tcp_info</code>), update the current BDP.</li><li>Double the request body buffer size when the current BDP &#62; (receiver window / 4).</li></ul><h2 id=\"test-result\">Test Result</h2><h3 id=\"lab-test\"><strong>Lab Test</strong></h3><p>Here is a test result when HTTP/2 autotune upload is enabled (still using <code>client_body_buffer_size</code> 128KB). You can see \"h2 autotune\" is doing pretty well – similar or even slightly faster than HTTP/1.1 speed (that's the initial goal). It might be slightly worse than a hand-picked optimal buffer size for given conditions, but you can see now NGINX picks up optimal buffer size automatically based on network conditions.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><h3 id=\"production-test\">Production test</h3><p>After we deployed this feature, I ran similar tests against our production edge, uploading a 10MB file from well connected client nodes to our edge. I created a Linux VM instance in Google Cloud and ran the upload test where the network is very fast (a few Gbps) and low latency (&#60;10ms).</p><p>Here is when I run the test in the Google Cloud Belgium region to our CDG (Paris) PoP which has 7ms RTT. This looks very good with almost 3x improvement.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><p>I also tested between the Google Cloud Tokyo region and our NRT (Tokyo) PoP, which had a 2.3ms RTT. Although this is not realistic for home users, the results are interesting. A 128KB fixed buffer performs well, but HTTP/2 with buffer autotune outperforms even HTTP/1.1.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Delivering HTTP/2 upload speed improvements\"></figure><h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>HTTP/2 upload buffer autotuning is now fully deployed in the Cloudflare edge. Customers should now benefit from improved upload performance for all HTTP/2 connections, including speed tests on speed.cloudflare.com. Autotuning upload buffer size logic works well for most cases, and now HTTP/2 upload is much faster than before! When we think about the performance we usually tend to think about download speed or latency reduction, but faster uploading can also help users working from home when they need a large amount of upload, such as photo/video sharing apps, content creation, video conferencing or self broadcasting.</p><p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/lucas/\">Lucas Pardue</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/rustam-lalkaka/\">Rustam Lalkaka</a> for great feedback and suggestions on the article.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":1732,"bgimg":"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Speed-header@2x-1.png","linkMd5":"be3dab8a0bdef3dc927296abcfd4221e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn76@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-37-54-105_d9df14167b2364d1.webp","destWidth":2832,"destHeight":1472,"sourceBytes":220297,"destBytes":51392,"author":"Junho Choi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Speed-header@2x-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn76@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-37-54-105_d9df14167b2364d1.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Speed-header@2x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-37-56-122_2e666245d7c8aad9.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-4.44.56-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-37-55-998_26c6e4b0413eb211.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-10-at-3.51.05-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-37-56-071_38f09e557c900844.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-37-56-043_cf21ece6403901d4.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-37-57-364_fee22476c7bec719.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-37-57-340_5b8c78324e6be5b8.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn41@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-37-57-251_048c5a94aa99b565.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn2@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-37-57-011_bbb2df040e6221d5.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/10MB-6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn94@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-37-56-971_926dee4a97ca8e4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279873542},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:37:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:37:53","title":"Introducing Deploy Buttons","link":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-deploy-buttons/","description":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-13-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Deploy Buttons\"></figure><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-13-2.png\" alt=\"Introducing Deploy Buttons\"><p>When I first try out new development platforms, the first thing I do is get an OSS (Open Source Software) project I find on Github up and running. I used to start by following tutorials or digging through documentation. It’s a little bit counterintuitive. Let me share with you why. One reason is that Hello, World! examples rarely show the real “magic” of the platform. I want to feel excited and get a sense of how other people are creatively using the platform. </p><p>For example, I love it when I can build and deploy an OSS <a href=\"https://github.com/scitbiz/flutter_pokedex\">Pokedex</a> app in a few minutes on Flutter to see if the platform actually lives up to the hype. It’s so much easier to do this than to spend a few hours following tutorials and documentation to get through the initial learning curve. You can think of it as shortening the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-magic-reimagining-developer-experiences-for-the-world-of-serverless/\">time to first dopamine</a>.</p><p>Another reason is that it makes learning the new platform much faster. Building off of an experienced developer’s work shows me which classes and functions are most useful to learn. There’s more nuance to building out full applications than is usually explained in the documentation. I can see how the pieces fit together and get a deeper understanding.</p><p>When I started my internship on the Workers team, I realized I could help create the magical experience of trying out a new platform quickly for the Workers dev experience. The team and I have spent the last few months working hard with the Workers team to make this possible. Today, I’m happy to share with you: Deploy Buttons.</p><p>Deploy Buttons let you deploy a project to the Workers Platform without even needing to set up a local development environment. Before Deploy Buttons, new developers had to jump between multiple places like the signup pages, the docs, the dashboard, and Wrangler to deploy a project. Now, it’s as easy as clicking a Deploy Button and three short steps to deploy using our new web-based deploy tool. This is the fastest way for beginners to get something live in less than five minutes, and for developers to share their projects with others by creating their own deploy buttons.</p><p>Try this button to deploy a GraphQL db:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href=\"https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-graphql-server\"><img src=\"https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button\" alt=\"Introducing Deploy Buttons\"></a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We’ve also curated a <a href=\"http://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/\">few awesome projects </a>to try deploying now with this new deploy flow.</p><p>Before Deploy Buttons, things were a bit more complicated.

CNI allows our customers to interconnect branch and HQ locations directly with Cloudflare wherever they are, bringing Cloudflare’s full suite of network functions to their physical network edge. Using CNI to interconnect provides security, reliability, and performance benefits vs. using the public Internet to connect to Cloudflare. And because of Cloudflare’s global network reach, connecting to our network is straightforward no matter where on the planet your infrastructure and employees are.</p><p>At its most basic level, an interconnect is a link between two networks. Today, we’re offering customers the following options to interconnect with Cloudflare’s network:</p><ul><li>Via a private network interconnect (PNI). A physical cable (or a virtual “pseudo-wire”; more on that later) that connects two networks.</li><li>Over an Internet Exchange (IX). A common switch fabric where multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet networks can interconnect with each other.</li></ul><p>To use a real world analogy: Cloudflare over the years has built a network of highways across the Internet to handle all our customers' traffic. We’re now providing dedicated on-ramps for our customers’ on-prem networks to get onto those highways.</p><h2 id=\"why-interconnect-with-cloudflare\">Why interconnect with Cloudflare?</h2><p>CNI provides more reliable, faster, and more private connectivity between your infrastructure and Cloudflare’s. This delivers benefits across our product suite. Here are some examples of specific products and how you can combine them with CNI:</p><ul><li><strong>Cloudflare Access</strong>: Cloudflare Access replaces corporate VPNs with Cloudflare’s network. Instead of placing internal tools on a private network, teams deploy them in any environment, including hybrid or multi-cloud models, and secure them consistently with Cloudflare’s network. CNI allows you to bring your own MPLS network to meet ours, allowing your employees to connect to your network securely and quickly no matter where they are.</li><li><strong>CDN</strong>: Cloudflare’s CDN places content closer to visitors, improving site speed while minimizing origin load. CNI improves cache fill performance and reduces costs.</li><li><strong>Magic Transit</strong>: Magic Transit protects datacenter and branch networks from unwanted attack and malicious traffic. Pairing Magic Transit with CNI decreases jitter and drives throughput improvements, and further hardens infrastructure from attack.</li><li><strong>Cloudflare Workers</strong>: Workers is Cloudflare’s serverless compute platform. Integrating with CNI provides a secure connection to serverless cloud compute that does not traverse the public Internet, allowing customers to use Cloudflare’s unique set of Workers services with tighter network performance tolerances.</li></ul><p>Let’s talk more about how CNI delivers these benefits.</p><h2 id=\"improving-performance-through-interconnection\">Improving performance through interconnection</h2><p>CNI is a great way to boost performance for many existing Cloudflare products. By utilizing CNI and setting up interconnection with Cloudflare wherever a customer’s origin infrastructure is, customers can get increased performance and security at lower cost than using public transit providers.</p><h3 id=\"cni-makes-things-faster\">CNI makes things faster</h3><p>As an example of the performance improvements network interconnects can deliver for Cloudflare customers, consider an HTTP application workload which flows through Cloudflare’s CDN and WAF. Many of our customers rely on our CDN to make their HTTP applications more responsive.</p><p>Cloudflare caches content very close to end users to provide the best performance possible. But, if content is not in cache, Cloudflare edge PoPs must contact the origin server to retrieve cacheable content. This can be slow, and places more load on an origin server compared to serving directly from cache. </p><p>With CNI, these origin pulls can be completed over a dedicated link, improving throughput and reducing overall time needed for origin pulls. Using Argo Tiered Cache, customers can manage tiered cache topologies and specify upstream cache tiers that correspond with locations where network interconnects are in place. Using Tiered Cache in this fashion lowers origin loads and increases cache hit rates, thereby improving performance and reducing origin infrastructures costs.</p><p>Here’s anonymized and sampled data from a real Cloudflare customer who recently provisioned interconnections between our network and theirs to further improve performance. Heavy users of our CDN, they were able to shave off precious milliseconds from their origin round trip time (RTT) by adding PNIs in multiple locations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Htmu4K3SVLYb5MLATaPHr1qv1aXV4033MS-rSKi8dKF4R8QUpW5mz7r0sOIhn94-4ljQm7fgnp0xXpqklh2tSM970ysEefBv5U66_Dci7Kw0setb3dzHqsV0rkJPz66H6ukLteAj\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Cloudflare Network Interconnect\"></figure><p>As an example, their 90th percentile round trip time in Warsaw, Poland decreased by 6.5ms as a result of provisioning a private network interconnect (from 7.5ms to 1ms), which is a performance win of 87%!  The jitter (variation in delay in received packets) on the link decreased from 82.9 to 0.3, which speaks to the dedicated, reliable nature of the link. CNI helps deliver reliable and performant network connectivity to your customers and employees.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/V8TPtdGC1OLm3ND8mRE9soZyNNo0E2voDjDdxcJYGu0s56VuVU49jg6yLcNpMNiv2UuXHS2tm7vkJac9tIgkEsHaq4F2PFRu_DmwZA94TQNmpmylXnt9LCtchu9xzlgH7wUlnPCc\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Cloudflare Network Interconnect\"></figure><h2 id=\"enhanced-security-through-private-connectivity\">Enhanced security through private connectivity</h2><p>Customers with large on-premise networks want to move to the cloud: it’s cheaper, less hassle, and less overhead and maintenance.  However, customers want to also preserve their existing security and threat models.</p><p>Traditionally, CIOs trying to connect their IP networks to the Internet do so in two steps:</p><ol><li>Source connectivity to the Internet from transit providers (ISPs).</li><li>Purchase, operate, and maintain network function specific hardware appliances. Think hardware load balancers, firewalls, DDoS mitigation equipment, WAN optimization, and more.</li></ol><p>CNI allows CIOs to provision security services on Cloudflare and connect their existing networks to Cloudflare in a way that bypasses the public Internet.  Because Cloudflare integrates with on-premise networks and the cloud, customers can enforce security policies across both networks and create a consistent, secure boundary.</p><p>CNI increases cloud and network security by providing a private, dedicated link to the Cloudflare network. Since this link is reserved exclusively for the customer that provisions it, the customer’s traffic is isolated and private.</p><h3 id=\"cni-magic-transit-removing-public-internet-exposure\">CNI + Magic Transit: Removing public Internet exposure</h3><p>To use a product-specific example: through CNI’s integration with Magic Transit, customers can take advantage of private connectivity to minimize exposure of their network to the public Internet.</p><p>Magic Transit attracts customers’ IP traffic to our data centers by advertising their IP addresses from our edge via BGP. When traffic arrives, it’s filtered and sent along to customers’ data centers. Before CNI, all Magic Transit traffic was sent from Cloudflare to customers via Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels over the Internet. Because GRE endpoints are publicly routable, there is some risk these endpoints could be discovered and attacked, bypassing Cloudflare’s DDoS mitigation and security tools.</p><p>Using CNI removes this exposure to the Internet. Advantages of using CNI with Magic Transit include:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduced threat exposure</strong>. Although there are many steps companies can take to increase network security, some risk-sensitive organizations prefer not to expose endpoints to the public Internet at all. CNI allows Cloudflare to absorb that risk and forward only clean traffic (via Magic Transit) through a truly private interface.</li><li><strong>Increased reliability</strong>. Traffic traveling over the public Internet is subject to factors outside of your control, including latency and packet loss on intermediate networks. Removing steps between Cloudflare’s network and yours means that after Magic Transit processes traffic, it’s forwarded directly and reliably to your network.</li><li><strong>Simplified configuration</strong>. Soon, Magic Transit + CNI customers will have the option to skip making MSS (maximum segment size) changes when onboarding, a step that’s required for GRE-over-Internet and can be challenging for customers who need to consider their downstream customers’ MSS as well (eg. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/service-providers/\">service providers</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=\"example-deployment-penguin-corp-uses-cloudflare-for-teams-magic-transit-and-cni-to-protect-branch-and-core-networks-and-employees-\">Example deployment: Penguin Corp uses Cloudflare for Teams, Magic Transit, and CNI to protect branch and core networks, and employees.</h3><p>Imagine Penguin Corp, a hypothetical company, has a fully connected private MPLS network.  Maintaining their network is difficult and they have a dedicated team of network engineers to do this.  They are currently paying a lot of money to run their own private cloud. To minimize costs, they limit their network egress points to two worldwide.  This creates a major performance problem for their users, whose bits have to travel a long way to accomplish basic tasks while still traversing Penguin’s network boundary.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_phA04NIplQYLGFp6NKPYCagymhemaHQBhFlYT_cX7lxV0QgVMt4g_W7eELJIfSufyH0iPiQZzWPQATMDHSul5Wcv3pDHTNqZI4wkTxcv787Lko8-F6cnGhXqaAy4dyvKfXkxcFe\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Cloudflare Network Interconnect\"></figure><p>SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) models look attractive to them, because they can, in theory, move away from their traditional MPLS network and move towards the cloud.  SASE deployments provide firewall, DDoS mitigation, and encryption services at the network edge, and bring security as a service to any cloud deployment, as seen in the diagram below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4nyBvpgo5-gvehuP51_4TIU_LPPADT3Dw3Tw4HvdMxxbuPAYgz-ewgbg8ervMqgP_eQgf94Vl7MQdzqeu7LtIlAHuAlGpg1LOa35WmUbFQvvX6PD3lnwk0eMhBGeIqHKb4OXeAtC\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Cloudflare Network Interconnect\"></figure><p>CNI allows Penguin to use Cloudflare as their true network edge, hermetically sealing their branch office locations and datacenters from the Internet. Penguin can adapt to a SASE-like model while keeping exposure to the public Internet at zero. Penguin establishes PNIs with Cloudflare from their branch office in San Jose to Cloudflare’s San Jose location to take advantage of Cloudflare for Teams, and from their core colocation facility in Austin to Cloudflare’s Dallas location to use Magic Transit to protect their core networks. </p><p>Like Magic Transit, Cloudflare for Teams replaces traditional security hardware on-premise with Cloudflare’s global network. Customers who relied on VPN appliances to reach internal applications can instead connect securely through Cloudflare Access. Organizations maintaining physical web gateway boxes can send Internet-bound traffic to Cloudflare Gateway for filtering and logging.</p><p>Cloudflare for Teams services run in every Cloudflare data center, bringing filtering and authentication closer to your users and locations to avoid compromising performance. CNI improves that even further with a direct connection from your offices to Cloudflare. With a simple configuration change, all branch traffic reaches Cloudflare’s edge where Cloudflare for Teams policies can be applied. The link improves speed and reliability for users and replaces the need to backhaul traffic to centralized filtering appliances.</p><p>Once interconnected this way, Penguin’s network and employees realize two benefits:</p><ol><li>They get to use Cloudflare’s full set of security services without having to provision expensive and centralized physical or virtualized network appliances.</li><li>Their security and performance services are running across Cloudflare’s global network in over 200 cities. This brings performance and usability improvements for users by putting security functions closer to them.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PVOb8h-7FT_nAHjY8nZ8RX8equpfCMRCj260_6anOjpmSvMbDc9W5AtUGXH-91k3EVpw8fyeEwPVsR2O--gs1AchU3kvLS10JwvWnHaKBcTw0nLj2iGogXcPApCu5JjhuOizT1bH\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Cloudflare Network Interconnect\"></figure><h2 id=\"scalable-global-and-flexible-interconnection-options\">Scalable, global, and flexible interconnection options</h2><p>CNI offers a big benefit to customers because it allows them to take advantage of our global footprint spanning 200+ cities: their branch office and datacenter infrastructure can connect to Cloudflare wherever they are.</p><p>This matters for two reasons: our globally distributed network makes it easier to interconnect locally, no matter where a customer’s branches and core infrastructure is, and allows for a globally distributed workforce to interact with our edge network with low latency and improved performance. </p><p><strong>Customers don’t have to worry about securely expanding their network footprint: that’s our job.</strong></p><p>To this point, global companies need to interconnect at <em>many</em> points around the world. Cloudflare Network Interconnect is priced for global network scale: <strong>Cloudflare doesn't charge anything for enterprise customers to provision CNI. </strong>Customers may need to pay for access to an interconnection platform or a datacenter cross-connect. We’ll work with you and any other parties involved to make the ordering and provisioning process as smooth as possible.</p><p>In other words, CNI’s pricing is designed to accommodate complicated enterprise network topologies <em>and</em> modern IT budgets.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-interconnect\">How to interconnect</h2><p>Customers can interconnect with Cloudflare in one of three ways: over a private network interconnect (PNI), over an IX, or through one of our interconnection platform partners. We have worked closely with our global partners to meet our customers where they are and how they want.</p><h3 id=\"private-network-interconnects\">Private Network Interconnects</h3><p>Private Network Interconnects are available at <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/net/4224\">any of our listed private peering facilities</a>. Getting a physical connection to Cloudflare is easy: specify where you want to connect, port speeds, and target VLANs. From there, we’ll authorize it, you’ll place the order, and let us do the rest.  Customers should choose PNI as their connectivity option if they want higher throughput than a virtual connection or connection over an IX, or want to eliminate as many intermediaries from an interconnect as possible.</p><h3 id=\"internet-exchanges\">Internet Exchanges</h3><p>Customers who want to use existing Internet Exchanges can interconnect with us <a href=\"https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_ix\">at any of the 235+ Internet Exchanges we </a>participate in. To connect with Cloudflare via an Internet Exchange, follow the IX’s instructions to connect, and Cloudflare will spin up our side of the connection.  Customers should choose Internet Exchanges as their connectivity option if they are either already peered at an IX, or they want to interconnect in a place where an interconnection platform isn’t present.</p><h3 id=\"interconnection-platform-partners\">Interconnection Platform Partners</h3><p>Cloudflare is proud to be <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-interconnect-partner-program\">partnering</a> with Equinix, Megaport, PCCW ConsoleConnect, PacketFabric, and Zayo to provide you with easy ways to virtually connect with us in any of the partner-supported locations.

They are platforms that allow two networks to interconnect privately at layer 2, without requiring additional physical cabling. Instead the customer can order a port and a virtual connection on a dashboard, and the interconnection ‘fabric’ will establish the connection. Since many large customers are already connected to these fabrics for their connections to traditional Cloud providers, it is a very convenient method to establish private connectivity with Cloudflare.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/BDES-687_Hero_Image_for_Web_Page_of_New_Partner_Program.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cloudflare Network Interconnection Partnerships Launch\"></figure><h3 id=\"why-interconnect-virtually\">Why interconnect virtually?</h3><p>Cloudflare has an extensive <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-peering-portal-beta/\">peering</a> infrastructure and already has private links to thousands of other networks. Virtual private interconnection is particularly attractive to customers with strict security postures and demanding performance requirements, but without the added burden of ordering and managing additional physical cross connects and expanding their physical infrastructure.</p><h3 id=\"key-benefits-of-interconnection-platforms\">Key Benefits of Interconnection Platforms</h3><p><strong>Secure</strong><br>Similar to physical PNI,<strong> </strong>traffic does not pass across the Internet. Rather, it flows from the customer router, to the Interconnection Platform’s network and ultimately to Cloudflare. So while there is still some element of shared infrastructure, it’s not over the public Internet.</p><p><strong>Efficient</strong><br>Modern PNIs are typically a minimum of 1Gbps, but if you have the security motivation without the sustained 1Gbps data transfer rates, then you will have idle capacity. Virtual connections provide for “sub-rate” speeds, which means less than 1Gbps, such as 100Mbps, meaning you only pay for what you use. Most providers also allow some level of “burstiness”, which is to say you can exceed that 100Mbps limit for short periods.</p><p><strong>Performance</strong><br>By avoiding the public Internet, virtual links avoid Internet congestion.</p><p><strong>Price</strong><br>The major cloud providers typically have different pricing for egressing data to the Internet compared to an Interconnect Platform. By connecting to your cloud via an Interconnect Partner, you can benefit from those reduced egress fees between your cloud and the Interconnection Platform. This builds on our<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/\"> Bandwidth Alliance</a> to give customers more options to continue to drive down their network costs.</p><p><strong>Less Overhead</strong><br>By virtualizing, you reduce physical cable management to just one connection into the Interconnection Platform. From there, everything defined and managed in software. For example, ordering a 100Mbps link to Cloudflare can be a few clicks in a Dashboard, as would be a 100Mbps link into Salesforce.</p><p><strong>Data Center Independence</strong><br>Is your infrastructure in the same metro, but in a different facility to Cloudflare? An Interconnection Platform can bring us together without the need for additional physical links.</p><h3 id=\"where-can-i-connect\">Where can I connect?</h3><ol><li>In any of our <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/net/4224\">physical facilities</a></li><li>In any of the 23 metro areas where we are currently connected to an Interconnection Platform (see below)</li><li>If you’d like to connect virtually in a location not yet listed below, simply <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/network-interconnect-partner-program\">get in touch</a> via our interconnection page and we’ll work out the best way to connect.</li></ol><h3 id=\"metro-areas\">Metro Areas</h3><p>The metro areas below have currently active connections.

To protect RDP, customers would deploy Argo Tunnel to create an encrypted connection between their RDP server and our edge - effectively locking down RDP resources from the public Internet. Once locked down with Tunnel, customers could use Cloudflare Access to create identity-driven rules enforcing who could login to their resources. </p><p>Setting Tunnel up initially required installing the Cloudflare daemon, <em>cloudflared</em>, on each RDP server. However, as the adoption of remote work increased we learned that installing and provisioning a new daemon on every server in a network was a tall order for customers managing large fleets of servers. </p><p>What should have been a simple, elegant VPN replacement became a deployment headache. As organizations helped tens of thousands of users switch to remote work, no one had the bandwidth to deploy tens of thousands of daemons.</p><p>Message received: today we are announcing <em>Argo Tunnel RDP Bastion mode</em>, a simpler way to protect RDP connections at scale. 🎉 By functioning as a jump-host, <em>cloudflared</em> can reside on a single node in your network and proxy requests to any internal server, eliminating deployment headaches.</p><p>Previously, if a user wanted to RDP to a resource not yet protected with a dedicated <em>cloudflared</em> tunnel, they would have to reach out to a member of their infrastructure team and request that it be provisioned manually. For larger enterprises managing thousands of network assets, this could pose a significant burden, involving new configuration management manifests and implementing tunnel health monitoring. </p><p>Argo Tunnel RDP Bastion mode enables teams to reach any machine through a single <em>cloudflared</em> instance - a single tunnel, gated by Cloudflare Access, to reach hundreds of remote desktops.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-rdp-matter\">Why does RDP matter? </h2><p>RDP is one of the most popular protocols used by employees to access their office computers from remote devices. It is installed by default on Windows, and is supported on *nix and MacOS operating systems. Many companies rely on RDP to allow their employees to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-build-a-highly-productive-remote-team-or-team-of-contractors-with-cloudflare-for-teams/\">work from home. </a></p><p>Utilization of the remote desktop protocol has increased significantly in correlation with increased work from home due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Unfortunately, in a rush to make machines available to remote users, many organizations have misconfigured RDP, which has given attackers a new opportunity to target remote desktops. </p><p>This increase is due primarily to two factors. The first factor is <em>exposure</em>. Many RDP servers are inadvertently exposed directly to the open Internet due to incomplete enforcement of firewall rules or unpatched vulnerabilities. Quickly exposing desktop fleets in a rush to help employees work from home might result in more security oversights.</p><p>Second, most RDP servers are not protected with corporate SSO tools. When users connect over RDP, they often enter a local password to login to the target machine. However, organizations don't always manage these credentials properly. Instead, users set and save passwords on an ad-hoc basis outside of the single sign-on credentials used for other services. That oversight leads to outdated, reused, and ultimately weak passwords that are potentially  securing Internet-exposed resources.</p><h2 id=\"where-does-cloudflare-access-fit\">Where does Cloudflare Access fit?</h2><p>Cloudflare Access adds stronger authentication to RDP sessions by first locking down access to the remote machine via Argo Tunnel, then enforcing identity-based policies to determine who can gain access. Whether your organization uses Okta, Azure AD, or another provider, your users will be prompted to authenticate with those credentials before starting any RDP sessions.</p><p>With RDP connections protected by Access, organizations can enforce the same password strength and rotation requirements for RDP connections as they do for other critical tools. </p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Protecting Remote Desktops at Scale with Cloudflare Access\"></figure><p>On the origin side, an admin will configure a single <em>cloudflared</em> instance to run in bastion mode. That bastion will reach out to the two closest Cloudflare edge data centers and create a long-lived HTTP2 session. Once set up, <em>cloudflared</em> will wait for incoming connections from clients to specify which final origin to connect to. This is unlike conventional <em>cloudflared</em> tunnel behavior, which immediately creates a single outgoing connection to a pre-configured origin.</p><p>On the RDP user side, a <em>cloudflared</em> instance running as a client will be configured with the final destination of the RDP session.  This isn't the address of the <em>cloudflared</em> bastion but rather the internal hostname the user wants to connect to.</p><p>Next, the user’s primary RDP client (i.e. “Remote Desktop Connection” on Windows) will initiate a connection to the local <em>cloudflared</em> client. <em>cloudflared</em> will launch a browser window and navigate to the Access app’s login page, prompting the user to authenticate with an IdP. </p><p>Once authenticated, the <em>cloudflared</em> client will tunnel the RDP traffic over HTTPS requests to the Cloudflare edge, including the final RDP destination and Access JWT in the request headers. The edge will verify the Access JWT to ensure that the client is authorized to reach the origin and, if it is, will use a special PoP to PoP route called <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/\">Argo Smart Routing</a> to forward the connection to the bastion over the shortest path possible.</p><p>For each incoming connection, the bastion will initiate an outgoing RDP session to the final internal destination and proxy traffic back and forth to the client.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Recording-2020-08-04-at-11.48.30-AM--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Protecting Remote Desktops at Scale with Cloudflare Access\"></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>While today we are proxying just RDP traffic in bastion mode, we will eventually be expanding this functionality to protocols like FTP, SSH, and generic TCP. </p><p>In the effort to make protecting internal resources easier than ever before, <em>cloudflared</em> can now also be conveniently found in the <a href=\"https://pkg.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare package repo</a>, in tagged releases on the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases\"><em>cloudflared</em> Github repo</a>, and in the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared\"><em>cloudflared</em> Docker hub repo</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":1732,"bgimg":"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-5.png","linkMd5":"8431e774f49ddf9948777d775f2e00ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-37-53-775_513eae5cf380368d.webp","destWidth":823,"destHeight":406,"sourceBytes":24310,"destBytes":18040,"author":"Mike Borkenstein","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-37-53-775_513eae5cf380368d.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn90@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-37-55-972_b204bce3afc42c69.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Recording-2020-08-04-at-11.48.30-AM--1-.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn89@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-38-21-134_7875ebf5f49577ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279873544},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:37:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:37:53","title":"My living room intern experience at Cloudflare","link":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/my-living-room-intern-experience-at-cloudflare/","description":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Cloudflare-Internship-Legal-Team@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"My living room intern experience at Cloudflare\"></figure><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Cloudflare-Internship-Legal-Team@2x-1.png\" alt=\"My living room intern experience at Cloudflare\"><p>This was an internship unlike any other. With a backdrop of a pandemic, protests, and a puppy that interrupted just about every Zoom meeting, it was also an internship that demonstrated Cloudflare’s leadership in giving students meaningful opportunities to explore their interests and contribute to the company’s mission: to help build a better Internet.</p><p>For the past twelve weeks, I’ve had the pleasure of working as a Legal Intern at Cloudflare. A few key things set this internship apart from even those in which I’ve been able to connect with people in-person:</p><ul><li>Communication</li><li>Community</li><li>Commingling</li><li>Collaboration</li></ul><p>Ever since I formally accepted my internship, the Cloudflare team has been in frequent and thorough communication about what to expect and how to make the most of my experience. This approach to communication was in stark contrast to the approach taken by several other companies and law firms. The moment COVID-19 hit, Cloudflare not only reassured me that I’d still have a job, the company also <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-doubling-size-of-2020-summer-intern-class/\">doubled down</a> on bringing on more interns. Comparatively, a bunch of my fellow law school students were left in limbo: unsure of if they had a job, the extent to which they’d be able to do it remotely, and whether it would be a worthwhile experience. </p><p>This approach has continued through the duration of the internship. I know I speak for my fellow interns when I say that we were humbled to be included in company-wide initiatives to openly communicate about the trying times our nation and particularly members of communities of color have experienced this summer. We weren’t left on the sidelines but rather invited into the fold. I’m so grateful to my manager, Jason, for clearing my schedule to participate in Cloudflare’s “Day On: Learning and Inclusion.” On June 18, the day before Juneteenth, Cloudflare employees around the world joined together for transformative and engaging sessions on how to listen, learn, participate, and take action to be better members of our communities. That day illustrated Cloudflare’s commitment to fostering communication as well as to building community and diversity. </p><p>The company’s desire to foster a sense of community pervades each team. Case in point, members of the Legal, Policy, and Trust &#38; Safety (LPT) team were ready and eager to help my fellow legal interns and me better understand the team’s mission and day-to-day activities. I went a perfect 11/11 on asks to LPT members for 1:1 Zoom meetings -- these meetings had nothing to do with a specific project but were merely meant to create a stronger community by talking with employees about how they ended up at this unique company. </p><p>From what I’ve heard from fellow interns, this sense of community was a common thread woven throughout their experiences as well. Similarly, other interns shared my appreciation for being given more than just “shadowing” opportunities. We were invited to commingle with our teammates and encouraged to take active roles in meetings and on projects. </p><p>In my own case, I got to dive into exciting research on privacy laws such as the GDPR and so much more. This research required that I do more than just be a fly on the wall, I was invited to actively converse and brief folks directly involved with making key decisions for the LPT. For instance, when Tilly came on in July as Privacy Counsel, I had the opportunity to brief her on the research I’d done related to Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs). In the same way, when Edo and Ethan identified some domain names that likely infringed on Cloudflare’s trademark, my fellow intern, Elizabeth, and I were empowered to draft WIPO complaints per the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. Fingers crossed our work continues Cloudflare’s strong record before the WIPO (<a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=DAI2019-0001\">here’s an example</a> of a recent favorable division). These seemingly small tasks introduced me to a wide range of fascinating legal topics that will inform my future coursework and, possibly, even my career goals.</p><p>Finally, collaboration distinguished this internship from other opportunities. By way of example, I was assigned projects that required working with others toward a successful outcome. In particular, I was excited to work with Jocelyn and Alissa on research related to the intersection of law and public policy. This dynamic duo fielded my queries, sent me background materials, and invited me to join meetings with stakeholders. This was a very different experience from previous internships in which collaboration was confined to just an email assigning the research and a cool invite to reach out if any questions came up.

At Cloudflare, we’ve seen an<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cyberattacks-since-the-murder-of-george-floyd/\"> increase in cyberattacks</a>, we’ve heard<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fallon-blossom_blacklivesmatter-activity-6674037943671291904-dWgP\"> from the leadership of Afroflare</a>, our Employee Resource Group for employees of African descent, and we held our first ever Day On, held on June 18, Cloudflare’s employee day of learning about bias, the history and psychological effects of racism, and how racism can get baked into algorithms. </p><p>By way of this blog post, I want to share my thoughts about where I think we go from here and how I believe we can truly embody<a href=\"https://dei.extension.org/\"> Diversity Equity and Inclusion</a> (DEI) in our workplace.</p><p><em>Is diversity recruiting the answer to anti-racism in the workplace?</em></p><p>Many Cloudflarians said we should increase our diversity recruiting efforts as part of the feedback we received after our Day On event. But recruiting more diverse candidates only solves one part of the problem. There are still two major hurdles to overcome:</p><ul><li>Employees need to feel welcome and have a sense of<a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/belonging-at-work/\"> belonging</a></li><li>Employees need to feel valued and have an<a href=\"https://www.skillcast.com/blog/7-tips-promote-equality-end-workplace-discrimination\"> equal opportunity</a> for career advancement</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/employee-resource-groups?aceid=&#38;gclid=CjwKCAjwmMX4BRAAEiwA-zM4JqGYCfRDJ4tesgBPmRIvcPB9Sz5rF62Rlc87ZpoQNolz54J4GCUZuBoCtxwQAvD_BwE\">Employee Resource Groups</a> (ERGs) offer opportunities to foster community and a sense of belonging. But it is beyond the scope of an ERG to ensure all employees have equal opportunities for advancement. And honestly, this is where a lot of companies fall short. It’s the reason you see people sharing pictures and calling out management teams or boards of directors<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/show_the_boardroom/\"> all over social media</a>. Because there is a lack of visible signs of diversity at senior levels. Numbers can be misleading. A company might state, “We have 11% employees of this group or 8% of that group.” That’s great, but how many of these employees are thriving in their current roles and getting promoted at the same pace as their white counterparts? Or being compensated at the same rate as their male counterparts? The answers to those questions are much more telling, yet seldom shared.</p><p>Folks, if we are going to see meaningful change, we all need to get onboard with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. It’s really not the type of thing that people can opt-in or out of. It won’t work. And even if, and when, everyone opts in to make DEI a priority, that won’t be enough. We won’t start to see real change until we are all living and breathing DEI day in and day out.</p><p><em>What does committing to DEI every day look like?</em></p><p>Doing something (anything) every day that flexes our DEI muscles and gets us closer to meaningful outcomes.</p><p>Examples include:</p><ul><li>Mentoring a person from an underrepresented group or asking someone from an underrepresented group to mentor you.</li><li>Scheduling coffee meetings with underrepresented people around the company and finding out how you can help to amplify their voices.</li><li>Providing candid, timely coaching to underrepresented employees to help them grow in their field or area of expertise.</li><li>Learning to value the different approaches and styles that people from underrepresented groups bring to the workplace.</li><li>Watching Cloudflare TV segments like,<a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/best-of/af5f628f6c47aed8fbec4333c44c666a\"> “Everyone at the Table”</a> which airs weekly and promotes an open dialogue about everyday topics from the perspective of people with different perspectives.</li><li>Hosting office-wide or team-wide “listening circles” where employees can share what a just and equitable workplace looks like to them.</li><li>Requesting educational opportunities for your team or whole company such as implicit bias workshops or allyship workshops. Asking if your company’s leaders have attended similar workshops.</li><li>Asking your manager/team leadership how you may help increase the diversity of your team. </li><li>Suggesting ideas for building a more inclusive culture within your team such as running meetings in a manner where everyone has an equal opportunity to speak, keeping meetings and work social activities within working hours, and regularly hosting conversations about how the team can be more inclusive.</li><li>And finally - asking the opinion of someone from an under-represented group. This one is especially important since so many of us are not present when critical decisions are being made.</li></ul><p><em>Why is committing to DEI on a daily basis important?</em></p><ul><li>Because it’s easier for us to do nothing. Keeping the status quo is easy. Coming together to change the system is hard work. Especially if everyone is not on board.</li><li>Because having a company full of underrepresented people who are not being heard, seen, celebrated, or promoted is not going to get us the outcomes we want. And trust me, it doesn’t take long to realize that you are not going to make it at a company. Racism, discrimination, and unfair treatment can be very subtle but under-represented people can tell when they are valued and appreciated. And when they are being set up to fail.</li><li>Because we know too much. The system is broken. Underrepresented groups have always known this. But now that it is a fact most people acknowledge and accept, we can’t ignore it. A wise woman once said, \"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.\" (Maya Angelou)</li></ul><p>I’ll end my commentary with this: I view DEI as a <em>journey</em> that we must commit to every day. Here at Cloudflare. Across the tech industry. And in our world.</p><p>Notice I used the word journey. It’s not a destination in the sense that we do these 10 things and we have “arrived”. Instead, I believe it is a journey that we will always be on with milestones and achievements to be celebrated along the way. </p><p>To help you start flexing your DEI muscle, I’m kicking off a 21-Day DEI Challenge starting today! Every day, for the next 21 days, I challenge you to share in a public forum (bonus points for doing it on LinkedIn) how you are helping to move DEI forward. You can take a small step or a really big one. What matters is that you are flexing that muscle and challenging yourself (and others) to start the journey. #21DayDEIChallenge #BeAntiRacist #MoveTheNeedle</p><p>I hope you are up for the challenge that DEI offers us because the future of our company, industry, and society depends on it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/image4-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Commit to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Every Day\"></figure><p><em><strong>Postscript: This blog post is dedicated to the memory of the late Congressman John Lewis, a great civil rights leader and so much more, who challenged all of us to be brave enough to make noise and get into “good trouble” for the sake of justice and equality.

The secondary servers can then serve the records as if they were the primary server, however changes can only be made by the primary server, not the secondary servers. This creates redundancy across many different servers that can be distributed as necessary. </p><p>There are many common ways to take advantage of Secondary DNS, some of which are:</p><ol><li>Secondary DNS as passive backup - The secondary DNS server sits idle until the primary server goes down, at which point a failover can occur and the secondary can start serving records.</li><li>Secondary DNS as active backup - The secondary DNS server works alongside the primary server to serve records.</li><li>Secondary DNS with a hidden primary - The nameserver records at the registrar point towards the secondary servers only, essentially treating them as the primary nameservers.</li></ol><h3 id=\"what-is-secondary-dns-override\">What is secondary DNS Override?</h3><p>Secondary DNS Override builds on the Secondary DNS with a hidden primary model by allowing our customers to not only serve records as they tell us to, but also enable them to proxy any A/AAAA/CNAME records through <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/\">Cloudflare's network</a>. This is similar to how Cloudflare as a primary DNS provider currently works. </p><p>Consider the following example:</p><p>example.com Cloudflare IP - 192.0.2.0<br>example.com origin IP - 203.0.113.0</p><p>In order to take advantage of Cloudflare's security and performance services, we need to make sure that the origin IP stays hidden from the Internet. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Orange Clouding with Secondary DNS\"><figcaption>Figure 1: Secondary DNS without a hidden primary nameserver</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 1 shows that without a hidden primary nameserver, the resolver can choose to query either one. This opens up two issues:</p><ol><li>Violates <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034\">RFC 1034</a> and <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2182\">RFC 2182</a> because the Cloudflare server will be responding differently than the primary nameserver.</li><li>The origin IP will be exposed to the Internet.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image2-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Orange Clouding with Secondary DNS\"><figcaption>Figure 2: Secondary DNS with a hidden primary nameserver</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 2 shows the resolver always querying the Cloudflare Secondary DNS server. </p><h3 id=\"how-does-secondary-dns-override-work\">How Does Secondary DNS Override work</h3><p>The Secondary DNS Override UI looks similar to the primary UI, the only difference is that records cannot be edited.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image3-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Orange Clouding with Secondary DNS\"><figcaption>Figure 3: Secondary DNS Override Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>In figure 3, all of the records have been transferred from the primary DNS server. test-orange and test-aaaa-orange have been overridden to proxy through the cloudflare network, while test-grey and test-mx are treated as regular DNS records. </p><p>Behind the scenes we store override records that pair with transferred records based on the name. For secondary override we don’t care about the type when overriding records, because of two things:</p><ol><li>According to <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1912#section-2.4\">RFC 1912</a> you cannot have a CNAME record with the same name as any other record. (This does not apply to some DNSSEC records, see<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181\"> RFC 2181</a>)</li><li>A and AAAA records are both address type records which should be either all proxied or all not proxied under the same name.</li></ol><p>This means if you have several A and several AAAA records all with the name “example.com”, if one of them is proxied, all of them will be proxied. The UI helps abstract the idea that we are storing additional override records through the “orange cloud” button, which when clicked, will create an override record which applies to all A/AAAA or CNAME records with that name. </p><h3 id=\"cname-at-the-apex\">CNAME at the Apex</h3><p>Normally, putting a CNAME at the apex of a zone is not allowed. For example:</p><p><code>example.com CNAME other-domain.com</code></p><p>Is not allowed because this means that there will be at least one other SOA record and one other NS record with the same name, disobeying RFC 1912 as mentioned above. Cloudflare can overcome this through the use of <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169056-CNAME-Flattening-RFC-compliant-support-for-CNAME-at-the-root\">CNAME Flattening</a>, which is a common technique used within the primary DNS product today. CNAME flattening allows us to return address records instead of the CNAME record when a query comes into our authoritative server. </p><p>Contrary to what was said above regarding the prevention of editing records through the Secondary DNS Override UI, the CNAME at the apex is the one exception to this rule. Users are able to create a CNAME at the apex in addition to the regular secondary DNS records, however the same rules defined in RFC 1912 also apply here. What this means is that the CNAME at the apex record can be treated as a regular DNS record or a proxied record, depending on what the user decides. Regardless of the proxy status of the CNAME at the apex record, it will override any other A/AAAA records that have been transferred from the primary DNS server. </p><h3 id=\"merging-secondary-override-and-cname-at-apex-records\">Merging Secondary, Override and CNAME at Apex Records</h3><p>At record edit time we do all of the merging of the secondary, override and CNAME at the apex records. This means that when a DNS request comes in to our authoritative server at the edge, we can still return the records in <a href=\"https://www.dnsperf.com/\">blazing fast times</a>. The workflow is shown in figure 4.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image4-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Orange Clouding with Secondary DNS\"><figcaption>Figure 4: Record Merging process</figcaption></figure><p>Within the zone builder the steps are as follows:</p><ol><li>Check if there is any CNAME at the apex, if so, override all other A/AAAA secondary records at the apex.</li><li>For each secondary record, check if there is a matching override record, if so, apply the proxy status of the override record to all secondary records with that name.</li><li>Leave all other secondary records as is.</li></ol><h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h3><p>Secondary DNS Override is a great option for any users that want to take advantage of the Cloudflare network, without transferring all of their zones to Cloudflare DNS as a primary provider. Security and access control can be managed on the primary side, without worrying about unauthorized edits of information on the Cloudflare side. </p><p>Secondary DNS Override is currently available on the Enterprise plan, if you’d like to take advantage of it, please let your account team know.

Full details of the breach are still pending, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1289000138300563457\">Twitter has shared</a> that the attackers stole credentials through a coordinated spear phishing attack.</p><p>The attackers convinced a team member to share login permissions, giving the attackers the ability to access the Twitter control plane. Once authenticated, they sent password reset flows to email accounts they controlled in order to hijack the Twitter accounts.</p><p>Administrative panels like Twitter’s are a rich target for phishing attacks because they give attackers a backdoor to privileged systems. Customer-facing teams at SaaS companies rely on these administrative panels to update end-user data and troubleshoot user account issues. If an attacker can compromise a single team member’s account they can potentially impact thousands of end users.</p><p>We have our own administrative panel at Cloudflare and we’ve deployed a number of safeguards over the last several years to keep it secure from phishing attacks. However, we had no way to enforce the security feature we think would most insulate us from phishing attacks: physical hard keys.</p><p>With hard keys, users can only login when they use a physical device - one that does not produce codes that could be shared over chat. Google notably <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\">eliminated all employee phishing cases</a> by rolling out their own hard keys. We issued them to every team member who had to login to our identity provider to reach the admin panel, but our identity provider allowed users to to fall back to a less secure option for MFA.</p><p>To solve that problem, we moved the hard key requirement into Cloudflare’s network. Using Cloudflare Access, we can now restrict the ability to reach our admin panel only to team members who authenticate with a hard key. Starting today, we’re making that feature available to all teams.</p><h2 id=\"securing-our-own-internal-tools\">Securing our own internal tools</h2><p>Our admin panel gives our team members the ability to turn on features, manage settings, and investigate issues for our customers. The tool itself maintains its own set of application-level permissions that control the actions that administrators can take. Some customer accounts are scoped to specific team members; other accounts cannot be modified without the customer’s explicit approval.</p><p>We layer other safeguards on top of those permissions. Users who are inactive for a number of days need to be manually re-enabled. We regularly audit who can use the tool and trim back the list.</p><p>We used to lean on a VPN to keep the front door to the admin panel secure. Team members would connect to our VPN using a client on their device. Once on the VPN, they could reach the login page of the tool.</p><p>The VPN was painful for end users and a source of concern for our security team. Two issues, in particular, motivated us to find a better solution.</p><ul><li><strong>Segmentation was difficult.</strong> Not every user in the company needs to reach the admin panel, but any user on the VPN could connect to the login page. We wanted to limit that access to users in specific permission groups as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.<br></li><li><strong>We could not add additional signals.</strong> Users could connect to the private network with just a password and MFA code. We could not limit VPN connections to corporate laptops, healthy devices, or other more granular restrictions.</li></ul><p>About two years ago, we migrated that <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/\">admin panel’s security perimeter to Cloudflare Access</a>. Access gave us a zero-trust alternative to our VPN. Instead of being able to reach the admin panel because you are on the private network, Access continuously checks every request to the tool for identity against a list of allowed users.</p><p>We could use Access to limit who could reach certain tools, and it became a foundation for adding other sources of signal down the road. Access also gave us a new level of visibility. Since all requests pass through Cloudflare’s edge, Access provides our team with visibility into every request to every path. Without making any server-side code changes, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/log-every-request-to-corporate-apps-no-code-changes-required/\">Access can log every request</a> and attribute it to an authenticated user. We can export those to our SIEM and create a comprehensive audit trail.</p><h2 id=\"hard-keys-without-weak-fallbacks\">Hard keys without weak fallbacks</h2><p>We integrated Cloudflare Access with our identity provider, which supports multifactor authentication (MFA). To login through Cloudflare Access, users would need to authenticate with their password and a MFA option. The ability to choose an option meant a less secure method could be selected.</p><p>Those fallback options were subject to a higher risk of phishing attack. SMS-based codes can be vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks. App-based time-based one-time-pin (TOTP) codes can linger on forgotten devices and, more dangerously, be transmitted as part of an attack.</p><p>Hard keys stand out because they rely on control of a physical item. With hard keys, users login with their password and then have to tap an actual key (typically in the form of a USB device). That tap presents a certificate, that only lives on the key, to the service configured to trust it. A user with the hard key could not inadvertently share that code over the phone or in a chat with an attacker.</p><p>We distribute hard keys to all team members at Cloudflare. However, we could not require team members to use them on an app-by-app basis. If I don’t have my hard key around, I always have the option to fall back to a TOTP code. We needed a filtering engine that could combine multiple sources of identity signal, which Cloudflare Access provided.</p><h2 id=\"how-cloudflare-access-solved-our-own-problem\">How Cloudflare Access solved our own problem</h2><p>If you remember going to bars or clubs before the pandemic, Cloudflare Access might seem familiar. You had to show your identity card at the door to a bouncer. The bouncer (and the establishment) did not issue that card - your government did. However, they know what it should look like and how to use its information.</p><p>Once checked, the bouncer stamped the back of your hand. You could put your ID back in your wallet and the stamp became proof that the bartenders inside knew to trust.</p><p>Cloudflare Access works like that bouncer. When users connect to a resource secured by Cloudflare Access, we check for their ID by sending them to login to their identity provider like Okta or Azure AD. Users authenticate and their identity provider sends Cloudflare Access details like who they are and, for certain providers, what MFA method they used.</p><p>Like that stamp, Cloudflare Access uses the external identity information to create a distinct badge that we trust. Access generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the user and stores it in their browser. That token becomes the user’s badge for the rest of their session. Cloudflare Access looks for that JWT on every request the user makes to the application and enforces rules that an administrator configures about who can proceed.</p><p>Cloudflare Access can store more than just the user’s identity in the JWT. If the identity provider captures the MFA method used by a team member, Access can read that value and store it as an additional field in the JWT. <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8176\">RFC 8176</a>, Authentication Method Reference Values, standardizes these values and how they are shared between systems.</p><p>We can use that standard to introduce an MFA option into the JWT created by Cloudflare Access. Access could then add an additional check that evaluated both the user’s identity and the MFA method they used to login.</p><p>The policy flexibility gave us what we needed to work with our security team to solve this problem. By adding a new rule that layers on top of the identity rule, we could immediately require that every team member logging in to our admin panel do so with their software-secured key.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Require hard key auth with Cloudflare Access\"></figure><p>In our case, that includes any hard keys supported by WebAuthN and FIDO2 or keys tied to a physical device like Apple Touch ID and Windows Hello. Access would reject the attempt if they (or an attacker) used the fallback TOTP code - even if the identity provider allowed the login.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to get started</h2><p>You can begin using the same feature our own security team needed today at no additional cost. You’ll need an identity provider that supports Authenticated Method Reference, or <code>amr</code> <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8176\">settings</a>. Today, that consists of Okta and Azure Active Directory. We expect others will add support and we will update our documentation as they do.</p><p>To get started, navigate to an application you have in Cloudflare Access or create a new one. In the rules that determine who is allowed to reach the application, add a rule in the “Require” section. Select “MFA” from the dropdown and then choose which options you want to require.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-19-at-8.59.26-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Require hard key auth with Cloudflare Access\"></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Cloudflare Access, part of Cloudflare for Teams, is available today.

We integrated your feedback about the Docs user experience and design. We reorganized and reformatted all of our content. We upgraded the Docs engine to add new UI components. The documentation is now intuitive to navigate and the content is now easy and enjoyable to read.</p><p>You can find our new and improved documentation site <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/\">here</a> and can find the docs engine on our <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-docs-engine\">repo</a>.</p><p>We hope this creates a better developer experience for you and makes the Docs more approachable to beginners. We plan to use our work and improvements for the Workers Docs to revamp docs for other Cloudflare products too.</p><p>Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the Workers Docs update.</p><p><strong>Content Organization: </strong>We reorganized site content into four categories to make it easier for you to read and find content: Tutorials, How-to guides, Technical reference, and Learning. The new content structure is heavily inspired by <a href=\"https://documentation.divio.com/\">Divio’s documentation system</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image2-workers-body.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p>The tutorials section groups together step by step guides for building a specific project on Workers (e.g. teaching a beginner how to cook). The how-to guides are a collection of examples to help developers understand and implement a specific feature of the Workers platform (e.g. a recipe in a cookbook). In the new Docs, the how-to guides section is split into the examples and starters pages. You can think of the examples as code snippets and the starters as fully completed and cloneable projects. The technical reference is a descriptive breakdown of each technical component for Workers (e.g. a reference encyclopedia article). In the new Docs, we decided to split the Reference section into three groups for Platform, Runtime APIs, and Wrangler documentation to make content easier to find. The learning section builds understanding for a specific topic or concept about the Workers platform (e.g. an article on culinary social history.)</p><p>The key insight is that by breaking content up in this way, each of the four types of documentation only has one job so it can really nail it. Plus, it makes it easier to find what you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Improved Formatting:  </strong>We added more structure and detail to our content. Here are a few examples. First, reference pages like the one for Request class now give more context with a background section explaining use cases and tips on how to use the class. We also added a table of contents to the right sidebar to make browsing through a page much easier.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image8-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p>We also cleaned up the formatting for content such as class breakdowns. This used to be done through chunky paragraphs of text. In the new Docs, each variable and parameter is listed and explained with plenty of whitespace for readability</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image5-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p>Similarly, we have improved the formatting for command breakdowns which used to be tables. It’s now easy to read through with the same list based format for class breakdowns.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p><strong>Redesigned Pages: </strong>With our Docs engine rewrite, we added new UI components and created new page designs. For instance, with the examples page, we added tags so you can sort by category. Also, the entire layout has been improved to make it easier to read and understand each example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image3-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p>Another great example is the tutorials page. We updated the page to show the difficulty and length of each tutorial. This should make the tutorials and learning how to develop on Workers more approachable for beginners. We also added new tutorials such how to manage multiple Workers projects with Lerna.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image4-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p><strong>Accurate Search:</strong> We updated the design for our Algolia docs search. The text is now easier to read and the results are prioritized better than before. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image6-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p><strong>Dark Mode: </strong>You can now customize the Docs to your liking and switch between light and dark mode. We designed these two themes to be really easy to read and visually appealing.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image7-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New and improved Workers Docs\"></figure><p>I hope this update makes using the docs a better experience for you.

As part of my onboarding as an intern on the Spectrum (a layer 4 reverse proxy) team, I learned that many internal services dogfood Spectrum, as they are exposed to the Internet and benefit from layer 4 DDoS protection. One of my first tasks was to update the configuration for an internal service that was using Spectrum. The configuration was managed in Salt (<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/manage-cloudflare-records-with-salt/\">used for configuration management at Cloudflare</a>), which was not particularly user-friendly, and required an engineer on the Spectrum team to handle updating it manually. </p><p>This process took about a week. That should instantly raise some questions, as a typical Spectrum customer can create a new Spectrum app in under a minute through Cloudflare Dashboard. So why couldn’t I? </p><p>This question formed the basis of my intern project for the summer.</p><h3 id=\"the-process\">The Process</h3><p>Cloudflare uses various IP ranges for its products. Some customers also authorize Cloudflare to announce their IP prefixes on their behalf (this is known as <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/getting-started/byoip/\">BYOIP</a>). Collectively, we can refer to these IPs as <em>managed</em> addresses. To prevent Bad Stuff (defined later) from happening, we prohibit managed addresses from being used as Spectrum origins. To accomplish this, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/\">Spectrum</a> had its own table of denied networks that included the managed addresses. For the average customer, this approach works great – they have no legitimate reason to use a managed address as an origin.</p><p>Unfortunately, the services dogfooding Spectrum all use Cloudflare IPs, preventing those teams with a legitimate use-case from creating a Spectrum app through the configuration service (i.e. Cloudflare Dashboard). To bypass this check, these <em>internal customers</em> needed to define a custom Spectrum configuration, which needed to be manually deployed to the edge via a pull request to our Salt repo, resulting in a time consuming process. </p><p>If an internal customer wanted to change their configuration, the same time consuming process must be used. While this allowed internal customers to use Spectrum, it was tedious and error prone.</p><h3 id=\"bad-stuff\">Bad Stuff</h3><p><em>Bad Stuff</em> is quite vague and deserves a better definition. It may seem arbitrary that we deny Cloudflare managed addresses. To motivate this, consider two Spectrum apps, A and B, where the origin of app A is the Cloudflare edge IP of app B, and the origin of app B is the edge IP of app A. Essentially, app A will proxy incoming connections to app B, and app B will proxy incoming connections to app A, creating a cycle. </p><p>This could potentially crash the daemon or degrade performance. In practice, this configuration is useless and would only be created by a malicious user, as the proxied connection never reaches an origin, so it is never allowed.</p>\n <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n  <img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Spectrum-loop@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"How Cloudflare uses Cloudflare Spectrum: A look into an intern’s project at Cloudflare\" />\n </figure>\n <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In fact, the more general case of setting another Spectrum app as an origin (even when the configuration does not result in a cycle) is (almost<sup><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-uses-cloudflare-spectrum-a-look-into-an-interns-project-at-cloudflare/#footnote\">1</a></sup>) never needed, so it also needs to be avoided.</p>\n <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As well, since we are providing a reverse proxy to customer origins, we do not need to allow connections to IP ranges that cannot be used on the public Internet, as specified in this <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6890\">RFC</a>.</p><h3 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem</h3><p>To improve usability and allow internal Spectrum customers to create apps using the Dashboard instead of the static configuration workflow, we needed a way to give particular customers permission to use Cloudflare managed addresses in their Spectrum configuration. Solving this problem was my main project for the internship.</p><p>A good starting point ended up being the Addressing API. The Addressing API is Cloudflare’s solution to IP management, an internal database and suite of tools to keep track of IP prefixes, with the goal of providing a unified source of truth for how IP addresses are being used across the organization. This makes it possible to provide a cross-product platform for products and features such as <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/getting-started/byoip/\">BYOIP</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/bgp/\">BGP On Demand</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit</a>.</p><p>The Addressing API keeps track of all Cloudflare managed IP prefixes, along with who owns the prefix. As well, the owner of a prefix can give permission for someone else to use the prefix. We call this a <em>delegation</em>.</p><p>A user’s permission to use an IP address managed by the Addressing API is determined as followed:</p>\n <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->\n <ol> \n  <li>Is the user the owner of the prefix containing the IP address?<br> a) Yes, the user has permission to use the IP<br> b) No, go to step 2</br></br></li> \n  <li>Has the user been delegated a prefix containing the IP address?<br> a) Yes, the user has permission to use the IP.<br> b) No, the user does not have permission to use the IP.</br></br></li> \n </ol> \n <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h3><p>With the information present in the Addressing API, the solution starts to become clear. For a given customer and IP, we use the following algorithm:</p>\n <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->\n <ol> \n  <li>Is the IP managed by Cloudflare (or contained in the previous <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6890\">RFC</a>)?<br> a) Yes, go to step 2<br> b) No, allow as origin</br></br></li> \n  <li>Does the customer have permission to use the IP address?<br> a) Yes, allow as origin<br> b) No, deny as origin</br></br></li> \n </ol> \n <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As long as the internal customer has been given permission to use the Cloudflare IP (through a delegation in the Addressing API), this approach would allow them to use it as an origin.</p><p>However, we run into a corner case here – since BYOIP customers also have permission to use their own ranges, they would be able to set their own IP as an origin, potentially causing a cycle. To mitigate this, we need to check if the IP is a Spectrum edge IP. Fortunately, the Addressing API also contains this information, so all we have to do is check if the given origin IP is already in use as a Spectrum edge IP, and if so, deny it. Since all of the denied networks checks occur in the Addressing API, we were able to remove Spectrum's own deny network database, reducing the engineering workload to maintain it along the way.</p><p>Let's go through a concrete example. Consider an internal customer who wants to use 104.16.8.54/32 as an origin for their Spectrum app. This address is managed by Cloudflare, and suppose the customer has permission to use it, and the address is not already in use as an edge IP. This means the customer is able to specify this IP as an origin, since it meets all of our criteria.</p><p>For example, a request to the Addressing API could look like this:</p>\n <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>curl --silent 'https://addr-api.internal/edge_services/spectrum/validate_origin_ip_acl?cidr=104.16.8.54/32' -H \"Authorization: Bearer $JWT\" | jq .\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"errors\": [],\n  \"result\": {\n    \"allowed_origins\": {\n      \"104.16.8.54/32\": {\n        \"allowed\": true,\n        \"is_managed\": true,\n        \"is_delegated\": true,\n        \"is_reserved\": false,\n        \"has_binding\": false\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"messages\": []\n}\n</code></pre> \n <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now we have completely moved the responsibility of validating the use of origin IP addresses from Spectrum’s configuration service to the Addressing API.</p><h3 id=\"performance\">Performance</h3><p>This approach required making another HTTP request on the critical path of every create app request in the Spectrum configuration service. Some basic performance testing showed (as expected) increased response times for the API call (about 100ms). This led to discussion among the Spectrum team about the performance impact of different HTTP requests throughout the critical path. To investigate, we decided to use OpenTracing. </p><p><a href=\"https://opentracing.io/\">OpenTracing</a> is a standard for providing distributed tracing of microservices. When an HTTP request is received, special headers are added to it to allow it to be traced across the different services. Within a given trace, we can see how long a SQL query took, the time a function took to complete, the amount of time a request spent at a given service, and more.</p><p>We have been deploying a tracing system for our services to provide more visibility into a complex system.</p><p>After instrumenting the Spectrum config service with OpenTracing, we were able to determine that the Addressing API accounted for a very small amount of time in the overall request, and allowed us to identify potentially problematic request times to other services.</p>\n <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n  <img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-14.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"How Cloudflare uses Cloudflare Spectrum: A look into an intern’s project at Cloudflare\" />\n </figure><h3 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h3><p>Reading documentation is important! Having a good understanding of how the Addressing API and the config service worked allowed me to create and integrate an endpoint that made sense for my use-case.</p><p>Writing documentation is just as important. For the final part of my project, I had to onboard <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-crossbow-lessons-from-refactoring-a-large-scale-internal-tool/\">Crossbow</a> – an internal Cloudflare tool used for diagnostics – to Spectrum, using the new features I had implemented. I had written an onboarding guide, but some stuff was unclear during the onboarding process, so I made sure to gather feedback from the Crossbow team to improve the guide.</p><p>Finally, I learned not to underestimate the amount of complexity required to implement relatively simple validation logic. In fact, the implementation required understanding the entire system. This includes how multiple microservices work together to validate the configuration and understanding how the data is moved from the Core to the Edge, and then processed there. I found increasing my understanding of this system to be just as important and rewarding as completing the project.</p>\n <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a id=\"footnote\"></a>Footnotes:</p>\n <!--kg-card-end: html-->\n <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a title=\"Regional Services\" href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-regional-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Regional Services</a> actually makes use of proxying a Spectrum connection to another colocation, and then proxying to the origin, but the configuration plane is not involved in this setup.</p>\n <!--kg-card-end: html--></img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":1732,"bgimg":"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Dogfooding-Spectrum@2x-1.png","linkMd5":"b646d38d4295bc9f12cb7e944eb09383","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn14@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-37-53-921_294d011f16214ac7.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":913,"sourceBytes":100043,"destBytes":30956,"author":"Ryan Jacobs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Dogfooding-Spectrum@2x-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn14@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-37-53-921_294d011f16214ac7.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Dogfooding-Spectrum@2x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn13@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-37-57-621_229b187246fb8977.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/Spectrum-loop@2x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-37-58-178_ca2d50ae168b6d53.webp","https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-14.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn50@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-37-57-239_fe625b1273b04fe0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279873542},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:37:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:37:53","title":"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless","link":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-magic-reimagining-developer-experiences-for-the-world-of-serverless/","description":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/Serverless-Week-Finale@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-30-at-9.40.28-PM.png\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"><p>This week we’ve talked about how Workers provides a step function improvement in the TTFB (time to first byte) of applications, by running lightweight isolates in over 200 cities around the world, free of cold starts. Today I’m going to talk about another metric, one that’s arguably even more important: TTFD, or time to first dopamine, and announce a huge improvement to the Workers development experience — <code>wrangler dev</code>, our edge-based development environment with all the perks of a local environment. </p><p>There’s nothing quite like the rush of getting your first few lines of code to work — no matter how many times you’ve done it before, there's something so magical about the computer understanding exactly what you wanted it to do and doing it! </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/Hello-World--@2x--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>This is the kind of magic I expected of “serverless”, and while it’s true that most serverless offerings today get you to that feeling faster than setting up a virtual server ever would, I still can’t help but be disappointed with how lackluster developing with most serverless platforms is today. </p><p>Some of my disappointment can be attributed to the leaky nature of the abstraction: the journey to getting you to the point of writing code is drawn out by forced decision making about servers (regions, memory allocation, etc). Servers, however, are not the only thing holding developers back from getting to the delightful magical feeling in the serverless world today. </p><p>The “serverless” experience on AWS Lambda today looks like this: between configuring the right access policy to invoke my own test application, and deciding whether an HTTP or REST API was better suited for my needs, 30 minutes had easily passed, and I still didn’t have a URL I could call to invoke my application. I did, however, spin up five different services, and was already worrying about cleaning them up lest I be charged for them. </p><p>That doesn’t feel like magic!</p><p>In building what we believe to be the serverless platform of the future — a promise that feels very magical —  we wanted to bring back that magical feeling to every step of the development journey. If serverless is about empowering developers, then they should be empowered every step of the way: from proof of concept to MVP and beyond.</p><p>We’re excited to share with you today our approach to making our developer experience delightful — we recognize we still have plenty of room to continue to grow and innovate (and we can’t wait to tell you about everything we have currently in the works as well!), but we’re proud of all the progress we’ve made in making Workers the easiest development platform for developers to use.</p><h2 id=\"defining-developer-experience-\">Defining “developer experience”</h2><p>To get us started, let’s look at what the journey of a developer entails. Today, we’ll be defining the user experience as the following four stages: </p><ul><li>Getting started: All the steps we have to take before putting in some keystrokes</li><li>Iteration: Does my code do what I expect it to do? What do I need to do to get it there?</li><li>Release: I’ve tested what I can -- time to hit the big red button!</li><li>Observe: Is anything broken? And how do I fix it?</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/developer-Experience-0@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>When approaching each stage of development, we wanted to reimagine the experience, the way that we’ve always wanted our development flow to work, and fix places along the way where existing platforms have let us down.</p><h2 id=\"zero-to-hello-world\">Zero to Hello World</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/developer-Experience-2@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>With Workers, we want to get you to that aforementioned delightful feeling as quickly as possible, and remove every obstacle in the way of writing and deploying your code. The first deployment experience is really important — if you’ve done it once and haven’t given up along the way, you can do it again. </p><p>We’re very proud to say our TTFD — even for a new user without a Cloudflare account -- is as low as three minutes. If you’re an existing customer, you can have your first Worker running in <em>seconds. </em>No regions to choose, no IAM rules to configure, and no API Gateways to set up or worry about paying for. </p><p>If you’re new to Workers and still trying to get a feel for it, you can instantly deploy your Worker to 200 cities around the world within seconds, with the simple click of a button. </p><p>If you’ve already decided on Workers as the choice for building your next application, we want to make you feel at home by allowing you to use all of your favorite IDEs, be it vim or emacs or VSCode (we don’t care!). </p><p>With the release of <code>wrangler</code> — the official command-line tool for Workers, getting started is just as easy as: </p><pre><code>wrangler generate hello\ncd hello\nwrangler publish</code></pre><p>Again, in seconds your code is up and running, and easily accessible all over the world. </p><p>“Hello, World!”, of course, doesn’t have to be quite so literal. We provide a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials\">range of tutorials</a> to help get you started and get familiar with developing with Workers. </p><p>To save you that last bit of time in getting started, our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/templates/\">template gallery</a> provides starter templates so you can dive straight into building the products you’re excited about -- whether it’s a new <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/templates/pages/graphql_server\">GraphQL server</a> or a brand new <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/templates/pages/sites/\">static site</a>, we’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id=\"local-ish-development-code-test-repeat\">Local(ish) development: code, test, repeat</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/developer-Experience-3@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>We can’t promise to get the code right on your behalf, but we can promise to do everything we can to get you the feedback you need to help you get your code right.</p><p>The development journey requires lots of experimentation, trial and error, and debugging. If my Computer Science degree came with instructions on the back of the bottle, they would read: “code, print, repeat.” </p><p>Getting code right is an extremely iterative, feedback-driven process. We would all love to get code right the first time around and move on, but the reality is, computers are bad mind-readers, and you’ve ended up with an extraneous parenthesis or a stray comma in your JSON, so your code is not going to run. Found where the loose parenthesis was introduced? Great! Now your code is running, but the output is not right — time to go find that off-by-one error. </p><p>Local development has traditionally been the way for developers to get a tight feedback loop during the development process. The crucial components that make up an effective local development environment and make it a great testing ground are: fast feedback loop, its sandboxed nature (ability to develop without affecting production), and accuracy.</p><p>As we started thinking about accomplishing all three of those goals, we realized that being local actually wasn’t itself a requirement — <em>speed</em> is the real requirement, and running on the client is the only way acceptable speed for a good-enough feedback loop could be achieved. </p><p>One option was to provide a traditional local development environment, but one thing didn’t sit well with us: we wanted to provide a local development environment for the Workers runtime, however, we knew there was more to handling a request than just the runtime, which could compromise accuracy. We didn’t want to set our users up to fail with code that works on their machine but not ours. </p><p>Shipping the rest of our edge infrastructure to the user would pose its own challenges of keeping it up to date, and it would require the user to install hundreds of unnecessary dependencies, all potentially to end up with the most frustrating experience of all: running into some installation bug the explanation to which couldn’t be found on StackOverflow. This experience didn’t sit right with us. </p><p>As it turns out, this is a very similar problem to one we commonly solve for our customers: Running code on the client is fast, but it doesn’t give me the control I need; running code on the server gives me the control I need, but it requires a slow round-trip to the origin. All we had to do was take our own advice and run it on the edge! It’s the best of both worlds: your code runs so close to your end user that you get the same performance as running it on the client, without having to lose control. </p><p>To provide developers access to this tight feedback loop, we introduced <code>wrangler dev</code> earlier this year! </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/wrangler-dev.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p><code>wrangler dev</code>  has the look and feel of a local development environment: it runs on localhost but tunnels to the edge, and provides output directly to your favorite IDE of choice. Since <code>wrangler dev</code> now runs on the edge, it works on your machine and ours exactly the same! </p><p>Our <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/releases/tag/v1.11.0-rc.0\">release candidate</a> for <code>wrangler dev</code> is live and waiting for you to take it for a test drive, as easily as:</p><pre><code>npm i @cloudflare/wrangler@beta -g</code></pre><p>Let us know what you think.</p><h2 id=\"release\">Release</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/developer-Experience-4@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>After writing all the code, testing every edge case imaginable, and going through code review, at some point the code needs to be released for the rest of the world to reap the fruits of your hard labor and enjoy the features you’ve built. </p><p>For smaller, quick applications, it’s exciting to hit the “Save &#38; deploy” button and let fate take the wheel. </p><p>For production level projects, however, the process of deploying to production may be a bit different. Different organizations adopt different processes for code release. For those using GitHub, last year we introduced our <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-cloudflare-workers-with-wrangler\">GitHub Action</a>, to make it easy to configure an integrated release process. </p><p>With Wrangler, you can configure Workers to deploy using your existing CI, to automate deployments, and minimize human intervention.</p><p>When deploying to production, again, feedback becomes extremely important. Some platforms today still take as long as a few minutes to deploy your code. A few minutes may seem trivial, but a few minutes of nervously refreshing, wondering whether your code is live yet, and which version of your code your users are seeing is stressful. This is especially true in a rollback or a bug-fix situation where you want the new version to be live ASAP. </p><p>New Workers are deployed globally in less than five seconds, which means new changes are instantaneous. Better yet, since Workers runs on lightweight isolates, newly deployed Workers don’t experience dreaded <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-workers-uses-tls-handshakes-to-achieve-0ms-cold-starts/\">cold starts</a>, which means you can release code as frequently as you’re able to ship it, without having to invest additional time in auxiliary gadgets to pre-warm your Worker — more time for you to start working on your next feature!</p><h2 id=\"observe-resolve\">Observe &#38; Resolve </h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/developer-Experience-5@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>The big red button has been pushed. Dopamine has been replaced with adrenaline: the instant question on your mind is: “Did I break anything? And if so, what, and how do I fix it?” These questions are at the core of what the industry calls “observability”. </p><p>There are different ways things can break and incidents can manifest themselves: increases in errors, drops in traffic, even a drop in performance could be considered a regression. </p><p>To identify these kinds of issues, you need to be able to spot a trend. Raw data, however, is not a very useful medium for spotting trends — humans simply cannot parse raw lines of logs to identify a subtle increase in errors. </p><p>This is why we took a two-punch approach to helping developers identify and fix issues: exposing trend data through analytics, while also providing the ability to tail production logs for forensics and investigation. </p><p>Earlier this year, we introduced <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/metrics/\">Workers Metrics</a>: an easy way for developers to identify trends in their production traffic. </p><p>With requests metrics, you can easily spot any increases in errors, or drastic changes in traffic patterns after a given release:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/Workers___Account___Cloudflare_-_Web_Performance___Security.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>Additionally, sometimes new code can introduce unforeseen regressions in the overall performance of the application. With CPU time metrics, our developers are now able to spot changes in the performance of their Worker, as well as use that information to guide and optimize their code.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/Workers___Account___Cloudflare_-_Web_Performance___Security--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>Once you’ve identified a regression, we wanted to provide the tools needed to find your bug and fix it, which is why we also recently launched `wrangler tail`: production logs in a single command. </p><p><code>wrangler tail</code> can help diagnose where code is failing or why certain customers are getting unexpected outcomes because it exposes <code>console.log()</code> output and exceptions. By having access to this output, developers can immediately diagnose, fix, and resolve any issues occurring in production.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/07/output2--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless\"></figure><p>We know how precious every moment can be when a bad code deploy impacts customer traffic.

Attacks with high bit rates attempt to saturate the Internet link, and attacks with high packet rates attempt to overwhelm the routers or other in-line hardware devices.</p><p>Similar to Q1, the majority of L3/4 DDoS attacks that we observed in Q2 were also relatively ‘small’ with regards to the scale of Cloudflare’s network. In Q2, nearly 90% of all L3/4 DDoS attacks that we saw peaked below 10 Gbps. Small attacks that peak below 10 Gbps can still easily cause an outage to most of the websites and Internet properties around the world if they are not protected by a cloud-based DDoS mitigation service.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><p>Similarly, from a packet rate perspective, 76% of all L3/4 DDoS attacks in Q2 peaked up to 1 million packets per second (pps). Typically, a 1 Gbps Ethernet interface can deliver anywhere between 80k to 1.5M pps. Assuming the interface also serves legitimate traffic, and that most organizations have much less than a 1 Gbps interface, you can see how even these ‘small’ packet rate DDoS attacks can easily take down Internet properties.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><p>In terms of duration, 83% of all attacks lasted between 30 to 60 minutes. We saw a similar trend in Q1 with 79% of attacks falling in the same duration range. This may seem like a short duration, but imagine this as a 30 to 60 minute cyber battle between your security team and the attackers. Now it doesn’t seem so short. Additionally, if a DDoS attack creates an outage or service degradation, the recovery time to reboot your appliances and relaunch your services can be much longer; costing you lost revenue and reputation for every minute. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><h3 id=\"in-q2-we-saw-the-largest-ddos-attacks-on-our-network-ever\">In Q2, we saw the largest DDoS attacks on our network, ever</h3><p>This quarter, we saw an increasing number of large scale attacks; both in terms of packet rate and bit rate. In fact, 88% of all DDoS attacks in 2020 that peaked above 100 Gbps were launched after shelter-in-place went into effect in March. Once again, May was not just the busiest month with the most number of attacks, but also the greatest number of large attacks above 100 Gbps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/BDES-831_DDoS_Report_Q2-20_Infographic_Blog_6_V2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><p>From the packet perspective, June took the lead with a whopping <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-a-754-million-pps-ddos-attack-automatically/\">754 million pps attack</a>. Besides that attack, the maximum packet rates stayed mostly consistent throughout the quarter with around 200 million pps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><p>The 754 million pps attack was automatically detected and mitigated by Cloudflare. The attack was part of an organized four-day campaign that lasted from June 18 to the 21. As part of the campaign, attack traffic from over 316,000 IP addresses targeted a single Cloudflare IP address.</p><p>Cloudflare’s DDoS protection systems automatically detected and mitigated the attack, and due to the size and global coverage of our network, there was no impact to performance. A global interconnected network is crucial when mitigating large attacks in order to be able to absorb the attack traffic and mitigate it close to the source, whilst also continuing serving legitimate customer traffic without inducing latency or service interruptions.</p><h3 id=\"the-united-states-is-targeted-with-the-most-attacks\">The United States is targeted with the most attacks</h3><p>When we look at the L3/4 DDoS attack distribution by country, our data centers in the United States received the most number of attacks (22.6%), followed by Germany (4.4%), Canada (2.7%) and Great Britain (2.6%).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><p>However when we look at the total attack bytes mitigated by each Cloudflare data center, the United States still leads (34.9%), but followed by Hong Kong (6.6%), Russia (6.5%), Germany (4.5%) and Colombia (3.7%). The reason for this change is due to the total amount of bandwidth that was generated in each attack. For instance, while Hong Kong did not make it to the top 10 list due to the relatively small number of attacks that was observed in Hong Kong (1.8%), the attacks were highly volumetric and generated so much attack traffic that pushed Hong Kong to the 2nd place.</p><p>When analyzing L3/4 DDoS attacks, we bucket the traffic by the Cloudflare edge data center locations and not by the location of the source IP. The reason is when attackers launch L3/4 attacks they can ‘spoof’ (alter) the source IP address in order to obfuscate the attack source. If we were to derive the country based on a spoofed source IP, we would get a spoofed country. Cloudflare is able to overcome the challenges of spoofed IPs by displaying the attack data by the location of Cloudflare’s data center in which the attack was observed. We’re able to achieve geographical accuracy in our report because we have data centers in over 200 cities around the world. </p><h3 id=\"57-of-all-l3-4-ddos-attacks-in-q2-were-syn-floods\">57% of all L3/4 DDoS attacks in Q2 were SYN floods</h3><p>An attack vector is a term used to describe the attack method. In Q2, we observed an increase in the number of vectors used by attackers in L3/4 DDoS attacks. A total of 39 different types of attack vectors were used in Q2, compared to 34 in Q1. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/\">SYN floods</a> formed the majority with over 57% in share, followed by RST (13%), <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/\">UDP</a> (7%), <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-reflections/\">CLDAP</a> (6%) and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ssdp-100gbps/\">SSDP</a> (3%) attacks. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image1-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attack trends for Q2 2020\"></figure><p>SYN flood attacks aim to exploit the handshake process of a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/\">TCP</a> connection. By repeatedly sending initial connection request packets with a synchronize flag (SYN), the attacker attempts to overwhelm the router’s connection table that tracks the state of TCP connections. The router replies with a packet that contains a synchronized acknowledgment flag (SYN-ACK), allocates a certain amount of memory for each given connection and falsely waits for the client to respond with a final acknowledgment (ACK). Given a sufficient number of SYNs that occupy the router’s memory, the router is unable to allocate further memory for legitimate clients causing a denial of service. </p><p>No matter the attack vector, Cloudflare automatically detects and mitigates stateful or stateless DDoS attacks using our 3 pronged protection approach comprising of our home-built DDoS protection systems:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-gatebot-a-bot-that-allows-us-to-sleep/\"><strong>Gatebot</strong></a> - Cloudflare's centralized DDoS protection systems for detecting and mitigating globally distributed volumetric DDoS attacks.

As we look to the upcoming 2020 U.S. elections, we are reminded that having the Internet be trusted, secure, reliable, and accessible for campaigns and citizens alike is critical to our democracy. We rely on the Internet to share and discover pertinent information such as how to register to vote, find polling locations, or learn more about candidates.</p><p>Due to the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing a number of election environments shift online, to varying degrees, with political parties conducting virtual fundraisers, campaigns moving town halls to online platforms and election officials using online forms to facilitate voting by mail. As the 2020 U.S. elections approach, we want to ensure that players in the election space have the tools they need to stay online to promote trust and confidence in the democratic system.</p><p>We’re keeping an eye on how this shift to online activities affect cyberattacks. From April to June 2020, for example, we saw a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/network-layer-ddos-attack-trends-for-q2-2020/\">trend</a> of increasing DDoS attacks, with double the amount of L3/4 attacks observed over our network compared to the first three months of 2020. In the election space, we are tracking trends and vulnerabilities to better understand the threats against these critical players. Our goal is to use the information to create best practices for election and campaign officials so they can be better prepared for the upcoming elections.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>When comparing types of attacks against campaigns and government election sites, we saw the exact inverse type of attacks with political campaigns experiencing more DDoS attacks while government sites experiencing more attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities.</li><li>On average, state and local government election sites experience 122,475 cyber threats per day with an average of 199 SQL injection attempts per day.</li><li>On average, political campaigns experience 4,949 cyber threats per day, although larger campaigns may see far more. </li></ul><h3 id=\"the-athenian-project-cloudflare-for-campaigns-participants\">The Athenian Project &#38; Cloudflare for Campaigns Participants</h3><p>Since 2020, the number of domains under the Athenian Project has increased by 48 percent, to 229 state and local government election websites in 28 states receiving our security protections. Cloudflare also protects many political campaigns at all levels on a wide range of plans. Under<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-for-campaigns/\"> Cloudflare for Campaigns,</a> an initiative we launched in January 2020 to provide a free package of security protections to political campaigns with our partnership with<a href=\"https://www.defendcampaigns.org/\"> Defending Digital Campaigns</a>, we protect more than 50 political campaigns from candidates in 27 states.</p><h3 id=\"significant-traffic-spikes-and-probing-for-vulnerabilities-to-government-election-websites\">Significant traffic spikes and probing for vulnerabilities to government election websites</h3><p>For state and local governments, election night and the days leading up that day are typically the most important days of the year. With constituents accessing voter information such as voting and polling stations, election officials expect higher amounts of traffic to their website. Over the last few months, we’ve seen this shift at Cloudflare, with noticeable increases in traffic ranging from 2 to 3 times the volume of requests to many of these government election websites. We believe there are a wide range of factors for traffic spikes including, but not limited to, states expanding vote-by-mail initiatives and voter registration <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/501577-heres-where-your-state-stands-on-mail-in-voting\">deadlines</a> due to emergency orders by 53 states and territories throughout the United States.

Since the beginning of this year, we’ve seen a large number of attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities that were mitigated by the web application firewall (WAF), with 90 million threats blocked in March 2020, for example. Cloudflare’s WAF uses managed rulesets to offer a wide range of protection against known vulnerabilities and suspicious behavior and custom firewall rules to allow users to rapidly identify and adapt to the evolving threat landscape. Of the threats we identified, managed rulesets helped mitigate 51% of threats and custom firewall rules mitigated an additional 35% of threats. Having both managed rulesets and custom firewall rules therefore helps safeguard election information. </p><p>In previous <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/dhs-fbi-say-election-systems-in-50-states-were-targeted-in-2016/\">elections</a>, attackers have used SQL injections against government election websites to attempt to extract information. We therefore did a deeper dive on those types of attacks, to understand if these threats are being conducted leading up to the 2020 election. We identified a number of SQL injection threats that were blocked by Cloudflare, with an average of 43,884 attempts per day across all domains under the Athenian Project. SQL injection attacks are commonly attempted against government election sites, with the WAF blocking an average of 199 SQL injection threats per day. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image2-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Election Cybersecurity: Preparing for the 2020 U.S. Elections.\"></figure><h3 id=\"political-campaigns-have-experienced-more-ddos-attacks\">Political Campaigns have experienced more DDoS attacks</h3><p>When looking at the ecosystem of election security, political campaigns can be soft targets for cyberattacks due to the inability to dedicate resources to sophisticated cybersecurity protections. Campaigns are typically short-term, cash strapped operations that do not have an IT staff or budget necessary to promote long term security strategies.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of the threats around political campaigns, we surveyed 80 U.S. federal political campaigns on a range of Cloudflare plans from Cloudflare for Campaigns to our self serve plans. Cloudflare has mitigated a total of 77,192,840 threats on these sites since January 2020. That means that, on average, these sites saw 4,949 threats per day from January 2020 to present.  In general, we see larger scale attacks against Senate candidate’s sites than those of House candidates.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image4-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Election Cybersecurity: Preparing for the 2020 U.S. Elections.\"></figure><p>As the election season has progressed, we’ve also seen an increase in the average number of attacks against political campaigns, with a 187% increase from May to June 2020. As face to face campaigning is not an option, campaigns now rely on online platforms such as video conferencing software, online fundraising and social media to reach voters. This can present significant cybersecurity challenges to already vulnerable groups, such as political campaigns. Political campaigns are realizing the importance of cybersecurity services and have begun working with state parties and committees on training on the types of <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-03/campaigns-grapple-with-how-to-manage-cybersecurity-in-2020\">cyber threats</a> and widely available resources for campaigns. With basic cybersecurity hygiene training on issues such as password security, two factor authentication, identifying phishing scams, network protection, internal application security and social media privacy, campaign staff are less likely to be the victims of a data breach.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/image3-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Election Cybersecurity: Preparing for the 2020 U.S. Elections.\"></figure><p>There has been a notable amount of DDoS activity against political campaign websites. DDoS attacks, which can be cheap, easy to organize and highly destructive, are often <a href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/ddos-democratic-campaigns-primary-dnc-dccc/\">used</a> for targeting political campaigns. A DDoS attack that takes down a campaign's website during critical times can severely disadvantage a website. Campaigns used rate limiting to address 63% of the cyber threats they experienced, suggesting that DDoS attacks remain a significant concern.</p><h3 id=\"securing-elections-in-2020\">Securing Elections in 2020</h3><p>Democracies rely on access to information and trust in government institutions, especially during a crisis. Reflecting this reality, elections officials are more aware and focused on reliability and resilience than ever before. Likewise, political campaigns are increasingly aware of the potential risks of DDoS activity and other cyber threats.</p><p>As COVID-19 continues to spread, it puts further pressure on ensuring that the Internet can be used to access and share election information. At Cloudflare, we believe that expanding access to tools that election officials and political candidates need to combat a range of online threats both serves our mission to help build a better Internet and strengthens our democracy.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 12:30:00
