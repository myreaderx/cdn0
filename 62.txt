Construction of a large-scale mechanistic model of <I>Escherichia coli</I> enabled us to integrate and cross-evaluate a massive, heterogeneous dataset based on measurements reported by various groups over decades. We identified inconsistencies with functional consequences across the data, including that the total output of the ribosomes and RNA polymerases described by data are not sufficient for a cell to reproduce measured doubling times, that measured metabolic parameters are neither fully compatible with each other nor with overall growth, and that essential proteins are absent during the cell cycle&#8212;and the cell is robust to this absence. Finally, considering these data as a whole leads to successful predictions of new experimental outcomes, in this case protein half-lives.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:39:01 +0000","feedId":62,"bgimg":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6502/eaav3751/F1.large.jpg","linkMd5":"9052f4023709704f9dd0c10d96e598fa","metaImg":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6502/eaav3751/F1.large.jpg","author":"Macklin, D.

Despite their pervasiveness, whether they are active on any targets has not been systematically explored. We computed the likelihood that approved excipients would bind to molecular targets. Testing in vitro revealed 25 excipient activities, ranging from low-nanomolar to high-micromolar concentration. Another 109 activities were identified by testing against clinical safety targets. In cellular models, five excipients had fingerprints predictive of system-level toxicity. Exposures of seven excipients were investigated, and in certain populations, two of these may reach levels of in vitro target potency, including brain and gut exposure of thimerosal and its major metabolite, which had dopamine D3 receptor dissociation constant <I>K</I><SUB>d</SUB> values of 320 and 210 nM, respectively. Although most excipients deserve their status as inert, many approved excipients may directly modulate physiologically relevant targets.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:39:01 +0000","feedId":62,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c9925d413db7675bb95c633185eb58bb","metaImg":"","author":"Pottel, J., Armstrong, D., Zou, L., Fekete, A., Huang, X.-P., Torosyan, H., Bednarczyk, D., Whitebread, S., Bhhatarai, B., Liang, G., Jin, H., Ghaemi, S.

We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:39:01 +0000","feedId":62,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2ea6598e0fabbbaa67ef2e9e1d746f01","metaImg":"","author":"Walker, P.

We generated genome-wide data for 93 ancient Caribbean islanders dating between 3200 and 400 calibrated years before the present and found evidence of at least three separate dispersals into the region, including two early dispersals into the Western Caribbean, one of which seems connected to radiation events in North America. This was followed by a later expansion from South America. We also detected genetic differences between the early settlers and the newcomers from South America, with almost no evidence of admixture. Our results add to our understanding of the initial peopling of the Caribbean and the movements of Archaic Age peoples in the Americas.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:39:01 +0000","feedId":62,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b3afa32d731acf4da2bf88e9d8728c49","metaImg":"","author":"Na&#x0308;gele, K., Posth, C., Iraeta Orbegozo, M., Chinique de Armas, Y., Hernandez Godoy, S.

We recovered viral sequences from 13 northern European individuals, including 11 dated to ~600&#8211;1050 CE, overlapping the Viking Age, and reconstructed near-complete variola virus genomes for four of them. The samples predate the earliest confirmed smallpox cases by ~1000 years, and the sequences reveal a now-extinct sister clade of the modern variola viruses that were in circulation before the eradication of smallpox. We date the most recent common ancestor of variola virus to ~1700 years ago. Distinct patterns of gene inactivation in the four near-complete sequences show that different evolutionary paths of genotypic host adaptation resulted in variola viruses that circulated widely among humans.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:39:01 +0000","feedId":62,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f5eeb32b239780218d6419af2208f31a","metaImg":"","author":"Mu&#x0308;hlemann, B., Vinner, L., Margaryan, A., Wilhelmson, H., de la Fuente Castro, C., Allentoft, M.
