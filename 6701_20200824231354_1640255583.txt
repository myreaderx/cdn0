Our worst expectations for a coarsened body politic have come to pass. It’s gotten ugly out there. On the one hand, we can all acknowledge that Trump’s campaign has given voice to the millions of Americans displaced and discouraged by a generation’s worth of changes in trade policy and technology that left them essentially derailed, even as “coastal elites” continued to thrive. On the other hand, did they have to pick Donald Trump as their flag bearer?</p>\n<p>It was in this frame of mind that I read with interest the recent NY TIMES article, “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-national-convention.html\">Corporations Grow Nervous About Participating in Republican Convention</a>.”</p>\n<p>If asked by a client whether to sponsor the GOP convention, my response would be a hearty “NFW.” To be affiliated with that crass show of mean-spiritedness would never be worthwhile. But you probably already knew that I was a card-carrying Obama voter, so maybe that doesn’t surprise you? </p>\n<p>The thing is, I’d offer the same advice to brands considering a sponsorship of the DNC Convention.</p>\n<p>I believe that more than ever before, political interests that publicly intersect with corporate branding represent an increasingly bad idea. America has achieved historic levels of partisanship; the chart at the top of this post shows this trend, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/\">via Pew Research</a>. Allying yourself with Democrats or Republicans risks vilification by the opposing side. Trying to split the difference by appealing to both parties is seen as wishy-washy (at best). It’s a lose-lose for brands.</p>\n<p>As you no doubt recall, two weeks ago Microsoft unleased an Artificial Intelligence bot on Twitter, and within 24-hours it had gone from tweeting empowering messages like “Humans are awesome!” to “Hitler was right, I hate the Jews.” The actual story behind the AI bot’s descent into hell is a bit more complicated than the headlines would have you believe, but it’s a telling signal that should be heard by brands worldwide. “Online America” is in a dark mood right now. It feels like our national soul hangs in the balance. It’s not the right time to pick sides. It’s not the right time to start hawking potato chips.</p>\n<p>For brands, it’s probably time to sit on the sidelines when it comes to political brand connections.

Choosing who those people are and who they collectively can be is a daunting challenge overall, but impossible without knowing what you stand for. That&#8217;s why core values are so important. At SHIFT, our core values are part of employee reviews. They&#8217;re part of monthly team meetings, when team leaders recognize accomplishments by their team members aligned with each of the values. They&#8217;re part of our hiring process, and candidates are evaluated based on how aligned they are with the values of the firm &#8211; and we&#8217;ve turned down many, many people who look good on paper but they weren&#8217;t going to be a good fit based on values.</p>\n<p>Core values help you to implement the essence of strategy: knowing what to say no to. Without them, you&#8217;re a car without a GPS, and you&#8217;re just as likely to drive into a bad neighborhood as you are to get where you want to go.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about what the values mean, read this series by SHIFT Senior Vice President Catherine Allen on each of the values and how we interpret them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-honorable/\">Honorable</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-dedicated/\">Dedicated</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-connected/\">Connected</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-creative/\">Creative</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-ballsy/\">Ballsy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-positive/\">Positive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/core-values-smart/\">Smart</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want &#8220;the secret sauce&#8221; to longevity as a business, it&#8217;s adhering to values like these, especially when the temptation to do something easier or more profitable arises.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=D2qNcAbLAdI:95XziZhJnvg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=D2qNcAbLAdI:95XziZhJnvg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=D2qNcAbLAdI:95XziZhJnvg:W9dqtTZ0I2U\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/D2qNcAbLAdI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 May 2013 12:29:34 +0000","feedId":6701,"bgimg":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7288/8722114501_da49748c88_m.jpg","linkMd5":"1521d5493655ba60c874a274af4c7e6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-11-52-391_d4bd01ce7b58e7f3.webp","destWidth":158,"destHeight":240,"sourceBytes":13728,"destBytes":5696,"author":"cpenn","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7288/8722114501_da49748c88_m.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-11-52-391_d4bd01ce7b58e7f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn85@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-11-54-149_3ce7c01f1f70fff6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn53@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-11-54-014_aa3ad4895192e821.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-11-54-074_9fbef25ee7ba3941.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/D2qNcAbLAdI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn66@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-11-53-988_314dfa68275f1364.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310712149},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:11:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:11:52","title":"Did early bloggers make a difference?","link":"http://www.pr-squared.com/?p=4942","description":"<p><img src=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/t_defren-200x265.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"7\" alt=\"Todd Defren\" />As is his wont, Tom Foremski has <a href=\"http://www.pr-squared.com/index.php/2006/05/the_social_media_press_release\">once again inspired me</a> to take (digital) pen to (virtual) paper; this time in response to his recent, somewhat wistful article: “<a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blogging-failed-to-challenge-mainstream-media-7000024474/\">Blogging failed to challenge mainstream media</a>.” I have seen various responses to Tom’s post, the key theme being: “did we (early bloggers) make a difference?” It’s easy to suggest, for example, that the recent rise in a brand’s need to use paid media strategies to gain more visibility and engagement is yet another sign that the good guys lost; that the Cluetrain ran off the tracks.</p>\n<p>Did it?

For example, our house in California has been empty for a good, long while. We had the genius idea to have the place remodeled while we were still living in Boston.  “We’ll move back to our dream home!”  The contractor agreed time-and-again, all along the way, that he’d be all finished up in time… Fast forward to today: we are still a couple of weeks out from completion. Now, despite the fact that we love all the work that’s been done, we’re still upset. Every subcontractor that walks in the door is a reminder that he shoulda been done with XYZ project weeks ago; why is he still here, why is any one of ‘em still here, still not done?</p>\n<p>I won’t bore you with the details of the situation or how we’re handling it… it just occurred to me that “I would never run my business this way,” which led me to remember that we quite specifically talk about this “Underpromise, Overdeliver” concept in our training at the agency.  That is not to say that there are never disappointments, or that sometimes we don’t get overeager about an idea that ultimately doesn’t zing like we’d hoped. It just means we try to plan for failure, to adjust for it, and to make up for it when possible.  The goal is “surprise and delight” vs. “overpromise and underdeliver.”</p>\n<p>The gulf between a “wow” and a “sigh” is not easily bridged.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=ZqOE5XvMapQ:1h_PFKUlOyE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=ZqOE5XvMapQ:1h_PFKUlOyE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=ZqOE5XvMapQ:1h_PFKUlOyE:W9dqtTZ0I2U\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/ZqOE5XvMapQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2013 17:35:28 +0000","feedId":6701,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c6c96d2f48062eac79d4f7b740ae306f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Todd Defren","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.pr-squared.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/100381000-300x225.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn85@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-11-54-149_3ce7c01f1f70fff6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn53@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-11-54-014_aa3ad4895192e821.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-11-54-074_9fbef25ee7ba3941.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/ZqOE5XvMapQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-11-53-970_da3e8ecec5953c7b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598310712149},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:11:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:11:52","title":"Nibbling at the Apple","link":"http://www.pr-squared.com/?p=4920","description":"<p><a title=\"Blighted apple by Christopher S.

There was Jean-Louis Gassée’s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/18/apple-microsoft\">scathing article in the Guardian</a>. There was <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2013/03/ceding_the_crown\">Jon Gruber</a> (of Daring Fireball) damning Apple with faint praise: blaming the media for cherrypicking the news to weave a narrative about Apple’s slow demise. I expect the chorus to grow louder before it weakens. Blood in the water, and all that.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn’t do itself many favors. Its trenchant secrecy used to seem cool – and I daresay it would still be considered cool – if not for the fact that a) competitive technologies are legitimately “catching up” to the iDevices and, b) the company’s <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-02/apple-avoids-9-2-billion-in-taxes-with-debt-deal.html\">accounting tricks</a> seem increasingly slinky and mean-spirited.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg reported: “Apple avoided as much as $9.2 billion in taxes by financing part of a $55 billion stock buyback with debt rather than offshore cash that would have been billed by the U.S. government.”</p>\n<p>Juxtapose that legal money laundering with the typical mindset of the prototypical iConsumer. I daresay most of Apple’s biggest fans are Obama supporters, and certainly the media tastemakers skew more liberal. At some point the corporate accounting chicanery will sound a discordant note that continues to toll. “These guys at Apple? These are not good guys. They are not pro-American. They’d go to any length to avoid paying taxes that would benefit America’s defense, infrastructure and education. And worst of all, sin above all sins: their tech is now only on-par with everybody else.”</p>\n<p>In other words: not cool. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>What do you do about this if you work at Apple PR?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/2013/05/nibbles-at-the-apple/\">Find out my suggestions on the SHIFT Communications
