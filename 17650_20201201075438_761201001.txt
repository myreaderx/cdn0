Software engineers, CEOs and venture capitalists have chosen to jump from the Bay Area to places such as Denver, Miami and Austin, Texas, citing housing costs, California's relatively high income tax and the Bay Area's general resistance to rapid growth and change. \n\nThe scale of the departures is visible in vacant high-end apartments, moth-balled offices and quieter streets in neighborhoods popular with tech workers. And while no one is exactly celebrating, especially as Covid-19 has devastated the incomes of many people, some residents were ready to take a break from the rich.... Rents may have fallen 20 percent or more from a year ago, but they're still high by national standards, and many artists left the city a long time ago. \n\nAlthough some companies such as Pinterest have canceled leases, Google is expanding its offices in San Francisco, a sign of the tech industry's attachment to the city despite the local hostility and the predictions of a permanent work-from-home culture... \n\nTracy Rosenberg, executive director of Media Alliance, a San Francisco nonprofit that is often critical of the power of tech companies, said she wonders whether tech workers will want to return to a place where they've received a mixed welcome. \"The level of tech blowback in San Francisco and the Bay Area was going up in intensity,\" she said. \"I think there'll be sort of a reluctance to come back and face that, because that was reaching a level that was hard to live with &mdash; when you are the cause of all social problems, in the eyes of a significant part of the population, at least.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Are+Tech+Workers+Fleeing+the+San+Francisco+Bay+Area%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2VjYM5Y\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F20%2F11%2F30%2F0653241%2Fare-tech-workers-fleeing-the-san-francisco-bay-area%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/11/30/0653241/are-tech-workers-fleeing-the-san-francisco-bay-area?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdotIt/~4/A393aPLICiQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 12:34:00 +0000","feedId":17650,"bgimg":"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png","linkMd5":"0c971781baa6b7bdd79f77cda5936a5f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_5/2020/12/01/07-54-34-691_1f3e32fe71d8631e.webp","destWidth":56,"destHeight":20,"sourceBytes":1116,"destBytes":666,"author":"EditorDavid","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_5/2020/12/01/07-54-34-691_1f3e32fe71d8631e.webp","https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn24@2020_2/2020/12/01/07-54-37-224_a2eaef28e1a069f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdotIt/~4/A393aPLICiQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn19@2020_6/2020/12/01/07-54-37-166_58b4d998e4d6ed8f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606809248112}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 15:54:08","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 15:54:08","feedId":17650,"fetchDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 07:54:08 +0000","fetchMs":29,"handleMs":37,"totalMs":30045,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":15,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"1468f90b455865110d0575f94c058189","hostName":"europe68*","requestId":"692847ac1c564eacb771bdb7eccce2dd_17650","contentType":"text/xml;
