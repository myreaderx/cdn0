In my opinion, this could be a reflection of genetic hybridity of Mongoloid and Caucasoid groups in Inner Asia. I have a strong conviction that no group there is homogeneous in their genetic composition and ethnogenesis. I am not sure if anyone has specifically studied physical transfer of Sinitic population to Mongolia by the Xiongnu as repeatedly recorded in early Chinese dynastic histories. The Xiongnu needed to have human resources and thus aimed to grab outside, especially Chinese, population. Though the Xiongnu seemed ruthless on battlegrounds, they were very kind toward those Chinese individuals. When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Qian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Qian&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1597873247668000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFFjqVQgzM_4Rst4-PD-RG2vEy3JA\">Zhang Qian</a> (d. ca. 114 BC) was captured, he was treated nicely and was offered a marriage with a Xiongnu woman.  This aspect of Xiongnu-Han interactions merits further investigation.</p>\n<p>Mark Bender:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I have seen many, many Han Chinese, especially in NE and SW China with hazel / yellowish irises, and a number in the SW (Yunnan) with blue-ish eyes &#8212; though it is of course hard to say what the label \"HAN\" can conceal.</p>\n<p>Johan Elverskog:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It is well known that the \"Mongols\" were a soupçon of peoples cobbled together by Chinggis et al. And thus that some may have had \"European\" features – as Afghans, Kirghiz, Uighurs, Dong'an, Uzbeks, etc. do today – is probably not that surprising.</p>\n<p>Marcel Erdal:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This certainly says a lot about their ethnogenetic features (which one should nowadays approach also with DNA analysis if their bones can be found), but I am still pretty sure one needs to decouple such information from linguistic affinity on the one hand, and from material affinity (I mean information that can be gathered through archaeology) on the other hand.    As is well known, the originally non-Turkic Kirghiz are said to have been described as red-haired and blue-eyed, much of northern Asia was Yeniseian, etc. before it became dominated by Turks and Mongols, and there were Indo-Iranians there, prior to their migrations to the South, i.e., ultimately Indo-European, not to forget the Uralic Samoyeds.</p>\n<p>Juha Janhunen:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">At least in the Minusinsk basin the dominant language was changed in the succession Samoyedic (Tagar) &#62; Yeniseic (Tashtyk) &#62; Turkic (the Yenisei Kirghiz of the Türk period) &#62; Russian (after 1703). Oirat was also briefly present as a superstrate (in the 15th-17th cc.). Whether there ever was an Indo-European language (Pre-Proto-Tocharian?) before Samoyedic is uncertain, but Indo-European (both Tocharian and Iranian) was certainly spoken at various times further to the south (and there may have been Sogdian trading stations also in the Minusinsk basin). The  historical Central Asian Indo-European speakers (whose descendants now speak Turkic) do not seem to have been blond or with blue eyes, so it remains an enigma from where and when the ancient Europoid population of the region came, and what language they spoke. It could also have been Uralic. Chinggis Khan's roots were in Transbaikalia (the Onon-Argun basin), which is rather far to the east, so it is unclear whether his blue eyes could have had any western connection.</p>\n<p>Asko Parpola:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">One factor that may have contributed to genetic mixture on the elite level: In the 7th to 9th centuries, the Mongol steppes were ruled by the Uyghurs.</p>\n<p>Xu Wenkan:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">None of the northern steppe peoples, including the Xiongnu (proto-Huns), Xianbei (Särbi), Rouran (Avars), Tujue (Turks), Huihu (Uyghurs), Menggu (Mongolians), etc., consist of a single component.  In all of them there are Indo-European elements.  The admixture among the Kirghiz is especially complex.  This is born out by recent archeological and DNA research carried out in Mongolia.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It is possible that Tocharian has an Uralic substrate, but further research is necessary to confirm this.</p>\n<p>Pamela Crossley:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The descriptions and depictions of the Mongols make clear that reddish hair and hazel or green eyes were frequently seen. You can also see this in the portraits of the returned Torghuts that the Qing displayed in the Ziguang ge 紫光閣 (\"Hall of Imperial Brilliance\") — some of them have outright blue eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">As for ethnogenesis, it only suggests to me that in the fluidity of Eurasian peoples there is very little by way of stable gene pools. That seems to be shown in the DNA studies of the Xiongnu and everybody coming after them. Koreans and a few Chinese groups (like Hakka) are also considered to have reddish hair and light eyes.    I wonder to what extent this might all be connected to the N mDNA haplogroup, which is ubiquitous across northern Asia, from Scandinavia to Siberia, with descendant lineages among Native Americans. Some Europeans, including my mother’s family, have a very large N component (in our case, we just don’t know why).</p>\n<p><b>Selected readings</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<a title=\"Permanent link to The

When you do take your truck in for service at Toyota place, ask them if an exterior cleaning is included. Having visited you over the years I know that where you park a lot of tree debris falls onto your vehicles! This is no big deal, except for one thing, you don't want stuff to fall on top of your vents right in front of where the windshield is. I had this problem with my truck under the crepe myrtles at Lacey's house. For a while I tried using cardboard cutouts to cover them up but they did not last very well in the Sun and rain. I know that at your place things dropping off the trees is almost a continuous problem whereas for me it was only in the fall.

(pdf)<br /><br /><b>Abstract</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This article examines the introduction of English to the treaty port of Shanghai and the speech communities that developed there as a result. English became a sociocultural phenomenon rather than an academic subject when it entered Shanghai in the 1840s, gradually generating various social activities of local Chinese people who lived in the treaty port. Ordinary people picked up a rudimentary knowledge of English along trading streets and through glossary references, and went to private schools to improve their linguistic skills. They used English to communicate with foreigners and as a means to explore a foreign presence dominated by Western material culture.Although those who learned English gained small-scale social mobility in the late nineteenth century, the images of English-speaking Chinese were repeatedly criticized by the literati and official scholars. This paper explores Westerners’ travel accounts, as well as various sources written by the new elite Chinese, including official records and vernacular poems, to demonstrate how English language acquisition brought changes to local people’s daily lives. I argue that treaty-port English in nineteenth-century Shanghai was not only a linguistic medium but, more importantly, a cultural agent of urban transformation. It gradually molded a new linguistic landscape, which at the same time contributed to the shaping of modern Shanghai culture.</p>\n<p>[h.t.

I think that, in this editorial, Global Times follows a typical, long-standing CCP discourse regarding people condemned for disloyalty or treachery to the party or the country: binary opposition, namely, the contrast between \"the people\" (which she \"betrayed\") and \"the enemy\" (that she \"turned to\"), with thinly-veiled, heavy, highly verbal and rhetorical sarcasm. Cai Xia has been censured and punished for her, to quote from Global Times, \"incredibly malicious attacks on China's system\". As a result, she has thus been portrayed as a sordid betrayer who is welcomed by Western media because of her defection to \"the other side\" for her own interests (\"She would not have done so if she had no intention to collude with external forces to hurt the interests of her motherland\"; \"People have every reason to doubt that Cai, who is living in the US, is doing so for selfish reasons as an extreme dissident, and that she is dedicated to reaping the benefits for herself in the US\").</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I think there is a perfect word to say it in Chinese in this given context: \"xiāng bōbo 香饽饽\" (literally means \"delicious cake / bun / pastry\"), which is used to compare to \"shòu huānyíng de rén huò shìwù 受欢迎的人或事物\" (\"popular people / things; one's favorite\"), \"chīdékāi, shòu huānyíng de rén吃得开、受欢迎的人\" (\"being popular; getting along all right; being much sought after\"). I gather Global Times intentionally chose a slang / informal word for \"favorite\" in order to indicate a touch of irony to make innuendoes against Cai. So \"xiāng bōbo 香饽饽\" (\"delicious cake / bun / pastry\") may be a good translation since it is dialectal and informal</p>\n<p>It's curious that the incendiary, hypernationalistic, anti-American Global Times is taking its metaphorical cues from English.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><b>Selected readings</b></p>\n<p>\"<a title=\"Permanent link to Fun bun pun\" href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=32017\" rel=\"bookmark\">Fun bun pun</a>\" (4/9/17)</p>\n<p>\"<a title=\"Permanent link to T-shirt slogans\" href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29230\" rel=\"bookmark\">T-shirt slogans</a>\" (11/7/16)</p>\n<p>\"<a title=\"Permanent link to Ethnogenesis of the Mongolian people and their language\" href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48160\" rel=\"bookmark\">Ethnogenesis of the Mongolian people and their language</a>\" (8/19/20) &#8212; light eye color</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>[Thanks to Mark Metcalf, Tong Wang, Yijie Zhang, and Xiuyuan Mi]</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 04:29:56 +0000","feedId":2932,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b4fa02979be48387fb3a28d9eab62899","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Victor Mair","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284104605},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:48:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:48:24","title":"\"Come to Nagoya\" — spatial locutions","link":"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48136","description":"<p>[This is a guest post by Nathan Hopson]</p>\n<p>One of the first bits of Nagoya-specific Japanese I picked up was 来名 (<i>raimei</i>), i.e. \"come to Nagoya.\" It added a bit of local color to my lexicon of directional Japanese, which was mostly commonplace but remarkable locutions such as 上京 (<i>jōkyō</i>, go \"up\" to Tokyo), which gives us the 上り (<i>nobori</i>, Tokyo-bound) and 下り (<i>kudari</i>, away-from-Tokyo-bound) train and expressways. Another of those standard phrases is 来日 (<i>rainichi</i>, come to Japan), which stuck out to me in the same way world maps with Japan in the center had when I first came here as a student almost 25 years ago. The discovery of this new politics of place was one of those experiences that really stuck with me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I feel like Japan is using 来日 less these days. In its place, I see 訪日 (<i>hōnichi</i>) for tourists &#8212; not much of that these days, tbf, but 訪日外国人 (<i>hōnichi gaikokujin</i>) was all anyone could talk about last year &#8212; and now, in my role as head of a program teaching almost exclusively international students here in Japan, 渡日 (<i>tonichi</i>). I feel like 渡日 is not in common circulation, but is primarily administrative jargon for organizations like mine &#8212; and <a href=\"https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/ryugaku/1403776.htm\">the education ministry</a> over us.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-48136\"></span></p>\n<p>Google hits:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">渡日 313,000<br />訪日 16,800,000<br />来日 41,000,000</p>\n<p>The difference between 来日 and 訪日 is subtle in some ways, and changing, I think.<br /><br />I feel like 来日 used to be commonly employed to talk about tourists, but no longer. On the other hand, you <del>couldn't</del> would say 訪日 for an official diplomatic visit, for example. <br /><br />And 渡日 seems pretty firmly ensconced in bureaucratese at the moment, though that may change, too, of course.</p>\n<p>1. I'd be interested to know what others make of this. <br /><br />2. Is there a similar distinction in Sinophone languages? If so, what is the usage like?<br /><br />Since initially discovering the joys of 来名, I've now added to this 帰名 (<i>kimei</i>, \"return to Nagoya\"). I mention this because it relates to another interesting factoid: it's almost never 帰日 (<i>kinichi</i>), but rather 帰国 (<i>kikoku</i>), a phrase often used indiscriminately even for Japanese (by nationality or ethnicity) who have never set foot in the country. This is the same spatial politics as 来日, which exposes Japan as the psycholinguistic anchor point. On the one hand I guess it's just a linguistic anomaly along the lines of \"come home\" or \"come over\" in English (\"Can I come over?\" = \"Can I go to your place?\"), but on the other, those anchor points are important in shaping the way we see and experience the world.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><b>Addendum</b></p>\n<p>I ran the words through the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics corpus (Chūnagon).

Many seem to be references to Korean nationals in academic and other nonfiction publications.<br /><br />An example:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">二作家とも済州島の出身で同い年、金石範は母のおなかの中で渡日し、金泰生は五歳で密航による渡日である。</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 17:05:03 +0000","feedId":2932,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4e1b1ddbd4472a142f14c8b02eb79d52","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Victor Mair","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284104607},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:48:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:48:24","title":"The same text but in Arabic","link":"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48203","description":"<p>From the Twitter feed of @ShabanaMir1:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Ikea what is you doing <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f480.png\" alt=\"💀\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;

South Coblin, has extensively utilized contemporary glosses, topolectal data, and Sanskrit and Prakrit transcriptions.</p>\n<p>My own approach to the reconstruction of Old Sinitic is to emphasize words from other languages for which the pronunciation is better known that have been borrowed into Sinitic.  I have published many of these terms in Language Log posts (see the list of \"Selected readings\" below) and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Axel Schuessler's pathbreaking dictionary of Old Sinitic etymology is promising, especially since it systematically employs evidence from cognates in non-Sinitic languages of East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, and occasionally from elsewhere.  Such sources have enabled Schuessler to provide what he calls Minimal Old Chinese reconstructions.  Studies of the rhymes in the <i>Poetry Classic</i> (<span class=\"st\">Shījīng </span><span class=\"st\">詩經)</span> and other types of verse will continue to offer valuable evidence for the reconstruction of Old Sinitic.</p>\n<p>So much for phonological reconstructions.  Another major endeavor is to distinguish between classical / literary Sinitic and vernacular Sinitic.  The largest project in this regard is the massive dictionary of Middle Vernacular Sinitic (MVS) which Zhu Qingzhi and I have been compiling for the last two decades and more.  Concentrating on the lexicon, morphology, and grammar of the middle period, our corpus is based on tens of thousands of quotations from texts that may be located precisely in time and space.  These data are potentially of tremendous value when used in conjunction with historical reconstructions arrived at by means of the methods described above.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><b>Selected readings</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<a title=\"Permanent link to Chinese transcriptions of Indic terms in Buddhist translations of the 2nd c.

perhaps they even spread much further in the following decades.  As I was paying the bill, I asked the cashier, \"How many Dutch Pantry restaurants are there in America?\"  When she said \"Three\", I thought that I had misheard.  \"Three?  Only three?\"  \"Yes,\" she said, \"there used to be more than a hundred.\"</p>\n<p>\"What happened to all the others?  What has caused them to disappear?\"</p>\n<p>\"Cracker Barrel came through,\" she replied.</p>\n<p>That left me feeling sad, though I have to admit that the breakfast experience I had at the Cracker Barrel in Canton was exceptionally good, and I expect that would be similar wherever you find them. </p>\n<p>Will Pennsylvania Dutch go the way of the Dutch Pantry restaurants?</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><b>Selected readings</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch_English\">Pennsylvania Dutch English</a>\" (Wikipedia)</li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://padutch.net/what-is-pd/\">What is Pennsylvania Dutch?</a>\" (informative website with helpful links)</li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_German_language\">Pennsylvania German language</a>\" (Wikipedia)</li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch\">Pennsylvania Dutch</a>\" (people) (Wikipedia)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The word \"Dutch\" in \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" is not a mistranslation, but rather a corruption of the Pennsylvania German <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endonym\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonym\">endonym</a> <i>Deitsch</i>, which means \"Pennsylvania Dutch / German\" or \"German\".
