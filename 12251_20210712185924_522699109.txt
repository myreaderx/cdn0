These devices are widely used for the production of\r\nparticle beams of high charge state ions. Operating the ion source in controlled turbulence regime\r\nallows increasing the absorbed power density and therefore the volumetric plasma energy content in\r\nthe dense part of the discharge surrounded by the ECR surface, which leads to enhanced beam currents\r\nof high charge state ions. We report experiments at the ECR ion source at the JYFL accelerator\r\nlaboratory, in which adopting of a new approach allows to increase the multicharged ion beam current\r\nup to two times, e.g. to 95 µ A of ##IMG##\r\n[http://ej.iop.org/images/0022-3727/54/38/385201/dac0e59ieqn1.gif] {$\\mathrm{O}^{7+}$} achieved with\r\nmere 280 W power at 11.56 GHz. ...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":12251,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"68103cc26139971a62bf369078783092","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"V A Skalyga, I V Izotov, A G Shalashov, E D Gospodchikov, E M Kiseleva, O Tarvainen, H Koivisto and V Toivanen","publishedOrCreatedDate":1626116364092}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:59:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:59:24","feedId":12251,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:59:24 +0000","fetchMs":38831,"handleMs":4,"totalMs":38837,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"245d88d7b2d8f26704713c23b090d029","hostName":"us-54*","requestId":"6b228c38eda8494c9f20ce828eed834d_12251","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:28","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 13:01:58","id":12251,"name":"Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3727/?rss=1","subscriber":253,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn57@2020_5/2020/09/06/05-01-57-779_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1626116325256,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":38832,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":4,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
