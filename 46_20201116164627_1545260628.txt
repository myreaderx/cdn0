Shooty games about wandering a somewhat living area of outer space doing odd jobs in between a chain of story missions are their own subgenre, to the point where even the good ones can blur together.

Instead of space, you fly over a vast ocean. Instead of ships, you ride a giant falcon, and fight flying dinosaurs, semi-mechanical (I think?) insects, and huge undulating serpents covered with gun banks. Instead of lasers, you fly into storms to charge up your lightning guns. Its world is so fresh that I&#8217;ve found myself rating it above games that, on reflection, have a lot more in them. It&#8217;s just now occurred to me that there isn&#8217;t any trading in it, for one thing.</p>\n<p>What it loses in capital-F features it gains in originality and atmosphere.

As ever, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war/\">Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a> will see you wordlessly slaying any number of Iranians, Turks, Vietnamese, Russians, Germans, Cubans, all in the name of Uncle Sam and, this time, under the approving, wrinkled eyes of Ronald Reagan. The story is set in 1981 and it does not take a revisionist pen to history so much as it wraps a cloth bag over history&#8217;s head and hoses it down against a chainlink fence. It is incoherent numbskullery, tasking you with avoiding nuclear war, while at the same time insisting that gunning down the entire staff of Moscow&#8217;s KGB headquarters will not be interpreted as an act of war in itself. Plausible deniability is at the heart of what we do, argues one of the idiot spooks on your squad. But within the stupidity of this story hides an insidious and intractable message about the necessity of doing wrong.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/16/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-singleplayer-review/#more-913011\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War singleplayer review\">(more&#8230;)</span></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=Y31WLsVKFKo:GAfa5mPBjVk:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=Y31WLsVKFKo:GAfa5mPBjVk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/Y31WLsVKFKo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:30:46 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-1.jpg","linkMd5":"4475fd3f0d894749d8184eb8db73a424","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn22@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-46-13-857_dfdedba34706fae3.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":273139,"destBytes":177526,"author":"Brendan Caldwell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn22@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-46-13-857_dfdedba34706fae3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn66@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-46-26-094_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn62@2020_5/2020/11/16/16-46-26-089_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/Y31WLsVKFKo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn93@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-26-084_7fb087e11ef54f7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545163047},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:46:03","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:46:03","title":"Assassin's Creed Valhalla Asgard riddles: where to find Cat's Footsteps and Mountain Root","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=913403","description":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/11/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-Wolf-mount-edition-1212x681.jpg\" alt=\"Eivor and a giant bear in Assassin's Creed Valhalla\" width=\"1212\" height=\"681\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-913405\" title=\"Eivor and a giant bear in Assassin's Creed Valhalla\"></p>\n<p>\nYou&#8217;ll travel to Asgard part way through <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/09/assassins-creed-valhalla-review/\">Assassin&#8217;s Creed Valhalla</a>, where you&#8217;ll meet Loki, Thor, Freja and more.
