That’s why we’re constantly building tools that make it easier for you to update how your business appears to potential customers on Google Search and Maps. </p><br/>Last year, we added ways for you to <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/business-profile-maps-and-search/\">change basic business information</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/connect-and-understand-customers/\">message your customers and see detailed insights</a>. And now, as we head into International Small Business Week, we have even more ways for you to update your Business Profile — all directly from Search and Maps. You can add details, such as contact information and opening hours, and create Posts to share updates, like special offers or new offerings, right from Google Search. Starting next week, you’ll also be able to create Posts about upcoming events including when and where they’re happening — whether you’re throwing a reopening party or hosting an online tasting.</div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><figure class=\" article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"GIF of a Post being created from Google Search\" class=\"article-image--medium\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Posts_v2.gif\"/></figure><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>You can now create Posts directly from Google Search</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Here are the newest ways you can use Search or Maps to share information about your business on Google.

You can now add menu items to your Business Profile on Search and Maps. Simply add and edit your entire menu or featured dishes via the ‘Edit profile’ menu on Search.
