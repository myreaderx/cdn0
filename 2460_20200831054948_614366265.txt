Each week we’re diving into a key area of Android so you don’t miss anything. This week, we spotlighted people & identity; here’s a look at what you should know.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The big news: Jetpack Compose Alpha</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis week we released the <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/announcing-jetpack-compose-alpha.html\">first alpha</a> of Jetpack Compose 🎉, Android’s modern UI toolkit with native access to the platform APIs. Compose combines the power of Kotlin with the reactive programming model to make it easier and faster to build UI. We want your <a href=\"http://goo.gle/compose-feedback\">feedback</a> to help us build the APIs that you need in your apps, so <strong>now</strong> is the time to try it out. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo get you up to speed with Compose, this week we’ve released <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose\">4 new codelabs</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/android/compose-samples\">7 new samples</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\">new documentation</a> and a <a href=\"http://androidbackstage.blogspot.com/2020/08/episode-147-jetpack-compose-alpha.html\">podcast</a> from the Compose team. If you prefer videos; we’ve got you covered...\n</p>\n<p>\nTo understand the reactive mindset and how to think about building apps with Compose, check out ‘Thinking in Compose’:\n</p>\n\n<center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMOhl9RK0BA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>\n\n<p>\nLearn how Jetpack Compose makes Android UI easier by walking through concrete examples from our open-source sample apps in ‘Compose by Example’:\n</p>\n\n<center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDd6IOlH3io\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>\n\n<p>\nFinally, to understand how Jetpack Compose and View based UIs can co-exist and interact, making it easy to adopt Compose at your own pace, check out ‘Compose for Existing’ apps:\n</p>\n\n<center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PjQdFmiDgwk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Keyboard (IME) animations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nNew in<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/android11\"> Android 11</a> is the ability for apps to create seamless transitions between the on screen keyboard being opened and closed, as well as a revamped <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/WindowInsets\">WindowInsets</a> API to enable control of things such as the keyboard (IME).

Bring your app to life with dramatically less code, interactive tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nNo matter where you’re working from -- whether it’s your kitchen table or an office, we know you need a programming language, an IDE and a powerful UI framework that can save you time and reduce how much code you need to write. So we built Jetpack Compose to make you (and us!) more productive with building UI.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe started with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack\">Android Jetpack</a> — taking the hardest, most common developer problems on Android and creating a suite of libraries that ensure high quality apps that work across all versions of the platform. Today, 84% of the top 10,000 apps in the Play store are using a Jetpack library. \n</p>\n<p>\nThen we heard how developers love Kotlin, with over 70% of the top 1000 apps and 60% of pro Android developers using Kotlin today. The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/google-home\">Google Home</a> app saw, in certain instances, an 80% reduction in lines of code by using Kotlin and a decrease of NullPointerExceptions by 33% compared to a similar past period. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/duolingo-kotlin\">Duolingo</a>, saw reduced line count by an average of 30%.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, we heard strong feedback from the community that developers like the simplicity of declarative APIs for building UI. Jetpack Compose combines all three of these: APIs for high quality apps at scale, an intuitive language, and a reactive programming model. \n</p>\n\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cxPO9bE5QT4/X0Vw6rOOAAI/AAAAAAAAPjg/UmpOu9X6wHMUFaEjuJEdfOcOcwuKEefTwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-06%2Bat%2B9.48.28%2BAM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width: 600px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cxPO9bE5QT4/X0Vw6rOOAAI/AAAAAAAAPjg/UmpOu9X6wHMUFaEjuJEdfOcOcwuKEefTwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-06%2Bat%2B9.48.28%2BAM.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"879\" alt= Jetpack Compose image /></a> </center> \n\n\n<h1>Jetpack Compose: Now in Alpha</h1>\n\n\n<p>\n<strong>Jetpack Compose Alpha</strong> has what you need to build full-fledged Android apps, including powerful tools and interoperability with existing Android views so you don’t need to rewrite your app. Compose APIs are designed and developed hand-in-hand with a set of <a href=\"http://www.github.com/android/compose-samples\">canonical sample apps</a> that use Material Design that we’re excited to release today!

Historically, an Android view hierarchy has been represented as a tree of UI widgets. As the state of the app changes, the UI hierarchy needs to be updated to display the current data. The most common way of updating the UI is to walk the tree using functions like <a href=\"https://android.devsite.corp.google.com/reference/android/view/View#findViewById(int)\">findViewById()</a>, and change nodes by calling methods like: <pre> button.setText(String) </pre> <pre>container.addView(View) </pre> <pre> img.setImageBitmap(Bitmap) </pre> These methods change the internal state of the widget. Not only can this be tedious, but updating views manually increases the likelihood of errors (e.g. forgetting to update a view).\n</p>\n<p>\nJetpack Compose is a fully declarative component-based approach, meaning you describe your UI as functions that transform data into a UI hierarchy. When the underlying data changes, the Compose framework automatically updates the UI hierarchy for you, making it simple to build UIs easily and quickly.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMOhl9RK0BA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> </center>\n\n\n<h2>Full interop with existing Android views</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nAdopting any new framework is a big change for existing projects and codebases, which is why we’ve designed Compose to be as easy to adopt as Kotlin — it is fully interoperable with existing Android code, from day one. \n</p>\n<p>\nMigrating to Compose depends on you and your team. If you're building a new app, the best option might be to implement your entire UI with Compose. We know that most of you have large existing codebases, so rather than rewriting your app, you can combine Compose with your existing UI design.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are two main ways you can combine Compose with a view-based UI:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>You can add Compose elements into your existing UI, either by creating an entirely new Compose-based screen, or by adding Compose elements into an existing fragment or view layout.\n\n<li>You can add a view-based UI element into your composable functions. Doing so lets you add non-Compose widgets, such as MapView or WebView, into a Compose-based design.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe’ve also published a new library, <a href=\"https://material-components.github.io/material-components-android-compose-theme-adapter/\">MDC Compose Theme Adapter</a>, which allows you to reuse your existing <a href=\"https://material.io/develop/android/\">Material Components</a> themes within your Compose UI.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo learn more, try the <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-compose-migration\">Compose for existing apps codelab</a> or check out these two samples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://tivi.app\">Tivi</a> and <a href=\"http://goo.gle/sunflower-compose\">Sunflower</a> are existing apps which are being integrated with Compose\n\n<li>Crane <a href=\"https://github.com/android/compose-samples/\">sample app</a>, embeds a MapView in Compose\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PjQdFmiDgwk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>\n\n<h2>Powerful Tools</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJetpack Compose is built with powerful tooling in Android Studio, designed to help you iterate quickly on the piece of UI you’re working on.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Compose layout preview enables you to preview your Compose components without having to deploy your app to a device or emulator. As you develop your app, your previews update to help you review your changes faster. To create a layout preview, write a composable function that does not take any parameters, and add the <pre> @Preview annotation </pre> After you build your app, the preview function's UI appears in Studio's <strong>Preview</strong> pane.\n</p>\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nkxrJO6kIZk/X0VyUgVOlaI/AAAAAAAAPj0/rnNtkiT_0z0cYyr_kBBTVw4nYIuIi6QkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/jetpack-compose-preview.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width: 600px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nkxrJO6kIZk/X0VyUgVOlaI/AAAAAAAAPj0/rnNtkiT_0z0cYyr_kBBTVw4nYIuIi6QkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/jetpack-compose-preview.gif\" data-original-width=\"1565\" data-original-height=\"758\" alt= Jetpack Compose gif /></a> </center>\n\n<p>\nAndroid Studio provides an <em>interactive preview</em> mode. While you're in interactive preview mode, you can click or type in your UI elements, and the UI responds as if it were in the installed app.\n</p>\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VJs-LV-Ec0c/X0Vy6FcZbBI/AAAAAAAAPj8/c2VxYCzVnaE5dxZEOr_O6M2quFTfoG2KACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/unnamed.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width:600px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VJs-LV-Ec0c/X0Vy6FcZbBI/AAAAAAAAPj8/c2VxYCzVnaE5dxZEOr_O6M2quFTfoG2KACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/unnamed.gif\" data-original-width=\"512\" data-original-height=\"267\" alt= Jetpack Compose gif /></a> </center>\n\n\n<p>\nYou can also deploy a single composable to your physical device or Android Emulator. Android Studio creates a new activity containing the UI generated by that function, and deploys it to your app on the device. This lets you try out the UI on an actual device without needing to reinstall the entire app or navigate to its location.\n</p>\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wjMlDBTfOqA/X0VzQz9HcyI/AAAAAAAAPkE/mcj3BH39R-4_PIO1MHWyL8lQEq8ze7QQQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252813%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width:600px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wjMlDBTfOqA/X0VzQz9HcyI/AAAAAAAAPkE/mcj3BH39R-4_PIO1MHWyL8lQEq8ze7QQQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252813%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"901\" alt= Jetpack Compose gif /></a> </center>\n\n\n<h2>Get started with Jetpack Compose</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo get started with Jetpack Compose, try the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial\">Compose Tutorial</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#add-compose\">get setup</a>.
