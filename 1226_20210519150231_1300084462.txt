This announcement stated that they lost access to their infrastructure, including their blog, payment, and CDN servers, and would be closing their service. Decrypters would also be provided for companies who have not paid, possibly to their affiliates to distribute. The post cited law enforcement pressure and pressure from the United States for this decision. We have not independently validated these claims and there is some speculation by other actors that this could be an exit scam.</i></p> \n<h4>Background</h4> \n<p>Since initially surfacing in August 2020, the creators of DARKSIDE ransomware and their affiliates have launched a global crime spree affecting organizations in more than 15 countries and multiple industry verticals. Like many of their peers, these actors conduct multifaceted extortion where data is both exfiltrated and encrypted in place, allowing them to demand payment for unlocking and the non-release of stolen data to exert more pressure on victims.</p> \n<p>The origins of these incidents are not monolithic. DARKSIDE ransomware operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) wherein profit is shared between its owners and partners, or affiliates, who provide access to organizations and deploy the ransomware. Mandiant currently tracks multiple threat clusters that have deployed this ransomware, which is consistent with multiple affiliates using DARKSIDE. These clusters demonstrated varying levels of technical sophistication throughout intrusions. While the threat actors commonly relied on commercially available and legitimate tools to facilitate various stages of their operations, at least one of the threat clusters also employed a now patched zero-day vulnerability.</p> \n<p>Reporting on DARKSIDE has been available in advance of this blog post to users of <a href=\"http://www.fireeye.com/content/fireeye-www/en_US/mandiant/threat-intelligence.html\">Mandiant Advantage Free</a>, a no-cost version of our threat intelligence platform.</p> \n<h4>Targeting</h4> \n<p>Mandiant has identified multiple DARKSIDE victims through our incident response engagements and from reports on the DARKSIDE blog. Most of the victim organizations were based in the United States and span across multiple sectors, including financial services, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, and technology. The number of publicly named victims on the DARKSIDE blog has increased overall since August 2020, with the exception of a significant dip in the number of victims named during January 2021 (Figure 1). It is plausible that the decline in January was due to threat actors using DARKSIDE taking a break during the holiday season. The overall growth in the number of victims demonstrates the increasing use of the DARKSIDE ransomware by multiple affiliates.</p> \n<p> <img src=\"https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/images/darkside/fig1.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br /> <span class=\"type-XS\">Figure 1: Known DARKSIDE victims (August 2020 to April 2021)</span></p> \n<h4>DARKSIDE Ransomware Service</h4> \n<p>Beginning in November 2020, the Russian-speaking actor \"darksupp\" advertised DARKSIDE RaaS on the Russian-language forums exploit.in and xss.is. In April 2021, darksupp posted an update for the \"Darkside 2.0\" RaaS that included several new features and a description of the types of partners and services they were currently seeking (Table 1). Affiliates retain a percentage of the ransom fee from each victim. Based on forum advertisements, the RaaS operators take 25% for ransom fees less than $500,000, but this decreases to 10 percent for ransom fees greater than $5 million.</p> \n<p>In addition to providing builds of DARKSIDE ransomware, the operators of this service also maintain a blog accessible via TOR. The actors use this site to publicize victims in an attempt to pressure&nbsp;these organizations into paying for the non-release of stolen data. A recent update to their underground forum advertisement also indicates that actors may attempt to DDoS victim organizations. The actor darksupp has stated that affiliates are prohibited from targeting hospitals, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and public sector entities. This may be an effort by the actor(s) to deter law enforcement action, since targeting of these sectors may invite additional scrutiny. Affiliates are also prohibited from targeting organizations in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations.</p> \n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"167\"><p> <b>Advertisement Date/Version</b></p> </td> \n   <td width=\"312\"><p> <b>Feature/Update</b></p> </td> \n   <td width=\"143\"><p> <b>Related Reporting</b></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"167\" rowspan=\"4\"><p>Nov. 10, 2020 (V1)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td width=\"312\"><p>Ability to generate builds for both Windows and Linux environments from within the administration panel.&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td width=\"143\" rowspan=\"4\"><p> <a href=\"https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/20-00023273\">20-00023273</a></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"312\"><p>Encrypts files using Salsa20 encryption along with an RSA-1024 public key</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"312\"><p>Access to an administrative panel via TOR that can be used by clients to manage Darkside builds, payments, blog posts, and communication with victims</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"312\"><p>The admin panel includes a Blog section that allows clients to publish victim information and announcements to the Darkside website for the purposes of shaming victims and coercing them to pay ransom demands</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"167\" rowspan=\"3\"><p>April 14, 2021 (V2.0)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td width=\"312\"><p>Automated test decryption.

Within this panel, affiliates can perform various actions such as creating a ransomware build, specifying content for the DARKSIDE blog, managing victims, and contacting support. Mandiant has identified at least five Russian-speaking actors who may currently, or have previously, been DARKSIDE affiliates. Relevant advertisements associated with a portion of these threat actors have been aimed at finding either initial access providers or actors capable of deploying ransomware on accesses already obtained. Some actors claiming to use DARKSIDE have also allegedly partnered with other RaaS affiliate programs, including BABUK and SODINOKIBI (aka REvil). For more information on these threat actors, please see <a href=\"https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00009431\">Mandiant Advantage</a>.</p> \n<p> <img src=\"https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/images/darkside/fig2.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br /> <span class=\"type-XS\">Figure 2: DARKSIDE affiliate panel</span></p> \n<h4>Attack Lifecycle</h4> \n<p>Mandiant currently tracks five clusters of threat activity that have involved the deployment of DARKSIDE. For more information on uncategorized threats, refer to our post, \"<a href=\"http://www.fireeye.com/content/fireeye-www/en_US/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors.html\">DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors</a>.\" These clusters may represent different affiliates of the DARKSIDE RaaS platform. Throughout observed incidents, the threat actor commonly relied on various publicly available and legitimate tools that are commonly used to facilitate various stages of the attack lifecycle in post-exploitation ransomware attacks (Figure 3). Additional details on three of these UNC groups are included below.</p> \n<p> <img src=\"https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/images/darkside/fig3b.png\" alt=\"\" /> <span class=\"type-XS\"> <br /> Figure 3: TTPs seen throughout DARKSIDE ransomware engagements</span></p> \n<p> <i>UNC2628</i></p> \n<p>UNC2628 has been active since at least February 2021. Their intrusions progress relatively quickly with the threat actor typically deploying ransomware in two to three days. We have some evidence that suggests UNC2628 has partnered with other RaaS including SODINOKIBI (REvil) and NETWALKER.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>In multiple cases we have observed suspicious authentication attempts against corporate VPN infrastructure immediately prior to the start of interactive intrusion operations. The authentication patterns were consistent with a password spraying attack, though available forensic evidence was insufficient to definitively attribute this precursor activity to UNC2628.</li> \n <li>In cases where evidence was available, the threat actor appeared to obtain initial access through corporate VPN infrastructure using legitimate credentials.</li> \n <li>UNC2628 has interacted with victim environments using various legitimate accounts, but in multiple cases has also created and used a domain account with the username 'spservice'. Across all known intrusions, UNC2628 has made heavy use of the Cobalt Strike framework and BEACON payloads. BEACON command and control (C2) infrastructure attributed to this actor has included the following:\n  <ul> \n   <li>hxxps://104.193.252[.]197:443/</li> \n   <li>hxxps://162.244.81[.]253:443/</li> \n   <li>hxxps://185.180.197[.]86:443/</li> \n   <li>hxxps://athaliaoriginals[.]com/</li> \n   <li>hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/font.html</li> \n   <li>hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/night.html</li> \n   <li>hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/online.html</li> \n   <li>hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/send.html</li> \n   <li>hxxps://lagrom[.]com/find.html?key=id#-</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>In at least some cases there is evidence to suggest this actor has employed Mimikatz for credential theft and privilege escalation.</li> \n <li>The threat actor appeared to have used built-in commands such as ‘net’ and ‘ping’ to perform basic reconnaissance of the internal network, though it is likely that additional reconnaissance was performed via BEACON and not represented in available log sources.</li> \n <li>UNC2628 has moved laterally in environments almost exclusively via RDP using legitimate credentials and Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads. This threat cluster uses both HTTPS BEACON payloads and SMB BEACON, the latter almost exclusively using named pipes beginning with “\\\\.\\pipe\\UIA_PIPE_”</li> \n <li>Intrusions attributed to this threat cluster have progressed swiftly from intrusion to data theft and ransomware deployment, and have thus not focused heavily on maintaining a persistent foothold in impacted environments.&nbsp; Despite this, UNC2628 has maintained access via the collection of legitimate credentials, the creation of attacker-controlled domain accounts (spservice), and via the creation of Windows services intended to launch BEACON. Notably, UNC2628 has repeatedly loaded BEACON with a service named ‘CitrixInit’.</li> \n <li>UNC2628 has also employed <a>F-Secure Lab</a>s' Custom Command and Control (C3) framework, deploying relays configured to proxy C2 communications through the Slack API. Based on this actor's other TTPs they were likely using C3 to obfuscate Cobalt Strike BEACON traffic.</li> \n <li>The threat actor has exfiltrated data over SFTP using Rclone to systems in cloud hosting environments. Rclone is a command line utility to manage files for cloud storage applications. Notably, the infrastructure used for data exfiltration has been reused across multiple intrusions. In one case, the data exfiltration occurred on the same day that the intrusion began.</li> \n <li>UNC2628 deploys DARKSIDE ransomware encryptors using PsExec to a list of hosts contained in multiple text files.</li> \n <li>The threat actor has used the following directories, placing copies of backdoors, ransomware binaries, copies of PsExec, and lists of victim hosts within them.\n  <ul> \n   <li>C:\\run\\</li> \n   <li>C:\\home\\</li> \n   <li>C:\\tara\\</li> \n   <li>C:\\Users\\[username]\\Music\\</li> \n   <li>C:\\Users\\Public</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<p> <i>UNC2659</i></p> \n<p>UNC2659 has been active since at least January 2021. We have observed the threat actor move through the whole attack lifecycle in under 10 days. UNC2659 is notable given their use of an exploit in the SonicWall SMA100 SSL VPN product, which has since been <a href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/support/product-notification/additional-sma-100-series-10-x-and-9-x-firmware-updates-required-updated-april-29-2021-12-30-p-m-cst/210122173415410/\">patched</a> by SonicWall. The threat actor appeared to download several tools used for various phases of the attack lifecycle directly from those tools’ legitimate public websites.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The threat actor obtained initial access to their victim by exploiting <a href=\"https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00008254\">CVE-2021-20016</a>, an exploit in the SonicWall SMA100 SSL VPN product, which has been <a href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/support/product-notification/additional-sma-100-series-10-x-and-9-x-firmware-updates-required-updated-april-29-2021-12-30-p-m-cst/210122173415410/\">patched</a> by SonicWall. There is some evidence to suggest the threat actor may have used the vulnerability to disable multi-factor authentication options on the SonicWall VPN, although this has not been confirmed.</li> \n <li>The threat actor leveraged TeamViewer (TeamViewer_Setup.exe) to establish persistence within the victim environment. Available evidence suggests that the threat actor downloaded TeamViewer directly from the following URL and also browsed for locations from which they could download the AnyDesk utility.\n  <ul> \n   <li>hxxps://dl.teamviewer[.]com/download/version_15x/TeamViewer_Setup.exe</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>The threat actor appeared to download the file rclone.exe directly from rclone[.]org - hxxps://downloads.rclone[.]org/v1.54.0/rclone-v1.54.0-windows-amd64.zip. The threat actors were seen using rclone to exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data over the SMB protocol to the pCloud cloud-based hosting and storage service.</li> \n <li>The threat actor deployed the file power_encryptor.exe in a victim environment, encrypting files and creating ransom notes over the SMB protocol.</li> \n <li>Mandiant observed the threat actor navigate to ESXi administration interfaces and disable snapshot features prior to the ransomware encryptor deployment, which affected several VM images.</li> \n</ul> \n<p> <i>UNC2465</i></p> \n<p>UNC2465 activity dates back to at least April 2019 and is characterized by their use of similar TTPs to distribute the PowerShell-based .NET backdoor SMOKEDHAM in victim environments. In one case where DARKSIDE was deployed, there were months-long gaps, with only intermittent activity between the time of initial compromise to ransomware deployment. In some cases, this could indicate that initial access was provided by a separate actor.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>UNC2465 used phishing emails and legitimate services to deliver the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. SMOKEDHAM is a .NET backdoor that supports keylogging, taking screenshots, and executing arbitrary .NET commands. During one incident, the threat actor appeared to establish a line of communication with the victim before sending a malicious Google Drive link delivering an archive containing an LNK downloader. More recent UNC2465 emails have used Dropbox links with a ZIP archive containing malicious LNK files that, when executed, would ultimately lead to SMOKEDHAM being downloaded onto the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> \n <li>UNC2465 has used Advanced IP Scanner, BLOODHOUND, and RDP for internal reconnaissance and lateral movement activities within victim environments.</li> \n <li>The threat actor has used Mimikatz for credential harvesting to escalate privileges in the victim network.</li> \n <li>UNC2465 also uses the publicly available NGROK utility to bypass firewalls and expose remote desktop service ports, like RDP and WinRM, to the open internet.</li> \n <li>Mandiant has observed the threat actor using PsExec and cron jobs to deploy the DARKSIDE ransomware.</li> \n <li>UNC2465 has called the customer support lines of victims and told them that data was stolen and instructed them to follow the link in the ransom note.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Implications</h4> \n<p>We believe that threat actors have become more proficient at conducting multifaceted extortion operations and that this success has directly contributed to the rapid increase in the number of high-impact ransomware incidents over the past few years. Ransomware operators have incorporated additional extortion tactics designed to increase the likelihood that victims will acquiesce to paying the ransom prices.&nbsp;As one example, in late April&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;the DARKSIDE operators released a press release stating that they were targeting organizations listed on the NASDAQ and other stock markets. They indicated that they would be willing to give stock traders information about upcoming leaks in order to allow them potential profits due to stock price drops after an announced breach.&nbsp;In another notable example,&nbsp;an attacker was able to obtain the victim's cyber insurance policy and leveraged this information during the ransom negotiation process refusing to lower the ransom amount given their knowledge of the policy limits. This reinforces that during the post-exploitation phase of ransomware incidents,&nbsp;threat actors can engage in internal reconnaissance and obtain data to increase their negotiating power.&nbsp;We expect that the extortion tactics that threat actors use&nbsp;to pressure victims&nbsp;will continue to evolve throughout 2021.</p> \n<p>Based on the evidence that DARKSIDE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat.

This larger group has set the foundation for all of our work, but a smaller group of people contributed more directly to producing this report and we would like to thank them by name. We would like to specifically thank Bryce Abdo and Matthew Dunwoody from our Advanced Practices team and Jay Smith from FLARE, all of whom provided analytical support and technical review. Notable support was also provided by Ioana Teaca, and Muhammadumer Khan.</p> \n<h4>Appendix A: DARKSIDE Ransomware Analysis</h4> \n<p>DARKSIDE is a ransomware written in C that may be configured to encrypt files on fixed and removable disks as well as network shares. DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates are given access to an administration panel on which they create builds for specific victims. The panel allows some degree of customization for each ransomware build such as choosing the encryption mode and whether local disks and network shares should be encrypted (Figures 4). The following malware analysis is based on the file MD5: 1a700f845849e573ab3148daef1a3b0b. A more recently analyzed DARKSIDE sample had the following notable differences:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The option for beaconing to a C2 server was disabled and the configuration entry that would have contained a C2 server was removed.</li> \n <li>Included a persistence mechanism in which the malware creates and launches itself as a service.</li> \n <li>Contained a set of hard-coded victim credentials that were used to attempt to logon as a local user. If the user token retrieved based on the stolen credentials is an admin token and is part of the domain administrators' group, it is used for network enumeration and file permission access.</li> \n</ul> \n<p> <img src=\"https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/images/darkside/fig4.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br /> <span class=\"type-XS\">Figure 4: DARKSIDE build configuration options appearing in the administration panel</span></p> \n<h5>Host-Based Indicators</h5> \n<p> <i>Persistence Mechanism</i></p> \n<p>Early versions of the malware did not contain a persistence mechanism. An external tool or installer was required if the attacker desired persistence. A DARKSIDE version observed in May 2021 implement a persistence mechanism through which the malware creates and launches itself as a service with a service name and description named using eight pseudo-randomly defined lowercase hexadecimal characters (e.g., \".e98fc8f7\") that are also appended by the malware to various other artifacts it created.&nbsp; This string of characters is referenced as <i>&lt;ransom_ext&gt;</i>. :</p> \n<p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">Service Name: &lt;ransom_ext&gt;<br /> Description: &lt;ransom_ext&gt;</p> \n<h5>Filesystem Artifacts</h5> \n<p> <i>Created Files</i></p> \n<p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">%CD%\\LOG&lt;ransom_ext&gt;.TXT<br /> README&lt;ransom_ext&gt;.TXT<br /> &lt;original_filename_plus_ext&gt;&lt;ransom_ext&gt;<br /> May version: %PROGRAMDATA%\\&lt;ransom_ext&gt;.ico</p> \n<p> <i>Registry Artifacts</i></p> \n<p>The DARKSIDE version observed in May sets the following registry key:</p> \n<p>HKCR\\&lt;ransom_ext&gt;\\DefaultIcon\\&lt;ransom_ext&gt;\\DefaultIcon=%PROGRAMDATA%\\&lt;ransom_ext&gt;.ico</p> \n<h5>Details</h5> \n<p> <i>Configuration</i></p> \n<p>The malware initializes a 0x100-byte keystream used to decrypt strings and configuration data. Strings are decrypted as needed and overwritten with NULL bytes after use. The malware's configuration size is 0xBE9 bytes.

This involves setting the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\exefile\\shell\\open\\command\\Default to the malware path and executing <i>slui.exe</i> using the verb \"runas.\"</p> \n<p>If the OS version is Windows 10 or newer, the malware attempts a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/api0cradle/d4aaef39db0d845627d819b2b6b30512\">UAC bypass that uses the CMSTPLUA COM interface</a>.

In a DARKSIDE version observed in May 2021, the file extension is generated using a MachineGuid registry value as a seed rather than the MAC address. The file extension consists of eight lowercase hexadecimal characters (e.g., \".e98fc8f7\") and is referred to as <i>&lt;ransom_ext&gt;</i>. The file extension generation algorithm has been <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Demonslay335/f82b8d9f94040b875ceb2386f9533362\">recreated in Python</a>. If logging is enabled, the malware creates the log file <i>LOG&lt;ransom_ext&gt;.TXT</i> in its current directory.</p> \n<p>The malware supports the command line argument \"-path,\" which allows an attacker to specify a directory to target for encryption.</p> \n<p>The sample analyzed for this report is not configured to perform a system language check. If this functionality were enabled and the check succeeded, the string \"This is a Russian-Speaking System, Exit\" would be written to the log file and the malware would exit.</p> \n<p> <i>Anti-Recovery Techniques</i></p> \n<p>The malware locates and empties Recycle Bins on the system.
