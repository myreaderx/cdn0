There’s never a good time to get complacent, though (a lesson the company learned the hard way on the mobile front).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This week the chip giant is debuting its own laptop, <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-nuc-kit-solid-whitebook-laptop-foundation/#gs.lcih14\">the NUC M15</a>. More properly, the NUC M15 Laptop Kit; the device is actually a white-label system. It’s essentially a reference design so smaller device makers don’t have to commit to the long and expensive process of building a system from scratch.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It is, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price\">The Verge notes</a>, not the first time the company has created this sort of reference design. It recently created a gaming system to similar ends. But much like the recent MacBooks, the system is designed to offer high performance in a package designed more for productivity.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5sx0pjem3I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are two configurations for the system, featuring either a Core i7 chip coupled with 16GB of RAM or a Core i5 with 8GB of RAM. That will, obviously, be complemented by Windows 10, which will take advantage of the 15.6-inch touchscreen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Pricing and timing and all of that good stuff will likely depend on which vendors take the system across the finish line.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"45cwDfcinD\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/macbook-air-m1-review-the-right-apple-silicon-mac-for-most/\">MacBook Air M1 review: The right Apple Silicon Mac for most</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;MacBook Air M1 review: The right Apple Silicon Mac for most&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/macbook-air-m1-review-the-right-apple-silicon-mac-for-most/embed/#?secret=45cwDfcinD\" data-secret=\"45cwDfcinD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/2NWwFrAYF9g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:50 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"5b7859be03c6105a817949ae2d809e25","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-46-122_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-46-122_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-855_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn66@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-02-924_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn34@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-02-983_667c44d668e6bbe2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2NWwFrAYF9g:YxmBraI6MZc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn20@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-40-04-181_176d95cb111c440d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-892_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/2NWwFrAYF9g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-03-894_2ef879a7ca4c559a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847181931},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:41","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:41","title":"Daily Crunch: Verizon sells HuffPost to BuzzFeed","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2076568","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">HuffPost has a new owner, Facebook says its misinformation-fighting AI is getting smarter and Affirm files to go public.

The enormous instrument boasted a larger size and different architecture than anything before it, opening up new possibilities for monitoring the universe (and transmitting to it, not something every array can do).</p>\n<p>Countless researchers and projects used Arecibo, which as a federally funded resource was at least partly dedicated to public proposals. Signals coming through Arecibo helped inform our understanding of stellar objects from Mercury to distant pulsars.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence famously used the telescope to transmit a message at high power toward a nearby star cluster structured so that its artificial nature would be unmistakable, at least to any form of life remotely like our own. The organization also scoured years of the observatory&#8217;s data for patterns that may indicate intelligent life doing the same thing in reverse.</p>\n<p>Arecibo&#8217;s crowning moment in pop culture, however, is certainly its appearance in the 1995 James Bond film &#8220;GoldenEye&#8221; — and the wildly popular Nintendo 64 game based on it. Who could forget the climactic showdown between Bond and his antagonist, suspended hundreds of feet above the dish?</p>\n<p>Sadly, Arecibo&#8217;s infrastructure has aged and the cost of replacing some parts seems to have been too great for its custodians to attempt. Though it has survived countless storms and earthquakes, the battering it has received in recent years seems was too much for some of its cables, two out of 12 of which broke in recent months, damaging the dish itself. It is suspected that the others may be in a poor state, and if so that vastly increases the danger and cost of repairs.</p>\n<p>Consequently it was decided by the board at the University of Central Florida, which manages Arecibo on behalf of the National Science Foundations, that a controlled decommissioning was the only reasonable path forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This decision was not an easy one to make,&#8221; the NSF&#8217;s Sean Jones told press at a briefing today. &#8220;We understand how much Arecibo means to the [scientific] community and to Puerto Rico.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No specific plan has been arrived at yet for the dismantlement of the facility, but it would need to be done fairly soon to prevent more accidents from further reducing the safety of the site.</p>\n<p>The loss of Arecibo is a grave one, and its capabilities are not replicated exactly by other observatories in the world, but it is no longer the largest or most sensitive radio telescope out there. Many successors have been built in the six decades since Arecibo was made operational; China just took the wraps off the five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope at the beginning of 2020, which promises to be an immensely important facility for astronomers worldwide.</p>\n<p>While the famous telescope may soon be gone, Arecibo may remain as a scientific facility, suggested Arecibo&#8217;s program director at the NSF in remarks <a href=\"https://www.space.com/arecibo-observatory-radio-telescope-to-be-destroyed\">reported by Space.com</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re discussing the decommissioning of a structure made of steel and cables,&#8221; he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the passion of the people that work at the observatory to continue to explore, to learn, that is the true heart and soul of Arecibo. It&#8217;s not the telescope that&#8217;s the heart and soul, it&#8217;s the people.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dTzO0b1iaCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:10:17 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"cf7d934b3a7725945dc0d56c033b94bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-46-122_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-46-122_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-855_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn66@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-02-924_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-000_3cde3b28d895b6c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dTzO0b1iaCg:rwEU7t4PYjE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-40-02-937_1524437707ad3d85.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-892_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dTzO0b1iaCg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn89@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-03-116_8d8a02efd4fdcbbe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847181931},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:41","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:41","title":"Genomatica’s expanded Aquafil partnership brings biomaterials to more consumer goods","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2076307","description":"<p align=\"left\">In a deal that has potentially big implications for the sustainability of consumer packaged goods, biomaterial manufacturing technology developer <a href=\"https://www.genomatica.com/\">Genomatica</a> and the massive nylon material manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.aquafil.com/\">Aquafil</a> have partnered on a new demonstration scale facility.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Nylon-6 is used to make everything from toothbrush bristles to pantyhose and industrial materials like carpeting and other heavy-duty fabrics.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The material will be used to develop renewable products and showcase goods that can be brought to market as more companies look to clean up their supply chains and make products that have fewer negative consequences for the environment at the end of their life.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p align=\"left\">The deal is a 50-fold expansion of previous production levels for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/genomatica\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"genomatica\">Genomatica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and represents a significant expansion of Genomatica&#8217;s capabilities.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The textile industry is a $960 billion business, and it&#8217;s one of the most polluting in the world &#8212; both in terms of chemical treatments and greenhouse gas emissions.

Back in the day, The Doors were one of a number of 60s rock groups to surface around the intersection of blues, R&#38;B, and a cultural shift that challenged our notions of who was in charge. The Doors were a four-piece that sounded like something bigger. The keyboard player, Ray Manzarek, created that sleight of hand by collapsing bass, drums, guitar, keyboard, and vocal to drums, guitar, vocal, and bass on his left hand and melody on his right.</p>\n<p>In the studio, they often augmented the sound with a traditional bass sideman, but the overall feel of the left hand driving the feel and the right the upper notes produced a unique sound and hybrid of musical styles. They were not my favorite, but the night I caught them at a New York club called Electric Circus, I lurked stunned behind Manzarek as he performed this magic trick cum laude into the night. Years later, I remember every note. It feels like I cheated the bounds of the universe.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Since the election, I’ve been hoping for a sense of completion, of triumph over the bounds of the terror of these times. Surely, a big part of it is the pandemic, which doesn’t care how close it was in Georgia or when or if Trump flies off to Florida for the holidays. But news of a second robust vaccine trial suggests the tough times, though not over by any means, may be in sight of an end or at least some version of a plan to get there.</p>\n<p>Not so much for Trump and his fearful enablers. There’s much to look forward to: Inauguration Day, or as I like to call it, Eviction Day. A bailout of the 20 million unemployed that keeps them in their homes and on a pathway to economic recovery. A rational approach to the science of the virus and how to slow it while we figure out how to distribute the vaccines. A majority government for a change.</p>\n<p>Instead, every last step will be fought tooth and nail. The early breath of fresh air is still lingering, but there’s no doubt this will be for every inch of the way. Come to think of it, did we really expect anything different? No, we expected the worst, and we got it. But this is not about the politics for me. It’s about finding a place to breathe, to invest in a future we can accept, to relearn how to be kind to ourselves in setting our expectations.</p>\n<p>I’ve always held a fascination for technology for just that reason — to experience the combined shouts of innovation and inspiration that lead to breakthroughs in what’s possible. Even in the darkest depths of this crisis, the vaccine trials offer a glimpse at the leading edge of new approaches that will span not just the current virus but advances in efforts to battle cancer and other more traditional enemies. In politics, some of the citizen-based fundraising efforts of Bernie Sanders and media innovations like the Lincoln Project suggest ways of countering the negative effects of social networks and misinformation attacks.</p>\n<p>In the more conventional reaches of tech, Apple’s M1 transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is unmistakably thrilling. Seeing the wave of computing acceleration spurred by the iPhone and iPad merging with the Mac on the desktop is so inspiring. For the first time, I’m  delaying the new iPhone because I lust for the new Silicon version of the MacBook Air. Why? Because of what it doesn’t have, a fan. It’s like the taxi scene in Star Wars, you know the one where they’re not the droids you’re looking for. Then: no wheels.</p>\n<p>Now: it’s not about the fact that you can run iOS apps on the Mac. It’s that you can write apps that take advantage of the whole platform, not just mobile but not Mac, or Web but not etc. The trade offs between the two platforms are evaporating. Notifications may be useless still on the desktop; that will rapidly change as app makers get used to the system-wide features spread across the merged platform. Video editing can move seamlessly to and from iPad (LumaTouch) and back to the Mac (X86 emulation mode), creating a production ecosystem and rendering farm for the new streaming renaissance. Work from home goes portable, plug and play as you travel and collaborate.</p>\n<p>This will happen because Apple Silicon is such a game changer that it will be impossible to disrupt. Instant on, silent computing, virtual memory so invisible that you can swap huge loads in and out of memory, all kinds of attention to how people really use computers in this mobile era. The iPhone and iPad changed the way we thought about things. Now the Mac thinks that way too.</p>\n<p>The only way I can justify the  upgrade to the latest iPhone is by reupping to the Apple monthly payment contract at the end of the first of two years. So, Apple, how about you put the M1 MacBook Air on that plan, That way, as the ecosystem expands across the new modular software/hardware economy of speed, silence, and computing that just works, I can upgrade every release to the latest and greatest.

Among other things, it’s an attempt to get out in front of suggestions that the project could be struggling. The company adds, however, that it is committed to the Prime Air project.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The initial report points to dozens of layoffs, though Amazon, unsurprisingly, is loath to give an exact figure. Understandably, the ambitious project, which would add rapid air delivers to Amazon’s existing robust delivery structure, hasn’t exactly been a quick launch.</p>\n<p>In a blog post tied to the company’s RE:Mars conference last June, consumer head Jeff Wilke noted, “[W]ith the help of our world-class fulfillment and delivery network, we expect to scale Prime Air both quickly and efficiently, delivering packages via drone to customers within months.”</p>\n<p>Certainly the health risks to essential workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a prime candidate for such a launch, but there are a number of hurdles for the program, including both regulatory and technological.

In order to recover, companies must focus on re-skilling their workforces in a measured and sustainable way. However, training and recruitment can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for companies, a heavy investment that is hard to explain during volatile times.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharanidharan-rajakumar-98aa1a1/\">Bharani Rajakumar</a>, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.transfrvr.com/\">Transfr</a>, the dilemma of displaced workers is the perfect use case for virtual reality technology. Transfr leverages virtual reality to create simulations of manufacturing-plant shop floors or warehouses for training purposes. The platform&#8217;s entry-level gives workers a way to safely and effectively learn a trade, and companies a solution on mass up-skilling needs.</p>\n<p>At its core, Transfr is building a “classroom to career pipeline,” Rajakumar says. Companies have influence over the training they need, and students can turn into entry-level employees within vocational schools, on-site or within training facilities. Below is a presentation from the company highlighting the trainee experience.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NM5l1A2UqDc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=59&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>Transfr&#8217;s core technology is its software. Hardware-wise, the business uses Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest headset with Oculus for Business, not the generic customer hardware available in stores.</p>\n<p>Transfr makes money by charging a software-as-a-service licensing fee to companies, which can go for up to $10,000 depending on the size of the workforce.</p>\n<p>Transfr started as a mentor-based VR training programming play. The business sold courses on everything from bartending to surgery skills, as shown below:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_TPoTAFOA7k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>The shift to displaced worker training, Rajakumar says, came from realizing who had the purchasing power in the relationship of entry-level employees. Hint: It was the companies that had the most to gain from a higher-skilled worker.</p>\n<p>Virtual reality has gotten <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/7-investors-discuss-augmented-reality-and-vr-startup-opportunities-in-2020/\">an overall bump</a> and better reputation from the coronavirus pandemic, but is yet to massively be adopted among edtech founders. Rajakumar thinks that it could be revolutionary for the sector. He first saw virtual reality when he attended a gaming conference in San Francisco in 2017.</p>\n<p>“I can&#8217;t believe that gaming and pornography are the two big industries for this technology,” he said. “I don&#8217;t think anybody understands what this is gonna be for teaching and learning.”</p>\n<p>Labster, which offers schools VR simulations of science class, had product usage grow 15 times since March. The company raised money in August <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/labster-lands-new-cash-to-bring-its-virtual-reality-science-lab-software-to-asia/\">to expand to Asia.</a></p>\n<p>Labster CEO and co-founder Michael Jensen says that Transfr’s gamification and simply UX is good for adoption, but noted that production costs could be the biggest barrier toward making the company scale.</p>\n<p>“It&#8217;s simply too expensive to build a stable, well-polished VR application still today, and all players, us included, need to think about reusability, testability and scalability to be able to truly succeed.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7W9RNTpPrs\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/7-investors-discuss-augmented-reality-and-vr-startup-opportunities-in-2020/\">7 investors discuss augmented reality and VR startup opportunities in 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;7 investors discuss augmented reality and VR startup opportunities in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/7-investors-discuss-augmented-reality-and-vr-startup-opportunities-in-2020/embed/#?secret=7W9RNTpPrs\" data-secret=\"7W9RNTpPrs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Transfr is trying to lower costs by creating a catalog of work simulations, a Transfr virtual reality training facility of sorts, that it can then repurpose for each different customer. Each month, it adds to the training facility with new jobs that are in demand, helping it scale without needing to start from scratch with each new customer. Since March, Transfr&#8217;s customers have quadrupled.</p>\n<p>Most notably, though, is Transfr’s recent work in Alabama. The company is behind a statewide initiative in Alabama where its software is being used in the community college system and industrial workforce commission for re-skilling purposes. It&#8217;s through these large contracts that Transfr will truly be able to scale in its mission to train workforces. Rajakumar hopes to sign 10 to 15 similar contracts in the next year.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an ambitious goal, and one worth raising financing to achieve.

Facebook said the number of fake accounts used daily could be very high. On April 17, 2020, the defendant used over 7,700 accounts to make automated requests to Facebook servers, for example. On April 22, 2020, he used over 9,000.</p>\n<p>On the clone websites created, users were able to enter in any Instagram username and then view their public profiles, photos, videos, Stories, hashtags and location. The clone sites also allowed visitors to download the pictures and videos that had been posted on Instagram, a feature that Instagram doesn&#8217;t directly offer. (Its official website and app don&#8217;t offer a &#8220;save&#8221; button.)</p>\n<p>Facebook attempted to protect against these various terms of service violations in 2019, when it disabled approximately 30,000 fake Instagram accounts operated by the defendant. It also sent a series of cease-and-desist letters and shut down further Instagram and Facebook accounts, including one Facebook Page belonging to the defendant. However, the defendant claimed he didn&#8217;t operate jolygram.com, it was just registered under his name. But he also said he had shut it down.</p>\n<p>Facebook claims the resources it used to investigate and attempt to resolve the issues with the defendant&#8217;s operations have topped $25,000 and is asking for damages to be determined during the trial.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit is now one of many Facebook has filed in the years that followed the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where millions of Facebook users&#8217; data was harvested without their permission.

Image Credit: Connect Homes</p></div></p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s smaller homes run around $174,000 all-in, while a 3200 square foot home costs around $825,000. That&#8217;s about half of the cost for a custom home today, Leung said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing is providing a beautiful, modern, product for half the price of a traditional custom homebuilder,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Currently, Leung said, there are three types of new construction getting build &#8212; new tract homes; multi-family housing units, and high rises. But, there&#8217;s an opportunity to infill housing. &#8220;70% of the Bay Area and LA were built in the 70s. That means there are millions of homes that are too small and out of date and energy inefficient,&#8221; Leung said. &#8220;It costs $1 million to $1.5 million to build a home&#8230; No one is addressing the urban infill market except for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And Leung&#8217;s interest extended beyond the 88 projects that the company has completed for new homeowners. From its Los Angeles headquarters with a factory in San Bernadino, Calif., the company is also looking to change how municipalities and governments think about temporary shelters and living spaces for the unhoused.</p>\n<p>Founded by Jared Levy and Gordon Stoddard, two architects who worked in the pre-fabricated building division of the firm <a href=\"https://www.marmol-radziner.com/\">Marmol Radziner</a>, Connect Homes had raised $27 million to build out a vision of pre-fab future.</p>\n<p>That capital includes a recent $5 million round that served to reboot the company and refocus it around its manufacturing technology that can create deployable shelters alongside its housing work. That was another draw for Leung, whose experience in Northern California made him acutely aware of the housing problem the nation faces.</p>\n<p>The single module shelter that the company has developed can be transported and put on site in one day. Adding a generator to the 40 foot by eight foot module the company is building means that the shelter has the flexibility of a trailer, but can be ready for habitation in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We designed this to sell to municipalities and third party service provider to house people,&#8221; Leung said. </span></p>\n<p>Customers for the new product include the Thatcher School in Ojai and a project in Mountain View, Calif. done in partnership with Life Moves.</p>\n<p>Prices for the shelters range between $20,000 and $30,000 per-bed, or $80,000 per module. Those prices compare incredibly favorably to the $500,000 to $1 million communities pay for a bed in permanent supportive housing, said Leung.</p>\n<p>Still, the company&#8217;s fancy replacements for tent cities don&#8217;t do anything to address the underlying housing crisis that cities across the country.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We’re trying to be the opposite of bespoke housing that we see as part of the problem. The shelters was a reaction to an urgent need. We had the ability to do something innovative to solve the problem,&#8221; said Leung. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t see the amazing talent and innovation being applied to this problem. And it’s affecting the well-being and health of millions and millions of people&#8230; This is something that will last for possibly lifetimes.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2076691\" style=\"width: 421px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2076691\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2076691\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upper_module_above_02.jpg?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2076691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">View of a Connect Homes house being installed. Image Credit: Connect Homes</p></div></p>\n<p>The attempt to create a new fable for the reconstruction of the building industry is what drew Brick &#38; Mortar Ventures back to the table to recapitalize the company with the new $5 million in cash the company recently secured, according to Darren Bechtel, the founder and managing director of the firm.</p>\n<p>A scion of the Bechtel engineering and construction family, Bechtel has a deep knowledge of the industry and sees Connect Homes as one of the best bets to disrupt traditional construction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You cannot construct today cheaper than existing assets,&#8221; Bechtel said. But, the opportunity to rethink construction as manufacturing is creating an environment that can drive down costs more effectively, he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;It’s been a primitive form of manufacturing for some time,&#8221; Bechtel said of the housing industry. &#8220;The difference from traditional manufacturing and even automobiles, is that when you get to the scale of a house, you exceed the ability to transport that product efficiently from the manufacturing site to the end delivery site.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the key problem that Bechtel saw Connect Homes solving. &#8220;You have to standardize around intermodal shipping or you have to get permits. You are limited on which roads you use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re doing a true kit of parts, you&#8217;re requiring craft workers to do the finished work on site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Connect Homes, said Bechtel, is taking a different approach from the homebuilders that are looking to be mostly vertically integrated. He said Connect Homes was taking a more Apple-like approach where they oversee the product lifecycle and the customer experience. &#8220;That&#8217;s how you reach global scale and create the VW and Audi of housing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A house is the most expensive purchase. The fact that this is still a bespoke product in the vast majority of scenarios doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bechtel also drew a distinction between the companies that are primarily targeting the accessory dwelling unit market in California and Connect Homes, which has broader aspirations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people who are buying and selling ADUs are getting an extra guest house. They want more space for themselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At a much larger scale if you can take existing housing stocks that are in medium or high density areas that are old properties with larger footprints and you can create two or three housing units in the same spot with new inventory, you&#8217;re drastically improving both the quality and the quantity of housing stock.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the ultimate goal, for Connect Homes, Bechtel said. And it&#8217;s going to be returning to market just as that market could be poised to rebound, said Bechtel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe you&#8217;re going to see a massive rebound in the need for housing,&#8221;

And work is like an incredible vector for that.”</p>\n<p>She tells us she began to research international labor protection and pursue doctorate work, but instead decided to move to Silicon Valley in 2015 and pursue the future of work with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/readyset\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"readyset\">ReadySet <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p>\n<p>“Diversity, equity and inclusion was the future of work issue &#8212; who gets access to high opportunity employment and how people are treated at work and what that means for their own personal outcomes.”</p>\n<p>Five years on from the launch of ReadySet, Hutchinson says she sees companies change the way they approach equitable workplaces. And it’s hard to avoid the fact that the pandemic, having locked us all in place to watch the video of police killing George Floyd, has had an impact on the way people navigate society’s structures of racism and policing.</p>\n<p>“In terms of how our companies are responding, I definitely do see more of an emphasis on having a structural response, and thinking about their complicity and structurally exclusionary systems. What does that mean for them?” she says. “I think now there are some positive indications that companies are looking at that. They&#8217;re looking beyond just ‘let&#8217;s do an unconscious bias training,’ which is what they were asking for in 2015. And asking for more structural work &#8212; more work exclusively focused on anti-racism and really unpacking harm. But is that sustainable? Is that something that&#8217;s going to be continuing to the long term? You know, at this stage? I don&#8217;t know.”</p>\n<p>More on this as well as an examination of what we can expect under a Biden administration.

In fact, Chrome&#8217;s launch is how I helped get the startup I worked for at the time <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/02/getclicky-analytics-service-tracking-2-google-chrome-usage/\">onto TechCrunch for the first time</a>.</p>\n<p>We did shots to celebrate. Chrome rocked, and we were Day One Fans.</p>\n<p>But over time what was once a romance began to sour, as Chrome got a bit slower, a bit heavier and a bit worse over the years.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The devolution felt a bit like what was happening to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> search, in which a very good idea was slowly turned into something that made more money at the cost of functionality, speed and user happiness (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/google-will-iterate-the-design-that-made-it-harder-to-tell-ads-from-search-results.html\">more on that natural terminus of that progression here</a>).</p>\n<p>And because I am a petulant child, I have been very annoyed by what has happened to Chrome, software that I have never paid a single dollar to use. To make this point, I went out to round up a tweet or two from myself complaining about Chrome over the years, but after finding at least nine examples since May I started to feel bad (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1244635272928788481\">one</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1298014383478657024\">two</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1285653121524531200\">three</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1284187630972870657\">four</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1278758748983566336\">five</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1261272217037475842\">six</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1247943883033583617\">seven</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1247944622090981376\">eight</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1244650983508115456\">nine</a>). So let&#8217;s move on.</p>\n<p>What went wrong with Chrome? I don&#8217;t know. Over time its taste for RAM, lag and being generally annoying grew. But as I was living in a G Suite world, sticking to Chrome made sense &#8212; so I endured.</p>\n<p>And now, I may not have to any longer. This week Google detailed an impending set of Chrome updates that are <em>amazing</em> to read through and imagine the real-world impact of. Big Goog appears to have gone deep into its browser&#8217;s code, finding ways to make it faster, lighter on memory usage and smarter.</p>\n<p>I am so very excited.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s coming? Pulling <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/11/tab-throttling-and-more-performance.html\">from Google&#8217;s Chromium blog</a> instead of its <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/faster-chrome/\">more consumer-friendly post</a> (a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4\">big thanks to The Verge</a> for bringing this set of updates to my attention), here are the highlights as far as I am concerned (Bolding: TechCrunch in each block quote):</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Even if you have a lot of tabs open</strong>, you likely only focus on a small set of them to get a task done. <strong>Starting in this release, Chrome is actively managing your computer’s resources to make the tabs you care about fast</strong>—<strong>while allowing you to keep hundreds of tabs open</strong>—so you can pick up where you left off.</p>\n<p>In this release, we’re improving how Chrome understands and manages resources with Tab throttling, occlusion tracking and back/forward caching, so you can quickly get to what you need when you need it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Google this is literally me. I feel incredibly seen. Thank you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We investigated how background tabs use system resources and found that JavaScript Timers represent &#62;40% of the work in background tabs. Reducing their impact on CPU and power is important to make the browser more efficient. <strong>Beginning in M87, we’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11FhKHRcABGS4SWPFGwoL6g0ALMqrFKapCk5ZTKKupEk/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">throttling JavaScript timer wake-ups</a> in background tabs to once per minute. This reduces CPU usage by up to 5x, and extends battery life up to 1.25 hours in our internal testing.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>When the world works again, I want to buy lunch for everyone who took part in this effort.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Next, we’re bringing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Di4DiGwHamIgLYjaOpripOJQinUquUuyxuiim2-WUIs/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Occlusion Tracking</a></strong>&#8211;which was previously added to Chrome OS and Mac&#8211;to Windows, which allows Chrome to know which windows and tabs are actually visible to you. With this information, <strong>Chrome can optimize resources for the tabs you are using, not the ones you’ve minimized, making Chrome up to 25% faster to start up and 7% faster to load pages, all while using less memory.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hell yes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How many times have you visited a website and clicked a link to go to another page, only to realize it&#8217;s not what you wanted and click the back button?

What else, with a week that included both the Airbnb <em>and</em> Affirm IPO filings, a host of mega-rounds for new unicorns, some fascinating smaller funding events and some new funds?</p>\n<p>So we had a lot to get through, but with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cgates123\">Chris</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannycrichton\">Danny</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmasc_\">Natasha</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alex\">your humble servant</a>, we dove in headfirst:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affirm has filed to go public! The fintech unicorn is big, growing and losing less money over time. We were pretty impressed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/affirm-files-to-go-public/\">in our first look</a>. Then, with a bit more time, we <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/inside-affirms-ipo-filing-a-look-at-its-economics-profits-and-revenue-concentration/\">dug deeper</a> and found a weakness or two.

According to Roblox, its developer and creator pool earned $72.2 million in the first three quarters of 2019, a figure that soared to $209.2 million in the same period of 2020. (TechCrunch has a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/how-roblox-avoided-the-gaming-graveyard-and-grew-into-a-2-5b-company/\">deep-dive into Roblox and its pre-IPO success here</a> if you want more depth in its business mechanics. We’ve also dug into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/how-roblox-completely-transformed-its-tech-stack/\">its tech stack evolution here</a>, if that is your jam.)</p>\n<p>Roblox has seen similar growth in its total revenues, growing 139% to $312.8 million in 2018, and 56% to $488.2 million in 2019. More recently, the company’s revenue expanded 68% in the first three quarters of 2020 from its 2019 result over the same period, to $588.7 million.</p>\n<p>The company, then, has grown more quickly in 2020 to date than it did in 2019, an impressive acceleration at scale. A COVID-derived tailwind has helped the company, with Roblox stating in its S-1 filing that it enjoyed “rapid growth” in part of Q1, and all of Q2 and Q3 that it says was “due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies.”</p>\n<p>The unicorn gaming company also warned that “in future periods” it anticipates “growth rates for our revenue to decline,” going on to warn that it “may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods” that are later compared to its COVID-boosted 2020 results.</p>\n<p>How investors weigh that warning against the company’s growth remains to be seen, but Roblox has had an extraordinary 2020. For example, the company’s bookings &#8212; what it defines as “sales activity in a given period without giving effect to certain non-cash adjustments” &#8212; grew 62% in 2018 to $499.0, 39% in 2019 to $694.3 million, and 171% to $1.24 billion in the first three quarters of 2020, when compared to the same period of 2019.</p>\n<p>That growth is downright impressive. As you’d imagine, the company’s impressive sales gains were derived from rising user interest, with Roblox averaging “31.1 million average DAUs across over 180 countries” during the first nine months of 2020, up from 17.1 million during the same portion of 2019.</p>\n<p>Along with more consumers coming to the Roblox platform, the hours engaged also increased. Users on Roblox spent 22.2 billion hours in the first nine months of 2020, up 122% during the same portion of 2020. Daily active users spend an average of 2.67 hours per day on the platform.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZEGP3KQESh\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/how-roblox-avoided-the-gaming-graveyard-and-grew-into-a-2-5b-company/\">How Roblox avoided the gaming graveyard and grew into a $2.5B company</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;How Roblox avoided the gaming graveyard and grew into a $2.5B company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/how-roblox-avoided-the-gaming-graveyard-and-grew-into-a-2-5b-company/embed/#?secret=ZEGP3KQESh\" data-secret=\"ZEGP3KQESh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Despite its rapid growth, Roblox, like many unicorns, is still unprofitable. The company lost $97.2 million in 2018, $86.0 million in 2019. Its losses exploded in 2020, with the company posting a net loss of $203.2 million in the first three quarters of the year, compared to just $46.3 million during the same portion of 2019.</p>\n<p>Those losses appear to be driven mainly from rising spend across its operations, and an increase in the cost of share-based compensation in 2020 compared to 2019.</p>\n<p>However, on a cash basis Roblox appears to be in much better shape than its GAAP numbers would have you initially estimate.  The firm’s operating cash flow grew from $62.6 million in the first nine months of 2019 to $345.3 million in the same period of this year. Over the same period, the company’s free cash flow was $6.0 million and $292.6 million.</p>\n<p>Roblox’s numbers demonstrate that its space can be large, and economically interesting.

And once it goes public, the company&#8217;s investors will start a clock on when they can convert their formerly illiquid shares into cash.</p>\n<p>The S-1 gives an idea of who owns how much of the gaming developer platform, and thus who might benefit the most from the IPO. Altos Ventures is the principal stockholder, holding 23.9% of the company at 114,261,961 shares. This is not surprising, given how many Roblox rounds it helped lead. Right behind Altos comes Meritech Capital, which owns 11.6% of Roblox; Index Ventures, with 11.1%; Tiger Global at 8.2%; and First Round Capital at 7%.</p>\n<p>The executive team, in aggregate, holds just 6.8% of the company. David Baszucki, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox, owns 8,252,471 shares, or 1.6% of the company, indicating the true effects of dilution when you are as richly funded a company as Roblox.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the numbers</h2>\n<p>In its S-1, Roblox did address that its success depends on its ability to “provide a safe online environment” for children, or else its “business will suffer dramatically.”</p>\n<p>In 2018, Roblox responded to a grotesque hack that allowed a young girl’s avatar to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/roblox-responds-to-the-hack-that-allowed-a-childs-avatar-to-be-raped-in-its-game/\">be raped on a playground</a> on one of its games. Other allegations continue, including that the business has offered a platform to criminal offenders to lure children into interacting with creeps off-platform, according to the S-1.</p>\n<p>“While we devote considerable resources to prevent this from occurring, we are unable to prevent all such interactions from taking place,” the document states. However, the document does go on to say that communications on its platform are not encrypted “at this time” and that they have an “increased risk” of data security incidents around access and disclosure. With children on the platform, this is a huge weak spot for Roblox.</p>\n<p>The business intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RBLX.”</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Yi6gqS-39NI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 23:18:52 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"ea26012f5199e50666338836da5e993e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-46-122_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-46-122_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-855_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn66@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-02-924_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn76@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-04-001_0d8950a30b3f170c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Yi6gqS-39NI:zOOPEm0o8eM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn24@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-12-358_419189f81362df94.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-892_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Yi6gqS-39NI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn47@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-092_25c6b7230dc89244.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847181933},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:41","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:41","title":"Lime plans for ‘modes’ beyond bikes and scooters in 2021","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2076446","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/limebike\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"limebike\">Lime <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is launching its fourth-generation scooter in Paris this week, an example the company says of its financial turnaround and commitment to growth. But the product rollout isn&#8217;t over.</p>\n<p>Lime CEO Wayne Ting hinted Thursday during the WSJ Future of Everything event that a &#8220;third mode,&#8221; beyond bikes and scooters, is also in the works for the first quarter of 2021, as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform. Earlier this year, Lime started to include on its app <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/wheels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"wheels\">Wheels</a>-branded electric bikes in certain cities. Ting said users should expect more partnerships like these.</p>\n<p>Ting wouldn&#8217;t give specifics on this &#8220;third mode&#8221; except to explain that it will probably serve a slightly longer distance than its scooters and be better at carrying cargo.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that it continues to appeal to different demographics that maybe don&#8217;t see themselves on a scooter,&#8221; Ting added.</p>\n<p>For now, Lime is focused on deploying the Gen4, a model that Ting says will surpass the more than two-year lifespan of its previous generation. The Gen4 will roll out across Europe in early 2021. Much of the Gen4 work was done by engineers at Uber&#8217;s Jump micromobility unit. Uber offloaded Jump to Lime this spring as part of a complex <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/the-station-uber-has-a-taste-for-lime-tesla-drama-moovit-gets-acquired/\">$170 million fundraising round</a>.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch previously viewed photos of Jump&#8217;s impending scooter, which never happened. The vast majority of Jump employees were laid off. Lime has said some Jump employees were retained.</p>\n<p>Lime gave some credit to the Jump employees in a blog post Thursday and thanked them for their &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">work in the initial development of this new model.&#8221; Lime said its R&#38;D team added to the design to bring it to market and will iterate further on the Gen4 over time. Lime focused on improving the Jump scooter&#8217;s durability and swapped out some parts that would allow the company to reuse parts from existing Lime vehicles. </span></p>\n<p>The Gen4 features swept-back handlebars that are similar to the design of bike handles, which Lime says allows for a more comfortable grip. The new model also sports an enhanced suspension and larger wheels, a dual hand-brake system, a lower baseboard to optimize the center of gravity on the scooter and a new kickstand with two legs.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest change is the addition of a swappable battery, which Ting described as a &#8220;huge improvement on existing technology.&#8221; These swappable batteries will be interchangeable with the Lime bike fleet, further streamlining its operations, the company said Thursday.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2076468\" style=\"width: 2838px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2076468\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2076468 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png\" alt=\"Lime Gen4 specs scooter\" width=\"2828\" height=\"1564\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png 2828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=2048,1133 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LimeGen4Specs.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2828px) 100vw, 2828px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2076468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lime</p></div></p>\n<p>Lime said Thursday it was both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter — a first — and is on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021.

Said Case at the time, in comments not published previously:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Obviously the jury is out. I think a lot of people who decided to leave Silicon Valley to shelter someplace else, most of those will end up returning. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll see a mass exodus from the city, whether that be Silicon Valley or New York or Boston, which some have predicted.</p>\n<p>I do think some of the people who decided to leave at least temporarily will decide to stay, and most of them will end up still working for their current company, in part because some of the tech companies like Facebook and Square and many others have have made it easier to work remotely. But some, once they get settled in another place, and their family is settled, will likely will decide to do something different [and] I think it could be a helpful catalyst in terms of these rise-of-the-rest cities that were showing some signs of momentum. This could be an accelerant.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We had also talked with Case about data that suggests that women and other founders who are not in the networking flow of traditional venture firms are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/pandemics-impact-disproportionately-reduced-vc-funding-for-female-founders/\">getting left behind</a> as deals are being struck over Zoom. He&#8217;d also seen the data and was surprised by it. As he told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s a concern. And it&#8217;s a concern about place. It&#8217;s also a concerned about people. If you just look at the the NVCA data, last year, 75% of venture capital went to just three states and more than 90% of venture capital went to men and less than 10% to women, even though women represent half our population. And last year, even though Black Americans are about 14% of the population, Black founders got less than 1% of venture capital. So if you just look at the data, it does matter where you live, it does matter what you look like, it does matter the kind of school you went to.</p>\n<p>I would have thought that because of the pandemic and because suddenly, Zoom meetings for pitches were becoming increasingly commonplace . . .that that would open up the aperture for most venture capitalists. They would be more willing to take meetings with people in other places, and also be willing to get to reach out to some of the diverse communities that they haven&#8217;t traditionally have invested in.</p>\n<p>Some of that has happened, for sure. We have seen more interest among coastal investors in opportunities in these in these rise-of-the-rest cities. I think the challenge more broadly, when you go beyond place toward people is what you hear from more of these venture capitalists. They say, &#8216;Yes, we understand that it&#8217;s a problem we need to be help solve. It&#8217;s also an opportunity we can potentially seize, because some of these entrepreneurs are going to build some really valuable companies. But we don&#8217;t really have the networks. We tend to be mostly situated where we live and have worked or went to school and also where we&#8217;ve previously made investments. So we just don&#8217;t have the networks in the middle of a country. We don&#8217;t have networks with Black founders,&#8217; and so forth.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s an area that we&#8217;re really focusing on now: how do we extend the networks. I do think most VCs realize they should be part of the solution, and not part of the problem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Case mentioned during our call &#8212; ahead of the U.S. presidential election &#8212; his longstanding friendship with now President-elect Joseph Biden. Case isn&#8217;t the only one at Revolution with ties to Biden, however. Ron Klain, an executive vice president at Revolution, previously served as Biden&#8217;s chief of staff when he was vice president and, as the world learned last week, Klain is again heading into politics after being chosen to serve as the incoming White House chief of staff.</p>\n<p>Said Case of Klain last week to the New York Times: “He can process a lot of information, focus on the things that matter and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/us/politics/ron-klain-biden.html\">balance a lot of balls</a>.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote
