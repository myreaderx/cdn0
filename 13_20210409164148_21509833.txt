And it’s a process that should be done with a bit of care. Beyond the style considerations that may be foremost in your mind, your shoes will have a disproportionate influence on your overall comfort level. Ill-fitting shoes can make standing and walking a literal pain, and cause significant health issues for not only your feet, but your ankles, knees, back, and more.</p>\n<p>So whether you’re buying casual athletic sneakers or formal dress shoes, you want the pair you choose to fit as perfectly as possible. Following the guidelines outlined above will get you much of the way there; following these additional tips will bring your new kicks on home:</p>\n<div><strong>1. Try on shoes in the afternoon/evening.</strong> Your feet will swell during the course of the day, and it’s better to have your shoes fit your feet at their largest, than at their smallest.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>2. Try on shoes while wearing the kind of socks you’ll normally be wearing with them.</strong> If you’re going to be wearing dress socks with your dress shoes, try on dress shoes with dress socks. If you’re going to be wearing athletic socks with your athletic shoes, try on athletic shoes with athletic socks.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>4. When you go to try on shoes, don’t get overly stuck on “your” size. </strong>Don’t do your shopping with the mindset: “I’m a size 10, and these shoes are a size 10, so they<em> should</em> fit.” While you may typically be one size, every brand’s shoes are sized a little differently. So start by trying on a pair with your typical size, and then go up or down in size, depending on how your foot <em>feels</em>, not what the number on the shoebox says.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>5. Always try on both shoes.</strong> One of your feet is often larger/smaller than the other. Buy the size that fits your larger foot.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>6. Do a test walk on both hard and soft surfaces.</strong> Different surfaces will give the shoes a different feel. </div>\n<p><strong>7. Make sure they feel good right out the box.</strong> While new shoes will conform to your feet with regular wear, especially if they’re made from leather, the degree their size and shape will change over time isn’t significant. So don’t count on this breaking-in process turning an uncomfortable, ill-fitting shoe into a comfortable, well-fitting one; your shoes should feel good and fit well from the get-go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.storytellersworkshop.com\"><em>Illustration by Ted Slampyak</em></a></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-choose-shoes-that-fit-perfectly/\">How to Choose Shoes That Fit Perfectly</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/Qbb4r4jfOl0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:31:01 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1ca621f5144a5a41eca8358e4c8dd63d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/shoes.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-47-271_b0ecd976cfd96f0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/Qbb4r4jfOl0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn18@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-41-599_1f6713bd6c2c3ee4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986480906},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:20","title":"How to Use Bitters to Elevate Your Drinks","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=134904","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135036\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/bitters.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/bitters.jpg 594w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/bitters-320x213.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are five elements of flavor in any dish or drink: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami. (Those first four are pretty self-explanatory; umami is a somewhat elusive term that basically means “savory.”) The best flavor experiences combine as many of those elements as possible; while some are sure to stick out — in a cake, it’s no doubt the sweetness — the others can provide a much needed complement so that no single component is overpowering. In that same cake, there’s assuredly a touch of salt, some bitter (chocolate and/or baking soda), possibly sour (perhaps in the form of a curd), and maybe even umami in a cream cheese frosting or an herbal addition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you stop and think about it, the dishes you love most are those that combine and balance all five elements of flavor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the world of cocktails, it’s pretty common to be served drinks that are too sweet, leaning heavily on just one, maybe two, flavor elements. But the best drinks are those that add unexpected components, like salty or bitter. If a drink tastes particularly balanced, not overly sweet or sour, it’s most likely incorporating one of these other elements. Most often, that secret ingredient that bartenders rely on is something called, naturally enough, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bitters</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking to boost your skill as a home mixologist, it’s worth getting to know this least understood member of the home bar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning what bitters are and how to use them can be eye-opening and taste bud-enlivening for the connoisseur of cocktails. </span></p>\n<h3>What Are Cocktail Bitters?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitters constitute a super-concentrated, flavored liquid that adds a dose of the bitter element to any cocktail, mocktail, or even sauce and/or marinade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitters contain a wide variety of different botanicals (the mixture and ratios of each brand are very tightly held corporate secrets) and are relatively simple to manufacture, at least compared to other alcohols: Those botanicals — fruits, herbs, nuts, roots, spices, etc. — are steeped in a clear alcohol for some amount of time. Then there’s generally a touch of sugar and food coloring added and it’s all filtered into a bottle. There’s no actual distilling or alcohol production happening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the liquid is in fact alcoholic (to the tune of around 40% ABV, which is about the same as any spirit), you use such a small amount — just a few dashes in the vast majority of drinks — that bitters don’t impact the overall ABV of a drink, and they’re also fine for pregnant women and most teetotalers (not including recovering alcoholics, as the taste alone may be triggering). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also bitter spirits, like Campari (<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-perfect-negroni-cocktail/\">which makes a Negroni taste so darn good</a>) and Amaro. These play more of a starring role in the cocktails which include them. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend keeping a bottle of bitter spirits in your home bar unless you’re loyal to a particular cocktail that uses them.  </span></p>\n<h3>3 Bitters to Keep on Your Shelf </h3>\n<p><b>Angostura. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The classic — if you have bitters in your home bar, this is almost assuredly the one. If a cocktail recipe calls for bitters, it’s nearly always Angostura. The recipe is a secret blend of ~40 herbs, spices, roots, and more (nobody </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> knows). The result is an almost spicy bitter flavor, led by cinnamon and clove. Angostura is found in a number of classic cocktails, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/5-classic-cocktails-every-man-should-know/\">most notably the Old Fashioned and the Manhattan</a>. There’s no reason not to stock a bottle in your home bar.</span></p>\n<p><b>Peychaud’s.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another classic and quite versatile. Given its French origins (via New Orleans), it’s no surprise that the leading flavors in Peychaud’s bitters are anise, licorice, and vanilla, giving it an absinthe-like quality. It’s not found in as many classic cocktails, but <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-primer-on-brandy/\">it does contribute to a mean Sazerac</a>, which is one of my personal favorites. </span></p>\n<p><b>Dealer’s choice.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Besides these two classics, grab one other bottle of bitters in a flavor you particularly enjoy, or perhaps based on the season. I love all things cherry, so I keep cherry bitters on hand. It adds a grenadine-like kick to any drink, but without that syrupy, overly sweet intensity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The options for bitters in today’s marketplace are legion. You can get almond, mint, a variety of fruits, general “herbal” bitters, celery, etc. Stroll on down to your local liquor store and see what they have available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might also notice one that I haven’t included: Regan’s Orange Bitters. It’s one you’ll see on a lot of lists, but which I’ve personally found does not have much flavor. In a home taste test with a few family members, it was unanimously the least distinguishable of any of the handful of bitters we tried.  </span></p>\n<h3>How to Use Bitters</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plenty of cocktail recipes call for a specific kind of bitters, usually measured in “dashes.” A bottle of bitters is basically constructed like a hot sauce bottle; it comes out in dribs and drabs when you shake it. Various flavors of bitters are somewhat interchangeable — you can certainly use Angostura when Peychaud’s is called for — but the flavor profile is likely to be altered from what’s intended. A Sazerac made with Angostura bitters tastes quite a bit different than one made with Peychaud’s. That’s not always a bad thing, just be aware of it. A few dashes of bitters will have more say in the final flavor than you’d expect.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a fun test to try this out with friends or family: make three basic Old Fashioneds using a few different types of bitters. Combine 2 oz bourbon, 1 oz simple syrup (or a sugar cube), a couple dashes of bitters — easy peasy. Pour them out, just a couple sips’ worth, into individual tasting glasses and see what everyone thinks. Angostura bitters provide that absolutely classic Old Fashioned flavor; cherry bitters are a little sweeter and make for the most dessert-like drink; Peychaud’s will give it a licorice essence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know how much bitters can add to a drink — and how different flavors can alter that overall taste — you can use them widely and experimentally with your cocktails and other libations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To a Dark and Stormy, add herbal bitters to take it up a notch; <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-the-perfect-mocktail/\">to your favorite mocktail</a>, add fruit bitters to balance the inevitable sweetness; to a nip of Scotch, add a dash of nut bitters to give it a little something extra. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t have bitters at all, you can definitely try a drink recipe without including it, but there’s a good chance it’ll be off-balanced. There aren’t really substitutes (outside of making your own bitters at home, which doesn’t take long, but is a pain), so your best bet is really to just head to the store and pick up a bottle for less than $10. It’ll last you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; a 5-ounce bottle is good for a couple hundred drinks.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-use-bitters-to-elevate-your-drinks/\">How to Use Bitters to Elevate Your Drinks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/GJpPJP7Nsus\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:40:34 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c3ad7721c4abac7e55e7749450d3b701","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jeremy Anderberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/bitters.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn16@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-46-159_21c16e947bc54845.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/GJpPJP7Nsus":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn21@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-41-47-578_913e44358b2755d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986480906}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:20","feedId":13,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:41:20 +0000","fetchMs":32,"handleMs":479,"totalMs":27982,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"def808aecb408fadcc4424587b155e88","hostName":"us-016*","requestId":"f593c53236da4f058cd8a0c2570667a1_13","contentType":"text/xml;
