Since it's flat, let's add a bicycle, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list of some of the best beaches in Riviera Maya is based on my time in the region, which amounts to a few weeks over the course of two separate visits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you're ready to plan a trip, be sure and <a href=\"https://www.visasmexico.com/visa-types/\">check out the various visa types for Mexico</a> to ensure you're following the rules based on your reason for going and citizenship.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya.jpg\" alt=\"Playa Norte, Isla Mujeres\" class=\"wp-image-45093\" srcset=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya.jpg 1600w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya-750x563.jpg 750w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya-320x240.jpg 320w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya-750x563@2x.jpg 1500w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Norte-Riviera-Maya-320x240@2x.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Playa Norte</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-playa-norte-islas-mujeres\">Playa Norte, Islas Mujeres</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's get this party started in Playa Norte (&#8220;North Beach&#8221;) on Isla Mujeres, an island eight miles (13 kilometers) east of Cancun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went <a href=\"https://gobackpacking.com/snorkeling-with-whale-sharks-cancun/\">snorkeling with whale sharks</a>, our boat stopped at Isla Mujeres on the way back to Cancun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The captain dropped anchor, and we were afforded time to snorkel, swim, and hang out in whatever way felt fit. The water was calm and shallow; it was quite relaxing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boats from other tours were also in the area, so there was a bit of a scene. It wasn't a full-on party, but I could see how it could get that way in the high season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playa Norte is easily accessible as a day trip by ferry from Cancun, or you can stay longer on one of the island's hotels or resorts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of bars and restaurants to keep you fed and feeling fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico.jpg\" alt=\"Playa del Carmen, one of the best beaches in the Riviera Maya\" class=\"wp-image-45095\" srcset=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico.jpg 1600w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico-750x563.jpg 750w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico-320x240.jpg 320w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico-750x563@2x.jpg 1500w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-del-Carmen-Mexico-320x240@2x.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Playa del Carmen </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-playa-del-carmen\">Playa del Carmen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My all-around favorite place in Riviera Maya is Playa del Carmen, which is an hour south of Cancun by bus or car. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you'll find white sandy beaches of varying depths. The beach adjacent to the center of town is narrower; however, the convenience can't be beaten. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further south, past the pier for ferries to Cozumel, the beach widens; you'll find a mix of resorts, condos, and casas (small houses) for rent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like Playa del Carmen because it's full of budget-friendly accommodation, a block or two from the beach, and there are plenty of rooftop restaurants for enjoying the Caribbean breeze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If dancing late into the night is your style, there are loads of nightclubs catering to partiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playa del Carmen is relatively safe, too. Whether you're on vacation or looking to live in Mexico, it's worthy of your consideration. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel.jpg\" alt=\"Playa Palancar on Cozumel island\" class=\"wp-image-45091\" srcset=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel.jpg 1600w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel-750x563.jpg 750w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel-320x240.jpg 320w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel-750x563@2x.jpg 1500w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playa-Palancar-Cozumel-320x240@2x.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Playa Palancar</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-playa-palancar-cozumel\">Playa Palancar, Cozumel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During my first visit to Playa del Carmen, I took a day trip to Cozumel, which is connected via a ferry that runs throughout the day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make life easy, I booked a ticket that included the roundtrip ferry ride and transportation to Playa Palancar, where we were able to hang out on a sandy beach, eat lunch, and order drinks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a small, unpretentious beach. Further south along this section of coast is the larger Playa &#8220;El Cielo&#8221; (&#8220;The Sky&#8221;), which offers a wider expanse of turquoise waters as it's got more of the reef. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cozumel has its own international airport with flights direct from the United States, in case you want to skip over Cancun completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach.jpg\" alt=\"Playa Paraiso at sunrise in Tulum\" class=\"wp-image-45096\" srcset=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach.jpg 1600w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach-750x563.jpg 750w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach-320x240.jpg 320w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach-750x563@2x.jpg 1500w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-beach-320x240@2x.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Playa Paraiso at sunrise</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-tulum\">Tulum </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If Playa del Carmen is too much city for you, continue south for another hour by bus or car to <a href=\"https://gobackpacking.com/tulum-mexico-beaches-ruins/\">Tulum</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tighter rules around development in Tulum National Park have helped to protect the environment and beach from over-development. That's the upside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the downside is that accommodation is more expensive and primarily consists of small luxury eco-hotels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, don't let that scare you away. Bargains can be found during shoulder seasons, and there's always the option to sleep in the town of Tulum, a 15-minute bike ride inland from the beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to find a $29 bed for a night when I visited Tulum, as the hotel was located on a rocky outcropping. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The water color was gorgeous; I just had to walk a minute to the north or south to reach sand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach.jpg\" alt=\"Playita Tortuga at Tulum ruins is one of the best beaches in Maya Riviera\" class=\"wp-image-45094\" srcset=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach.jpg 1600w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach-750x563.jpg 750w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach-320x240.jpg 320w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach-750x563@2x.jpg 1500w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tulum-ruins-beach-320x240@2x.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Playita Tortuga at Tulum ruins </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was up before dawn the morning after my arrival and walked along the beach to the Tulum ruins as the sun rose. I had the beach to myself and it was wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also one of the first visitors inside the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulum\">Tulum archaeological site</a> that day. This former walled city was constructed between 1200 to 1450 AD and was one of the last cities inhabited by the Maya people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staircases have been built into the 40-foot cliffs to allow visitors access to some of the beaches below. Access to Playita Tortuga (&#8220;Turtle Beach&#8221;), pictured above, doesn't require stairs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve.jpg\" alt=\"Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve\" class=\"wp-image-45088\" srcset=\"https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve.jpg 1600w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve-750x563.jpg 750w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve-320x240.jpg 320w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve-750x563@2x.jpg 1500w, https://gobackpacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sian-Kaan-Biosphere-Reserve-320x240@2x.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Mangroves in Sian Ka'an</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-sian-ka-an-biosphere-reserve\">Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so this last one on my list isn't as much a beach as a biosphere reserve with tropical forests, mangroves, and marshes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gobackpacking.com/sian-kaan-biosphere-reserve/\">Sian Ka'an</a> (&#8220;Origin of the Sky&#8221;) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located south of Tulum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's a short trip by taxi or tour.

They sure knew how to live well back then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colors of the water were spectacular. For a little inspiration, check out the satellite view of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/TkuRGjgu2MzGvYSB8\">Sian Ka'an on Google Maps</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reserve includes a marine area with a reef. A a road runs along the coast and there are a handful of small hotels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it is possible to visit or stay at the beach in Sian Ka'an if you really want to get away from civilization.
