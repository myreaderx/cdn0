At least that&#8217;s the theory. The reality is a bit messier, and while these companies can narrow the search, they can&#8217;t just say &#8220;here, a cure for Parkinson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Founder Evan Feinberg got into the field when an illness he inherited made traditional lab work, as an intern at a big pharma company, difficult for him. The computational side of the field, however, was more accessible and ended up absorbing him entirely.</p>\n<p>He had dabbled in the area before and arrived at what he feels is a breakthrough in how molecules are represented digitally. Machine learning has, of course, accelerated work in many fields, biochemistry among them, but he felt that the potential of the technology had not been tapped.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think initially the attempts were to kind of cut and paste deep learning techniques, and represent molecules a lot like images, and classify them — like you&#8217;d say, this is a cat picture or this is not a cat picture,&#8221; he explained in an interview. &#8220;We represent the molecules more naturally: as graphs. A set of nodes or vertices, those are atoms, and things that connect them, those are bonds. But we&#8217;re representing them not just as <em>bond</em> or <em>no bond</em>, but with multiple contact types between atoms, spatial distances, more complex features.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"G3ELdGfwPd\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/atomwises-machine-learning-based-drug-discovery-service-raises-123-million/\">Atomwise&#8217;s machine learning-based drug discovery service raises $123 million</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Atomwise&#8217;s machine learning-based drug discovery service raises $123 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/atomwises-machine-learning-based-drug-discovery-service-raises-123-million/embed/#?secret=G3ELdGfwPd\" data-secret=\"G3ELdGfwPd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The resulting representation is richer and more complex, a more complete picture of a molecule than you&#8217;d get from its chemical formula or a stick diagram showing the different structures and bonds. Because in the world of biochemistry, nothing is as simple as a diagram. Every molecule exists as a complicated, shifting 3D shape or conformation where important aspects like the distance between two carbon formations or bonding sites is subject to many factors. Genesis attempts to model as many of those factors as it can.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Step one is the representation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the logical next step is, how does one leverage that representation to learn a function that takes an input and outputs a number, like binding affinity or solubility, or a vector that predicts multiple properties at once?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the work they&#8217;ve focused on as a company — not just creating a better model molecule, but being able to put a theoretical molecule into simulation and say, it will do this, it won&#8217;t do this, it has this quality but not that one.</p>\n<p>Some of this work may be done in partnerships, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201019005182/en/Genesis-Therapeutics-Enters-AI-driven-Multi-Target-Drug-Discovery-Partnership-with-Genentech\">such as the one Genesis has struck up with Genentech</a>, but the teams could very well find drug candidates independent of those, and for that reason the company is also establishing an internal development process.</p>\n<p>The $52M infusion ought to do a lot to push that forward, Feinberg wrote in an email:</p>\n<p>&#8220;These funds allow us to execute on a number of critical objectives, most importantly further pioneering AI technologies for drug development and advancing our therapeutics pipeline. We will be hiring more top notch AI researchers, software engineers, medicinal chemists and biotech talent, as well as building our own research labs.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LcGaSNB3wo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/flagship-pioneering-raises-1-1-billion-to-spend-on-sustainability-and-health-focused-biotech/\">Flagship Pioneering raises $1.1 billion to spend on sustainability and health-focused biotech</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Flagship Pioneering raises $1.1 billion to spend on sustainability and health-focused biotech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/flagship-pioneering-raises-1-1-billion-to-spend-on-sustainability-and-health-focused-biotech/embed/#?secret=LcGaSNB3wo\" data-secret=\"LcGaSNB3wo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Other companies are doing simulations as well and barking up the same tree, but Feinberg says Genesis has at least two legs up on them, despite the competition raising hundreds of millions and existing for years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the only company in the space that&#8217;s working at the intersection of modern deep neural network approaches and biophysical simulation — conformational change of ligands and proteins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we&#8217;re bringing this super technical platform to experts who have taken FDA-approved drugs to market. We&#8217;ve seen tremendous value creation just from that — the chemists inform the AI too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold, which is performing the complex task of simulation protein folding far faster than any previous system, is as exciting to Feinberg as to everyone else in the field.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As scientists, we are incredibly excited by recent progress in protein structure prediction. It is an important basic science advance that will ultimately have important downstream benefits to the development of novel therapeutics,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Since our Dynamic PotentialNet technology is unique in how it leverages 3D structural information of proteins, computational protein folding &#8212; similar to recent progress in cryo-EM &#8212; is a nice complementary tailwind for the Genesis AI Platform. We applaud all efforts to make protein structure more accessible such that therapeutics can be more easily developed for patients of all conditions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Also participating in the funding round were T.

But the bill does not remove qualified immunity for police, a controversial measure that shields serving police from legal action for misconduct, following objections from police groups.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Lawmakers brought the bill to the state legislature in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/\">the killing of George Floyd</a>, an unarmed Black man who was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, since charged with his murder.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vQ6eJpIA85\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/\">A beginner&#8217;s guide to diversity, equity and inclusion</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;A beginner&#8217;s guide to diversity, equity and inclusion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/embed/#?secret=vQ6eJpIA85\" data-secret=\"vQ6eJpIA85\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Critics have for years complained that facial recognition technology is flawed, biased and <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-has-always-troubled-people-of-color-everyone-should-listen/\">disproportionately misidentifies</a> people and communities of color. But the bill grants police an exception to run facial recognition searches against the state&#8217;s driver license database with a warrant. In granting that exception, the state will have to publish annual transparency figures on the number of searches made by officers.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Senate voted 28-12 to pass, and the House voted 92-67. The bill will now be sent to Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker for his signature.</p>\n<p>Kade Crockford, who leads the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, praised the bill&#8217;s passing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No one should have to fear the government tracking and identifying their face wherever they go, or facing wrongful arrest because of biased, error-prone technology,&#8221; said Crockford. In the last year, the ACLU of Massachusetts has worked with community organizations and legislators across the state to ban face surveillance in seven municipalities, from Boston to Springfield. We commend the legislature for advancing a bill to protect all Massachusetts residents from unregulated face surveillance technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the absence of privacy legislation from the federal government, laws curtailing the use of facial recognition are popping up on a state and city level. The patchwork nature of that legislation means that state and city laws have room to experiment, creating an array of blueprints for future laws that can be replicated elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Portland, Oregon passed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/\">broad ban on facial recognition tech</a> this September. The ban, one of the most aggressive in the nation, blocks city bureaus from using the technology but will also prohibit private companies from deploying facial recognition systems in public spaces. Months of clashes between protesters and aggressive law enforcement in that city raised the stakes on Portland&#8217;s ban.</p>\n<p>Earlier bans in Oakland, San Francisco and Boston focused on forbidding their city governments from using the technology but, like Massachusetts, stopped short of limiting its use by private companies. San Francisco&#8217;s ban <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban/\">passed in May of last year</a>, making the international tech hub the first major city to ban the use of facial recognition by city agencies and police departments.</p>\n<p>At the same time that cities across the U.S. are acting to limit the creep of biometric surveillance, those same systems are spreading at the federal level. In August, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) signed a contract for access to a facial recognition database <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/\">created by Clearview AI</a>, a deeply controversial company that scrapes facial images from online sources, including social media sites.</p>\n<p>While most activism against facial recognition only pertains to local issues, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/\">at least one state law</a> has proven powerful enough to make waves on a national scale. In Illinois, the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has ensnared major tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet for training facial recognition systems on Illinois residents without permission.</p>\n<p><em>Updated with comment from the ACLU of Massachusetts.</em></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vaM0Tez7Mc\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/\">Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/embed/#?secret=vaM0Tez7Mc\" data-secret=\"vaM0Tez7Mc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QciTEr9QPMM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:25 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"aeddc567c1ace59125796e6a69e7fe84","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Taylor Hatmaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-57-008_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-55-232_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-09-56-253_ccdbba703ec85bac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QciTEr9QPMM:uKJ8p3A6TVE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn100@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-56-077_14650483e151f5b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-56-389_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QciTEr9QPMM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn80@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-55-264_b175c9f3212abf8b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910987111},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","title":"Apple releases its ‘Best of 2020’ App Store winners and most downloaded apps of the year","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081350","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> today released its highly anticipated annual list of the best apps and games of 2020.

However the officials also noted that the vaccine is stable for a short period between 2-8 degrees &#8212; which they suggested will help with the challenge of distribution in care homes.</p>\n<p>The UK is obtaining its supply of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine from within the EU &#8212; from a manufacturing facility in Belgium. It&#8217;s not clear whether the impending end of the Brexit transition period will pose any logistical challenges to a smooth future supply of the vaccine &#8212; by putting a brake on Hancock&#8217;s plan to roll it out at the pace it&#8217;s manufactured. This is because negotiations are ongoing between the UK and the EU over a possible post-brexit trade deal, with concerns of major border delays resulting from customs checks in the event of no deal.</p>\n<p>Another remaining (non-UK specific) question is how long the vaccine&#8217;s protection lasts. Given how quickly the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has been developed &#8212; in a matter of months &#8212; there&#8217;s no long term data available to answer that yet.</p>\n<p>The same is true of COVID-19 vaccine candidates being developed by other companies.</p>\n<p>“The Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. will mark the first time citizens outside of the trials will have the opportunity to be immunized against COVID-19,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and co-founder of BioNTech in a supporting statement. “We believe that the roll-out of the vaccination program in the U.K. will reduce the number of people in the high-risk population being hospitalized.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our aim is to bring a safe and effective vaccine upon approval to the people who need it. The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development program.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HB6hVygV61\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-95-effective-in-final-clinical-trial-results-analysis/\">Pfizer says its COVID-19 vaccine is 95% effective in final clinical trial results analysis</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Pfizer says its COVID-19 vaccine is 95% effective in final clinical trial results analysis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-95-effective-in-final-clinical-trial-results-analysis/embed/#?secret=HB6hVygV61\" data-secret=\"HB6hVygV61\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><em>This report was updated with additional detail from press conferences and ministers comments this morning </em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oeoen5FS7IE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 09:20:52 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2705.png","linkMd5":"f1620bae737a5eee05cde586a563efaf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-533_b452f2e2c568a589.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":525,"destBytes":1088,"author":"Natasha Lomas","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2705.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-533_b452f2e2c568a589.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-55-428_bf8142499f30a23a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-57-008_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-55-232_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn19@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-56-145_3ef1a4c5974f93f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oeoen5FS7IE:dJH11fARt9w:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn80@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-56-557_5ee2660600191d5c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-56-389_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oeoen5FS7IE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-55-333_e1705077d31c95dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910987106},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","title":"Revolut launches early salary feature in the UK and web app","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081147","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Fintech startup <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com\">Revolut</a> has two new features this week. First, the company is launching a web app for its regular users — not just business users. Second, in the U.K., <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"revolut\">Revolut <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.modulrfinance.com\">Modulr</a> to let you receive your salary a day early.</p>\n<p>Revolut has historically focused its efforts on its mobile app. If you have a business account with Revolut, you know that you can see your past transactions and access your account from a regular web browser. But the company’s 13 million customers couldn’t access their account from a computer.</p>\n<p>Everyone can now head over to <a href=\"https://app.revolut.com/start\">Revolut’s web app</a> and sign in to view their transaction history and cards. From this interface, you can freeze and unfreeze a debit card and control card features. The web app also supports account top-ups using a bank transfer, a card payment or Apple Pay (in Safari).</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>By default, Revolut sends a push notification so that you can authorize web browser access. But if you’ve lost your phone, you can also choose to receive a security code via email.</p>\n<p>You’ll still have to use the mobile app to access some features, but it’s a start.</p>\n<p>As for users living in the U.K., Revolut is doubling down on its partnership with Modulr to send your salary a bit early. Salaries made over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACS\">Bacs payment scheme</a> will arrive a day earlier than usual — most people are paid using this method in the U.K. This is all about optimizing payment infrastructure, and it could be particularly helpful before a long holiday weekend.</p>\n<p>This should also benefit Revolut directly as many users have been using Revolut in addition to a regular bank account. Adding features that make it easier to ditch your bank account could boost the company’s usage numbers. And that could help the company grow its card interchange fees, subscription revenue and other sources of revenue.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9L2LcgsN900\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 07:00:53 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"99aa4255178abaeaa6878143f1ecad6c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Romain Dillet","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-57-008_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-55-232_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn59@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-56-661_dcc770d343bdcce0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9L2LcgsN900:_8uVIoe10WU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn30@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-55-232_9d8fa2c363c632a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-56-389_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9L2LcgsN900":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn84@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-56-375_f148fa51343c2e30.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910987111},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","title":"Eat Just to sell lab-grown meat in Singapore after gaining “world first” regulatory approval","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081543","description":"<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.ju.st/en-us\">Eat Just</a> will start offering lab-grown chicken meat in Singapore after gaining regulatory approval from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). The cell-cultured chicken will eventually be produced under Eat Just’s new GOOD Meat brand through partnerships with local manufacturers and go on sale to restaurants before it is available to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">While there are plenty of other companies working on lab-grown meats using various techniques, Eat Just describes the Singapore government’s review and regulatory approval as a &#8220;world first.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No chickens were killed to obtain the cell line used to produce Eat Just’s cultured meat, global head of communications Andrew Noyes told TechCrunch. Instead, the process starts with cell isolation, where cells are sourced through methods that can include a biopsy from a live animal. After the cells are cultured, they are transferred into a bioreactor, fed with a proprietary mix of proteins, amino acids, minerals, sugars, salts and other nutrients and then harvested after they achieve enough density.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company said it went through 20 productions runs of cell-cultured chicken in 1,200-liter bioreactors to prove the consistency of its manufacturing process. Eat Just also said no antibiotics were used and that its cultured chicken has an &#8220;extremely low and significantly cleaner microbiological content than conventional chicken.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Noyes said the company is already working with a restaurant to add its GOOD Meat chicken to their menu, and hopes to announce a launch date soon.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bn91s326sl\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/\">Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/embed/#?secret=bn91s326sl\" data-secret=\"bn91s326sl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In Eat Just&#8217;s announcement today, chief executive officer Josh Tetrick said, &#8220;Singapore has long been a leader in innovation of all kinds, from information technology to biologics to now leading the world in building a healthier, safer food system.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The government is currently engaged in an initiative, called &#8220;30 by 30,&#8221; to <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/strengthening-food-security-with-rd\">produce 30% of the country’s food supply</a> locally by 2030. Spearheaded by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the initiative was prompted because Singapore currently imports over 90% of its food, which makes it vulnerable to export bans or the logistics issues highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. As part of &#8220;30 by 30,&#8221; the SFA and Agency for Science, Technology and Research has made $144 million SGD in research funding available.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eat Just, whose other products include <a href=\"https://www.ju.st/en-us/products/consumer/egg/folded\">a plant-based egg substitute</a>, announced last month it is partnering with Proterra Investment Partners Asia to launch a new Asian subsidiary. The partnership includes a factory in Singapore that received support from the government’s Economic Development board.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are several factors driving demand for cultured meat and plant-based protein in Asian markets. The first is concerns about the safety of meat from slaughterhouses that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also highlighted vulnerabilities in the production and supply chain that can be potentially be avoided with lab-produced meat and meat alternatives.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aFojFRxvgW\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/eat-just-partners-with-proterra-to-launch-a-new-subsidiary-in-asia/\">Eat Just partners with Proterra to launch a new subsidiary in Asia</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Eat Just partners with Proterra to launch a new subsidiary in Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/eat-just-partners-with-proterra-to-launch-a-new-subsidiary-in-asia/embed/#?secret=aFojFRxvgW\" data-secret=\"aFojFRxvgW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/LzTWuriOwQA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:07:52 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b1a55ecf700363b9d9951f3858e0a519","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Catherine Shu","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-57-008_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-55-232_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-56-345_57227b2faff9a7f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=LzTWuriOwQA:lwhRCfU6TcM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn64@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-56-664_e454105e79dae888.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-56-389_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/LzTWuriOwQA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn68@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-55-263_50e9664988744a66.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910987112},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","title":"Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is now available","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081499","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Back in October <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-hi-speed-iphone-event-today/\">announced the MagSafe Duo</a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, a folding travel charger capable of charging both the iPhone and either an Apple Watch or AirPods simultaneously/wirelessly.

This year, however, Spotify is making a few changes. For starters, Wrapped will be exclusively available on mobile for Spotify users, while a web experience will offer a version of Wrapped for non-Spotify users for the first time. To reflect Spotify&#8217;s continuing investment in podcasts, Wrapped will also this year include a deeper look into users&#8217; podcast listening habits. And it will include new features, like in-app quizzes, a &#8220;Story of Your 2020&#8221; dedicated to users&#8217; top song of the year, new Wrapped badges, personalized playlists, customization options for social sharing, and other additions.</p>\n<p>The feature will launch in the Spotify mobile app for iOS and Android in global markets to give users their year-end insights. But non-users will get a taste of Wrapped with a web version, where Spotify will share its broader global listening trends, including the most-streamed artist, top three podcasts, and other popular music insights.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2081050\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2081050\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2081050\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NUX-2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2081050\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Spotify on Tuesday <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/the-trends-that-shaped-streaming-in-2020/\">had shared</a> some of these trends, noting that Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny had claimed the top spot with more than 8.3 billion streams in 2020.

Now it&#8217;s up to Salesforce leadership to prove that the huge buy will help boost the company&#8217;s growth.</p>\n<p>Salesforce told investors today that it anticipates Q4 fiscal 2021 revenues of $5.665 billion to $5.675 billion, which works out to growth of around 17% from the year-ago period. The company also anticipates that it will grow around 17% in Q1 of its fiscal 2022.</p>\n<p>But Salesforce expects to grow 21% in all of its fiscal 2022. How does it intend to accelerate? Its projections include Slack:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Full Year FY22 revenue guidance includes contributions from Slack Technologies, Inc. of approximately $600 million, net of purchase accounting, and assumes a closing date in late Q2 and Acumen Solutions, Inc. of approximately $150 million, net of purchase accounting, and assumes a closing date within Q2.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, Salesforce investors, after two anticipated quarters of 17% growth coming up, your company will accelerate up to 21% growth for the next fiscal year.

This year has undoubtedly seen a huge shift in how those conferences exist. The Covid-19 health pandemic has drastically curtailed travel and how people spend time in crowded places, decimating the wider event industry, <a href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/events-industry-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated</a> to be worth more than $1 trillion annually before Covid, in its wake.</p>\n<p>Today, however, comes news of a significant round of funding for a startup that is showing one way out of the mess. <a href=\"https://www.bizzabo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bizzabo</a>, which provides a platform to plan and run both virtual and in-person conferences, from its earliest stages of conception and handling sponsorships, through to managing interactions between attendees, and provisioning the conference itself, has closed a round of $138 million &#8212; funding it will use to drive the growth of its business, said CEO Eran Ben-Shushan (who co-founded the company with Alon Alroy and Boaz Katz) in an interview, after seeing that business boom this year, running conferences for large businesses and event planners. (Its customers include companies like Uber, Gainsight, Github, WeWork, Accenture and actually &#8212; disclosure &#8211;TechCrunch.)</p>\n<p>Revenue has grown 100%, with the number of events organized through Bizzabo up 65%, he said, with the number of attendees registering for events with Bizzabo up 500% and overall usage is up 150x.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;With a vaccine likely and more hybrid events in the future, we anticipate even greater growth,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Bizzabo has been the category leader, experiencing hyper-growth both pre-pandemic and during the virtual transition, we are excited to continue to lead the market forward by doubling down on product, technology, and user experience, to help organizations unlock the power of hybrid experiences.”</p>\n<p>He said that will include the building of more tech to integrate virtual and in-person experiences, and tripling its engineering, product and experience teams, adding two new offices in Europe for the Tel Aviv-New York startup.</p>\n<p>This Series E is being led by Insight Partners, the VC known for its big growth investments; previous backers Viola Growth, Next47, and OurCrowd also participated. Viola led Bizzabo&#8217;s previous round, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/bizzabo-series-d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$27 million Series D </a>in April 2019. Ben-Shushan did not disclose the valuation in this round except to say that it has grown by 400% since then. The company has raised some $195 million to date, and for some further context on valuation, recall that Hopin &#8212; another platform to help manage events online &#8212; last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raised $125 million at a $2 billion+ valuation</a>.</p>\n<p>Bizzabo started life in 2011 positioning itself as the &#8220;Salesforce for events.&#8221; Leaning heavily on cloud architecture and providing integrations into the many productivity and communication tools that an event organizer might use, the idea was to provide a platform to knit all that together and give organizers a way of using apps and online services to extend touch points between and with attendees. That could take the form of registration software to sign people up and collect payments for would-be attendees; chatrooms for people at specific sessions, better ways for exhibitors and sponsors to connect with visitors, and for those visitors to connect with each other during and after the event.</p>\n<p>All of that changed this year when key in-person events <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">started to get cancelled</a>. At first these just disappeared into a black hole with virtually nothing to replace them, and then gradually, as the year went on, organisers started to look for virtual alternatives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The virtual conference market was almost non-existent&#8221; before 2020, said Ben-Shushan. &#8220;Pre Covid, a fraction of events were virtual, less than 2% of total events. March 2020 started the ‘virtual transition period’ in which live events were no longer possible in most parts of the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That move dovetailed with a bigger shift in workplace communications: a huge surge of video use spearheaded by the likes of Zoom, Google, Microsoft and many others that had built platforms for people not just to speak to each other over the internet, but to see each other, too. While videoconferencing has been around for years, much of it was based around very costly hardware and software packages used mostly by large corporates. The big innovation was leveraging the growth of faster internet, better basic computers and cameras, and the cloud to make videoconferencing something anyone can use.</p>\n<p>Event organisers seized the moment and the bigger events, which had already been offering streams of their live events to those who could not attend in person, started to think of how to shift the whole experience online. That was a whole new set of demands on organisers and those participating in the conferences, but turned out to be just one more thing to add in and consider for the likes of Bizzabo. It hasn&#8217;t rebuilt its platform but has just continued to extend what it does within in.</p>\n<p>For example, it didn&#8217;t offer streaming as a core part of its service, but it&#8217;s very much a part of it now, in partnership with <a href=\"https://corp.kaltura.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kaltura</a>, which provides live streaming technology as a service.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, while a lot of that been in effort to &#8220;make up the difference&#8221; and has resulted in some interesting approaches to provide new, and sometimes even better, bridges between people, some Bizzabo does not think the live event should be left for dead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our data shows that although there are meaningful advantages to virtual events (higher reach, lower production costs), event organizers and attendees want to go back to live events,&#8221; said Ben-Shusan. &#8220;2021 will mark a new era in the event industry &#8211; the hybrid era that integrates experiences of remote and live participants.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hybrid will indeed be the name of the game, it seems, even if we still may have a lot of question marks over how big that game will be after all this is over. Inevitably, some events may never come back.</p>\n<p>“COVID-19 has permanently transformed the professional events category,” said Matt Gatto, a Managing Director at Insight Partners, who will join the Bizzabo board of directors, in a statement. “Bizzabo’s impressive growth and momentum began pre-pandemic and accelerated during it as they launched the industry’s first end-to-end event technology solution. Their pedigree in both in-person and virtual events and their impressive execution capabilities have them well-positioned to lead this rapidly evolving space.

All we really know at this point is that he cofounded the company with Alejandro Crosa, an Argentinian software engineer who most recently spent five months at Slack but logged more than three years at both Twitter and LinkedIn before that.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Nash said on Twitter that the two met at LinkedIn, where Nash was himself VP of product management for four years beginning in 2007. It&#8217;s a good detail to know, considering that Nash has logged time at a wide variety of tech outfits over the years, making it hard to guess at whom he knows and from where.</p>\n<p>A computer science graduate of Stanford, where he later nabbed a master&#8217;s degree, Nash began his career interning at NASA, HP, and Trilogy before landing his first big job as a software engineer at Apple in 1996 (when former PepsiCo exec, John Sculley, was briefly running the place).</p>\n<p>After moving on to a bubble-era company that no longer exists, Nash tried his hand at VC for the first time, joining Atlas Venture as an associate. To get more operating experience, he then jumped to eBay, where he was a director; LinkedIn, where he met Crosa; then Greylock, where he spent just over a year as an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) before joining the wealth-management startup <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/wealthfront\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"wealthfront\">Wealthfront <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> as its president and CEO.</p>\n<p>A little more than four years later,  in 2016, Wealthfront&#8217;s original CEO and founder, Andy Rachleff, reclaimed the role. But Nash didn&#8217;t disappear from the scene. Instead, he rejoined Greylock as an EIR for another year before joining Dropbox shortly after it went public in 2018 as its VP of product and growth, leaving that post back in February to start his own thing, <a href=\"https://adamnash.blog/2020/02/28/a-new-year-a-new-adventure/\">he said on his way out the door</a>.</p>\n<p>That Nash would start a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"aax-b20d\">fintech <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> company specifically isn&#8217;t surprising, considering his involvement with Wealthfront, as well as some of the personal investments he has made in recent years.</p>\n<p>In 2018, for example, he wrote a check to <a href=\"https://learnlux.com/\">LearnLux</a>, a five-year-old, Boston-based educational startup that helps employees better understand their 401k, health savings accounts, and stock options. He is also an investor in <a href=\"https://humaninterest.com/\">Human Interest</a>, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based startup that offers automated, paperless 401(k) plans.</p>\n<p>Nash is also riding a very big wave.  According to Pitchbook, consumer fintech is on pace to attract a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/\">record amount</a> of venture funding in 2020, at least in North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>Either way, it&#8217;s notable that Nash is trying his hand at starting a company from scratch for the first time in his career, and we&#8217;ll let you know more about what he&#8217;s building as soon as he&#8217;s ready to share more.</p>\n<p>The little that Nash is saying publicly for now is that he and Crosa believe there is &#8220;still a lot more to do in consumer fintech, and that through software we can help bring purpose to the way people approach their financial lives.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XZvp60BZqts\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:34:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"579a51e27218a64449e408d89d037d3c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Connie Loizos","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-47-539_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-57-008_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-55-232_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn74@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-55-295_f5a9322b099c8038.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XZvp60BZqts:bNxgS8m2ZQc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-55-259_cd717d850a0b8deb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-56-389_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XZvp60BZqts":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn95@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-09-56-657_bc4de95e7e553317.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910987098},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","title":"Announcing TechCrunch’s 2021 Event Calendar","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081325","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">We know that you’re hard at work building the next great startup, so we want to get our events on your radar early for next year.
