The proliferation of online communities has helped spawn novel strategies for promoting political causes, conducting business, finding sex and love, and transforming culture.</p><p>Could online communities also transform behavior in the financial world?</p><p>That's one of the key questions explored in a new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01847.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> published on the preprint server arXiv. Titled \"Reddit's self-organised bull runs: Social contagion and asset prices,\" the study used discussion data from the subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WallStreetBets</a> to analyze relationships between the price of stocks and \"hype\" among online retail investors.</p><p>Hype is nothing new in the investing world. But the researchers noted that there seems to be something novel about the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">short squeeze</a> of GameStop's stock in January, when the price of the stock rose tenfold, thanks largely to self-organized retail investors from WallStreetBets.</p><p>\"As academics and regulators alike grapple with the implications, many wonder whether large-scale coordination among retail investors is the new 'modus operandi,' or a one-off fluke,\" the researchers wrote. \"We argue that this is a new manifestation of a well-established global phenomenon.\"</p><p>To better understand how online hype is associated with stock prices, the researchers focused on two social components of hype: contagion and consensus. Contagion refers to investors spreading interest in an asset among each other, while consensus refers to their ability to agree on whether to buy or sell an asset.</p><p>The analysis found empirical evidence that both contagion and consensus emerge in online communities like WallStreetBets. In other words, investors spread sentiments about future stock performance to other investors, and then they cohere around investment strategies. </p><h2>Popularity over fundamentals</h2><p>The findings suggest that an asset's popularity, not its fundamentals, is paramount to many investors.</p><p>\"Our results consistently show that investors become interested in discussing an asset, not because of fundamentals, but because other users discuss it,\" the researchers wrote. \"Subsequently, this paper tests whether an individual's sentiment about future asset performance [is] affected by those of others. We find that this is the case: people look to their peers to form an opinion about an asset's potential.\"</p><p>To find evidence for social contagion among online investors, the researchers compiled a large dataset of posts and comments submitted to WallStreetBets. The goal was to analyze whether investors' past comments or posts about a given stock, such as Tesla, had a predictable effect on future discussions of that asset within WallStreetBets. </p><p>After conducting a regression analysis, the results suggest that hype is socially contagious and cyclical. The cycle usually plays out like this: A small group of investors hypes an asset. This attracts a larger group of investors who join the discussions.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0345eeaab6a3dbdd512388b1fef3e01a\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"93cf8\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM4NTA4OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzUyNzQzMn0.xY8sUsIJNmNRRshrkUBPd4BicFzWCOAYLyK7plDZYk8/img.png?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01847.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Semenova & Winkler</a></small></p><p>But eventually, too many investors have joined the discussion, and fewer new investors are buying into the hype. As investors lose interest, they spend less time discussing (or \"spreading\") the asset on the forum, and they turn to new opportunities. The process is similar to a virus: As enough people become infected, they reach herd immunity, and the virus (hype) dies out.<br/></p><p>So, does this process affect the stock price, and if so, how? The researchers said it was difficult to establish causality between hype and actual market activity. After all, they didn't have access to the trading records of subscribers to WallStreetBets. </p><p>But their model did show that activity on WallStreetBets was able to explain \"significant variance\" in trading volumes for the most-discussed assets on the forum. This suggests that when social contagion is strong for a given asset, consensus is strong too. </p><p>On the stock chart, consensus may start off bullish (or positively): As hype spreads, there's a slow, steady run-up in price. But the growth eventually becomes unstable and is followed by a crash and a period of volatility. </p><p>\"The price crash stems from panic selling, as investors turn nervous in the face of volatility,\" the researchers wrote.</p><h2>Bad news spreads faster than good news</h2><p>Interestingly, the analysis found that bearish (or negative) sentiments were significantly more contagious on WallStreetBets. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The data demonstrates that authors who previously commented on a bearish post are 47.7% more likely to express bearish over neutral sentiments, and 18.1% less likely to express bullish sentiments over neutral sentiments.

For the tests, the researchers simulated three real-world magnetic fields. As the various magnetic fields were activated, the sharks' movements were captured by GoPro cameras and their average swimming orientations calculated by software.<br/></p><p>The first simulation, serving as a control, mimicked the magnetic field of the nearby shoal from which the sharks had been captured. When this field was activated, the sharks essentially acted like they were \"home,\" just swimming around as they do.</p><p>A second field was the magnetic equivalent of a location 600 kilometers south of the lab within the Gulf of Mexico. When this field was activated, the sharks, apparently mistaking themselves for being far south in the Gulf, began swimming northward toward the shoal.</p><p>The opposite occurred with a field standing in for a location in continental North America 600 km north of their home shoal — the sharks began swimming southward.</p><h2>Suspicion confirmed</h2><p>\"For 50 years,\" says Keller, \"scientists have hypothesized that sharks use the magnetic field as a navigational aid. This theory has been so popular because sharks, skates, and rays have been shown to be very sensitive to magnetic fields. They have also been trained to react to unique geomagnetic signatures, so we know they are capable of detecting and reacting to variation in the magnetic field.\"</p><p>His team's experiments confirm what's long been suspected, Keller says: \"Sharks use map-like information from the geomagnetic field as a navigational aid.

Emily Ury, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></p><h2>The insidious role of salt</h2><p>Sea level rise <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-4-sea-level-rise-and-implications-for-low-lying-islands-coasts-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">driven by climate change</a> is making wetlands wetter in many parts of the world. It's also making them saltier. </p><p>In 2016 I began working in a forested North Carolina wetland to study the effect of salt on its plants and soils. Every couple of months, I suit up in heavy rubber waders and a mesh shirt for protection from biting insects, and haul over 100 pounds of salt and other equipment out along the flooded trail to my research site. We are salting an area about the size of a tennis court, seeking to mimic the effects of sea level rise. </p><p>After two years of effort, the salt didn't seem to be affecting the plants or soil processes that we were monitoring. I realized that instead of waiting around for our experimental salt to slowly kill these trees, the question I needed to answer was how many trees had already died, and how much more wetland area was vulnerable. To find answers, I had to go to sites where the trees were already dead. </p><p>Rising seas are inundating North Carolina's coast, and saltwater is seeping into wetland soils. Salts move through groundwater during phases when freshwater is depleted, such as during droughts. Saltwater also moves through canals and ditches, penetrating inland with help from wind and high tides. Dead trees with pale trunks, devoid of leaves and limbs, are a telltale sign of high salt levels in the soil. A 2019 report called them “<a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/videos/the-seeds-of-ghost-forests/\" target=\"_blank\">wooden tombstones</a>.\" </p><p>As the trees die, more salt-tolerant shrubs and grasses move in to take their place.

You sit behind a desk, or in some designated space, and you work until the clock says it's over. This is what life is like for the vast majority of people. That is, until COVID came along. Then, everything changed.</p><p>Recently, an interesting idea has emerged called the \"Great Resignation.\" This is a phenomenon that Professor Anthony Klotz of Texas A&M University has predicted will happen when people are asked, or told, to return to their offices. Klotz argues that, when we're all forced back into the old reality of the commute, a nine-to-five job, and cubicle life, there will be a \"Great Resignation\" among the workforce. </p><p>The argument is that in times of uncertainty and insecurity — like during a global pandemic — people behave conservatively. They'll stay put. But once things \"normalize\" again, we ought to expect employees to head for the exits.</p><p>But why? What has changed? Why has working from home made us so dissatisfied with our previously normal lives? Other than the comfort and convenience of working from home, one explanation might involve the concept of \"normalization,\" a topic that fascinated French philosopher Michel Foucault.</p><h2>The power of normal people</h2><p>Foucault argued that we often spend an inordinate amount of time trying to be normal. We must dress the same way as everyone else. We must talk about the same things. We must work just like everyone else works. It's hugely important that things are normal. But, behind all of this, is a power dynamic that many of us are simply unaware of — and unconsciously unhappy about. </p><p>Someone, somewhere, must define what is \"normal.\" It is then for the rest of us to bend over backward to fit into this narrow mold. To be powerful, then, is to say, \"Do this, otherwise everyone will call you weird.\" Power is to hold the hoops everyone else must jump through. It's what Foucault describes as \"normalizing power.\"</p><h2>COVID was a wake-up call to the abnormality of modern work</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"2b0a1565a46e3a7cf1003a5948d23fb0\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"a6195\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5ODkyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDk2MzU2M30.1P2RqoNmbotbH9lmQRBqGZqTSZ4fwGGsGDXZBV39Q88/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/chinese-commuters-wear-protective-masks-as-they-exit-a-news-photo/1230831262?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&photographer=Lintao+Zhang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lintao Zhang</a> via Getty Images</small></p><p>Let's apply Focault's normalization concept to the modern workplace. Accepted wisdom had it that the best — and really, the <em>only</em> way — to work was in an office, usually downtown, far away from where we live. We were told this is where collaboration and creativity occur. Largely unchallenged, this \"normal\" functioned for decades, and we all obeyed.<br/></p><p>We had to wake up at the crack of dawn to get ready for work. We had to travel in clogged and joyless commutes. We had to eat ready-packaged lunches behind our too-small desks. We had to sit through meetings in \"good posture\" ergonomic chairs that wouldn't be out of place in the Spanish Inquisition. Then we had to travel back home in yet another clogged and joyless commute. And we did this day after day after day.</p><p>Then COVID came along and revealed just how artificial, unnecessary, and <em>ab</em>normal it all is. It's as if someone ripped a blindfold off of society. We have laptops, wi-fi, and 5G (at least when people aren't burning the towers down). Many of us were just as productive — if not <em>more</em> so — than during the \"normal\" pre-COVID era. We don't need to be in an office. We don't need to waste countless hours of our lives sitting in traffic. </p><blockquote>While the idea of a Great Resignation is quite appealing right now, we should be careful the \"new normal\" isn't so much worse.</blockquote><p>Even better, people got to spend more time with their families, enjoy long and restful breaks, and have space to pursue their hobbies. In short, people like not going to an office. And, as Klotz argues, when companies see this dissatisfaction — this Great Resignation — they're going to ask some revolutionary questions, like, \"Do you want to come back full time? Work remotely? In-office three days a week? Four days? One day?\"</p><p>The silver lining to the COVID pandemic is that it has made us re-examine what \"normal\" is.</p><h2>Beware the new normal</h2><p>Of course, the idea of a nine-to-five office job was not established by some moustache-twirling villain just to satisfy his sadistic whims. It came about because people thought that was the most effective and productive way to operate.</p><p>People do need direct human contact, and it's often easier and more productive to speak to a colleague next to you or walk across an office to ask for some help. Remote-working software like Zoom is indeed convenient, but can a company honestly say that it's as efficient as working in an office?</p><p>What's more, there's a particularly pernicious sting in what Foucault argued. It's something that ought to slow any would-be Great Resignation. This is the idea that there likely will <em>always</em> be some kind of normal. </p><p>While COVID has revealed the office for the normalized power play that it is, what's to say what the next \"normal\" will be? Let's say that working from home becomes the new normal. Will we be expected to attend Zoom meetings at any hour of the day or answer text messages at midnight? Might cameras be used to monitor our every movement? Might software check that we're working at the right pace and in the right way?</p><ul></ul><p>While the idea of a Great Resignation is quite appealing right now, we should be careful the \"new normal\" isn't so much worse.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/f5dcvIo_oCY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 May 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5ODkxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTM2Njg1M30.8hwUv16Lv9yYGCp0-I9U71Tlisx5V4wKRz5Q0nta_RE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C220%2C0%2C220&height=700","linkMd5":"004e91166588d27de5c768e94b682c8b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn75@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-197_9dd3bbcab298de58.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":48586,"destBytes":48586,"author":"Jonny Thomson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5ODkxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTM2Njg1M30.8hwUv16Lv9yYGCp0-I9U71Tlisx5V4wKRz5Q0nta_RE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C220%2C0%2C220&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn75@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-197_9dd3bbcab298de58.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5ODkyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDk2MzU2M30.1P2RqoNmbotbH9lmQRBqGZqTSZ4fwGGsGDXZBV39Q88/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-32-107_a619507e19dc4640.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/f5dcvIo_oCY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn61@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-31-807_bf5afbc31e650f64.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161068},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Why professional soccer players choke during penalty kicks","link":"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/choking-under-pressure","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM3OTkxMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTA4MzAwOH0.CtJZy2xZiONIN4Y0GrrsKLMpJ7YpZ9VnyYA9_UddPgc/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C31%2C0%2C19&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul>  <li>The new study is the first to use in-the-field imaging technology to measure brain activity as people delivered penalty kicks.</li><li>Participants were asked to kick a total of 15 penalty shots under three different scenarios, each designed to be increasingly stressful.</li><li>Kickers who missed shots showed higher activity in brain areas that were irrelevant to kicking a soccer ball, suggesting they were overthinking.</li></ul><hr/><p>In a 2019 soccer match, Swansea City was down 1-0 against West Brom late in the first half. A penalty was called against West Brom. Swansea midfielder Bersant Celina was preparing to deliver a penalty kick. He scuttled up to the ball, but his foot only made partial contact, lobbing it weakly to the right.</p><p>Was it a simple mistake? Maybe. But there might be deeper explanations for why professional athletes choke under high-pressure situations. </p><p>A new study published in <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2021.661466/full\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Frontiers in Computer Science</em></a> used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to analyze the brain activity of inexperienced and experienced soccer players as they missed penalty shots. Although past research has explored why soccer players miss penalty shots, the recent study is the first to do so using in-the-field fNIRS measurement.</p><p>The results showed that kickers who choked were activating parts of their brain associated with long-term thinking, self-instruction, and self-reflection. The chokers, in other words, were overthinking it.</p><p><strong>The psychology of penalty kicks</strong></p><p>Penalty shots offer an interesting case study of how mental pressure affects physical performance. After all, there's a lot at stake, not only because the kick can sometimes render a win or loss, but also because there are sometimes millions of people anxiously watching, some of whom might have a financial interest in the outcome. </p><p>That pressure is no joke. For example, research on Men's World Cup penalty shoot-outs has shown that when the score is tied and a goal means an immediate win, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/sports/soccer/31penaltykicks.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&src=un&feedurl=http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/sports/soccer/index.jsonp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">players score 92 percent of kicks</a>. But when teams are facing elimination in a shootout, and the kick determines an immediate tie or loss, players only score 60 percent of the time.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"How can it be that football players with a near perfect control over the ball (they can very precisely kick a ball over more than 50 meters) fail to score a penalty kick from only 11 meters?\" study co-author Max Slutter, of the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said in a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/f-htt042821.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Obviously, huge psychological pressure plays a role, but why does this pressure cause a missed penalty? We tried to answer this by measuring the brain activity of football players during the physical execution of a penalty kick.\"</p><p>In the new study, the researchers aimed to answer two key questions about choking under pressure among both experienced and inexperienced players: (1) What is the difference in brain activity between success (scoring) and failure (missing) when taking a penalty kick? (2) What brain activity is associated with performing under pressure during a penalty kick situation?</p><p>To find out, the researchers asked ten experienced soccer players and twelve inexperienced players to participate in a penalty-kicking task.

They wore a fNIRS-equipped headset during the task that measured activity in various parts of the brain.</p><p>All participants performed worse in the second and third rounds and reported experiencing the most pressure in the third round.

While the term \"mental restlessness\" <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OMAtAAAAYAAJ\" target=\"_blank\">dates back</a> to 1798, English pediatrician George Still described the disorder in front of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1902. The condition is attributed to both nature and nurture, with a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481311/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent study</a> suggesting the disorder is 75 percent genetic. </p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-the-basics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DSM-IV criteria</a>, ADHD affects five to seven percent of children; but according to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=O3sSd-OAdP0C\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ICD-10</a>, only between one and two percent are afflicted. Global estimates <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/gbd/summaries/diseases/adhd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">state</a> that nearly 85 million people suffer from ADHD, which, like autism, exists on a spectrum. </p><p>Treatment is perhaps the most contentious issue. While a holistic approach includes counseling, lifestyle changes, and medication, due to insurance requirements and other factors, many children only receive the latter. And now a new <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2778451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">systematic scoping review</a> published in the journal <em>JAMA Network Open</em> that investigated 334 studies conducted between 1979 and 2020 found that ADHD is being both overdiagnosed and overtreated in children and adolescents. </p><h2>ADHD: An epidemic of overdiagnosis</h2><p>Researchers from the University of Sydney and the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Australia initially retrieved 12,267 relevant studies before using a set of criteria that whittled the list down to 334. Only five studies critically investigated the costs and benefits of treating milder cases of ADHD, prompting the team to focus on knowledge gaps in side effects. </p><p>The team writes that public scrutiny has increased along with the increase in diagnoses. The numbers are startling: between 1997 and 2016, the number of children reported to be suffering from ADHD <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2698633\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">doubled</a>. While the symptoms of ADHD include fidgeting, inattention, and impulsivity, Dr. Stephen Hinshaw compared this disorder to depression, as neither condition has \"unequivocal biological markers.\" He <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/over-past-20-years-the-percentage-of-children-with-adhd-nearly-doubles/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">continues</a>, \"It's probably not a true epidemic of ADHD. It might be an epidemic of diagnosing it.\"</p><p>The Australian researchers write that ambiguous or mild symptoms might contribute to diagnostic inflation and the subsequent rise in the prevalence of ADHD. They compare this to cancer, a field that has established protocols for overdiagnosis. ADHD is still understudied in this regard.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"790cc091ad013a5f8e837731f04ced31\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"fb220\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwNTYwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNjkyNjI1NH0.XSAlOfoOaVthqp-zxRiA09rQjEozDH3r2yFKDLGGUIo/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Photo: fizkes / Adobe Stock</small></p><h2>Overdiagnosis is harmful<br/></h2><p>This has contributed to an increase in potential harm, not just to children's health (such as the long-term pharmacological impact on developing brains) but to parents' finances.

The authors write:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"We found evidence of benefits for academic outcomes, injuries, hospital admissions, criminal behavior, and quality of life. In addition, harmful outcomes were evident for heart rate and cardiovascular events, growth and weight, risk for psychosis and tics, and stimulant misuse or poisoning.\"</p><p>For most of these studies, the benefits outweighed the risks in children suffering from more severe ADHD. But this is not true for children with milder symptoms. </p><p>Across the studies, the team noticed that four themes emerged. The first two were positive, and the second two were negative:</p><ol><li>For some people, an ADHD diagnosis was shown to create a sense of empowerment because a biological explanation provided a sense of legitimacy.</li><li>Feelings of empowerment enabled help-seeking behavior.</li><li>For others, a biomedical explanation led to disempowerment because it served as an excuse and provided a way to shirk responsibility. </li><li>An ADHD diagnosis was linked to stigmatization and social isolation.</li></ol><ul></ul><p>The unfortunate reality is that ADHD is a real condition that should be treated in some children.

We can't seem to get enough of happiness advice, wellness gurus, and life coaches. But, as the Book of Ecclesiastes says, there is nothing new under the sun. The Ancient Greeks were into the self-help business millennia before the likes of Dale Carnegie and Mark Manson.</p><h2>Four schools of ancient Greek philosophy</h2><p>From the 3rd century BCE until the birth of Jesus, Greek philosophy was locked into an ideological war. Four rival schools emerged, each proclaiming loudly that they — alone — had the secret to a happy and fulfilled life. These schools were: Stoicism, Cynicism, Skepticism, and Epicureanism. Each had their advocates and even had a kind of PR battle to get people to sign up to their side. They were trying to sell happiness.</p><blockquote>Epicurus's guide to living is noticeably different from a lot of modern self-help books in just how little day-to-day advice it gives. </blockquote><p>Many of us are familiar with Stoicism, a topic I covered <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/stoicism-help-you-stop-worrying\" target=\"_self\">recently</a>, because it forms the foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy. Skepticism and Cynicism have become watered down or warped variations of their original forms. (I will cover these in future articles.) Today, we focus on the most underappreciated of these schools, the Epicureans. In their philosophy, we can find a surprisingly modern and easy-to-follow \"Four Part Remedy\" to life.</p><h2>Epicureans: The first atheists</h2><p>The Epicureans were some of history's first materialists.<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/ancient-physics-democritus-predicted-atom\" target=\"_self\"> They believed that the world was made up only of atoms (and void)</a>, and that everything is simply a particular composition of these atoms. There were no gods, spirits, or souls (or, at most, they're irrelevant to the world as we encounter it). They thought that there was no afterlife or immortality to be had, either. Death is just a relocation of atoms. This atheism and materialism was what the Christian Church would later come to despise, and after centuries of being villainized by priests, popes, and church doctrine, the Epicureans fell out of fashion. </p><p>In the atomistic, worldly philosophy of the Epicureans, all there is to life is to get as much pleasure as you can and avoid pain. This isn't to become some rampant hedonist, staggering from opium dens to brothels, but concerns the <em>higher</em> pleasures of the mind.</p><p>Epicurus, himself, believed that pleasure was defined as the satisfying of a desire, such as when we drink a glass of water when we're really thirsty. But, he also argued that desires themselves were painful since they, by definition, meant longing and anguish. Thirst is a desire, and we don't like being thirsty. True contentment, then, could not come from creating and indulging pointless wants but must instead come from minimizing desire altogether. What would be the point of setting ourselves new targets? These are just new desires that we must make efforts to satisfy. Thus, minimizing pain meant minimizing desires, and the bare minimum desires were those required to live.</p><h2>The Four Part Remedy</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8771623602bf5ff714564d29ed7255bb\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"fb439\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5MDQwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMTI1MjI1Mn0.tmMK8sogwVrcqKAf8vISJWntYcsDnAI8AgicZkZwA_0/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/people-listen-to-a-speech-by-a-philosopher-during-the-xxiii-news-photo/175741687?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&photographer=LOUISA+GOULIAMAKI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LOUISA GOULIAMAKI</a> via Getty Images</small></p><p>Given that Epicureans were determined to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, they developed a series of rituals and routines designed to help. One of the best known (not least because we've lost so much written by the Epicureans) was the so-called \"Four Part Remedy.\" These were four principles they believed we ought to accept so that we might find solace and be rid of existential and spiritual pain:<br/></p><p><strong>1. Don't fear God. </strong>Remember, everything is just atoms. You won't go to hell, and you won't go to heaven. The \"afterlife\" will be nothingness, in just the same way as when you had no awareness whatsoever of the dinosaurs or Cleopatra. There was simply nothing before you existed, and death is a great expanse of the same timeless, painless void.</p><p><strong>2. Don't worry about death. </strong>This is a natural corollary of Step 1. With no body, there is no pain. In death, we lose all of our desires and, along with them, suffering and discontent. It's striking how <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/axial-age-greatest-minds-walked-earth\" target=\"_self\">similar in tone this sounds</a> to a lot of Eastern, especially Buddhist, philosophy at the time.</p><p><strong>3. What is good is easy to get. </strong>Pleasure comes in satisfying desires, specifically the basic, biological desires required to keep us alive. Anything more complicated than this, or harder to achieve, just creates pain. There's water to be drunk, food to be eaten, and beds to sleep in. That's all you need.</p><p><strong>4. What is terrible is easy to endure. </strong>Even if it is difficult to satisfy the basic necessities, remember that pain is short-lived. We're rarely hungry for long, and sicknesses most often will be cured easily enough (and this was written 2300 years before antibiotics). All other pains often can be mitigated by pleasures to be had. If basic biological necessities can't be met, then you die — but we already established there is nothing to fear from death.</p><h2>Practical Epicureanism</h2><p>Epicurus's guide to living is noticeably different from a lot of modern self-help books in just how little day-to-day advice it gives. It doesn't tell us \"the five things you need to do before breakfast\" or \"visit these ten places, and you'll never be sad again.\" Just like it's rival school of <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/stoicism-help-you-stop-worrying\" target=\"_self\">Stoicism</a>, Epicureanism is all about a psychological shift of some kind.</p><p>Namely, that psychological shift is about recognizing that life doesn't need to be as complicated as we make it. At the end of the day, we're just animals with basic needs. We have the tools necessary to satisfy our desires, but when we don't, we have huge reservoirs of strength and resilience capable of enduring it all. Failing that, we still have nothing to fear because there is nothing to fear about death. When we're alive, death is nowhere near; when we're dead, we won't care.</p><ul></ul><p>Practical, modern, and straightforward, Epicurus offers a valuable insight to life.

In a new paper, Adib's team is pushing the technology a step further. \"We're trying to give robots superhuman perception,\" he says.</p><p>The researchers have developed a robot that uses radio waves, which can pass through walls, to sense occluded objects. The robot, called RF-Grasp, combines this powerful sensing with more traditional computer vision to locate and grasp items that might otherwise be blocked from view. The advance could one day streamline e-commerce fulfillment in warehouses or help a machine pluck a screwdriver from a jumbled toolkit.</p><p>The research will be presented in May at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation. The paper's lead author is Tara Boroushaki, a research assistant in the Signal Kinetics Group at the MIT Media Lab. Her MIT co-authors include Adib, who is the director of the Signal Kinetics Group; and Alberto Rodriguez, the Class of 1957 Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Other co-authors include Junshan Leng, a research engineer at Harvard University, and Ian Clester, a PhD student at Georgia Tech.</p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><img alt=\"Video thumbnail\" src=\"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ZAzeYPcTM78/maxresdefault.jpg\"/><a target=\"_blank\">Play video</a><p><br/></p><p>As e-commerce continues to grow, warehouse work is still usually the domain of humans, not robots, despite sometimes-dangerous working conditions. That's in part because robots struggle to locate and grasp objects in such a crowded environment. \"Perception and picking are two roadblocks in the industry today,\" says Rodriguez. Using optical vision alone, robots can't perceive the presence of an item packed away in a box or hidden behind another object on the shelf — visible light waves, of course, don't pass through walls.</p><p>But radio waves can.</p><p>For decades, radio frequency (RF) identification has been used to track everything from library books to pets. RF identification systems have two main components: a reader and a tag. The tag is a tiny computer chip that gets attached to — or, in the case of pets, implanted in — the item to be tracked. The reader then emits an RF signal, which gets modulated by the tag and reflected back to the reader.</p><p>The reflected signal provides information about the location and identity of the tagged item. The technology has gained popularity in retail supply chains — Japan aims to use RF tracking for nearly all <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/akikokatayama/2019/02/26/japan-aims-to-automate-all-convenience-stores-by-2025-with-a-new-rfid-technology/?sh=34ab85f7745b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">retail purchases</a> in a matter of years. The researchers realized this profusion of RF could be a boon for robots, giving them another mode of perception.</p><p>\"RF is such a different sensing modality than vision,\" says Rodriguez. \"It would be a mistake not to explore what RF can do.\"</p><p>RF Grasp uses both a camera and an RF reader to find and grab tagged objects, even when they're fully blocked from the camera's view. It consists of a robotic arm attached to a grasping hand. The camera sits on the robot's wrist. The RF reader stands independent of the robot and relays tracking information to the robot's control algorithm. So, the robot is constantly collecting both RF tracking data and a visual picture of its surroundings. Integrating these two data streams into the robot's decision making was one of the biggest challenges the researchers faced.</p><p>\"The robot has to decide, at each point in time, which of these streams is more important to think about,\" says Boroushaki. \"It's not just eye-hand coordination, it's RF-eye-hand coordination. So, the problem gets very complicated.\"</p><p>The robot initiates the seek-and-pluck process by pinging the target object's RF tag for a sense of its whereabouts. \"It starts by using RF to focus the attention of vision,\" says Adib. \"Then you use vision to navigate fine maneuvers.\" The sequence is akin to hearing a siren from behind, then turning to look and get a clearer picture of the siren's source.</p><p>With its two complementary senses, RF Grasp zeroes in on the target object. As it gets closer and even starts manipulating the item, vision, which provides much finer detail than RF, dominates the robot's decision making.</p><p>RF Grasp proved its efficiency in a battery of tests. Compared to a similar robot equipped with only a camera, RF Grasp was able to pinpoint and grab its target object with about half as much total movement. Plus, RF Grasp displayed the unique ability to \"declutter\" its environment — removing packing materials and other obstacles in its way in order to access the target. Rodriguez says this demonstrates RF Grasp's \"unfair advantage\" over robots without penetrative RF sensing. \"It has this guidance that other systems simply don't have.\"</p><p>RF Grasp could one day perform fulfilment in packed e-commerce warehouses. Its RF sensing could even instantly verify an item's identity without the need to manipulate the item, expose its barcode, then scan it. \"RF has the potential to improve some of those limitations in industry, especially in perception and localization,\" says Rodriguez.</p><p>Adib also envisions potential home applications for the robot, like locating the right Allen wrench to assemble your Ikea chair. \"Or you could imagine the robot finding lost items. It's like a super-Roomba that goes and retrieves my keys, wherever the heck I put them.\"</p><p>The research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NTT DATA, Toppan, Toppan Forms, and the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS).</p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT News</a>.

The researchers tested out their iconic sounds in two different experiments.<br/></p><p>In an online experiment, speakers of 25 different languages were asked to match the meaning of iconic sounds to six written labels. They listened to three performances for each of the 30 candidates, 90 recordings in all.</p><p>Participants correctly identified the sounds' meaning roughly 65 percent of the time.</p><p>Some meanings were more readily understood than others. \"Sleep\" was correctly identified by almost 99 percent, as opposed to \"that,\" understood by only 35 percent. The most often understood sounds were \"eat,\" \"child,\" \"sleep,\" \"tiger,\" and \"water.\" The least? \"That,\" \"gather,\" \"sharp,\" \"dull,\" and \"knife.\" </p><p>The researchers next conducted field experiments to capture the meaningfulness of the sounds in oral cultures with inconsistent literacy levels. For these people, researchers played twelve iconic sounds for animals and inanimate objects as listeners identified each from a grid of pictures. The volunteers correctly identified the sounds' meanings about 56 percent of the time, again above the level of chance.</p><h2>The universal roots of language</h2><p>In addition to being the sounds that facilitated the birth of language, the authors of the study wonder if such commonly understood sounds may also be a factor in the similarities that exist between different modern languages that don't share a common root language.

He acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" (meaning \"little [soldier's] boot\") from his father's soldiers during a campaign. </p><p>While recognized for some positive measures in the early days of his rule, he became famous throughout the ages as an absolutely insane emperor, who killed anyone when it pleased him, spent exorbitantly, was obsessed with perverse sex, and proclaimed himself to be a living god.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ea5704ed5b012f0c31ad8982369c2383\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"55fff\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMDQxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NTIyMTM1Nn0.GeQc_PgS0n-kXbM9aEZOan_Xr-ym5VDkUAYwnISOI8I/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Caligula gives his horse Incitatus a drink during a banquet. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: An engraving by Persichini from a drawing by Pinelli, from \"The History of the Roman Emperors\" from Augustus to Constantine, by Jean Baptiste Louis Crevier. 1836. </small></p><p>Among his litany of misdeeds, according to the accounts of Caligula's contemporaries<a href=\"http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book40.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Philo</a> of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger, he slept with whomever he wanted, brazenly taking other men's wives (even on their wedding nights) and publicly talking about it. </p><p>He also had an insatiable blood thirst, killing for mere amusement. Once, as <a href=\"https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~wstevens/history331texts/caligula.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports historian Suetonius</a>, when the bridge across the sea at Puteoli was being blessed, he had a number of spectators who were there to inspect it thrown off into the water. When some tried to cling to the ships' rudders, Caligula had them dislodged with hooks and oars so they would drown. On another occasion, he got so bored that he had his guards throw a whole section of the audience into the arena during the intermission so they would be eaten by wild beasts. He also allegedly executed two consuls who forgot his birthday.</p><p>Suetonius relayed further atrocities of the mad emperor's character, <a href=\"https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~wstevens/history331texts/caligula.html\" target=\"_blank\">writing</a> that Caligula \"frequently had trials by torture held in his presence while he was eating or otherwise enjoying himself; and kept an expert headsman in readiness to decapitate the prisoners brought in from gaol.\" One particular form of torture associated with Caligula involved having people sawed in half. </p><p>He caused mass starvation and purposefully wasted money and resources, like making his troops stage fake battles just for theater. If that wasn't enough, he turned his palace into a brothel and was accused of incest with his sisters, Agrippina the Younger, Drusilla, and Livilla, whom he also prostituted to other men. Perhaps most famously, he was planning to appoint his favorite horse Incitatus a consul and<a href=\"https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28\" target=\"_blank\"> went as far</a> as making the horse into a priest. </p><p>In early 41 AD, Caligula was assassinated by a conspiracy of Praetorian Guard officers, senators, and other members of the court.</p><p><strong>2. Nero</strong> </p><p>Fully named Nero Claudius Caesar, Nero ruled from 54 to 68 AD and was arguably an even worse madman than his uncle Caligula. He had his step-brother Britannicus killed, his wife Octavia executed, and his mother Agrippina stabbed and murdered. He personally kicked to death his lover Poppeaea while she was pregnant with his child — a horrific action the Roman historian Tacitus <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/nero\" target=\"_blank\">depicted</a> as \"a casual outburst of rage.\" </p><p>He spent exorbitantly and built a 100-foot-tall bronze statue of himself called the Colossus Neronis.</p><p>He is also remembered for being strangely obsessed with music. He sang and played the lyre, although it's not likely he really fiddled as Rome burned in what is a popular myth about this crazed tyrant. As misplaced retribution for the fire which burned down a sizable portion of Rome in the year 64, he executed scores of early Christians, some of them outfitted in animal skins and brutalized by dogs, with others burned at the stake.</p><p>He died by suicide.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"720a98da44cc02c0c1b194298dcf1ffe\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"05411\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMDM4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0ODY3Mzk4OH0.6lumF7a24TxnlGpMOl4tP_Kal9siW4yHNxwR4rzatHY/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Roman Emperor Nero in the burning ruins of Rome.

Commodus</strong><br/></p><p>Like some of his counterparts, Commodus (a.k.a. Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus) thought he was a god — in his case, a reincarnation of the Greek demigod Hercules. Ruling from 176 to 192 AD, he was also known for his debauched ways and strange stunts that seemed designed to affirm his divine status. Numerous statues around the empire showed him as Hercules, a warrior who fought both men and beasts. He fought hundreds of exotic animals in an arena like a gladiator, confusing and terrifying his subjects. Once, he killed 100 lions in a single day.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a50d81c2860a2bc16a4a15259d114134\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"ff0f8\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMDM3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTU3NDkyNn0.7fgPZxVRBsk-BDamgJQPuSRbj1XyZ_6XNMOZJXjKqIY/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) questions the loyalty of his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) In Dreamworks Pictures' and Universal Pictures' Oscar-winning drama \"Gladiator,\" directed by Ridley Scott.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-emperor-of-rome-commodus-has-reason-to-question-the-news-photo/51103254\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo By Getty Images</a></small></p><p>The burning desire to kill living creatures as a gladiator for the New Year's Day celebrations in 193 AD brought about his demise. After Commodus shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning as part of the Plebeian Games leading up to New Year's, his fitness coach (aptly named Narcissus), choked the emperor to death in his bath.<br/></p><p><strong>4. Elagabalus</strong> </p><p>Officially named Marcus Aurelius Antoninus II, Elagabalus's nickname comes from his priesthood in the cult of the Syrian god Elagabal. Ruling as emperor from 218 to 222 AD, he was so devoted to the cult, which he tried to spread in Rome, that he had himself circumcised to prove his dedication. He further offended the religious sensitivities of his compatriots by essentially replacing the main Roman god Jupiter with Elagabal as the chief deity. In another nod to his convictions, he installed on Palatine Hill a cone-like fetish made of black stone as a symbol of the Syrian sun god Sol Invictus Elagabalus.</p><p>His sexual proclivities were also not well received at the time. He was likely transgender (wearing makeup and wigs), had five marriages, and was quite open about his male lovers. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=39ENDgAAQBAJ\" target=\"_blank\">According</a> to the Roman historian (and the emperor's contemporary) Cassius Dio, Elagabalus prostituted himself in brothels and taverns and was one of the first historical figures on record to be looking for sex reassignment surgery.</p><p>He was eventually murdered in 222 in an assassination plot engineered by his own grandmother Julia Maesa.</p><p><strong>5. Vitellius</strong></p><p>Emperor for just eight months, from April 19th to December 20th of the year 69 AD, Vitellius made some key administrative contributions to the empire but is ultimately remembered as a cruel glutton. He was<a href=\"https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132%3Alife%3Dvit.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> described</a> by Suetonius as overly fond of eating and drinking, to the point where he would eat at banquets four times a day while sending out the Roman navy to get him rare foods. He also had little social grace, inviting himself over to the houses of different noblemen to eat at their banquets, too.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"cde66d6bb67ab4506a3f467de5f177bc\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"09baf\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMDM3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MjA4ODA2Mn0.5EgOSTbcGswHlZBGgTqSIFU7rk_yfQ6inRpSsgzXaxU/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Vitellius dragged through the streets of Rome.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit:  Georges Rochegrosse. 1883.</small></p><p>He was also quite vicious and reportedly either had his own mother starved to death or approved a poison with which she committed suicide.<br/></p><p>Vitellius was ultimately murdered in brutal fashion by supporters of the rival emperor Vespasian, who dragged him through Rome's streets, then likely beheaded him and threw his body into the Tiber river. \"Yet I was once your emperor,\" were supposedly his last words, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20304642\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> historian Cassius Dio.</p><p><strong>6. Caracalla</strong></p><p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus I ruled Rome from 211 to 217 AD on his own (while previously co-ruling with his father Septimius Severus from 198). \"Caracalla\"' was his nickname, referencing a hooded coat from Gaul that he brought into Roman fashion. </p><p>He started off his rise to individual power by murdering his younger brother Geta, who was named co-heir by their father. Caracalla's bloodthirsty tyranny didn't stop there. He wiped out Geta's supporters and was known to execute any opponents to his or Roman rule. For instance, he slaughtered up to 20,000 citizens of Alexandria after a local theatrical satire dared to mock him.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"501dcb258ec363ff6839b2dfea4363e3\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"22feb\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMDQxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDczMzMwOH0.yChSajxg2It6LR5v_AIhJZ6If0mSRMVzG-aG_z8YEMI/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Geta Dying in His Mother's Arms.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Jacques Pajou (1766-1828)</small></p><p>One of the positive outcomes of his rule was the Edict of Caracalla, which gave Roman citizenship to all free men in the empire. He was also known for building gigantic<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla\" target=\"_blank\"> baths</a>.<br/></p><p>Like others on this list, Caracalla met a brutal end, being assassinated by army officers, including the Praetorian prefect Opellius Macrinus, who installed himself as the next emperor. </p><p><strong>7. Tiberius</strong></p><p>As the second emperor, Tiberius (ruling from 42 BC to 16 AD) is known for a number of accomplishments, especially his military exploits. He was one of the Roman Empire's most successful generals, conquering Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and parts of Germania. </p><p>He was also remembered by his contemporaries as a rather sullen, perverse, and angry man. In the chapter on his life from <em>The Lives of the Twelve Caesars</em> by the historian Suetonius, Tiberius is said to have been disliked from an early age for his personality by even his family. Suetonius<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/6400/6400-h/6400-h.htm#link2H_4_0004\" target=\"_blank\"> wrote</a> that his mother Antonia often called him \"an abortion of a man, that had been only begun, but never finished, by nature.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d12dda67daab9bafb7c992de6f8c1d7a\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"0a6e3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMDQ0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NDYwMTA3Mn0._cbT2MPbeKhScMhDTAknMDuFl68JVNyL_gDq23U_P3E/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">\"Orgy of the Times of Tiberius on Capri\".</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Painting by Henryk Siemiradzki. 1881.</small></p><p>Suetonius also<a href=\"https://www.livius.org/sources/content/suetonius/suetonius-on-tiberius-sex-life/\" target=\"_blank\"> paints</a> a damning picture of Tiberius after he retreated from public life to the island of Capri. His years on the island would put Jeffrey Epstein to shame. A horrendous pedophile, Tiberius had a reputation for \"depravities that one can hardly bear to tell or be told, let alone believe,\" Suetonius<a href=\"https://www.livius.org/sources/content/suetonius/suetonius-on-tiberius-sex-life/\" target=\"_blank\"> wrote</a>, describing how \"in Capri's woods and groves he arranged a number of nooks of venery where boys and girls got up as Pans and nymphs solicited outside bowers and grottoes: people openly called this 'the old goat's garden,' punning on the island's name.\"<br/></p><p>There's much, much more — far too salacious and, frankly, disgusting to repeat here.

The findings were in line with the previous, less robust studies on the subject.</p><p>Other stereotypes, like if a higher pitched voice hints at neuroticism, openness to new experiences, or agreeableness, were impossible to determine with the data at<a href=\"https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/if-your-voice-has-this-pitch-it-could-mean-you-have-these-personality-traits\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>hand</u></a>.</p><h2>Voice isn't everything</h2><p>It should be remembered that the personality traits that this study associates with vocal pitch are self-reported, so there are some serious limitations. For instance, it is entirely possible that vocal pitch is associated with<em> thinking</em> you're extroverted when you actually aren't. Furthermore, all four countries in the study are <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2013/05/weird-psychology-social-science-researchers-rely-too-much-on-western-college-students.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>WEIRD</u></a>, so the findings probably cannot be universalized. </p><p>Additionally, there are plenty of examples of people for whom the voice-personality link doesn't apply. For example, Teddy Roosevelt, an extremely extroverted, dominating man, had a fairly high pitched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhlzdjPGxrs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>voice</u></a>. </p><p>The authors do speculate that there could be a connection between testosterone levels in men, their vocal pitch, and their perceived level of dominance that would be supported by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S135917890400014X?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>previous</u></a><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X19301083?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>studies</u></a>. However, they have no hypothesis explaining why that same relationship exists for women. </p><p>The authors suggest that further studies in this area could focus on finding a possible physical connection between these traits and vocal pitch and to determine if they hold for traits which are not self-reported.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/LnLVvyEXOdA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwNTY0Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTQ5MjI2Mn0.fRnEdwdQEPERVfJwLM_X9bJiVv3MVhd07UxJLEgvU3U/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C148%2C0%2C232&height=700","linkMd5":"d9132287bcc9dfa231e775a44cf458cf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-31-285_629bbf736d64da18.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":20854,"destBytes":20854,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwNTY0Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTQ5MjI2Mn0.fRnEdwdQEPERVfJwLM_X9bJiVv3MVhd07UxJLEgvU3U/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C148%2C0%2C232&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-31-285_629bbf736d64da18.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/LnLVvyEXOdA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn96@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-33-660_db6c376c22a79121.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161061},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"You are suffering from “tab overload”","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/tab-overload","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5MDczNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTAxOTE0NX0.x5S8T3iGHbKAR_mojKCclyt0g-Eb2gfsWIoB8fWZwys/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C270%2C0%2C366&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul><li>A new study suggests that tabs can cause people to be flustered as they try to keep track of every website.</li><li><span></span>The reason is that tabs are unable to properly organize information.</li><li>The researchers are plugging a browser extension that aims to fix the problem.</li></ul><hr/><p>A lot of ideas that people had about the internet in the 1990s have fallen by the wayside as technology and our usage patterns evolved. Long gone are things like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>GeoCities</u></a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie#BowieNet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>BowieNet</u></a>, and the belief that letting anybody post whatever they are thinking whenever they want is a fundamentally good idea with no societal repercussions.</p><p>While these ideas have been abandoned and the tools that made them possible often replaced by new and improved ones, not every outdated part of our internet experience is gone. A new<a href=\"https://joe.cat/images/papers/tabs.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>study</u></a> by a team at Carnegie Mellon makes the case that the use of tabs in a web browser is one of these outdated concepts that we would do well to get rid of.</p><h2>How many tabs do you have open right now?</h2><p>We didn't always have tabs. Introduced in the early 2000s, tabs are now included on all major web browsers, and most users have had access to them for a little over a decade. They've been pretty much the same since they came out, despite the ever changing nature of the internet. So, in this new study, researchers interviewed and surveyed 113 people on their use of — and feelings toward — the ubiquitous tabs.</p><p>Most people use tabs for the short-term storage of information, particularly if it's information that is needed again soon. Some keep tabs that they know they'll never get around to reading. Others used them as a sort of external memory bank. One participant described this action to the researchers:</p><p>\"It's like a manifestation of everything that's on my mind right now. Or the things that should be on my mind right now... So right now, in this browser window, I have a web project that I'm working on. I don't have time to work on it right now, but I know I need to work on it. So it's sitting there reminding me that I need to work on it.\"</p><h2>You suffer from tab overload<br/></h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMq_MyOFtW8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>Unfortunately, trying to use tabs this way can cause a number of problems. A quarter of the interview subjects reported having caused a computer or browser to crash because they had too many tabs open. Others reported feeling flustered by having so many tabs open — a situation called \"tab overload\" — or feeling ashamed that they appeared disorganized by having so many tabs up at once. More than half of participants reported having problems like this at least two or three times a week. </p><p>However, people can become emotionally invested in the tabs. One participant explained, \"[E]ven when I'm not using those tabs, I don't want to close them. Maybe it's because it took efforts [sic] to open those tabs and organize them in that way.\"</p><p>So, we have a tool that inefficiently saves web pages that we <em>might </em>visit again while simultaneously reducing our productivity, increasing our anxiety, and crashing our machines. And yet we feel oddly attached to them.</p><p>Either the system is crazy or we are. </p><h2>Skeema: The anti-tab revolution<br/></h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAKhaxdQ1eo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>The researchers concluded that at least part of the problem is caused by tabs not being an ideal way of organizing the work we now do online. They propose a new model that better compartmentalizes tabs by task and subtask, reflects users' mental models, and helps manage the users' attention on what is important right now rather than what might be important later.</p><p>To that end, the team also created<a href=\"https://www.skeema.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Skeema</u></a>, an extension for Google Chrome, that treats tabs as tasks and offers a variety of ways to organize them. Users of an early version reported having fewer tabs and windows open at one time and were better able to manage the information they<a href=\"https://www.scs.cmu.edu/news/overcoming-tab-overload\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>contained</u></a>.</p><p>Tabs were an improvement over having multiple windows open at the same time, but they may have outlived their usefulness. While it might take a paradigm shift to fully replace the concept, the study suggests that taking a different approach to tabs might be worth trying. </p><p>And now, excuse me, while I close some of the 87 tabs I currently have open.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/dliGniEETRU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 May 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5MDczNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTAxOTE0NX0.x5S8T3iGHbKAR_mojKCclyt0g-Eb2gfsWIoB8fWZwys/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C270%2C0%2C366&height=700","linkMd5":"0e0134b4f56a1c749a699ba8a6bb8159","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-307_95f4b7653dac53f4.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":40582,"destBytes":40582,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5MDczNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTAxOTE0NX0.x5S8T3iGHbKAR_mojKCclyt0g-Eb2gfsWIoB8fWZwys/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C270%2C0%2C366&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-307_95f4b7653dac53f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/dliGniEETRU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn72@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-31-667_cdfab26005bd717c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161071},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Pink placebo: Fake energy drink makes people run faster, further","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/pink-drink-running","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwNTczMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMjY3NzA5Nn0.i5L_N9Uw8xKdCeO0PmBuRqohw7svj9NB_dKMDRRn2tQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul><li>A study suggests that the effectiveness of sports drinks may depend in part on their color.</li><li><span></span>Runners who rinsed with a pink liquid ran better than those who consumed the same but colorless drink.</li><li>Improvement in their performance is likely due to a placebo effect.</li></ul><hr/><p>The \"<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect\" target=\"_self\">placebo effect</a>\" is real.

At any given time, 20,000 lumberjacks were at work in the woods, a further 20,000 in the sawmills, and another 20,000 in other lumber-related industries.</p>\n<p>Production peaked in the year 1900, with over 2.3 billion board-feet (5.4 million m3) of lumber harvested from the state's forests. That was enough to build 600,000 two-story houses or a boardwalk nine feet (2.7 m) wide, circling Earth along the equator. From then on, yields declined, albeit slightly at first. By 1910, however, the first lumber operations started packing up and moving on to the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Minnesota's era of Big Timber symbolically came to an end with the closure of the Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company in 1929. At that time, a century's worth of lumbering in Minnesota had produced 68 billion board-feet (160 million m3) of pine — enough to fill a line of boxcars all the way to the moon and halfway back again.</p>\n<p>Now spool back a few decades. It's 1882, and the Public Land Survey is measuring, mapping, and quantifying the wilderness of northern Minnesota — and its as yet unharvested north woods. Setting out from the small settlement of Grand Rapids, Josias Redgate King leads a three-man survey team 40 miles north, into the backwoods.</p>\n<h2>Mapping error becomes cartographic fact</h2>\n<p>Their job, specifically, is to chart the area between Moose and Coddington Lakes. And they mess up. Perhaps it's the lousy November weather, the desolate swampy terrain, or both. But they make a serious mistake: their survey stretches Coddington Lake half a mile further northwest than it actually exists. As happens surprisingly often with mapping mistakes, the error becomes cartographic fact, undisputed for decades. <br /></p>\n<p>The area is marked on all maps as being under water and is therefore excluded from the considerations of logging companies. Only in 1960 is the area re-surveyed and the error corrected. But by then, as we have seen, Big Timber has moved on from the Gopher State.</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"4d13a73d13a9cbe1a2c0c6b47a53370b\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"1aa1b\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM4NTA3NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzM3MTk2NH0.bryjGtyUw6jDdpz2hqsUKimLv3MmOmPVqN6qDZUJtNw/img.png?width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">Map of the \"Lost Forty\" SNA (top right).

King was more than the mismapper of Coddington Lake. He has another, and rather better, <a href=\"https://www.mnopedia.org/person/king-josias-r-1832-1916\" target=\"_blank\">claim to fame</a>. When the Civil War broke out, Minnesota was the first state to offer volunteers to fight for the Union. At Fort Snelling, Mr. King rushed to the front of a line of men waiting to sign up.<br /></p>\n<p><span></span>So it was said, with some justification, that he was the first volunteer for the Union in all of the country. During the war, he attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. After, he returned to his civilian job, surveying. Because of his credentials as the Union's first volunteer, he was asked to pose for the face of the bronze soldier on the Civil War monument which was unveiled at St. Paul's Summit Park in 1903.</p>\n<h2>The loggers' loss is nature's gain</h2>\n<p>But back to the Lost Forty. The loggers' loss — hence the name — is actually nature's gain. The SNA's crowning glory, literally, is nearly 32 acres of designated old-growth red pine and white pine forest, in two stands, partially extending into the Chippewa National Forest proper. (In fact, much of the mismapped area seems to fall within the Chippewa National Forest Unique Biological Area adjacent to the Lost Forty.) Old-growth forests represent less than 2 percent — and <em>designated</em> old-growth forests less than 0.25 percent — of all of Minnesota's forests.</p>\n<p>The oldest pine trees in the Lost Forty are between 300 and 400 years old, close to their maximum natural life span, which is up to 500 years. Similar pines in other parts of the National Forest are harvested at between 80 and 150 years for pulp and lumber. As a result, the pines in the Lost Forty are not only higher than most of the surrounding woods but also bigger with a diameter of between 22 and 48 inches (55 to 122 cm). One of the biggest has a circumference of 115 inches (2.9 m).</p>\n<p>With their craggy bark, massive trunks, and dizzying height, these trees look like the ancient beings they are. And they exist in a cluster the size of which is unique for the Midwest. There's nothing lost about these trees; in fact, it's rather the reverse. Perhaps the area should more precisely be called the \"Last Forty.\"</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9b638e2bdadbfaf5a64015d68fcc476c\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"ec9ee\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM4NTAzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NjYxODgxOX0.dJ9DqC8w3JRSvm58Y_MfPtcFCrIcTqy48TAUzEg6j8w/img.jpg?width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">At 52 feet, only half as high as an old-growth white pine: Josias R.

A violent and sadistic criminal. So, we decide to do something about it.

Alex will be forced to watch violent movies as his body is pumped with nausea-inducing drugs. After a while, he'll come to associate violence with this horrible sickness. And, after a course of Ludovico, Alex can happily return to society, never again doing an immoral or illegal act. He'll no longer be a danger to himself or anyone else.</p><p>This is the story of<em> A Clockwork Orange</em> by Anthony Burgess, and it raises important questions about the nature of moral decisions, free will, and the limits of rehabilitation.</p><h2>Today's Clockwork Orange</h2><p>This might seem like unbelievable science fiction, but it might be truer — and nearer — than we think. In 2010, Dr. Molly Crockett did a series of experiments on moral decision-making and serotonin levels. Her results showed that people with more serotonin were less aggressive or confrontational and much more easy-going and forgiving. When we're full of serotonin, we let insults pass, are more empathetic, and are less willing to do harm.</p><blockquote>As Fydor Dostoyevsky wrote in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, if the \"entrance fee\" for having free will is the horrendous suffering we see all around us, then \"I hasten to return my ticket.\"</blockquote><p>The idea that biology affects moral decisions is obvious. Most of us are more likely to be short-tempered and spiteful if we're tired or hungry, for instance. Conversely, we have the patience of a saint if we just have received some good news, had half a bottle of wine, or had sex.</p><p>If our decision-making can be manipulated or determined by our biology, should we not try various interventions to prevent the criminally inclined from harming others?</p><h2>Drastic interventions</h2><p>What is the point of prison? This is itself no easy question, and it's one with a rich <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/bigthink.com/amp/philosophy-of-punishment-and-penology-2647871318\" target=\"_self\">philosophical debate</a>. Surely one of the biggest reasons is to protect society by preventing criminals from reoffending. This <em>might </em>be achievable by manipulating a felon's serotonin levels, but why not go even further?</p><p>Today, we know enough about the brain to have identified a very particular part of the prefrontal cortex responsible for aggressive behavior. We know that certain abnormalities in the amygdala can result in anti-social behavior and rule breaking. If the purpose of the penal system is to rehabilitate, then why not \"edit\" these parts of the brain in some way? This could be done in a variety of ways.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"06c4151fce621d984f7f0617f865132d\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"b3b53\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM3ODk2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDE5MjA1NH0.7RUK0TVEwXzWOK6vaVOaSpI0xXDjL5EaVBthSOcDj7c/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#/media/File:Bergonic_chair.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/27337026@N03\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Otis Historical Archives National Museum of Health and Medicine</a> via Flickr / Wikipedia</small></p><p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a surprisingly common practice in much of the developed world. Its supporters say that it can help relieve major mental health issues such as depression or bipolar disorder as well as alleviate certain types of seizures. Historically, and controversially, it has been used to \"treat\" homosexuality and was used to threaten those misbehaving in hospitals in the 1950s (as notoriously depicted in <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>). Of course, these early and crude efforts at ECT were damaging, immoral, and often left patients barely able to function as humans. Today, neuroscience and ECT are much more sophisticated. If we <em>could</em> easily \"treat\" those with aggressive or anti-social behavior, then why not?<br/></p><p>Ideally, we might use techniques such as ECT or hormonal supplementation, but failing that, why not go even further? Why not perform a lobotomy? If the purpose of the penal system is to change the felon for the better, we should surely use all the tools at our disposal. With one fairly straightforward surgery to the prefrontal cortex, we could turn a violent, murderous criminal into a docile and law-abiding citizen. Should we do it?</p><h2>Is free will worth it?</h2><p>As Burgess, who penned <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, wrote, \"Is a man who chooses to be bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\"</p><p>Intuitively, many say yes. Moral decisions must, in some way, be our own. Even if we know that our brains determine our actions, it's still <em>me</em> who controls my brain, no one else. Forcing someone to be good, by molding or changing their brain, is not creating a moral citizen. It's creating a law-abiding <em>automaton</em>. And robots are not humans.</p><p>And yet, it begs the question: is \"free choice\" worth all the evil in the world?</p><p>If my being brainwashed or \"rehabilitated\" means children won't die malnourished or the Holocaust would never happen, then so be it. If lobotomizing or neuro-editing a serial killer will prevent them from killing again, is that not a sacrifice worth making? There's no obvious reason why we should value free will above morality or the right to life. A world without murder and evil — even if it meant a world without free choices for some — might not be such a bad place. </p><p>As Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, if the \"entrance fee\" for having free will is the horrendous suffering we see all around us, then \"I hasten to return my ticket.\" Free will's not worth it.</p><p>Do you think the Ludovico technique from<em> A Clockwork Orange</em> is a great idea? Should we turn people into moral citizens and shape their brains to choose only what is good? Or is free choice more important than all the evil in the world?</p><p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

Studies from two different teams used tiny drums to show that quantum entanglement, an effect generally linked to subatomic particles, can also be applied to much larger macroscopic systems. One of the teams also claims to have found a way to evade the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.</p><p>One question that the scientists were hoping to answer pertained to whether larger systems can exhibit quantum entanglement in the same way as microscopic ones. Quantum mechanics proposes that two objects can become \"entangled,\" whereby the properties of one object, such as position or velocity, can become connected to those of the other.</p><p>An<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6542/622\" target=\"_blank\"> experiment</a> performed at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, led by physicist Shlomi Kotler and his colleagues, showed that a pair of vibrating aluminum membranes, each about 10 micrometers long, can be made to vibrate in sync, in such a way that they can be described to be quantum entangled. Kotler's team amplified the signal from their devices to \"see\" the entanglement much more clearly. Measuring their position and velocities returned the same numbers, indicating that they were indeed entangled.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d2ed220554cdfa7ef8fb8553d7fb85a8\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"93ed3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM5OTA1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjE4MzQ1MX0.9Vjq-iQmm2VGce8R3faVCNp0JdColl62YgYD0HFuv78/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Tiny aluminium membranes used by Kotler's team.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Florent Lecoq and Shlomi Kotler/NIST</small></p><h2>Evading the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?<br/></h2><p>Another<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6542/625\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> experiment</a> with quantum drums — each one-fifth the width of a human hair — by a team led by Prof. Mika Sillanpää at Aalto University in Finland, attempted to find what happens in the area between quantum and non-quantum behavior. Like the other researchers, they also achieved quantum entanglement for larger objects, but they also made a fascinating inquiry into <a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/evading-the-uncertainty-principle-in-quantum-physics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">getting around the Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a>. </p><p>The team's theoretical model was developed by Dr. Matt Woolley of the University of New South Wales. Photons in the microwave frequency were employed to create a synchronized vibrating pattern as well as to gauge the positions of the drums. The scientists managed to make the drums vibrate in opposite phases to each other, achieving \"collective quantum motion.\"</p><p>The study's lead author, Dr. Laure Mercier de Lepinay, <a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/evading-the-uncertainty-principle-in-quantum-physics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"In this situation, the quantum uncertainty of the drums' motion is canceled if the two drums are treated as one quantum-mechanical entity.\"</p><p>This effect allowed the team to measure both the positions and the momentum of the virtual drumheads at the same time. \"One of the drums responds to all the forces of the other drum in the opposing way, kind of with a negative mass,\" Sillanpää explained.</p><p>Theoretically, this should not be possible under the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, one of the most well-known tenets of quantum mechanics. Proposed in the 1920s by Werner Heisenberg, the principle generally says that when dealing with the quantum world, where particles also act like waves, there's an inherent uncertainty in measuring both the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. The more precisely you measure one variable, the more uncertainty in the measurement of the other. In other words, it is not possible to simultaneously pinpoint the exact values of the particle's position and momentum.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"edf963152eeb2c00b4808bc72728a4fd\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8FTr2qMutA?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Explained.</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Veritasium / Youtube.com</small>\n        </p><h2>Quantum skepticism</h2><p>Big Think contributor astrophysicist<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/u/adam_frank\" target=\"_self\"> Adam Frank</a>, known for the 13.8 podcast, called this \"a really fascinating paper as it shows that it's possible to make larger entangled systems which behave like a single quantum object.

But when Sputnik 1's batteries died and the aluminum satellite began lifelessly orbiting the planet, it marked the end of another era: the billions of years during which space was pristine.</p><p>Today, the space above Earth is the world's \"largest garbage dump,\" according to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/library/find/bibliographies/space_debris\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a>. It's littered with 8,000 tons of human-made junk, called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/space-debris\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">space debris,</a> left by space agencies over the past six decades. </p><p>The U.S. now tracks more than 25,000 pieces of space junk. And that's only the debris that ground-based radar technologies can track. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network <a href=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/does-space-junk-fall-sky\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> there could be more than 170 million pieces of space debris currently orbiting Earth, with the majority being tiny fragments smaller than 1 mm. </p><h2>Space debris: Trashing a planet</h2><p>Space debris includes all human-made objects, big and small, that are orbiting Earth but no longer serve a useful function. A brief inventory of known space junk includes: a spatula, a glove, a mirror, a bag filled with astronaut tools, spent rocket stages, stray bolts, paint chips, defunct spacecraft, and about 3,000 dead satellites — all of which are orbiting Earth at speeds of roughly 18,000 m.p.h. </p><blockquote>By allowing space debris to accumulate unchecked, we could be building a prison that keeps us stranded on Earth for centuries.</blockquote><p>Most space junk is floating in low Earth orbit (LEO), the region of space within an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. LEO is also where most of the world's 3,000 satellites operate, powering our telecommunications, GPS technologies, and military operations. </p><p>\"Millions of pieces of orbital debris exist in low Earth orbit (LEO) — at least 26,000 the size of a softball or larger that could destroy a satellite on impact; over 500,000 the size of a marble big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites; and over 100 million the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit,\" <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-21-011.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> NASA's Office of Inspector General Office of Audits.</p><p>If LEO becomes polluted with too much space junk, it could become treacherous for spacecraft, threatening not only our modern technological infrastructure, but also humanity's ability to venture into space at all. </p><p>By allowing space debris to accumulate unchecked, we could be building a prison that keeps us stranded on Earth for centuries.</p><h2>An outsized problem</h2><p>Space debris of any size poses grave threats to spacecraft. But tiny, untrackable micro-debris presents an especially dreadful problem: A paint fragment chipped off a spacecraft might not seem dangerous, but it careens through space at nearly 10 times the speed of a bullet, packing enough energy to puncture an astronaut's suit, crack a window of the International Space Station, and potentially destroy satellites. </p><p>Impacts with space debris are common. During the Space Shuttle era, NASA replaced an average of <a href=\"https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/nasa/nasa-hdbk-871914\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">one to two shuttle windows per</a> mission \"due to hypervelocity impacts (HVIs) from space debris.\" To be sure, some space debris are natural micrometeoroids. But much of it is human-made, like the fragment that struck the starboard payload bay radiator of the STS-115 flight in 2006.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Space debris impact on International Space Station\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"94c3848518e0815f6cf325e9e0030961\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"6fad0\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMTM3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MjAwNDg4MH0.Mvei4rpjjLtNHTt4D4gaXBrx7RvoGcaFwgSZOZ1upiM/img.png?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/nasa/nasa-hdbk-871914\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a></small></p><p>\"The debris penetrated both walls of the honeycomb structure, and the shock wave from the penetration created a crack in the rear surface of the radiator 6.8 mm long,\" NASA <a href=\"https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/nasa/nasa-hdbk-871914\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>. \"Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray detection analysis of residual material around the hole and in the interior of the radiator shows that the impactor was a small fragment of circuit board material.\"<br/></p><p>The European Space Agency <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2016/05/Impact_chip\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a> that any fragment of space debris larger than a centimeter could shatter a spacecraft into pieces.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"aeb2a712dc898227b262efa15e3fb8a3\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"85bdd\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMTM3Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MzY1MzQ3Mn0.4ZxfZIrVVaY83qV3UvaNHbpz3ZO0HyrS7Koeh4nq0Vc/img.png?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Impact chip on the ISS</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2016/05/Impact_chip\" target=\"_blank\">ESA</a></small></p><p>To dodge space junk, the International Space Station (ISS) has to conduct \"avoidance maneuvers\" a couple times every year. In 2014, for example, flight controllers decided to <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/station-conducts-debris-avoidance-maneuver\" target=\"_blank\">raise the ISS's altitude by half a mile</a> to avoid collision with part of an old European rocket in its orbital path.<br/></p><p>NASA has strict guidelines for how it decides to perform these maneuvers.</p><p>\"Debris avoidance maneuvers are planned when the probability of collision from a conjunction reaches limits set in the space shuttle and space station flight rules,\" NASA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>. \"If the probability of collision is greater than 1 in 100,000, a maneuver will be conducted if it will not result in significant impact to mission objectives. If it is greater than 1 in 10,000, a maneuver will be conducted unless it will result in additional risk to the crew.\"</p><p>These precautionary measures are becoming increasingly necessary. In 2020, the ISS had to move three times to avoid potential collisions. One of the latest close-calls came with such little warning that astronauts were instructed to <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2020/09/22/station-boosts-orbit-to-avoid-space-debris/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">take shelter in the Russian segment of the space station</a>, in order to be closer to their Soyuz MS-16 spacecraft, which serves as an escape pod in case of an emergency.</p><h2>The Kessler syndrome</h2><p>The hazards of space debris grow exponentially over time. That's because of a problem that NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler outlined in 1978. The so-called Kessler syndrome states that as space becomes increasingly packed with spacecraft and debris, collisions become more likely. And because each collision would create more debris, it could trigger a chain reaction of collisions — potentially to the point where near-Earth space becomes a shrapnel field through which safe travel is impossible.</p><blockquote>A paint fragment chipped off a spacecraft might not seem dangerous, but it careens through space at nearly 10 times the speed of a bullet, packing enough energy to puncture an astronaut's suit, crack a window of the International Space Station, and potentially destroy satellites.</blockquote><p>The Kessler syndrome may already be playing out. Perhaps it began with the first known case of a spacecraft being severely damaged by artificial space debris, which occurred in 1996 when the French spy satellite Cerise was struck by a piece of an old European Ariane rocket. The collision tore off a 13-foot segment of the satellite. </p><p>The next major space debris incident occurred in 2007 when China conducted an anti-satellite missile test in which the nation destroyed one of its own weather satellites, triggering <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-anti-satellite-test#:~:text=In%20January%202007%2C%20China%20became,destroyed%20an%20inactive%20weather%20satellite.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">international criticism</a> and creating more than 3,000 pieces of trackable space debris, most of which was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TSKelso/status/789570050621448192\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">still in orbit ten years after the explosion</a>. </p><p>Then, in 2009, an unexpected collision between communications satellites — the active Iridium 33 and the defunct Russian Cosmos-2251 — produced at least 2,000 large fragments of space debris and as many as 200,000 smaller pieces, <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100002023\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to NASA</a>. About half of all space debris currently orbiting Earth came from the Iridium-Cosmos collision and China's missile test.</p><p>There's more. Russia's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLITS_(satellite)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BLITS</a> satellite was spun out of its orbital path in 2013 after being struck by a piece of space debris suspected to have come from China's 2007 missile test; the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite was struck by a tiny particle in 2016; and a window of the ISS was hit by a small fragment that same year.</p><p>As nations and private companies plan to send more satellites into orbit, collisions and impacts could soon become more common.</p><h2>The promise and peril of satellite mega-constellations</h2><p>Space organizations have recently begun launching satellites into low Earth orbit at an unprecedented pace. The goal is to create \"mega-constellations\" of satellites that provide high-quality internet access to virtually all parts of the planet. </p><p>Internet-providing satellites have existed for years, but they're typically expensive and provide slower service than land-based internet infrastructure. That's mainly because it can take a relatively long time for a signal to travel from the satellite to the user due to the high altitudes at which many of these satellites float above us in geostationary orbit.</p><p>China and companies like SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon aim to solve this problem by launching thousands of satellites into lower orbits in order to reduce signal latency, or the time it takes for the signal to travel to and from the satellite. But some space experts worry satellite mega-constellations could create more space debris.</p><p>\"We face entirely new challenges as hundreds of satellites are launched every month now — more than we used to launch in a year,\" Thomas Schildknecht of the International Astronomical Union <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ded0def-1715-4d01-880b-939a89cc33d7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> at a European Space Agency conference in April. \"The mega-constellations are producing huge risks of collisions. We need more stringent rules for traffic management in space and international mechanisms to ensure enforcement of the rules.\"</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2017/04/space-debris-mega-constellations.page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2017 study funded by the European Space Agency</a> found that the deployment of satellite mega-constellations into low Earth orbit could increase the number of catastrophic collisions by 50 percent. Still, it remains unclear whether sending more satellites into space will necessarily cause more collisions. </p><p>SpaceX, for example, claims that Starlink satellites aren't at significant risk of collision because they're equipped with automated collision-avoidance propulsion systems. However, this system seemed to fail in 2019 when a Starlink satellite had a close call with a European science satellite named Aeolus. The company later <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-risky-rush-for-mega-constellations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said it had fixed the bug</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Starlink\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d3e9dfe669e986aa0495df3c6a79334d\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"6ddde\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjQwMTM4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTE4NjI2OH0.JA3zwz4kMv2NW7jxZP9zsz0Ms6Qb_oaBjfHPfuf7stE/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">A batch of 60 Starlink test satellites stacked atop a Falcon 9 rocket.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">SpaceX</small></p><p>Currently, there are no strict international rules governing the deployment and management of satellite mega-constellations.

The committee aims \"to exchange information on space debris research activities between member space agencies, to facilitate opportunities for cooperation in space debris research, to review the progress of ongoing cooperative activities, and to identify debris mitigation options.\"</p><p>The IADC's <a href=\"https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/iadc-space-debris-guidelines-revision-2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines</a> list three broad goals:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">1. Preventing on-orbit break-ups </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">2. Removing spacecraft from the densely populated orbit regions when they reach the end of their mission</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">3. Limiting the objects released during normal operations </p><p>But even though the world's space agencies recognize the gravity of the space debris problem, they're reluctant to act because of an incentives-based dilemma.</p><h2>Space debris: A classic tragedy of the commons</h2><p>Space debris is everyone's problem, but no one entity is obligated to solve it. It's a tragedy of the commons — an economic scenario in which individuals with access to a shared and scarce resource (space) act in their own best interest (spend the least amount of money). Left unchecked, the shared resource is vulnerable to depletion or corruption.</p><p>For example, the U.S. by itself could develop a novel method for removing space debris, which, if successful, would benefit all organizations with assets in space. But the odds of this happening are slim because of a game-theoretical dilemma. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00054/full\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2018 study published in <em>Frontiers in Robotics and AI</em></a> explains:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"[In space debris removal] each stakeholder has an incentive to delay its actions and wait for others to respond. This makes the space debris removal setting an interesting strategic dilemma. As all actors share the same environment, actions by one have a potential immediate and future impact on all others. This gives rise to a social dilemma in which the benefits of individual investment are shared by all while the costs are not. This encourages free-riders, who reap the benefits without paying the costs. However, if all involved parties reason this way, the resulting inaction may prove to be far worse for all involved. This is known in the game theory literature as the tragedy of the commons.\"</p><p>Similar to trying to curb climate change, there's no clear answer on how to best incentivize nations to mitigate space debris. (For what it's worth, the game theoretical model in the 2018 study found that a centralized solution — e.g., one where a single actor makes decisions on mitigating space debris, perhaps on behalf of a multinational coalition — is less costly than a decentralized solution.)</p><p>Although space organizations have been slow to act, many have been exploring ways to remove space junk from orbit and prevent new debris from forming.</p><h2>Cleaning up space debris </h2><p>Space organizations have proposed and experimented with many ways to remove debris from space. Although the techniques vary, most agree on strategy: get rid of the big stuff first. </p><p>That's because collisions involving large objects would create lots of new debris.

Funding pours in and progress seems swift. Then, a decade or so later, progress stalls and funding dries up. Over the last ten years, we've clearly been in an AI summer as vast improvements in computing power and new techniques like deep learning have led to remarkable advances. But now, as we enter the third decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, some who follow AI feel the cold winds at their back leading them to ask, \"Is Winter Coming?\" If so, what went wrong this time?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d75a163559f9b13e9633decb8a9ab010\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ke1vH4_rQc?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">How to build an A.I. brain that can conceive of itself | Joscha Bach  | Big Think</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ke1vH4_rQc\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n        </small>\n        </p><h2>A brief history of AI<br/></h2><p>To see if the winds of winter are really coming for AI, it is useful to look at the field's history. The first real summer can be pegged to 1956 and the famous Dartmouth University Workshop where one of the field's pioneers, John McCarthy, coined the term \"artificial intelligence.\" The conference was attended by scientists like Marvin Minsky and H. A. Simon, whose names would go on to become synonymous with the field. For those researchers, the task ahead was clear: capture the processes of human reasoning through the manipulation of symbolic systems (i.e., computer programs).</p><blockquote>Unless we are talking about very specific tasks, any 6-year-old is infinitely more flexible and general in his or her intelligence than the \"smartest\" Amazon robot.</blockquote><p>Throughout the 1960s, progress seemed to come swiftly as researchers developed computer systems that could play chess, deduce mathematical theorems, and even engage in simple discussions with a person. Government funding flowed generously. Optimism was so high that, in 1970, Minsky famously <a href=\"https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">proclaimed</a>, \"In three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of a human being.\"</p><p>By the mid 1970s, however, it was clear that Minsky's optimism was unwarranted. Progress stalled as many of the innovations of the previous decade proved too narrow in their applicability, seeming more like toys than steps toward a general version of artificial intelligence. Funding dried up so completely that researchers soon took pains not to refer to their work as AI, as the term carried a stink that killed proposals.</p><p>The cycle repeated itself in the 1980s with the rise of expert systems and the renewed interest in what we now call neural networks (i.e., programs based on connectivity architectures that mimic neurons in the brain). Once again, there was wild optimism and big increases in funding. What was novel in this cycle was the addition of significant private funding as more companies began to rely on computers as essential components of their business. But, once again, the big promises were never realized, and funding dried up again.</p><h2>AI: Hype vs. reality</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"2d4737d1e50d4fea25b37adab99ea8ae\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d887f\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjM4NTk4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4MjAyMjMzNX0.5guzal6hE61SHOHTDr9jd5BxPkvXle5RLWflctWJXBE/img.jpg?width=980\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/sony-president-and-ceo-kazuo-hirai-speaks-during-a-press-news-photo/902748580?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&photographer=Alex+Wong\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Wong</a> via Staff</small></p><p>The AI summer we're currently experiencing began sometime in the first decade of the new millennium. Vast increases in both computing speed and storage ushered in the era of deep learning and big data. Deep learning methods use stacked layers of neural networks that pass information to each other to solve complex problems like facial recognition. Big data provides these systems with vast oceans of examples (like images of faces) to train on. The applications of this progress are all around us: Google Maps give you near-perfect directions; you can talk with Siri anytime you want; IBM's Deep Think computer beat Jeopardy's greatest human champions.<br/></p><p>In response, the hype rose again. True AI, we were told, must be just around the corner. In 2015, for example, <em>The Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/13/self-driving-cars-bmw-google-2020-driving\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that self-driving cars, the killer app of modern AI, was close at hand. Readers were told, \"By 2020 you will become a permanent backseat driver.\" And just two years ago, Elon Musk claimed that by 2020 \"we'd have over a million cars with full self-driving software.\" </p><blockquote>The general intelligence — i.e., <em>the understanding</em> — we humans exhibit may be inseparable from our <em>experiencing</em>. If that's true, then our physical embodiment, enmeshed in a context-rich world, may be difficult if not impossible to capture in symbolic processing systems.</blockquote><p>By now, it's obvious that a world of fully self-driving cars is still <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/14/21063487/self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-waymo-cruise-uber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">years away</a>. Likewise, in spite of the remarkable progress we've made in machine learning, we're still far from creating systems that possess general intelligence. The emphasis is on the term <em>general</em> because that's what AI really has been promising all these years: a machine that's flexible in dealing with any situation as it comes up. Instead, what researchers have found is that, despite all their remarkable progress, the systems they've built remain brittle, which is a technical term meaning \"they do very wrong things when given unexpected inputs.\" Try asking Siri to find \"restaurants that aren't McDonald's.\" <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/can-ai-think-understand\" target=\"_self\">You won't like the results</a>.</p><p>Unless we are talking about very specific tasks, any 6-year-old is infinitely more flexible and general in his or her intelligence than the \"smartest\" Amazon robot.</p><p>Even more important is the sense that, as remarkable as they are, <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/can-ai-think-understand\" target=\"_self\">none of the systems we've built <em>understand</em> anything</a> about what they are doing. As philosopher Alva Noe <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/11/21/365753466/artificial-intelligence-really-is-pseudo-intelligence\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> of Deep Think's famous <em>Jeopardy!</em> victory, \"Watson answered no questions. It participated in no competition. It didn't do anything. All the doing was on our side. We played Jeapordy! with Watson.\" Considering this fact, some researchers claim that the general intelligence — i.e., <em>the understanding</em> — we humans exhibit may be inseparable from our <em>experiencing</em>.

Archival documentation similar to — and often of a similar quality as — modern economic data allows researchers to get a glimpse of what economic conditions were like centuries ago. Sources like property tax records and documents listing the rental value of homes can be used to determine how much a person's estate was worth. (While these methods leave out those without property, the data is not particularly distorted.)</p><p>The first part of the line, shown in black, represents work by Prof. Alfani and represents the average inequality level of the<a href=\"https://tsup.truman.edu/files/2012/09/SabaudianLookInside.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Sabaudian State</u></a> in Northern Italy,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Florence\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>The Florentine State</u></a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>The Kingdom of Naples</u></a>, and the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Republic of Venice</u></a>. The latter part, in gray, is based on the work of French economist Thomas Piketty and represents an average of inequality in France, the United Kingdom, and Sweden during that time period.</p><p>Despite the shift in location, the level of inequality and rate of increase are very similar between the two data sets.</p><h2>Apocalyptic events cause decreases in inequality </h2><p>Note that there are two substantial declines in inequality. Both are tied to truly apocalyptic events. The first is the <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/think-tank/black-death-the-upside-to-killing-half-of-europe\" target=\"_self\"><u>Black Death</u></a>, the common name for the bubonic plague pandemic in the 14th century, which killed off anywhere between 30 and 50 percent of Europe. The second, at the dawn of the 20th century, was the result of World War I and the many major events in its aftermath. </p><p>The 20th century as a whole was a time of tremendous economic change, and the periods not featuring major wars are notable for having large experiments in distributive economic policies, particularly in the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/clement-attlee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>countries</u></a><a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7092114.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Piketty</u></a><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/dirigisme\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>considers</u></a>.</p><p>The slight stall in the rise of inequality during the 17th century is the result of the Thirty Years' War, a terrible religious conflict that ravaged Europe and left eight million people dead, and of major plagues that affected South Europe. However, the recurrent outbreaks of the plague after the Black Death no longer had much effect on inequality. This was due to a number of factors, not the least of which was the adaptation of European institutions to handle pandemics without causing such a shift in wealth.</p><p>In 2010, the last year covered by the essay, inequality levels were similar to those of 1340, with 66 percent of the wealth of society being held by the top ten percent. Also, inequality levels were continuing to rise, and the trends have not ended since. As Prof. Alfani explained in an email to BigThink:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"During the decade preceding the Covid pandemic, economic inequality has shown a slow tendency towards further inequality growth. The Great Recession that began in 2008 possibly contributed to slow down inequality growth, especially in Europe, but it did not stop it. However, the expectation is that Covid-19 will tend to increase inequality and poverty. This, because it tends to create a relatively greater economic damage to those having unstable occupations, or who need physical strength to work (think of the effects of the so-called \"long-Covid,\" which can prove physically invalidating for a long time). Additionally, and thankfully, Covid is not lethal enough to force major leveling dynamics upon society.\"</p><h2>Can only disasters change inequality?</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KL-SDoEO9VU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>That is the subject of some debate. While inequality can occur in any economy, even one that doesn't grow all that much, some things appear to make it more likely to rise or fall.</p><p>Thomas Piketty suggested that the cause of changes in inequality levels is the difference in the rate of return on capital and the overall growth rate of the economy. Since the return on capital is typically higher than the overall growth rate, this means that those who have capital to invest tend to get richer faster than everybody else.</p><p>While this does explain a great deal of the graph after 1800, his model fails to explain why inequality fell after the Black Death. Indeed, since the plague destroyed human capital and left material goods alone, we would expect the ratio of wealth over income to increase and for inequality to rise. His model can provide explanations for the decline in inequality in the decades after the pandemic, however- it is possible that the abundance of capital could have lowered returns over a longer time span. </p><p>The catastrophe theory put forth by Walter Scheidel suggests that the only force strong enough to wrest economic power from those who have it is a world-shattering event like the Black Death, the fall of the Roman Empire, or World War I. While each event changed the world in a different way, they all had a tremendous leveling effect on society.</p><p>But not even this explains everything in the above graph. Pandemics subsequent to the Black Death had little effect on inequality, and inequality continued to fall for decades after World War II ended. Prof. Alfani suggests that we remember the importance of human agency through institutional change. He attributes much of the post-WWII decline in inequality to \"the redistributive policies and the development of the welfare states from the 1950s to the early 1970s.\"</p><h2>What does this mean for us now?</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_b6dKwfa_Ds\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>As Professor Alfani put it in his email:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"[H]istory does not necessarily teach us whether we should consider the current trend toward growth in economic inequality as an undesirable outcome or a problem per se (although I personally believe that there is some ground to argue for that). Nor does it teach us that high inequality is destiny. What it does teach us, is that if we do not act, we have no reason whatsoever to expect that inequality will, one day, decline on its own. History also offers abundant evidence that past trends in inequality have been deeply influenced by our collective decisions, as they shaped the institutional framework across time. So, it is really up to us to decide whether we want to live in a more, or a less unequal society.\"</p><ul></ul><div><br/></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/gRnObgAkyPI\"
