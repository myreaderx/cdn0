He anticipated the Pfizer vaccine to be available during the second month of the upcoming new year.</p>\n<p>Touching on the American Ambassador&#8217;s stance vis-à-vis the Ministry of Health due to his connection with Hezbollah, Dr. Hasan considered this as being a &#8220;politicized position, since health support is a human right and must not be linked to any questioning or doubts, especially with the Ministry&#8217;s financial disclosure and guarantee of transparency available on its website.&#8221; He also noted that &#8220;protecting the Lebanese, displaced Syrians, Palestinian refugees and various residents of Lebanon is not only the responsibility of Lebanon, but the entire international community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Referring to private hospitals, Dr. Hasan underlined that &#8220;the Ministry of Public Health is carrying out all its duties to support private hospitals and collect their rightful dues, while in turn, these hospitals must play their national and humanitarian role at this critical stage.&#8221;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 18:08:38 +0000","feedId":37550,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"564492491116beee970b56090cd3b6bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/05/manar-02573510015896538099.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_6/2020/11/14/18-44-25-474_95c456d682615408.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605379404332}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 02:43:24","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 02:43:24","feedId":37550,"fetchDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 18:43:24 +0000","fetchMs":3194,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":65298,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"8edd0348c26217c934bf858576e98787","hostName":"us-024*","requestId":"0590fe3b23cb4a4d946a4fcf8b3f339e_37550","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":6910,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:11:16","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:26:08","id":37550,"name":"Al-Manar TV Lebanon","url":"http://www.almanar.com.lb/english/rss.php","subscriber":86,"website":null,"icon":"http://english.almanar.com.lb/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn82@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-26-07-340_3b702dfbe6af5085.jpg","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":6910,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605379401128,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":3199,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":62093,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-013.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://europe-60.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/05/manar-02573510015896538099.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":242,"destHeight":209,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_6/2020/11/14/18-44-25-474_95c456d682615408.webp","sourceBytes":6361,"destBytes":6910,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":37550,"totalSpendMs":1820,"convertSpendMs":4,"createdTime":"2020-11-15 02:44:24","host":"europe-60*","referer":"http://external.english.almanar.com.lb/?p=1197737","linkMd5ListStr":"564492491116beee970b56090cd3b6bd","githubUser":"myreaderx25","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"compressRate":"108.6%","sourceSize":"6.2 KB","destSize":"6.7 KB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
