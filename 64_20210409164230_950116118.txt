Usually, I see them in cabins and rarely at a larger scale but Circle Wood by Mobius Architekci has taken it to the next level. This stunning circular home is clad in okume wood which was chosen to make the structure blend into the surrounding pine forest. The Warsaw-based architectural firm drew inspiration from a large cut tree trunk for the shape of the home.</p>\n<p>Circle wood is a 400 sqm building complete with an overhanging oval frame that encloses the garage as well as an open spa area &#8211; all very well &#8217;rounded up&#8217; so the zones seamlessly flow into one another. Every part of the design from its form, the material, and the color palette was carefully chosen so that it would merge into the landscape and also offer privacy to the residents. The exterior features elegant and knotless panels of okume wood that were sourced from West Africa. This choice of cladding material was also instrumental in making the residence naturally blend into the pine forest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought of the house as a big piece of a tree trunk. Designing through reduction looked like hewing pockets of rooms and cozy, semi-private, glazed alcoves into the wood. Consequently, users can feel as if they are continuously strolling through the trees. It is full of glazing that blurs the boundaries. The plot offers the freedom, or rather intimacy of communing with nature and architecture,&#8221; said says Przemek Olczyk, lead architect and founder of Mobius Architekci.</p>\n<p>The modern home has been designed for an art lover and collector who did not wish to hide away from the surroundings but also wanted it to be an intimate space. The interiors have been inspired by the flow of a private art gallery. Every element was picked out keeping the beauty of nature in mind so that it would complement the location while creating a visual harmony between the outside and inside. One of the most beautiful parts of this house is the central atrium which rises up towards the sky and brings in plenty of daylight and forest views. Another striking piece in the house is the ribbon-like, white, gigantic staircase which adds to the artistic aesthetic. This is going on the list of my dream homes and if I ever happen to get one, you best believe ill be running in &#8216;circles&#8217; around it!</p>\n<p>Designer: Przemyslaw Olczyk Mobius

manufacturing and life-cycle. A majority of the products we consume are carbon-positive &#8211; which means their production requires carbon emissions in some form (whether it&#8217;s the creation, the distribution, the usage, or even the disposal). Some products, on the other hand, aim at being carbon-neutral by reducing the amount of emissions needed, or balancing them out with practices that pull carbon out of the atmosphere. PANGEA&#8217;s Bamboo Adventure Towel 2.0 is carbon-negative &#8211; they pull more carbon out of the atmosphere than they put in, leaving the earth in a better condition than it was before.</p>\n<p>This vision makes sense, considering PANGEA was founded by a bunch of backpackers who care deeply for nature and the planet&#8217;s wellbeing. Their previous product was the PANGEA Bamboo Travel Towel, a sustainable bamboo-fiber towel that went on to become Kickstarter&#8217;s most funded travel towel ever. With the Bamboo Adventure Towel 2.0, PANGEA hopes to make everything bigger and better, from the towel itself, to the impact the towel has.</p>\n<p>Unlike most travel towels which come made from plastic microfibers, the Bamboo Adventure Towel 2.0 has absolutely no plastic used in its construction. As its name suggests, it comes crafted from 100% bamboo fibers, dyed with natural dyes, and woven into a waffle pattern for effective absorption and exfoliation. Designed for the outdoors, the towels are up to thrice as absorbent as your average microfiber towel and is naturally hypoallergenic and anti-bacterial. In fact, the towels even come with reinforced slits on the corners, so you can suspend them and use them as makeshift sun-shades, or even wear them as cloaks or ponchos. Available in as many as 5 natural colors, the Bamboo Adventure Towel 2.0 comes in 3 sizes, a standard, pocket, and an XL (which transforms into a poncho too) and arrives packaged in a carrying case either made from cork or from a breathable cotton mesh. Every part of the Bamboo Adventure Towel 2.0 + packaging is designed using natural materials and can safely biodegrade outdoors or even be composted at home (barring the plastic zipper on the case and the aluminum carabiner clip).</p>\n<p>So wait, how is the towel carbon-negative? Well, that philosophy comes naturally baked into Pangea&#8217;s business model. For every $10 that the company makes, Pangea commits to removing 2lbs of trash from the ocean and 2lbs worth of carbon from our atmosphere. With funds from its previous towel, the company organized as many as 26 international ocean cleanups with over 900 volunteers, and Pangea aims at using funds from this project to help set up river-barriers that help trap waste before it enters our ocean. If the project reaches its stretch goal of $200,000, Pangea will put river barriers in the world&#8217;s dirtiest river, the Citarum, trapping and collecting nearly 40 tonnes of waste each year. The company is extremely transparent about what it does with its money too. Profits make up 15% of the company&#8217;s revenue, and nearly half the amount goes into environmental cleanups while the other significant chunk goes towards ensuring Pangea&#8217;s employees are fairly compensated for their work.

height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Spring is receding and the weather is heating up steadily. Most of us are already taming our yards and when the good weather is here, some of us will want to cook and dine under the sun. For the good <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/bbq/\">barbeque</a> and occasional wine sessions, a decent outdoor layout is a must-have. One such contraption which is worth every penny you shell for it &#8211; owing to its design that maximizes function – is the Convivium Mobile Bar from Italy-based Il Giardino di Corten.</p>\n<p>The modular outdoor kitchen – that includes a bar &#8211; is made from weather-resistant corten steel, similar to the brand’s other products for home and garden. Laid out beautifully for cooking and serving cocktails al fresco, this outdoor kitchen setup is equipped with an electric, gas, or charcoal grill and wooden cutting board to cater to the cooking needs. A kitchen is not complete without its washing area –Convivium Mobile Bar is fitted with a stainless steel sink that features pull-out taps, so the outright appeal and distinctive appearances of the design are maintained.</p>\n<p>When a few party people are busy at the BBQ, the others can engross themselves in pleasant conviviality at the bar that features its own bottle holder, glass holders, trays for ingredients, and ice containers. As a host, you have the choice to choose different modules of Convivium Mobile Bar – you can select from the two sizes – the entire kitchen and bar setup or simply the kitchen area complete with the steel sink. In either case, the outdoor kitchen features generously sized compartments for storing cooking/serving tools and accessories. The compartment&#8217;s doors have contrasting vertical door handles that add a touch of plush to the rusty look.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer</strong>: <a

Salvatore Ville, a car designer at Tata Motors, takes his bikes seriously, probably why he embarked on modifying the design of a BMW K100 into an attractive café racer.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Salvatore says he wanted to give the bike a sensual appeal by giving it sexy proportions. According to him, the BMW Ki Concept embodies the aesthetic heritage from the yesteryears, in a shape that’s not limited by the norms of the law. The bike is powered by an electric motor and manages to retain BMW’s DNA in totality. The fat rear wheel promises superior grip at high speeds and better handling while cornering chicanes. The beefed-up muscular body done in dual tone of black and silver lends BMW Ki a contrasting personality, complemented by the all-black rims at the front and the silver ones on the rear wheels. While the front wheel has a very classic feel with the wheel spokes visible, the rear is done in a contrasting modern tone.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This concept elevates the classic appeal of the BMW K100 to a level of modern charm – like in the headlight, which is so modern. Rightfully, BMW Ki Concept deserves the attention to one day actually make it past the drawing board as a real café racer machine powered by clean electric energy.</span></p>\n<p>Designer: Salvatore

height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309966\" /></p>\n<p>Sleek, with minimal details, and controls that are as baffling as the AppleTV Remote yet equally appealing. This may be Designer Hannes Geipel&#8217;s version of a Microsoft Surface Gaming Controller, but it definitely has a very strong Apple-esque vibe to it.</p>\n<p>The Surface Gaming Controller concept by Hannes Geipel boasts of a brilliantly simple form. With absolutely no frills, textures, accents, or color-separation, the Surface Gaming Controller has a clean look to it that is a major contrast to Microsoft&#8217;s own Xbox controller. The Surface Gaming Controller comes with a soft, satin finish, and sports two rather slick looking joypads with a metallic ring around them. The joypads lie perfectly in reach of your thumb, while two large X signs sit where you&#8217;d expect the D-pad and the XYAB buttons.</p>\n<p>However, instead of the buttons, the controller opts for flaps, using the X-shaped cutouts to create triangular plastic flaps that bend inward when pressed. The flaps give a natural spring-like action, providing just the right amount of resistance as you press it&#8230; although whether this detail is better than your average button from a tactile standpoint is something that&#8217;s yet to be determined. On the aesthetic front, the X-shaped cutouts definitely set the controller apart visually! There are even a pair of triggers on the upper corners of the controller, although they sit flush against the surface and recess inwards when pressed.</p>\n<p>All the details on the Surface Gaming Controller focus more on form than on function, resulting in a device that definitely looks good. I&#8217;d arguably compare this to the AppleTV Remote, which most consumers will agree is more visually pleasing than functionally useful. Then again, the Surface Game Controller is just a concept. It echoes the clean, no-nonsense design of Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Book and Surface Pro, comes with minimal backlighting for night-time gaming, and if you look carefully, you&#8217;ll even spot the Microsoft logo on the back!</p>\n<p>Designer: Hannes Geipel</p>\n<p><img

<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/hybrid/\">hybrid</a> powertrains – at least for motorbikes. And not your usual hybrid, it’s going to be a hydrogen-electric powertrain for minimal environmental impact with the maximum power output. After experimenting with the clumsy-looking electric-powered Segway Apex unveiled in 2019, Segway has again dropped a bombshell on the automotive community in the form of a Segway Apex H2 hybrid bike. The machine is going to be a hydrogen fuel cell-driven monster with a reworked frame bestowing it with a futuristic design that is rounded enough to keep it from being extremely aggressive/ edgy design with the neon rings on the wheels embodying a definite Tron vibe.</p>\n<p>The highly combustible fuel (we are talking about hydrogen, right) is the way to go for the future, and Apex H2 wants to leverage it, just like the hydrogen fuel cell hybrid cars. The machine will have hydrogen gas stored in the tanks which will be converted into electrical energy to power the electric motors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309923\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/segway-apex-h2-hydrogen-electric-hybrid-is-the-cybertruck-of-the-motorbike-world/Segway-Apex-H2-hydrogen-electric-hybrid-motorbike-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>From what we see here, there isn’t any visible hub motor to actuate the rear wheel. It’s left only to the imagination that Segway might be onto something innovative here. The mean-looking suspension forks make the Apex H2 a predator on the prowl to eat down the miles of freeway. It’s kind of floating as front wheels are attached to a single-sided front swingarm (to match the one on the rear), and a well-disguised monoshock setting. The sporty aesthetics continue to the steering mechanism neatly tucked in the stellar body of the machine under the tank. Those flowing sharp lines, and the chiseled look, actually makes the Apex H2 futureproof when it finally makes it to reality – it’s so irresistible.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309921\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/segway-apex-h2-hydrogen-electric-hybrid-is-the-cybertruck-of-the-motorbike-world/Segway-Apex-H2-hydrogen-electric-hybrid-motorbike-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>According to Segway, the motorbike will churn out 60KW (80 hp) of meat for an acceleration of 0-62 mph in flat four seconds. The top speed will also be right there at the sweet spot at around 93 mph. All this signals a performance machine coming our way in 2023. Yes, Segway says, they are on track to bring the Apex H2 to the motor enthusiasts for an estimated price tag of $10,700.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-309922\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/segway-apex-h2-hydrogen-electric-hybrid-is-the-cybertruck-of-the-motorbike-world/Segway-Apex-H2-hydrogen-electric-hybrid-motorbike-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>While the price tag might surprise you, as it’s not very high, it signals Segway’s intention to make it a practical performance road bike. Of course, having hydrogen fuel stations is one question still leaving a lot to the imagination, the bike for now is your best bet to ride an urban mean machine to enchant the crowd. It has that Cybertruck-like masculine character to make anyone go weak in the knees!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.ninebot.com/product/SegwayApexH2\" target=\"_blank\"

Imagine this&#8230; the board occupies the same amount of space as a rolling pin, but just when you need it, open it out and it unfolds into a beautiful surface to prep your veggies, chop up some fruits, or even butcher your meat. Plus, the mat curves up as you lift it, making it much easier to empty your chopped/diced/julienned food into a saucepan or skillet!</p>\n<p>The uniquely flexible Trebonn Roll mat is made of two parts. Individual vertical strips made from a knife-friendly polymer, connected together by a flexible, food-grade, dishwasher-friendly silicone mat. The silicone is responsible for the mat&#8217;s hinges, and a magnetic closure at one end lets you snap the mat shut in place. Open it out and the mat unfolds to reveal a flat cutting surface&#8230; just make sure your knife-work isn&#8217;t parallel to the silicone hinges (you don&#8217;t want to accidentally cut the hinges through and through). Once you&#8217;re done cutting and chopping, the mat&#8217;s flexible design makes it easy to collect all your chopped bits and pour them into your crock pot, saucepan, skillet, or mixing bowl. The mat&#8217;s easy to clean &#8211; it rinses under tap water, or conversely, you could just place it in the dishwasher with the rest of your cutlery. When you&#8217;re done, it rolls right up into a nice scroll that fits right in one of your kitchen drawers, occupying a mere fraction of the space any regular cutting board would!</p>\n<p>Designer:

Bags come with handles that make them easy to hold, so do cups&#8230; so why don&#8217;t phones come with handles too? No, I&#8217;m not under the influence of anything, it&#8217;s just a pretty straightforward question. Phones today are much bigger (and also more slippery) than the average hand can hold&#8230; try using your phone for an entire day with just one hand and you&#8217;ll realize it isn&#8217;t really possible or comfortable (go ahead, try pressing that back button on the top left corner on your iPhone). This weird phone-palm-size-conundrum has ended up spawning a dozen products, from pop-socket rings to friction cases&#8230; but the guys at Phone Loops have a pretty simple idea that, at least on paper, works rather remarkably well. The Phone Strap is a simple piece of silicone that &#8216;rubber bands&#8217; around your phone (sitting wedged between your smartphone and cover), giving you a handle to help you hold your phone better. Measuring just 0.85mm (.03 inches) in thickness, the strap sits flat on the back of your phone-case at all times, respecting its sleekness and allowing you to fit your phone into your pocket with ease; but slip your hand underneath the strap and it suddenly transforms into a handle, letting you hold your phone comfortably without danger of it falling or accidentally slipping from your hand while you use it.</p>\n<p>The solution sounds incredibly rudimentary, but that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s so appealing about it. As simple as the idea outwardly is, it&#8217;s just as effective too. The silicone band provides just the right amount of traction, ensuring single-handed phone-use with absolute ease, and it just universally fits on any type of smartphone you have, sandwiching itself between the phone and case to make sure it never slips out accidentally. No matter what phone you have, where the camera&#8217;s oriented, or even if you&#8217;ve got a MagSafe accessory on your case, the Phone Strap finds a unique way to integrate itself in place, giving you the functionality you need&#8230; without being as monstrous and ugly as some of those thick ring-sockets.</p>\n<p>Each Phone Strap comes made from food-grade silicone, is easy to sanitize, and comes in one universal size that fits onto any phone like a glove. The silicone provides just the right amount of friction, ensuring your phone never slips out from your hand, and it even allows you to hang your phone from hooks or other hook-like forms to create your own MacGyverian phone-stands. Each Phone Strap also comes with an optional Modular Sling which lets you turn your phone into a cross-body wearable, sort of holstering it in place right across your chest. It&#8217;s oddly fashionable, and is a neat way to carry your phone around on your person (quite literally, if I may add)! When strapped in place using the Modular Sling&#8217;s carabiner-style clips, your smartphone can also become a fitness wearable or a body-cam, allowing you to either track your workout, or film your morning run. The Phone Strap and Modular Sling are unconventional at best, but they&#8217;re a great example of lateral thinking. They solve common problems perfectly, although in justifiably unique ways&#8230; and if the only complaint you have at the end of the day is that they&#8217;re unusual, well then so be it!</p>\n<p>Designer: Jean-Philippe Brousseau of Phone Loops</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yanko.fnd.to/phoneloops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $9</strong></a>.

changing times, social spaces need to change too&#8230; and it seems like Herman Miller has noticed that. As a world that&#8217;s slowly preparing to step out of their homes and go back to offices again, this unique window of time we&#8217;ve got is perfect to redefine productivity and how offices should look in this new future. Herman Miller&#8217;s OE1 series of furniture helps define the &#8216;new age&#8217; office by creating a space that&#8217;s more conducive to co-working and socializing, instead of locking people in cubicles to make them more productive. The OE1 series brings an element of openness, dynamism, and fun to the workplace, giving it a unique facelift that definitely contrasts from the restrictive atmosphere created by working from home.</p>\n<p>Short for Optimized Essentials, the OE1 range is &#8220;designed to help people experiment with space, discover what works in the moment, and change rapidly for the future&#8221;. It focuses on adaptability and on agility, by allowing modules to interconnect or separate, and work well both as a part of a team or as individual units&#8230; sort of like humans. The furniture elements can be scaled up, scaled down, or fine-tuned to create the workspace you need. Filled with basic forms and vibrant colors, the OE1 series has just the right amount of character to add a minimalist yet vibrant touch to the workspace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The ideas behind OE1 predate COVID-19. The collection is the result of two years of development, driven by an international research project, in which the team interviewed everyone from office managers to sci-fi writers about the future of work. But as the collection came to a crest in 2020, amid a rise of remote work in response to the global pandemic, this future-forward design became a much more urgent one&#8221;, reports <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90622893/herman-millers-new-office-line-is-the-anti-cubicle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Company</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309883\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>“I often say with a mixture of pride and sorrow that Herman Miller invented the cubicle&#8230; probably envisioning a utopia, and it became something different,” says CEO of Herman Miller, Andi Owen. “We envision a future where [modular, flexible] furniture styles are the ones that are most dominant” Owen replies, indicating the demise of the restrictive cubicle, and the creation of what is referred to as an &#8220;unsystem&#8221; &#8211; or a series of individual elements that can be mixed and matched in a variety of ways, without ever really &#8216;going wrong&#8217;.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309884\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309885\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s immediately characteristic of the OE1 is that even as it creates separate, independent workspaces, it does so without putting the user in a bubble. People are still welcome to look each other in the eye, exchange pleasantries and ideas, and work as a collective whole instead of as individual cogs in a machine.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309886\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309887\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>The Agile Wall [above and below] is a series of vertical panels that act as functional elements even serving as room dividers.

Each Micro Pack comes with an adjustable desk system, letting you choose between sitting and standing formats, while even organizing your cables into a central channel. Along with it all, the Micro Pack even lets you hang your bag or backpack on a hook placed right beneath the desk, so you don’t have to drop your purse on the ground when you sit at your desk.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309890\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309891\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>For more traditional sitting desks, you&#8217;ve got OE1 Storage Trolleys that nest nicely under them, allowing you to cut the clutter on your table yet still have all your stuff at hand. The trolleys can be moved around as you shift workspaces, and can even be turned into stools by popping a seat on top, so you can have a quick conversation with your colleagues without dragging your chair around.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309892\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309893\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309894\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/herman-millers-latest-office-furniture-range-abandons-the-cubicle-and-promotes-social-freedom/herman_miller_oe1_12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Ultimately, with the OE1 series, Herman Miller aims at building up the workplace by breaking it down. Plagued by the &#8216;cubicle culture&#8217; that they themselves created, the OE1 is Herman Miller&#8217;s way of going back to the drawing board and redefining creativity and productivity in a way that is less bound by rules and is more accommodating of diverse work cultures. In a rather bittersweet way, it also takes into account the fact that workplaces may see downsizing, budget cuts, and migration to smaller office spaces. With the modular design of the OE1 and those innovative Micro Packs, Herman Miller hopes to create a workplace that fits &#8216;more into less&#8217; while still “making [the workplace] as comfortable as possible.”</p>\n<p>Designers: <a href=\"https://www.hermanmiller.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Herman Miller</a> in collaboration with Kim Colin and Sam Hecht</p>\n<p><img
