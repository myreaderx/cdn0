According to a simple Google search, NSW has a population of 8.166 million people.&nbsp; We’ve done the math on this site before, but 112 out of 8.166 million is a rounding error. The ruling class is just laughing at us now.&nbsp; They are all looking down on us at how stupid we have become as the human race continues to obey and comply with their every whim. If we keep going like this and continue to act like the slaves we are, we can expect to continue to be treated as slaves.</p> \n<p><a title=\"The Science of Fear: How The Elitists Use it to Control Us &amp; How to Break Free\" href=\"https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-science-of-fear-how-the-elitists-use-it-to-control-us-how-to-break-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What have we come to if people are afraid</a> of those kinds of numbers? The brainwashing has worked out great.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Fearing a Delta variant outbreak, nearly half of Australia’s population went into lockdown for around three days last month with major urban centers across the country tightening their pandemic restrictions due to fears of a delta variant-fueled outbreak. However, the brunt of the current outbreak has largely been restricted to Sydney and its surrounding regions. Australia had previously managed to almost completely clamp down on the local spread of Covid-19 by using a mix of contact tracing, movement curbs, and strict quarantine measures for incoming travelers. But the country’s sluggish vaccine rollout threatens to undo its previous pandemic success. –<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/07/12/no-end-in-sight-for-sydney-lockdown-as-delta-variant-fueled-outbreak-worsens/?sh=4fd9444c211d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Forbes</em></a></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The ruling class will not stop manufacturing fear of this COVID-19 scam until it no longer works.&nbsp; At that point, however, we should be keeping our eyes open for another more sinister plot to keep people in their current state of enslavement. The ruling class is exploiting fear and we all know that by now:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4LtEciQUF8\" width=\"560\" height=\"333\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p> \n<p class=\"quoteText\">“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb8Rj5xkDPk&amp;t=10s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best slave is the one who thinks he is free</a>.” ―<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/656896-the-best-slave-is-the-one-who-thinks-he-is#:~:text=Quote%20by%20Johann%20von%20Goethe,who%20thinks%20he%20is%20free.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> <span class=\"authorOrTitle\">Johann von Goethe</span></em></a></p> \n<p>We all need to stop legitimizing power over others. No one makes a rightful master, and no one makes a rightful slave, so why do we keep arguing about which master will be better instead of realizing what’s really happening? Stay alert and use critical thinking.&nbsp; As I have mentioned many times, if the rulers in the United States believe they can get away with forcing us all into another lockdown without too many of the slaves figuring out what’s happening, they will do it.</p> \n<p>Stay prepared and alert.&nbsp; Things continue to ramp up and will reach a breaking point eventually.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The primary threat to freedom and justice is not greed, or hatred, or any of the other emotions or human flaws usually blamed for such things. Instead, it is one ubiquitous superstition which infects the minds of people of all races, religions and nationalities, which deceives decent, well-intentioned people into supporting and advocating violence and oppression. Even without making human beings one bit more wise or virtuous, removing that one superstition would remove the vast majority of injustice and suffering from the world. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ANFCc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>-The Most Dandgerous Superstition</em></a></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Most-Dangerous-Superstition-Larken-Rose/dp/145075063X?crid=2HG9OQ9HE5187&amp;keywords=most+dangerous+superstition&amp;qid=1626092741&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=most+dangerous+superst%2Cstripbooks%2C203&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=li2&amp;tag=tn030-20&amp;linkId=97b4662e736a3e3bd5953d99f05605b6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_il\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=145075063X&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=tn030-20&amp;language=en_US\" width=\"232\" height=\"297\" border=\"0\" /></a><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"border: none !important;
