</b><br /><br />Now, looking back on it all, I really am starting to feel that this was a big stink about nothing but words:<br /><br />Astronomers got hung up on definitions.<br />People got hung up on scientists changing the meaning of a word without even (in their minds) an explanation.<br /><br />Of course, there <u>were</u> explanations.&nbsp; A lot of them.<br /><br />But the reasoning about what the problem <u>was</u> with Pluto was - to my mind - all over the place: Pluto's too small to be a Planet, it has too weird an orbit, its moon is too close its own size,&nbsp; it's too far away, or it's got too many other space objects near it to be a Planet.<br /><br />It started to remind me of when I was a kid and a teacher decided to really dislike a student in the class.&nbsp; Once the decision had been made that the kid was a bad egg, then any and every transgression, no matter how minor, was continuing proof of the student's badness, by definition:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"You were one minute late! Typical.&nbsp; You stay for detention!\"<br />\"But Jack was <u>five</u> minutes late and you didn't say anything to him!\"<br />\"Yes, but he isn't a bad student like you!\"</blockquote><br />But really, the source of this Pluto angst was nothing more than disagreement about what a being \"Planet\" actually meant.&nbsp; In 2006, a large group of astronomers decided to try its hand at a clearly defining the word \"Planet\" and decide whether Pluto fit into this definition.<br /><br /><br />But the more I read about it, I find the solution they devised to be a lot less than satisfying.<br /><br />And it doesn't have anything to do with Pluto. <br /><br />So what's my beef?<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><b>Words wander, too</b><br /><br />To start with, let's understand where the problem started.<br /><br />Back before telescopes, all anyone knew about the sky was that there were lots and lots of stars which never shifted in relation to one another.&nbsp; It was like there was a giant rotating sphere, surrounding our world, with the stars painted on it.&nbsp; <u>This</u> star was always just so far from <u>that</u> star - always.&nbsp; The constellations never altered.&nbsp; The Big Dipper never turned into the Big Diaper.<br /><br />But... there were a small number of other star-like things which were different.&nbsp; They <u>did</u> move without any care for the position of some constellation or star.&nbsp; They looked as if they wandered around over the years, each following their own independent paths.&nbsp; And so, in Ancient Greece, they were given the name of <i>plan√≠tis</i>, which means \"wanderer\". &nbsp;So there's the meaning of \"Planet\".<br /><br />What people were <u>actually</u> seeing were objects that orbit the Sun.&nbsp; The only reason they could see those planets is that they were big enough, when lit up by the Sun, to just be seen as shining points in the night sky.<br /><br />Well, that was all fine then.<br /><br />But, now we know that, if it were possible to see <u>all</u> the objects that orbit the sun while we looked up at the night sky, we would see - at least - <i>thousands of \"Planets\"</i>.<br /><br />Yet we don't call them Planets, because they weren't part of the original crew.* <br /><br />They still are indeed \"wanderers\" to us, since they do all orbit the Sun. But they don't really have that big planety <i>feel</i>&nbsp;to them.&nbsp;So, as these things were discovered, we made up other names for these other types of wanderers.<br /><br />Asteroids, Comets, Centaurs, Trojans, trans-Neptunian bits and pieces...<br /><br />The first two we all probably have heard about. The others were new to me until I bothered to look up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System\">Solar System</a> in Wikipedia.<br /><br />But while these names are pretty, they don't tell the uninitiated much about what they really are.<br /><br />Also confusing matters, some of these objects are defined mainly by what they are made of, others by where they happen to hang out in the Solar System, &nbsp;and others still by a combination of location and weird behavior.<br /><br />And <u>then</u> there were these almost-Planety things that a lot of people <u>really</u> didn't want to call planets.<br />Did you know know that it isn't just Pluto? &nbsp;There are five rocks already in the class: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29\" title=\"Ceres (dwarf planet)\">Ceres</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Haumea_%28dwarf_planet%29\" title=\"Haumea (dwarf planet)\">Haumea</a>, <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Makemake_%28dwarf_planet%29\" title=\"Makemake (dwarf planet)\">Makemake</a>, <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Eris_%28dwarf_planet%29\" title=\"Eris (dwarf planet)\">Eris</a>, join Pluto as not-quite-good-enoughs, and there appear to be a few more that might fit into this fuzzy&nbsp;category depending on what further study&nbsp;shows.<br /><br />If Pluto <u>was</u> going to be called a planet, then why not the others?&nbsp; Instead of the nine planets we <u>had</u>, why shouldn't we just go ahead and say there are 13 planets... and counting?&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder if that's what was getting some astronomers' goats about Pluto.&nbsp; I mean, on its own, Pluto was harmless.&nbsp; But maybe the idea, that any large hunk of junk that happened to float by&nbsp;might have to be admitted into the gated community of Planethood, might have been a bit too much to swallow. <br /><br />Well, for whatever reasons, in response to both the \"what is Pluto\" debate and the growing zoo of names for space things, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union\" title=\"International Astronomical Union\">International Astronomical Union</a> made decided to make a new set of classifications for the Things in the Solar System.<br /><br /><br /><b>The Great Planetary Purge&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Well, the IAU (why on earth aren't they calling themselves the Astro-Union? That has 50s sci-fi cool written all over it!) grouped the entire Solar System into 3 large classes of Sun-orbiting objects&nbsp;(Moons, since they orbit some other rock or gas-ball and not the Sun, aren't included in this. &nbsp;They are simply property of their local rock or gas-ball):<br /><br />1) The eight \"Planets\": Men Very Early Make Jars Stand Up Neatly**<br />2) The five (and counting) Pluto-like bodies that no one knew what to do with.<br />3) Everything else.<br /><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4yAVG9BTE1E/TQZTQufhPPI/AAAAAAAAAws/W2-Me5OSsk4/s1600/astro+union.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4yAVG9BTE1E/TQZTQufhPPI/AAAAAAAAAws/W2-Me5OSsk4/s320/astro+union.jpg\" width=\"280\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Really it would totally work!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />For the all-important <i>status</i> of \"Planet\", the Astro-Union - oh, ok, fine! - the IAU made this definition.&nbsp; A Planet is:<br /><ul><li>something that orbits the  local star&nbsp;</li><li>is big enough to have been push-pulled into a spherical shape&nbsp;</li><ul><li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium#Planetary_geology\">it's a gravity-ish thing</a>: basically, when something is big enough it's  going to start becoming  somewhat round. &nbsp;I only really understand half of it, myself.</li></ul><li>doesn't have any other celestial body (other than its own moons) orbiting anywhere nearby.</li></ul>That last point is where the not-good-enough rocks fall short, it seems: They all have other big chunks of crap floating around  nearby.<br /><br />Apparently, these are the bachelors, the  boys-not-yet-men, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Madison\">Oscar Madisons</a> of the Solar System***.

Clearly, someone was getting a kick out of seeing the Pro-Pluto-Planet faction with steam coming out of their ears, so we can just accept this as par for the course.<br /><br />But even just for the logically inclined there's something annoying about  this naming system:<br /><br />There are such things as Dwarf <u>Stars</u>.&nbsp; They are part of the  larger great family called, er...
