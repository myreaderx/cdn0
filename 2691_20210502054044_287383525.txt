Now you can click to expand the diffs above or below your changes to get a more complete picture of the rest of the file around the changes made. You can also use a context menu on the diff to expand the whole file.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GitHub-Desktop-expanding-diffs-2.gif\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"hide-whitespace-in-diffs\">Hide whitespace in diffs<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57485#hide-whitespace-in-diffs\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Hide whitespace in diffs\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Similar to being able to see more context around your changes, sometimes there are a lot of whitespace changes in a file that don’t allow you to get a clear picture of the substantive changes that happened. Now, in both changes and history, you can optionally hide whitespace changes to allow you to focus just on the more meaningful changes to your code. This feature was built almost entirely by Steven Yeh (<a href=\"https://github.com/say25\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@say25</a>), a fantastic and close community contributor to GitHub Desktop. Steven is a long-time open source contributor to GitHub Desktop, and we’re immensely grateful for him continuing to help improve the product.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GitHub-Desktop-hiding-whitespace-changes.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"create-aliases-for-repositories-locally\">Create aliases for repositories locally<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57485#create-aliases-for-repositories-locally\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Create aliases for repositories locally\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Many developers keep more than one copy of a repository in GitHub Desktop, and the way repositories are displayed makes it tricky to differentiate between them. In GitHub Desktop 2.8, you can create aliases for your local repositories to easily tell them apart in the list.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GitHub-Desktop-repository-aliases.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"we-appreciate-your-input\">We appreciate your input<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57485#we-appreciate-your-input\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"We appreciate your input\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>All of the recent features we’ve shipped have come as a direct result of the great feedback we get from talking with users and hearing from you in our <a href=\"https://github.com/desktop/desktop\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open source repository</a>. With more than one million users actively using GitHub Desktop every month and more than 200 community contributors, we so appreciate all the feedback and contributions that help make GitHub Desktop even better every day.
