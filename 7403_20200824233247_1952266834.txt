We have been working for more than 18 months to re-think Kibana’s entire architecture from first principles in order to build a new system designed for scalability and efficiency. We are thrilled in 7.9 to report that work has been completed and that all of Kibana has been moved to this new architecture.&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>The most immediate difference you’ll notice with this migration is simply how fast Kibana pages load. Whether you are diagnosing a site outage, investigating suspicious user activity, or putting together a dashboard in time for a meeting, moving between interfaces is immediate and helps keep you in the flow of finishing your task. For the Kibana development community, this new architecture brings a number of powerful enhancements designed to help you build features faster and with greater efficiency.&#160;For more details on this&#160;effort, check out Elastic principal software engineer Josh Dover’s blog post, “<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana\">Introducing a new architecture for Kibana</a>.”\n</p> <strong><h2>Rolling out the welcome mat for Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana</h2></strong><p>At Elastic we talk a lot about how Kibana is the window into the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack\">Elastic Stack</a> and how that stack supports Elastic’s three solutions:&#160;<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/observability\">Elastic Observability</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">Elastic Security</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search\">Elastic Enterprise Search</a>. In 7.8 we reorganized the Kibana side navigation to help make observability and security applications easier to find and in 7.9 we’re completing the solution trifecta by adding enterprise search to the fold. For existing users of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/app-search\">App Search</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search\">Workplace Search</a>, you’ll now be able to quickly see your existing engines from within Kibana as well as launch directly into those environments.

Viewers of Kibana dashboards enjoy not just detailed charts, but also the ability to easily interact and filter analyses in order to discover additional insights. In 7.8 we released the Drilldowns capability for Kibana which lets you create custom drill paths between one or more dashboards. In 7.9 we’re going even further by introducing the explore underlying data feature that allows you to simply use a chart’s action panel to go directly to the Discover app so you can investigate the document level details of the chart data you were just looking at — complete with the previously selected filter, query, and time range.&#160;\n</p><p>This new capability works from the context menu of any standard Kibana visualization (including Kibana Lens visuals) based on a single Elasticsearch index. In can also be enabled as an in-chart context menu by editing your kibana.yaml settings file to add: <strong><code>pack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInChart.enabled: true</code></strong>\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"5mchj5q3l\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"5mchj5q3l\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltcaed233aa861bbd8/5f3ab64131523c5cba9b847e/video-kibana-explore-underlying-data-discover2.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h2>Doing more with Anomaly Explorer visuals in dashboards</h2></strong><p>In 7.8 we made it <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-7-8-0-released\">possible to add visuals from Anomaly Explorer right into a dashboard</a> just like any other chart to help you build more robust views of your data.&#160;In 7.9 we’ve added three new capabilities to that experience designed to give you and viewers of your dashboards even greater interactivity. The first is the ability to select cells within an embedded Anomaly Explorer visual and use that selection as a time filter for the rest of the dashboard. The second new capability is simply the option to use selected cells as an overall dashboard filter. And lastly, you can now navigate from an embedded Anomaly Explorer view in a dashboard directly to that view in the Anomaly Detection tab within Elastic Machine Learning. All of these new features help you easily integrate visualized machine learning results directly within your dashboards, making it simple to create analyses that offer deeper insights&#160;into&#160;your data.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"1ol53jcc0\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"1ol53jcc0\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1cdcceb71c6a02e5/5f3a9b761340d47a564b5d6d/video-ml-anomaly-explorer-swimlane-filters.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h2>Embedding Kibana: New iframe configurations</h2></strong><p>Taking Kibana dashboards and embedding them in your internal wiki or even your external website is a powerful way to put visualized insights from Elasticsearch data in front of hundreds if not thousands or even tens of people. In 7.9, thanks to an outstanding community contribution from <a href=\"https://github.com/ajwild\">Alex Wild</a>, you have greater flexibility to show exactly which elements appear when you embed Kibana via iframe.&#160;Specifically, you can now choose to include or exclude the filter bar, query, time bar, and top menu.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"68wtj704s\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"68wtj704s\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf86752036ab5960c/5f3a9be70f176f7b9ab29380/video-kibana-embed-configurations.mp4\"></video>\n</div> <strong><h3></h3></strong> <strong><h2>Kibana Lens</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Visually comparing data using multiple y axes</h3></strong><p>Comparing two metrics at the same time is a powerful and quick way to spot outliers. For example, you might be monitoring for potential intrusion threats against your website by tracking something like port scans in one analysis and unique IP addresses in another. Both of these are the right places to be looking, but separately these metrics might not tell the whole story.&#160;The ability to place these two indicators visually on top of each other might be the only way to flag that a single IP is actually conducting a suspiciously high number of the overall port scans against your site for a given time period.\n</p><p>In 7.9 we want to make this kind of data comparison even easier in Kibana Lens, which is why we’re so excited to be rolling out the ability to have two metrics on a y axes at the same time.&#160;Lens has always been able to stack multiple metrics on top of one another (either from the same index or different ones), but with the new multiple y axes capability you no longer have to have those fields share the same left-hand axis. In 7.9 you can control which y axis is measured on the right and which is on the left, giving you the power to compare and contrast data with vastly different ranges.&#160;Using this feature will be especially helpful when looking to compare an aggregated metric (e.g., total pageviews) against a percentage (e.g., webpage bounce rate) since the potentially wide ranged metric whose results could tally in the millions won’t visually drown the percentage whose results are most often between 1 and 100.&#160;\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"tmlbpv35c\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"tmlbpv35c\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt143741567c11478b/5f3a9c4048bdc47f3f1e869d/video-kibana-lens-multiple-y-axes.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h3>Custom color selector</h3></strong><p>Crafting the look of your Kibana Lens visualization just got easier in 7.9 with the new ability to pick a specific color for a field on the y axis. The same format & style tab used to shift an axis to the right or left to achieve multiple y axes also contains a series style input that lets you determine the exact color you’d like a metric to be. You can choose between using the visual color picker or entering in an exact hexadecimal color code if you already know the precise color you’d like to use. If you are segmenting your y axis with another field in the “Breakdown by” area to build a stacked bar chart or draw multiple lines, etc., Lens will still automatically pick which colors are used. However, where you are using multiple independent metrics on the y axis for comparison analytics, using this new custom color selector is highly recommended to help you visually create stark color contrast.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"a1z104uti\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"a1z104uti\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt63b5dd750348e971/5f3aa18348bdc47f3f1e86ab/video-kibana-lens-y-axes-color-picker.mp4\"></video>\n</div><p><strong></strong>\n</p><h3><strong>Handling data gaps with fitting functions</strong></h3><p>It is not uncommon when analyzing data to come across gaps where there is simply no data available.&#160;Your website was down for maintenance and so there just aren’t any pageviews for a one-hour period or maybe the time range you are examining when investigating suspicious log activity is granular enough that there are large visual gaps between timestamps.&#160;Whatever the situation, it’s important to be able to visually represent these scenarios accurately or you run the risk of accidentally conveying the wrong message.\n</p><p>In 7.9, Lens helps you do this quickly and easily by introducing the chart settings dropdown which includes data fitting functions designed to let you choose exactly how to represent sparse data. Lens’s default is to not fill in data gaps (hide function), however you can now also choose to fill gaps with zeros (zero function), fill gaps with a line (linear function), or fill gaps according to the last or next data point (last and next functions). Going back to the examples above, a website maintenance outage means there were zero pageviews happening and so representing those breaks by showing a dip to zero might be appropriate. In the hunting suspicious log activity example though, being so zoomed in on a time range that the visual is showing the gaps between single minute timestamp updates doesn’t mean there is a dip in data, just that what’s being shown is literally between normal intervals.&#160;In this scenario it might be more appropriate to use the linear or last options to convey that there is in fact no downward trend or missing data. Regardless of the scenario, Kibana Lens in 7.9 is ready to help you paint the right picture when it comes to filling in the gaps (or not).&#160;\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"q1im68oih\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"q1im68oih\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt922d7f4e7346ed8e/5f3aa884db5c28785b6f075c/video-kibana-lens-fitting-function.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h2>Canvas</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Variables: Edit once, update everything</h3></strong><p>It’s no secret that Canvas gives you the power to create stunning visual dashboards and presentations from your data stored in Elasticsearch. In 7.9 we are making the process for building and iterating beautiful Canvas workpads more efficient by introducing variables when writing Canvas expressions. Where previously you might have hardcoded something in the expression editor like the color of a shape or even the name of an index used by a chart or metric, you now have the ability to use the “var” function.&#160;This allows you to reference a string, boolean, or number that acts as an alias. That alias is tied to a specific value (e.g., hexidecimal color code, index name, etc.) and is accessible in the new variables interface outside of the expression editor. Ultimately this makes changing a single variable all that is potentially needed to update multiple Canvas elements simultaneously.&#160;\n</p><p>The new variables feature is incredibly useful especially if you use your Canvas workpads as templates. If you clone or update workpads often and want to efficiently swap style colors, fonts, etc., or have a lightning fast way to simply&#160;point some or all of the elements at a different Elasticsearch index, then you are going to love using variables.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"ya9rud3xw\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"ya9rud3xw\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt51b83415a5c5e54a/5f3aa8e1327a6201d7ebc36c/video-kibana-canvas-variables-editor.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h2>Elastic Maps</h2></strong> <strong><h3>More out-of-the-box map layers: Network traffic for security practitioners</h3></strong><p>In 7.8 we introduced our first prebuilt solution specific layer in Elastic Maps for observability professionals intended to automatically take APM data and build real user monitoring (RUM) traffic and performance maps in just a few clicks. With 7.9 we're adding a new solution layer for security practitioners, designed to take network data and rapidly build&#160;geography-driven network traffic analyses.&#160;If it feels like you’ve seen something like this before, you have.&#160;This visual is affectionately known as a pew-pew map and already lives as an embedded item in the Network interface for Elastic Security.&#160;Our goal with adding it as a prebuilt layer inside of Elastic Maps is to extend its potential impact for threat hunters with the ability to further customize the analysis using additional data layers as well as make it easier to add to dashboards and Canvas workpads.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"6ugdc4sxf\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"6ugdc4sxf\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt17ef768454e1a750/5f3aa945ddf9d7332963a61f/video-maps-security-layer.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h3>Building filled maps faster with the new choropleth wizard</h3></strong><p>Heatmap? Filled map? Shaded map? If you’ve ever wondered how exactly to refer to a map where the areas inside the map shapes are colored (e.g., a world map comparing various countries, colored according to a metric like GDP, literacy, military budget, etc.), you are in luck because Elastic Maps 7.9 can tell you. It’s officially called a choropleth map and it’s never been easier to build one in the Elastic Maps app with the new choropleth step-by-step wizard. The new Choropleth option in the “Add layer” menu lets you quickly select the administrative boundaries for your geoanalysis or geo_shapes as defined in one of your Elasticsearch indices.&#160;From there it is just a few more clicks to define what metric governs the coloring of your map shapes and then the standard easy to use Elastic Maps formatting options. A key time saver with this new feature is the way the wizard automatically handles the term joins required to connect the data you want to measure with the data needed to create the map shapes.&#160;\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"vp2y7maim\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"vp2y7maim\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1737c26d3a3d19c0/5f3aa993ca538c7eaba30455/video-kibana-maps-choropleth-wizard.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h3>Leveraging custom vector data sources</h3></strong><p>While Elastic Maps provides you with an incredible number of options for building and designing maps built on top of your Elasticsearch data, our goal is also to make it simple to bring in your own customizations. That’s why we’re excited in 7.9 to roll out the ability for you to connect to your own vector data sources in order to control both the context and style of your map. With the new Vector Tile option in the “Add Layer” menu, you can quickly add a URL to your vector data, add the name of the layer you would like to use, then apply stylings to match your desired aesthetic.&#160;\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"zv4018yk2\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"zv4018yk2\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt224cd70cc5403126/5f3aa9deddf9d7332963a623/video-maps-vector-tile-service.mp4\"></video>\n</div><h3>Another reason to zoom-in: New global administrative regions added</h3><p>The ability to see provinces, cantons, states, and counties globally just got a lot easier in 7.9 with the release of a new layer for administrative regions. Thanks to this enhancement you can use your global Elasticsearch data to do things like compare website traffic coming from French departments and German states without having to add each country’s administrative levels individually. Or from a security perspective, in just a couple clicks you can have a detailed view of network activity as specific as something like Chilean administrative districts and Argentine provinces. We’ve added nearly 60 countries worth of administrative data in this release with the goal of letting you create the exact geoanalysis you need.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"t4z5hxapu\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"t4z5hxapu\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt70b23a8f3991f42a/5f3aaa48ddf9d7332963a627/video-maps-administrative-regoins.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h2>Alerting</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Trigger ServiceNow incidents with alerts from the Elastic Stack</h3></strong><p>The release of the new alerting framework in 7.7 introduced an easy way to create alerts in the Elastic Stack and connect to them actionable outcomes like triggering emails, sending messages, or initiating escalations in third-party platforms. With 7.9 we’ve added ServiceNow as a native alerting connector, allowing you to have Elastic Stack alerts create incidents in the ServiceNow platform.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"5nc9py7es\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"5nc9py7es\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltfa1db5a3d31f2cc6/5f3aaaab12fb5b71fd0a1ade/video-alerting-servicenow.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h2>Machine Learning</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Correcting polluted models: Managing snapshots</h3></strong><p>Ever been alerted by Anomaly Detection only to discover after digging in that the culprit is a benign blip in the data causing false alarms? Maybe something went down for maintenance or a project triggered an unusual, but very explainable, set of activity.&#160;Maybe it’s a one-time event so big it is warping baseline results (e.g., Black Friday traffic spike, etc.). Regardless, the result is still a chunk of data feeding into your model and skewing the results.&#160;\n</p><p>In 7.9, fixing this becomes incredibly simple with the new model snapshot management capability accessible directly in the Anomaly Detection user interface that lets you quickly revert back to an earlier snapshot or even just skip the problem events.&#160;Simply navigate to the model snapshots tab in job management and use your mouse to make the updates you need.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"yewuycxas\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"yewuycxas\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt53a2010e77c6f429/5f3aab0e31523c5cba9b8466/video-ml-model-snapshot-management.mp4\"></video>\n</div><p>While reverting a model to a previous snapshot <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-revert-snapshot.html\">has been possible via our API</a>, bringing this capability directly into the UI and also adding the ability to exclude events in a time range supports our ongoing efforts to make machine learning not just powerful, but also easy enough for everyone to use. With model snapshot management, anyone can quickly get an anomaly detection job back to an effective state. And for that reason, we also want to make it even easier to spot when and how models change (especially when those changes are big) which is why we’re adding some great new features to annotations.&#160;&#160;</p> <strong><h3>Automatically generated Anomaly Detection annotations</h3></strong><p>To help give you more insight into Anomaly Detection jobs, we’re introducing a new feature with 7.9 that automatically creates an annotation when a significant change in the model calculation happens. Examples of things that might trigger this include periodicity or a trend or step change. You’ll still be able to add your own annotations and to help make sure you can tell the difference between a system-generated annotation and a user created one;&#160;we’re also updating the annotation table itself by adding search and filter capabilities.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"dtl1ihjxg\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"dtl1ihjxg\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt06903ae3b8569085/5f3aab700f176f7b9ab293c8/video-machine-learning-automatic-annotations.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h3>Seeing your data: Preview charts in the Transforms wizard and data frame analytics&#160;</h3></strong><p>Whether you're transforming your data to get it ready for analysis or evaluating your data after running it through a data frame analytics job, understanding the distribution and range of your fields is important. With 7.9 we’ve added the ability to toggle-on histogram charts in the Transform and data frame analytics wizards so that you can quickly understand the shape of your data columns.&#160;All of this is designed to give you richer visibility into your data so you can spot outliers faster as well as more easily compare prediction results vs. actual values.\n</p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow m-t-40 m-b-40\"><div class=\"vsc-controller\" data-vscid=\"f4175gedv\"></div><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" data-vscid=\"f4175gedv\"><source src=\"https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4e441d059fc330c4/5f3aabc4ddf9d7332963a62b/video-machine-learning-data-grid-preview-charts.mp4\"></video>\n</div><strong><h3>More machine learning integrations with Elastic Observability and Elastic Security</h3></strong><p>On top of the great new standalone machine learning capabilities added in 7.9, Elastic solutions continue to weave machine learning capabilities directly into their experiences to better support monitoring and security professionals. Elastic Security now has five new advanced anomaly detection jobs in 7.9 for AWS CloudTrail designed to spot when a malicious actor may have created, updated, or even deleted a log. If you are using the APM application within Elastic Observability you’ll notice in 7.9 that anomaly data is being surfaced in charts as well as in the service maps.\n</p> <strong><h2>Get hands-on with Kibana 7.9</h2></strong><p>Ready to try out some of these new features?

In this Spotlight we talk to Christopher Brown about his role as an education architect and what it takes to train the next generation of security professionals. </em>\n</p><h3>Can you tell us about your role?\n</h3><p><strong>Christopher Brown: </strong>I’m an education architect at Elastic. Really, I’m more of a security instructor — I don’t actually do a lot of architecting.\n</p><h3>Where are you located?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>I’m based out of central Indiana, about 35 or 40 miles out of Indianapolis. I’m out in the middle of a lot of cornfields. I actually live on five acres surrounded by cornfields. We’re just about to get fiber internet.\n</p><h3>Welcome to the 21st century!</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>Traditionally I’m a road warrior and the hotel Wi-Fi has always been faster than at home. Now that I’m home all the time, it’s a relief to get something a bit faster.\n</p><h3>What does training mean in your job?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>It typically entails delivery of training and teaching students. In our case it's usually to the Department of Defense, government, and federal employees.\n</p><h3>How did you get into the training space? Specifically, how did you get into the federal security work that you do?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>I come from a family of consultants and trainers. My mom was a cosmetology instructor. My dad worked with Raytheon for 30 years. He was a defense contracting and field engineer instructor. My brother worked for Apple education for 10 years. We were all somewhere between consulting and training. I was a Microsoft trainer until 2004. Around that time I started having students in my class from government and federal roles. I remember a few of them at the time saying, “You know, you would be interested in our work.” One person in particular slid me a business card and said we should speak offline. He happened to be with a company called TAMSCO which did technical account management and security consulting. They were bought by a group, DRS, and in 2006 I went on my first overseas assignment with them.\n</p><h3>What initially got you interested in the security field?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>When I was at Microsoft I was given a book called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg?baymax=web&elektra=culture-fed-team-spotlight-christopher-brown-on-training-the-next-line-of-defense\"><i>The Cuckoo’s Egg</i> by Clifford Stoll</a> and I was hooked. Stoll was doing a systems administration job on a time-sharing system that happened to have some minor accounting inaccuracies. He wanted to get to the bottom of it. So he began investigating and it turned out to be international hackers. The book details how he unraveled the whole case. I found it interesting. I think a lot of people get started this way — they’re not in security but they find the mystery interesting and just want to keep digging deeper and deeper.\n</p><h3>What drew you to Elastic?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>There were a few things. I kind of knew the team that I was going into because we've been running in very similar circles. My current team has a lot of people from <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/welcome-perched-security-training-for-siem-threat-hunting-and-more?baymax=web&elektra=culture-fed-team-spotlight-christopher-brown-on-training-the-next-line-of-defense\">Perched, which joined forces with Elastic last year</a>. They are a lot of former Army, Air Force, and Navy professionals, people who develop training — so I’d encountered them in previous roles. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/endgame-joins-forces-with-elastic?baymax=web&elektra=culture-fed-team-spotlight-christopher-brown-on-training-the-next-line-of-defensew\">Endgame</a> came in later and now both teams have merged and are responsible for delivering federal services education. It’s been a really good fit for me.\n</p><h3>What excites you about the role right now?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>Digging into students’ minds and figuring out how they really learn, because every student is different. To move out of the theoretical and academic world of teaching principles to really help someone to understand the topic.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt2f43f998c622edb0/5f32b0269751e50576cbbdcb/image1.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt2f43f998c622edb0\" alt=\"Christopher Brown in the classroom\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><p>A lot of the courses that we have for network security are capture the flag related. So we don't ask questions that involve a straight answer, or looking one up. Instead, students really have to search for the right answer. It pushes students to get out of their comfort zone. It gets them out of routine work where they sit in a lab and write down all the info and that’s it. I don’t think that’s an effective way to learn. Finding these teaching solutions really excites me.\n</p><h3>How many students do you usually have in the classroom?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>It’s usually a bigger class load, between 20 and 30. Really an ideal class is around 12 students but that’s not often possible.\n</p><h3>What’s been one of the biggest challenges of modifying your work during COVID-19?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>Not travelling, because I’m so used to it being part of the job. I’m 48 and I’m working on passport number three. I’ve never been grounded like this before, and I hope to travel again someday.\n</p><h3>How have you adapted your classroom for a virtual setting?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>We’d run a few classes in the past virtually using Strigo and Slack to interact with students live. But there’s one big adaptation. You need to really listen when working virtually. There are a lot of instructors that feel they need to talk all the time. This is fine in a live setting where you can read whether a student is losing interest and adapt. But in a virtual setting it isn’t always possible to read your students. I mean, you can ask them questions and get some feedback in chat and that kind of thing, but you don’t normally see them since many keep their video off.\n</p><p>When I see you on video, and you smile and nod, I can see that you’re paying attention. I’m getting that feedback. But without video on that’s impossible. So asking questions and listening is very important.\n</p><h3>Do you have any other tips or tricks for teaching virtually?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>It’s important not to stretch out lectures on theory as long as you would in a live classroom. Keep it to 10- to 15-minute chunks and get them into the lab. You have to keep students active to hold their interest.\n</p><h3>What does success look like for your team?</h3><p><strong>Christopher: </strong>I think success for our team is really just putting together a program or a structure where students can come in and learn what it takes to keep their organization secure. And, you know, maybe six months down the road we can check in with them and see how they're doing. If they're happy, and they can say, hey, you know, we learned something and caught a big threat — that’s real success.\n</p><p><em>Interested in joining Elastic? We’re hiring.

As a consequence, there may be instances where behavior unique to these protocols/packages differs with the behavior described below (i.e., Kerberos constrained delegation). Additionally, this blog owes a huge debt of gratitude to <i>Programming Windows Security</i> by Keith Brown which is a fantastic resource for learning more about fundamental Windows security concepts.\n</p> <strong><h2>Logon sessions and access tokens</h2></strong><p>The key concept to grasp in order to understand authentication in Windows environments is the relationship between <strong>logon sessions</strong> and <strong>access tokens</strong>. A logon session is used to represent the <em>presence</em> of a user on a machine and begins when a user is successfully authenticated and ends when the user logs off.\n</p><p>For example, when a user physically logs on to a Windows workstation (i.e., interactively), they supply a username and password, which is then checked by the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication\">Local Security Authority</a> (LSA). If the account is a local account (i.e., only valid on that specific computer) the LSA will check the credentials against its own security database. In the case of a Windows Active Directory domain environment, the authentication attempt is referred to the closest domain controller (DC) which will process the request and authenticate the user.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc5d931ae03cda6fb/5f3c5f2b6bbc05271064339a/1-windows-logon-session-access-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltc5d931ae03cda6fb\" alt=\"1-windows-logon-session-access-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 1 - Windows logon process for an interactive user</figcaption><p>Once the user has been successfully authenticated, the LSA will create a new <strong>logon session</strong> and produce an <strong>access token</strong>, as shown above.<sup>1</sup>&#160;A logon session can have multiple access tokens associated with it, but an access token can only ever be linked to one logon session (which is typically the successful logon attempt that generated it).<sup>2</sup>&#160;Windows has legitimate functionality which can be used to change the logon session (and hence cached credentials) that your current token is associated with. This will be covered in more detail in part 2.</p><p><span></span>Every new logon session is identifiable via a 64 bit locally unique identifier (LUID), referred to as the logon ID, and every access token must contain an Authentication Id (or AuthId) parameter that identifies the origin/linked logon session via this LUID. This is highlighted in the diagram below:</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt5e0d9d711f5c3946/5f3c5f38752d292b6ca4e530/2-authid-parameter-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt5e0d9d711f5c3946\" alt=\"2-authid-parameter-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 2 - Every access token is linked to a sole logon session, which is identifiable via the AuthID parameter. The AuthID field contains a 64 bit LUID, or logon ID, which identifies the <strong>origin</strong> logon session.\n</figcaption><p><br>\n</p><p>The main function of an access token is to act as a “volatile repository for security settings associated with the logon session” which can be adjusted and modified on the fly.<sup>2</sup>&#160;In this sense, access tokens act as a <strong>proxy</strong> or <strong>stand-in</strong> for the logon session and so when making security decisions, Windows developers never interact with the logon session itself (which is “hidden” away in lsass), but with an access token which <strong>represents</strong> it (and hence predominantly via the Windows access token API).&#160;\n</p><p>Therefore, a developer can copy existing tokens (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-duplicatetokenex?redirectedfrom=MSDN\">DuplicateTokenEx</a>), modify the security settings for a given token (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-gettokeninformation\">Get</a>/<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-settokeninformation\">SetTokenInformation</a>) etc.&#160;to their heart's content, but these tokens are still just abstractions representing the security settings from the<em> originating</em> logon session.\n</p><p>Most importantly, the access token represents the <strong>security context</strong> of the user. The security context can be defined as the privileges and permissions that a user has on a specific workstation (and across the network). An access token caches a number of <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens\">attributes</a> which determine its security context, such as:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>The security identifier (SID) for the user</li>\n\t<li>Group memberships</li>\n\t<li>Privileges held</li>\n\t<li>A logon ID which <em>references</em> the<strong> origin</strong> logon session</li>\n</ul><p>For example, the screenshot below shows the cached security attributes for an access token using James Forshaw’s <a href=\"https://github.com/googleprojectzero/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools\">TokenViewer</a>:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltcbe78d08b45c817d/5f3c5f43327a6201d7ebc9cf/3-cached-security-attributes-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltcbe78d08b45c817d\" alt=\"3-cached-security-attributes-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 3 -&#160;TokenViewer revealing the cached security attributes stored in an access token</figcaption><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-77ec5f66-7fff-f8af-45f9-e0532a87e770\">As discussed previously, the Authentication ID parameter, which is the key link between an access token and the logon session that it represents, contains a 64 bit LUID (logon ID) which identifies the origin logon session that this access token is associated with. Note also&#160;that it is possible to infer a number of other conclusions about the state of this token, e.g., it is a primary token, it is not elevated (medium integrity),&#160;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8c74de17-7fff-f1c9-dba1-c7f851ccaaee\">and the user is an administrator (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ne-winnt-token_elevation_type\">Elevation Type</a> = limited means the token is a ‘filtered’ admin token and hence UAC is enabled)</span>.</span><br>\n</p><p>Whenever a thread <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/interaction-between-threads-and-securable-objects\">attempts to access a securable object</a> managed by the Windows kernel, such as a process, thread, handle, semaphore, token, etc., Windows will perform an <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-accesscheck\">access check</a>. To perform this check, Windows needs three pieces of information<sup>2</sup>:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Who</strong> is requesting access?</li>\n\t<li><strong>What</strong> are their intentions with the object?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Who</strong> can access the object?</li>\n</ul><p>Hence, Windows will first check the token associated with the calling thread and look at the authorization attributes cached in it (e.g., user sid, group memberships, privileges etc.). Secondly, Windows will look at the desired <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthz/access-rights-and-access-masks\">access</a> requested by the thread. In the Windows security model you <strong>must</strong> state your intentions upfront; for performance reasons an access check only occurs <em>once</em> and no further checks are performed on any additional handle operations (unless a user attempts to perform an action that the handle did not have rights to, e.g., write to a read-only handle).&#160;Thirdly, Windows will retrieve the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptors\">security descriptor</a> for the target object. The security descriptor contains a discretionary access control list (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists\">DACL</a>) which specifies what users/groups have access to the object and the <em>type </em>of access granted.&#160;\n</p><p>Based on these three sources of information, Windows can give a boolean answer to whether a principal has access to a given object. This is why every process <strong>must</strong> have a primary token; it is the user that is “charged” for any objects that process attempts to access.<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p>As a note, some <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants\">privileges</a> can be thought of as simply enabling a user to bypass/skip the access check in the kernel for a given object. For example, if a token has the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess\">SeDebugPrivilege</a> privilege enabled, the Windows kernel will skip the DACL checks for any process and thread objects (hence why it is so powerful).<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p>Following successful authentication from an interactive logon, Windows will execute the user’s shell (normally explorer.exe) on behalf of the newly logged-on user. The operating system performs this action by using the newly minted access token to spawn explorer.exe as that user via <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessasusera\">CreateProcessAsUserA</a>. This function takes a handle to a token and spawns a new process as the user specified in the token (i.e., in a <em>different</em> security context).\n</p><p>Typically, every process created by the user is a child of the shell process (i.e., explorer.exe)<sup>4</sup>&#160;and every new process will (by default) run in the <strong>same</strong> security context as its parent; hence the child process will inherit its parent’s access token upon creation.<sup>5</sup>&#160;Therefore, <em>all</em> processes will inherit their <em>own</em> local copy of an access token.\n</p><p>As stated previously, access tokens act as a local “volatile repository” for the security settings associated with the logon session. As each process has its <em>own</em> local copy of an access token, a process can modify the volatile security settings stored in its copy without affecting other processes.<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p>For example, a browser such as Chrome may want to create a <em>restricted</em> version of its access token in order to effectively <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md\">sandbox</a> the application in the event an attacker is able to exploit the browser and obtain arbitrary code execution on the compromised machine. As a consequence of the sandbox, any actions performed by the attacker will be restricted and help prevent further damage. As previously discussed, <em>all</em> access checks in Windows make decisions based on the attributes stored in the calling thread’s token, and so by ‘hardening’ the token a developer can restrict its access.\n</p><p>The key point is that Chrome can modify its local copy of the token <em>without</em> affecting other applications. This can be achieved via APIs such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokengroups\">AdjustTokenGroups</a>/<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokenprivileges\">AdjustTokenPrivileges</a>, which can be used to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/enabling-and-disabling-privileges-in-c--\">disable</a> dangerous groups and privileges, respectively. Alternatively, a new restricted copy of a specified access token can be created with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-createrestrictedtoken\">CreateRestrictedToken</a>.&#160;As an example, the relevant functionality in the chromium source code can be <a href=\"https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/4e88a3c4fa53bf4d3622d07fd13f3812d835e40f/sandbox/win/src/restricted_token.cc#L65\">found here</a>.\n</p><p>This is so important because, as discussed above, access tokens are the <strong>core</strong> component of the Windows security model and so by being able to change the information cached in them, a developer can limit <strong>what</strong> securable objects a token can touch and hence restrict its access across a system.\n</p><p>The diagram below summarizes the logon process and an example&#160;access check for an interactive user, <strong>ASTRO\\cosmo</strong>:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt7b021068d99d5ea2/5f3c5f8760261e2e581f214f/4-logon-process-access-control-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt7b021068d99d5ea2\" alt=\"4-logon-process-access-control-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 4 -&#160;An overview of the Windows logon process and access checks for an interactive logon</figcaption><p> <strong></strong>\n</p><h2><strong>Network authentication</strong></h2><p>Having covered local authentication and access control, what happens under the hood when a user needs to access some resource located across the network? For example, a user could attempt to view the available shares on another host by running the following command:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blteb93047fd50346e0/5f3c5f93327a6201d7ebc9d3/5-attempt-available-shares-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blteb93047fd50346e0\" alt=\"5-attempt-available-shares-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 5 -&#160;Attempt to view available shares on the remote domain controller, \\\\MISTAKENOT-DC-1</figcaption><p>The user’s logon session is <strong>unique</strong> to their workstation (as is their access token and privileges) and they cannot simply send their access token over the wire. The token would be meaningless as it <em>does not</em> correspond to a valid logon session on the remote host. Furthermore, this authentication mechanism would be an obvious target for replay attacks.<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p> In this case, the user needs to <strong>re-authenticate</strong> and establish a <strong>new</strong> logon session on the remote machine (assuming the user has access). For an interactive logon (and actually all other logon types like service, batch, etc.,&#160;<em>except</em> network<sup>6</sup>) Windows will <strong><em>automatically</em></strong> cache the credentials as part of the Windows single sign-on (SSO) mechanism.<sup>7</sup>&#160;This is the intended design of the Windows SSO mechanism and prevents the user from having to constantly re-enter their password when accessing network resources.\n</p><p>As a consequence, access tokens which link back to these types of logon sessions <em>can</em> authenticate to remote hosts and Windows will <strong>automatically</strong> authenticate on the users behalf whenever a network resource is accessed by a thread or process.<sup>8</sup>&#160;Note that Windows will <strong>always</strong> use the credentials cached in the logon session that the access token is linked to when authenticating remotely&#160;(e.g., Windows will find the token’s linked logon session, via the AuthId, and use the credentials cached for that logon session, as shown below).\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt985c90d304c8a2e9/5f3d9001004c131277a52a66/access-token-linked-session-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt985c90d304c8a2e9\" alt=\"access-token-linked-session-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" \"=\"\">\n</p><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-da53e0ed-7fff-736c-9c82-4809789dbc4b\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\n\t</span></span>\n</p><figcaption>Figure 6 - Relationship between an access token, its linked logon session, and the credentials cached for that logon session</figcaption><p>Therefore, in order to establish a new logon session, the SMB server will need to authenticate the client over the network. In Windows domains, network authentication is typically performed via <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview\">Kerberos</a> or the legacy challenge-response protocol <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm\">NTLM</a>. Irrespective of the network authentication protocol used, on receiving an authentication request the target host will forward the credential information to the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/key-distribution-center\">DC</a> and, following successful authentication, establish a new <em>network</em> login session for the user (i.e.,&#160;<strong>this login</strong> “<strong>represents a remote client”</strong>).<sup>2</sup>&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>Network logins <strong>do not</strong> cache credentials and therefore you cannot use this token to authenticate to another remote host.<sup>9</sup>&#160;This is commonly referred to as the ‘double hop’ problem. Note that due to the inherent <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm\">design</a> of the NTLM challenge response protocol (e.g., the client encrypts a challenge with the user’s NTLM hash) it fundamentally does not support credential delegation.\n</p><p>Most importantly from the server’s perspective, following the successful authentication of the remote user, it is presented with a newly minted<em> </em><strong>access token</strong> which represents the network logon of the remote client. The diagram below illustrates this process:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc34cb1078b03baab/5f3c5fa0752d292b6ca4e534/6-network-logon-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltc34cb1078b03baab\" alt=\"6-network-logon-blog-windows-tokens-for-defenders.png\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 7 - The network authentication process when a user attempts to access a remote resource, such as an SMB file share\n</figcaption><p>This neatly leads to the second key concept for Windows access tokens: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/impersonation\"><strong>impersonation</strong></a>. As previously mentioned, access tokens encode a wealth of information about the security context of the user and enable a handy way for developers to make “localized” changes to this context <em>without</em> affecting other processes.<sup>2</sup>&#160;However, in <strong>multi-threaded</strong> applications, problems and difficult-to-debug race conditions may arise if different threads start enabling/disabling different privileges or modifying default token DACLs.<sup>2 10</sup></p><p>As a result, Windows has a feature called impersonation. By default <em>all</em> threads will inherit the same security context as their process’s primary token. However, impersonation allows a thread to switch to a <em>different</em> security context.&#160;Specifically, it enables threads to have their own local copy of a token; known as an impersonation token.&#160;This is the best way to remember the distinction between primary and impersonation tokens, in that impersonation tokens are always applied to threads, whereas primary tokens are associated with processes. In this way, the SMB server can handle each incoming client request in a separate thread and impersonate the access token representing the remote client.</p><p>Also note that switching security context has two implications. The first is that&#160;<strong>locally</strong> the thread is now impersonating a different access token, and hence any <strong>local</strong> access checks will be performed using this new token. Secondly, as this impersonated token may be linked to a <strong>different </strong>logon session (and therefore potentially have <em>different</em> cached credentials (if a non-network login)) the thread’s security context <strong>remotely</strong> is also <em>different</em>. Furthermore, as we shall see in the next blog post in this series, do not always assume that the cached credentials stored in lsass <strong>match</strong> the user specified in the token.\n</p><p>In summary, from the perspective of a listening server process (say an SMB file server), the following steps must occur following a connection request from a remote client:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>The user is authenticated and a new logon session is created (<strong>NETWORK_ONLY</strong>)</li>\n\t<li>The server process is presented with a handle to an impersonation token which links back to the remote client’s new<strong> network logon session</strong></li>\n\t<li>The server can use this token to impersonate the client to perform work on their behalf</li>\n</ul><p>This approach has the added benefit of making use of the existing Windows’ access control model, as all actions performed while impersonating are under the security context of the user’s identity (hence any local access check decisions will use the information cached in the impersonated user’s token). Therefore, if that user does not already have access to a specific file on a share, they will be denied access.\n</p><p>For most of Windows’ key IPC mechanisms (e.g., named pipes, RPC, COM) this process is handled automatically. The server needs only to call the appropriate API in order to obtain a handle to the remote clients’ security context (i.e., access token) and start impersonating the client via functions such as<sup>2</sup>:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-impersonateloggedonuser\">ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</a></li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coimpersonateclient\">CoImpersonateClient</a></li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-rpcimpersonateclient\">RpcImpersonateClient</a></li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-impersonatenamedpipeclient\">ImpersonateNamedPipeClient</a></li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/ddeml/nf-ddeml-ddeimpersonateclient\">DdeImpersonateClient</a></li>\n</ul> <strong><h2>Conclusion</h2></strong><p>Hopefully this has been an informative overview of some key concepts in Windows Security.

href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security\"></a>We are pleased to announce version 7.9 of the Elastic Observability solution, adding&nbsp;several exciting new capabilities that focus on reducing time to value for observability teams. Our latest version adds a single, unified agent for collecting all kinds of telemetry data that dramatically simplifies data onboarding down to just a few clicks; a new observability overview page that surfaces key insights across all your telemetry data and provides a curated at-a-glance view of the health of your technology stack; and 50+ turnkey security detections that help security teams get instant value from observability data.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Experience the latest version of Elastic Observability on our <a href=\"http://cloud.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud</a> (a free <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service\">14-day trial</a> is available) or <a href=\"https://elastic.co/downloads\">install the latest version</a> of the Elastic Stack for a self-managed experience.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>And now, without further ado, here are the release highlights.&nbsp; </p>\n<h2>Onboarding data gets radically simpler with a single, unified agent</h2>\n<p>Data ingest is a critical — and often time-consuming — piece of observability and security workflows. How easy is it to instrument the system you want to monitor? Is the collected data parsed and structured to be usable? How quickly can you visualize and get key insights from this data? Now multiply this by the thousands of components — hosts, containers, applications, middleware, and more —&nbsp; in your environment, and the operational aspects such as deployment, configuration, and upgrades become just as critical. </p>\n<p>Our vision is to simplify the ingest process down to one agent, one-click so that observability engineers can spend more time acting on insights, and less time managing their ingest to get to the insight. We are excited to announce that we are taking our first step (a really BIG step) towards achieving this vision with the launch of a single unified agent, along with several new ingest capabilities in version 7.9.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt6e8978d7677327f3/5f355f23c9ec57071816f580/ingest-manager.gif\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt6e8978d7677327f3\" alt=\"ingest-manager.gif\"> </img></p>\n<p>These new capabilities are in beta in 7.9, and we invite our users to try these features out and <a href=\"https://discuss.elastic.co/c/observability/82\">provide us with feedback</a>.&nbsp;<br> </br></p>\n<ul> \n <li>Elastic Agent, one agent to collect it all:&nbsp;Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to collect all kinds of telemetry data from a host. Elastic Agent (beta) supports logs, metrics, and endpoint security data collection in 7.9, with plans to expand to include APM and other data types in the future. Having a single agent to install, configure, update, upgrade, and maintain is a huge efficiency boost for operators. And, with a single configuration file, adding or removing sources is just a click away.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul>\n<ul> \n <li>Integrations for popular services and platforms: 7.9 has support for ~40 integrations, with plans to port all 100+ Beats modules over in the next few releases. Integrations ship with prepackaged content like dashboards and a data transformation pipeline that let you go from data to insight in literally minutes.</li> \n</ul>\n<ul> \n <li>Centrally manage all your agents with Fleet — the control tower for all deployed agents:&nbsp;A typical enterprise will usually have agents deployed on tens of thousands of hosts. Our goal with Fleet is to make it easy for operators to manage this spread from a single place. When you make a change to a configuration, all the agents using that configuration will get the new configuration, often within seconds, simplifying the operational aspects even further. Goodbye SSH and automation playbooks.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul>\n<ul> \n <li>Ingest Manager, one UI to control i(nges)t all:&nbsp;Ingest Manager (beta) is a brand new Kibana app to control all aspects of your ingest universe from a central place. Create, edit, and update your agent configuration using the convenient Configuration Editor. So long, YAML files.</li> \n</ul>\n<ul> \n <li>Ingest Node Pipelines UI, a more visual and intuitive way to parse logs: The benefits of schema on write — parsing and extracting fields from unstructured logs before indexing them — <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/schema-on-write-vs-schema-on-read\">is well established</a>. Even as we have added more out-of-the-box integrations that automatically extract structured fields for common sources, we recognize that users will always need the flexibility to parse and transform custom log formats. In 7.9, we are making this process much simpler and approachable through the general availability of the Ingest Node Pipeline UI in Kibana.

A single datastore for all your observability data is essential for cross-source investigative workflows and helps lower mean time to resolution.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt789a1b5bb67c4a28/5f355f9c48d3b57cb974a5d8/observability-overview.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt789a1b5bb67c4a28\" alt=\"observability-overview.png\"> </img></p>\n<p>Building on this unified data foundation, we are excited to extend that unification to the visualization layer with the launch of a new observability overview page in Kibana. The landing page presents a curated at-a-glance view of the health of your entire ecosystem by bubbling up key insights from all data streams (logs, metrics, traces, etc.) across all sources (apps, infrastructure, etc.).&nbsp; While you could always create this type of view using the flexible dashboarding features in Kibana, this out-of-the-box page gets you there faster — especially for new users or new setups. The overview page also embeds helpful widgets like newsfeed and&nbsp;training to enhance your in-product experience.&nbsp;<br> </br></p>\n<h2>Embracing open standards with the OpenTelemetry integration in Elastic APM&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>From open code to open community, Elastic is built on transparency. That mindset extends to our support for open standards in the observability space such as OpenTracing, Jaeger, and W3C Trace-Context. We are happy to add the recently formed OpenTelemetry standard to that list. Our goal is to enable users that have instrumented their system using these methods to migrate their apps to Elastic with minimal effort.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>OpenTelemetry is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project (currently in beta) that provides vendor-neutral, language-specific agents, SDKs, and APIs to collect all observability data (such distributed traces, metrics, and logs) from all your monitored elements. We have added the Elastic Exporter (and contributed it to the <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/registry/collector-exporter-elastic/\">OpenTelemetry collector contrib repo</a>) that takes the trace data collected using OpenTelemetry Collector, translates it to Elastic compatible protocol, and sends it to Elastic APM. This means that you can start exploring your OpenTelemetry data in Elastic APM with zero changes to your instrumentation. Just configure the Elastic Exporter into your OpenTelemetry setup and start exploring your trace data in Elastic APM, alongside other logs, metrics, and traces, in minutes.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>OpenTelemetry is a fast evolving project, and will expand to include metrics and logs. As a member of the OpenTelemetry project, we are following the roadmap closely and will enhance our support to match their progress.

Each new technology expands the threat envelope, and adds one more element that security teams need to monitor. The good news is that much of the logs and metrics data your operations teams are collecting for health and performance monitoring also includes rich information that your security teams can use to detect malicious behaviors. In 7.9, we are making it possible for security teams to mine those threat signals from observability data in minutes, with zero effort, by launching 50+ turnkey security detections.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>The turnkey detections introduced in this release focus on five major detection areas — asset visibility, data protection, identity and access monitoring, log audit, and network monitoring — across two popular platforms, AWS and Okta. For example, this includes a group of unsupervised machine learning jobs to detect uncommon AWS API calls based on user, location, or errors generated. Such a rule could have detected and prevented a recent attack on large financial institutions that used AWS API calls to compromise data.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Another example is identity and access monitoring detections on Okta logs to identify attackers who are trying to tamper with MFA configurations, API tokens, or other critical account parameters. And of course, with the flexible detection engine you are welcome to create additional rules to fit your environment. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt775c5eff6f952826/5f3563c6168ec908bebea5d3/detection-rules-alt.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt775c5eff6f952826\" alt=\"detection-rules-alt.png\"> </img></p>\n<p>Read more about these security integrations <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-9-0-free-endpoint-security\">in this post</a>. </p>\n<h2>Additional highlights</h2>\n<p>Anomaly detection alerting and monitor availability in Uptime:&nbsp;In Elastic Uptime 7.9, users will now be able to see the availability percentage of their monitors (both overall and per-testing node), enabling them to quickly report service-level objectives. Users will also be able to configure alerting to get notified if their availability falls below a specific value. Elastic Uptime 7.9 adds machine learning features that automatically detect if a monitor is experiencing anomalous response durations from one or more testing nodes.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Azure Monitoring enhancement: Our cloud observability story has rapidly advanced in the last few releases with the launch of several new integrations into the Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS ecosystems. In this release, we are continuing to expand and simplify the Azure monitoring use case with the launch of two new integrations: <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.9/metricbeat-metricset-azure-billing.html\">Azure Billing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.9/metricbeat-metricset-azure-app_insights.html\">Azure Application Insights</a>.&nbsp; </p>\n<h2>Try it out today</h2>\n<p>To start taking advantage of these new features and capabilities, upgrade your Elasticsearch Service deployment to 7.9, or grab a <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service\">free 14-day trial</a> of our Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud or install the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/start\">latest version</a> of the Elastic Stack. </p>\n<h2>Related blogs</h2>\n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security\">What's new in the Elastic Stack 7.9 release</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-elastic-agent-and-ingest-manager\">Introducing Elastic Agent and Ingest Manager</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-9-0-free-endpoint-security\">Elastic Security 7.9 released</a></li> \n</ul>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 16:05:00 +0000","feedId":7403,"bgimg":"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt6e8978d7677327f3/5f355f23c9ec57071816f580/ingest-manager.gif","linkMd5":"71fe4533ddcde0b31e47fbdc7ec2018c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn42@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-30-43-606_0f4e697f567d1ff9.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":2740817,"destBytes":2312306,"author":"Asawari Samant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt6e8978d7677327f3/5f355f23c9ec57071816f580/ingest-manager.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn42@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-30-43-606_0f4e697f567d1ff9.webp","https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbcb4112aba75cda5/5f355f82ddf9d73329639c25/ingest-pipeline.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-30-47-134_dfc0a46c027b0797.webp","https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt789a1b5bb67c4a28/5f355f9c48d3b57cb974a5d8/observability-overview.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-30-46-188_35276b56a28b2905.webp","https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt775c5eff6f952826/5f3563c6168ec908bebea5d3/detection-rules-alt.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-30-47-921_d1a61a2066c0064b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311822916},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:30:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:30:22","title":"Security operations: Cloud monitoring and detection with Elastic Security","link":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/cloud-monitoring-and-detection-with-elastic-security","description":"<p><strong></strong>\n</p><p>As many organizations have migrated their infrastructure, applications, and data to cloud offerings, adversaries have extended their operational capabilities in cloud environments to achieve their mission — whether that means stealing intellectual property, disrupting business operations, or holding an organization’s data for ransom. In order to protect our users’ data from attack, the Elastic Security&#160;Intelligence & Analytics Team researches and develops <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-security-opens-public-detection-rules-repo\">rules</a> to detect attacker behavior in the cloud <em>and</em> on the endpoint.\n</p><p>In this post, we’ll discuss cloud monitoring and detection-related challenges security operations teams face, and why attacks against cloud environments are often successful. We will share details on our free cloud detection rules (including many new ones released in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-9-0-free-endpoint-security\">Elastic Security 7.9</a>) and show how they can help <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">Elastic Security</a> users.\n</p><p>We’ll also explain how Elastic can ingest logs from a wide variety of cloud platforms and how the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) makes searching, monitoring, and detection easy for defenders.\n</p> <strong><h2><strong>Cloud monitoring and detection challenges</strong></h2></strong><p>Security teams typically encounter one or more of the following challenges when they’re asked to monitor, detect, and respond to threats in their organization's cloud environments:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Resource constraints:</strong>&#160;It can take a considerable amount of time to learn and understand cloud technologies and their ever-changing data sources. Many security operations teams do not have the resources to allocate to this ongoing effort.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Understanding of adversary tradecraft:</strong>&#160;Attacker behavior on well-known platforms such as Windows has been researched extensively and shared with the security community. Security teams may not have an in-depth understanding of how adversaries operate in cloud environments or the ability to provision a test environment to practice offensive and defensive techniques to protect their organization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Blind spots:</strong>&#160;For effective monitoring and detection, the data available to security practitioners must be relevant, accurate, and timely. Cloud logs shipped to a SIEM can be used for detection and response as long as the security team can depend on the quality of the data.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Data normalization:</strong>&#160;Most cloud platforms have their own log categories and event schema. Normalizing logs into a common schema is not a trivial or one-off task. Some security teams, for example, have several different field names for a hostname across their data sources indexed in their SIEM. Without a normalized and documented schema, it can be difficult for analysts — especially less experienced ones — to write search queries and correlate events across data sources effectively.</li>\n</ul> <strong><h2><strong>Ingesting and searching cloud logs with Elastic</strong></h2></strong><p>Elastic has a large collection of Filebeat <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-modules.html\">modules</a> that can be used to simplify the collection, parsing, and visualization of many diverse log formats into a common schema — including cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-aws.html\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-azure.html\">Azure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-okta.html\">Okta</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-o365.html\">Office 365</a>. Rapid development of new Filebeat modules is an ongoing process.\n</p><p>The&#160;<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html\">Elastic Common Schema</a> (ECS) defines a common set of fields for ingesting logs from a connected data source (e.g., AWS/Okta) into Elasticsearch. Log data is normalized into a format where the various field names can be used in queries to correlate behavior across data sources. This is useful to security and IT operations teams for a number of reasons.\n</p><p>Practitioners and administrators do not need to spend countless hours transforming or normalizing their ingested logs so that the field names follow their own common schema. Managing a schema like this yourself is no small undertaking and is a continuous effort. Elastic manages ECS (saving users time and resources) so that security teams can rely on a common set of field names to search their data quickly and efficiently.\n</p><p>End users can rely on using the same field names in their queries when searching across multiple data sources, which presents the following advantages:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Having a consistent schema for searching saves security analysts time and lowers the barrier to entry for new analysts. Analysts don’t have to learn or remember all of the different field names and their purpose for each data source.</li>\n\t<li>Analysts can correlate events across data sources such as endpoint, proxy, and firewall, which helps them ask questions of their data more efficiently and make sound decisions during an investigation, incident, or hunt.</li>\n\t<li>It’s easy for analysts to produce a timeline or build a visualization of the activity that occurred.</li>\n</ul> <strong><h2><strong>Detecting attackers operating in cloud environments</strong></h2></strong><p>The Elastic Security Intelligence & Analytics Team’s research into adversary tradecraft leads to new detection features like rules and machine learning jobs — capabilities that enable small security teams to have an outsized impact. Security features like these increase the cost of an attack for adversaries. Elastic Security users can expect to see a continued focus on increasing the cost of cloud attacks.\n</p><p>In the remainder of this blog post, we’ll simulate attack techniques against AWS and Okta cloud environments. We’ll review the alerts that are generated by the suspicious activity and how an analyst can perform initial triage and complete their investigation using Elastic Security. We will also demonstrate how analysts can add exceptions to detection rules in order to filter benign events and continue to alert on suspicious behavior.\n</p> <strong><h2><strong>Monitoring AWS CloudTrail logs to detect suspicious behavior</strong></h2></strong><p>As organizations migrate to or provision new infrastructure in cloud platforms like AWS, they face the common challenges that we described earlier. Fortunately, Elastic Security has a <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/aws\">strong variety of AWS rules</a>, available for <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-9-0-free-endpoint-security\">free in 7.9</a> to detect suspicious behaviors in an AWS environment.\n</p><p>The Filebeat <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/filebeat-module-aws.html\">module</a> for AWS helps you easily ship CloudTrail, Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and virtual private cloud (VPC) flow logs to Elasticsearch for monitoring and detection in Elastic Security. Let’s walk through an attack and defense scenario utilizing CloudTrail data. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\">CloudTrail</a> provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS software development kits (SDKs), command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history can help simplify security detection, analysis, and investigations.\n</p><p>Many attacks against AWS start with an attacker obtaining an access key and/or the secret access key details. These keys may be harvested in a variety of ways, including through phishing, a data breach, GitHub repositories, screenshots, error messages, snapshot data, or simply poor key management practices. By obtaining these keys, an attacker can take a variety of actions against your AWS infrastructure.\n</p><p>Let’s walk through one of the many potential attack scenarios that could play out. In the following example, the adversary enumerates the trails and monitoring capabilities that have been configured for the AWS account. They follow up on this activity by disabling a trail and a configuration recorder in an attempt to evade detections and then proceed to harvest secrets.\n</p> <strong><h3><strong><em>Simulating adversary behavior in AWS</em></strong></h3></strong><p>In this demonstration, we’ll use <a href=\"https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu\">Pacu</a> to perform our attack. Pacu is a popular framework for exploiting AWS infrastructure, developed and maintained by Rhino Security Labs. Pacu is modular, similar to other exploitation frameworks like Metasploit and Koadic, and enables attackers to exploit configuration flaws within an AWS account. Attackers can use Pacu to check if the required permissions are assigned to the compromised account before attempting to execute a module. This can be helpful from an attacker's perspective to not create unnecessary noise and logs, and draw additional attention from defenders by running modules that will ultimately fail.\n</p><p>The attacker begins by enumerating services using the <code>detection__enum_services</code> module to determine what logging and monitoring services are enabled for the AWS account.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt5cf78b83c1322fab/5f3c385c4f4b6324ce744fcd/1-enumerating-services-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt5cf78b83c1322fab\" alt=\"1-enumerating-services-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 1 - Enumerating services using Pacu’s detection__enum_services module\n</figcaption><p>The attacker discovered eight trails, as well as ten configuration rules, a recorder, and a delivery channel. Essentially, the enumeration script is querying certain AWS API calls to list or describe relevant information about the environment. By reviewing the <a href=\"https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu/blob/master/modules/detection__enum_services/main.py\">code</a> of the module, we can see the targeted APIs:\n</p><pre>DescribeSubscription\nGetSubscriptionState\nDescribeTrails\nListDetectors\nDescribeConfigRules\nDescribeConfigurationRecorders\nDescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus\nDescribeDeliveryChannels\nDescribeDeliveryChannelStatus\nDescribeConfigurationAggregators\nDescribeAlarms\nDescribeFlowLogs\n</pre><p>After the attacker determines which services are running, their next logical step may be to interrupt logging and monitoring by disabling a trail, alarm, detector, or recorder in an attempt to evade detection. To accomplish this objective, we’ll use a different module called <code>detection__disruption</code> to disable a trail called <code>brentlog</code>, and stop the configuration recorder named <code>default</code>.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4722e6ec69a693e7/5f3c386c6e9660261c55b7df/2-disabling-trail-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt4722e6ec69a693e7\" alt=\"2-disabling-trail-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 2 - Disabling a trail and stopping a configuration recorder using Pacu’s detection__disruption module\n</figcaption><p>At this point, with trail logging suspended and the configuration recorder turned off from tracking changes to resources, the attacker may want to check if there are any credentials, API keys, or tokens available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/introducing-aws-secrets-manager/#:~:text=AWS%20Secrets%20Manager%20is%20a,other%20secrets%20throughout%20their%20lifecycle.\">Secrets Manager</a> and if so, collect them. In this scenario, the attacker uses the <code>enum_secrets</code> module and finds one secret in the directory, <code>/sessions/brent/downloads/secrets/secrets_manager</code>. Harvesting these secrets could help the adversary achieve lateral movement and/or privilege escalation.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1d8ccf8245d26532/5f3c387a6e9660261c55b7e3/3-searching-aws-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt1d8ccf8245d26532\" alt=\"3-searching-aws-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 3 - Searching for AWS secrets using Pacu’s enum__secrets module\n</figcaption><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt702afec7fc2ff8b5/5f3c38825f7d2953ae8216da/4-viewing-aws-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt702afec7fc2ff8b5\" alt=\"4-viewing-aws-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 4 - Viewing the AWS secret after its discovery\n</figcaption><p>We’ll stop our fictitious attack scenario here, but if you’re curious to learn what the attacker could do next, the following Google search will return some examples: <code>intitle:\"AWS\" intext:(\"attack\" | \"breach\")</code>. In the next section, we’ll look at what this behavior looks like from a defender's perspective and how Elastic Security can be used to detect this behavior.\n</p> <strong><h3><strong><em>Detecting and investigating the suspicious behavior in AWS</em></strong></h3></strong><p>While monitoring the usage of the previously mentioned APIs, it can be difficult to distinguish benign activity from suspicious behavior, such as an attacker enumerating an environment. In production environments, monitoring for calls to these APIs can be noisy, as the behavior is quite common. To help find this rare and potentially suspicious behavior, and in addition to the AWS detection rules we have available, we’ve released <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/ml\">machine learning</a> jobs in 7.9 specifically for AWS CloudTrail that help identify outliers, such as patterns of unusual activity that are hard to find using conventional detection rules.\n</p><p>Looking at our detections page from the previous attack, we can see multiple alerts were triggered.

Informing end users that they only have to remember one username and password instead of ten or more reduces the risk that they’ll adopt poor password hygiene and enables system administrators to enforce stronger password policies. Further, multi-factor authentication (MFA) policies can be configured in Okta, which raises the barriers to entry for attackers. Many attackers will simply move on to look for an easier target when they discover that MFA is enforced for their target’s network or user account.\n</p><p>While SSO solutions can provide a convenient user experience and reduce cybersecurity risk for an organization, these centralized systems that offer a type of skeleton key to many systems and applications are often an attractive target for attackers. For example, if an adversary manages to harvest an Okta administrator’s credentials or API token, they could attempt to perform any of the actions in the non-exhaustive list below:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Modify or disable MFA policies for one or more applications in order to weaken their victim’s security controls.</li>\n\t<li>Create new user accounts or API tokens to maintain persistence in their target’s environment and attempt to “blend in” and evade detection.</li>\n\t<li>Modify, delete, or deactivate an Okta network zone to loosen the restrictions on which geolocation users or administrators can login from.</li>\n\t<li>Delete or disable an application or other configuration to create a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition and impact a company’s business operations.</li>\n</ul><p>To enable security teams to monitor their Okta environment for suspicious activity, our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-okta.html\">Okta Filebeat module</a> can pull <a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/\">Okta System Log</a> events and ship them to Elasticsearch to be indexed. Okta’s System Log records events related to an organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity. The Elastic Security Intelligence & Analytics Team has <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/okta\">free rules</a> to detect suspicious activity in Okta logs and will continue adding more in future.\n</p><p>In the following example, imagine that an adversary has harvested an API token after gaining initial access to an organization’s network. The API token has administrator privileges and the adversary executes some actions in their target’s Oka environment:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Create a new user account and assign administrative permissions to it in order to maintain a presence in the target environment should the security team discover that the current API token is compromised</li>\n\t<li>Deactivate a sign-on policy in order to weaken the target’s security controls</li>\n\t<li>Disable a network zone to enable attackers to authenticate from any geographical location during their intrusion</li>\n</ul><p>The Okta Filebeat module was configured to ship Okta System Log events to Elasticsearch and our Okta rules were activated in Elastic Security. The suspicious activity triggered three alerts shown in Figure 12 below.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt073d5134f84714ac/5f3c38f882d2265b5e30edc4/12-okta-alerts-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt073d5134f84714ac\" alt=\"12-okta-alerts-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 12 - Okta alerts in Elastic Security generated by suspicious activity\n</figcaption><p>Clicking on one of the alerts allows the analyst to review more information about the rule, including the description of the behavior that the rule detects, severity and risk scores, and the associated MITRE ATT&CK® tactic and technique.

Behavior that looks suspicious in one environment may be benign in another. To help security teams find the proverbial “signal in the noise,” users can add exceptions to their detection rules to filter benign events and continue to alert on suspicious events. Figure 14 shows an exception being added to an Okta rule.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt226d6fc7cd588a0d/5f3c390c4f4b6324ce744fd9/14-adding-exception-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt226d6fc7cd588a0d\" alt=\"14-adding-exception-blog-secops-cloud-platform-monitoring.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\">\n</p><figcaption>Figure 14 - Adding an exception to a rule in Elastic Security\n</figcaption><p>We’ve also introduced the “threshold” rule type.

Elastic Stack 7.9 timeframe, which is nicely summarized in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security\">7.9 release blog</a>. Onward to the cloud!\n</p><h2>Elastic Cloud security and compliance</h2><h3>Network Security: AWS PrivateLink support and IP filtering&#160;</h3><p>Network security is a critical component of Elastic Cloud’s security posture. We launched support for AWS PrivateLink, which securely connects a customer Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to private AWS services endpoints, and to your Elastic Cloud deployments. We also launched support for IP filtering across all supported public cloud providers, enabling you to specify network access to your Elastic Cloud deployment based on IP addresses, address blocks, and ranges. This ensures restricted access to trusted connections, networks, organizations, and more.&#160;IP filters are deployable in combination with AWS PrivateLink endpoints for additional security on your Amazon Web Services deployment(s). To learn more, watch this seven-minute demonstration to learn about how PrivateLink integration works.\n</p><!-- The script tag should live in the head of your page if at all possible --><!-- Put this wherever you would like your player to appear --><p><img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/78P8dTvrtmDfLxvffaNaVK.jpg\" data-uuid=\"78P8dTvrtmDfLxvffaNaVK\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" alt=\"AWS PrivateLink integration demo\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\">\n</p><figcaption>AWS PrivateLink integration demo</figcaption><h3>FedRAMP authorization</h3><p>Elastic Cloud is generally available in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) environment, and is <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-achieves-fedramp-authorization\">authorized</a> for FedRAMP Moderate impact level.&#160;FedRAMP provides standardized security requirements for cloud products, services assessments, and monitoring used in federal agencies. It standardizes security requirements across federal agencies, allowing those agencies to choose authorized cloud solutions. Today, many government agencies are required by law to buy only FedRAMP-authorized solutions for handling information in the cloud. Non-federal organizations also appreciate the certification, because it makes it easier to decide where and how a solution can meet their security needs.\n</p><p>Elastic Cloud implemented more than 325 required security controls specified by the FedRAMP certification process. Some of the controls and technologies used by Elastic Cloud include encryption algorithms, upgraded VPN, Content Delivery Network (CDN), SSH, Proxy, Vulnerability Management and Identity solutions, as well as a robust logging environment. These improvements are now part of Elastic Cloud, included to help you protect your data.&#160;\n</p><p>Of course, achieving <a href=\"https://fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/\">Moderate</a> Impact level means Elastic can also accommodate data needing a Low Impact level. Moderate is the baseline from which we will pursue higher security certifications and FedRAMP compliance on other cloud providers like Azure and Google Cloud. Federal, state, and local governments — as well as higher education institutions and organizations storing government data — can sign up for a <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/federal/cloud\">free 30-day trial</a> today.&#160;\n</p> <strong><h3>Sign up with your Google Account</h3></strong><p>We also added support for Google Accounts, so that you can sign up for Elastic Cloud using your existing Google Account credentials. By using your Google identity to access your Elastic Cloud account there is no need to maintain another set of credentials. It's just one less thing for you to manage.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbf30048d22047193/5f3604e6c9ec57071816f7eb/Elastic-Cloud-Log-in-with-Google.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltbf30048d22047193\" alt=\"Sign up with your Google Account\" \"=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><figcaption>Sign up with your Google Account</figcaption><h2><strong>Streamlined purchasing&#160;</strong></h2> <strong><h3>New self-service monthly subscriptions</h3></strong><p>You can now purchase Gold and Platinum monthly subscriptions directly within the Elastic Cloud console.

Their speed and reliability come from applying changes to the cluster (like settings, upgrades, and resizing) in place, which is followed by a rolling restart of its nodes. This avoids potentially long-running data migration operations inherent with the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-change-deployment.html\">grow-and-shrink</a> approach.&#160;\n</p><p>While there are still some changes that will always require the grow-and-shrink approach, we’re improving Elastic Cloud to use in-place configuration changes wherever possible. When you change your deployment’s configuration, Elastic Cloud will choose the right way to apply the changes, using either the grow-and-shrink approach or in-place configuration changes as appropriate.\n</p><!-- The script tag should live in the head of your page if at all possible --><!-- Put this wherever you would like your player to appear --><p><img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/PWmPzULwfWi9Wd4HXwipjv.jpg\" data-uuid=\"PWmPzULwfWi9Wd4HXwipjv\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" data-autoplay=\"1\" data-loop=\"1\" data-hidden_controls=\"1\" alt=\"In-place configuration updates\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\">\n</p><figcaption>In-place configuration updates</figcaption><p>Plus, Amazon EC2 M5d general purpose and R5d memory-optimized instances are now used in all supported AWS regions to improve performance.<br>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbe833c29ff5eeb00/5f36a86a7ca22b018aed979c/elastic_cloud_aws_r5d_m5d_instances.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltbe833c29ff5eeb00\" alt=\"New AWS instances types in Elastic Cloud deployment templates\" \"=\"\">\n</p><figcaption>New AWS instances types in Elastic Cloud deployment templates</figcaption><p>These instance types offer improved disk performance via locally attached NVMe SSD.

This new field type addresses best practices for efficiently indexing and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/log-monitoring\">searching within logs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">security data</a> by taking a whole new approach to how we index string data. Depending on your existing field usage, wildcards can provide: </p>\n<ul> \n <li>Simpler search expressions (no need to AND words/phrases together)</li> \n <li>Simpler indexing (no need to define choices of analyzers)</li> \n <li>No more missing values</li> \n <li>Faster search</li> \n <li>Less disk usage</li> \n</ul>\n<p>The most exciting feature of this new data type is its simplification of partial matches. With wildcards, you no longer need to worry about where your text pattern falls within a string. Just search using normal query syntax, and Elasticsearch will find all matches anywhere in a string. That's right, we did this all <strong>without requiring you to change your query syntax</strong>. </p>\n<p>The wildcard data type addresses issues <a href=\"https://socprime.com/blog/elastic-for-security-analysts-part-1-searching-strings/\">noted by those in the security field</a> when it comes to partial matching of string values, but has applications in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/observability\">observability</a> and beyond (covered below). In particular, users wanting to search machine-generated logs should find this new field type a more natural fit than existing options. </p>\n<p>In this blog, we'll take a look at how we've been able to accomplish this, as well as how you'll be able to best benefit from wildcard fields. Let's take a look. </p>\n<h2>Existing options for indexing strings</h2>\n<p>Until 7.9, when it came to searching strings, Elasticsearch has broadly offered two choices: </p>\n<ol> \n <li><code>Text</code> fields</li> \n <li><code>Keyword</code> fields</li> \n</ol>\n<p><code>Text</code> fields “<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/analysis-tokenizers.html\">tokenize</a>” strings into multiple tokens, each typically representing words. Searchers looking for <em>quick foxes</em> can therefore match articles talking about a <em>quick brown fox</em>. </p>\n<p><code>Keyword</code> fields tend to be used for shorter, structured content like a country code which would be indexed without analysis as a single token. These can then be used by analysts e.g. to visualize popular holiday destinations using <em>aggregations</em>. </p>\n<p>Without an explicit mapping choice by users, Elasticsearch’s default index template assumes that string values presented in JSON documents should be indexed as both a <strong>text</strong> field and a <strong>keyword </strong>field. The intention is that Elasticsearch should work if the string represents prose that should be chopped into multiple word tokens for search <em>or</em> if it represents a single structured value (like the city name “New York”) that should be displayed as one item when displayed in a “top travel destinations” bar chart. </p>\n<h2>When text and keyword fields fall short</h2>\n<p>We don’t have to look very far for an example of string content that doesn’t work well as either text or keyword fields. Elasticsearch’s own log files produce messages that don’t fit neatly into either category. Let’s examine why. </p>\n<p>Each Elasticsearch log file entry follows the classic minimal requirement for a logged event - a timestamp and a message. The messages that are logged are used to describe a variety of events in a semi-structured form e.g.: </p>\n<ol> \n <li>Indexes being created or deleted</li> \n <li>Servers joining or leaving the cluster</li> \n <li>Warnings of resources under pressure</li> \n <li>Detailed error messages with long stack traces</li> \n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltca07898874ebd078/5f3707a6db5c28785b6f041b/blog-wildcard-field-stack-trace.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltca07898874ebd078\" alt=\"Elasticsearch stack trace\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width:600px;\"> </img></p>\n<p>Above is an example of a logged event. Highlighted is a section of the message that I’d like to search for to find similar logged errors. That would be a simple “Cmd/Ctrl-F” key press in a text editor, but is not quite so simple using Elasticsearch. Remember, Elasticsearch operates <em>at scale</em>, so Ctrl-F is great for a small text file, but not for TBs of logs. An index of some kind is required to make searches fast. </p>\n<h4>Log message as text field</h4>\n<p>If we indexed the message content as a <strong>text</strong> field the end user immediately has a translation problem. The selected substring is “<code>NodeNotConnectedException:[54b_data_2]</code>” but the critical question is “how this is represented in the index”? </p>\n<ul> \n <li>Is it half a token?</li> \n <li>One token?</li> \n <li>One and a half tokens?</li> \n <li>Two? Two and a half? ...</li> \n</ul>\n<p>The mystery arises because, unlike English text such as “<code>quick brown fox</code>”, we have no clue where words begin or end in log messages like the stack trace shown above. This is not a language humans speak naturally so it is easy to accidentally select only part of a word. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/query-dsl-match-query.html\">match</a> query can help users avoid having to know if the : or [ or _ characters in our selection are parts of word tokens or just used to split words. However, the match query will <em>not</em> help with knowing if the beginning or end of our selection happens to crop what would otherwise be a complete token. If the choice of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/configure-text-analysis.html\">analyzer</a> kept the full stops in the Java package names we would have to use an expensive leading wildcard search for <code>*NodeNotConnectedException</code> or back-up the text selection to add the preceding <code>org.elasticsearch.transport.</code> characters in our “match” query. </p>\n<p>Constructing a query that is respectful of tokenisation policies is a significant challenge, even for experienced Elasticsearch developers. </p>\n<h4>Log message as a keyword field</h4>\n<p>The keyword field has much less mystery about how the indexed content is stored — it’s one string and we can use a single regexp or wildcard expression to match arbitrary fragments like our search string inside the field values. </p>\n<p>Search is made much simpler for users but there are two main issues with the execution: </p>\n<ol> \n <li>Search speed</li> \n <li>Missing data</li> \n</ol>\n<p>Search speeds are very slow if, like our search, we are searching for something in the middle of strings and there are many unique values. Although keyword fields are indexed, it’s the wrong data structure for this task. An equivalent task would be a researcher trying to find all words with “oo” in the dictionary. They’d have to scan every word on every page from A to Z to find values “afoot” to “zoo”. That’s essentially what the keyword field has to do with every unique value and the index is of no help in speeding this up. Making things more difficult, log messages often produce many unique string values if, like those produced by Elasticsearch, they contain variables such as timings and memory sizes etc. </p>\n<p>The other big issue with the keyword field is it can’t handle very long fields. The default string mapping ignores strings longer than 256 characters, <a href=\"https://discuss.elastic.co/t/i-need-help-elasticsearch-does-not-match-my-regexp-wildcard-or-query-string-queries/239473\">silently dropping values from the list of indexed terms</a>. The majority of Elasticsearch’s log file messages exceed this limit. </p>\n<p>And even if you <em>do</em> <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/ignore-above.html\">raise</a> the Elasticsearch limit, you cannot exceed the hard Lucene limit of 32k for a single token, and Elasticsearch certainly logs some messages that exceed this. </p>\n<p>This makes a bit of a blind spot for our logging which is undesirable and, in some security cases, unacceptable. </p>\n<h2>Introducing the new wildcard field</h2>\n<p>To solve these issues we have a new <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/wildcard.html\">wildcard field</a>&nbsp;which is adept at finding any patterns in the middle of arbitrary string values. </p>\n<ul> \n <li>Unlike the text field, it does <strong>not</strong> treat strings as a collection of words separated by punctuation.</li> \n <li>Unlike the keyword field, it can be very fast to infix search many unique values and is free of size restrictions.</li> \n</ul>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>Detailed pattern-matching operations like wildcard or regular expressions can be expensive to run on large data sets. The key to speeding up these operations is to limit the amount of data on which you apply these detailed comparisons. If a quick <em>approximate</em> match can be applied to narrow the bulk of the data then the more expensive operation of detailed matching can be reserved to verifying a few promising candidate matches. </p>\n<p>The new wildcard field automatically accelerates wildcard and regexp searches in this way using two data structures: </p>\n<ol> \n <li>An “n-gram” index of all 3 character sequences found in strings</li> \n <li>A “binary doc value” store of the full original document values</li> \n</ol>\n<p>The first structure is used to provide a fast but rough narrowing of candidates based on matching n-gram fragments from the search string. </p>\n<p>The second data structure is used to verify the match candidates produced by the n-gram match with an automaton query. </p>\n<h4>Wildcard example</h4>\n<p>A security analyst might be interested in finding any log messages where a hacker may have referred to the word “shell”. Given the wildcard query “<strong>*shell*</strong>” the wildcard field would automatically split this search string into 3 character n-grams, creating the equivalent of this Lucene query: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code>she AND ell</code> </p>\n<p>This would reduce the number of documents we need to consider but may produce some false positives — e.g. a document containing the string </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code>/Users/Me/Documents/F</code><strong><code>ell</code></strong><code> walking trip with </code><strong><code>She</code></strong><code>ila.docx</code> </p>\n<p>Obviously, the longer the search string the fewer false positives produced. A search for “<code>*powershell.exe*</code>”, for example would produce a much more selective n-gram query of </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code>pow AND wer AND rsh AND hel AND l.e AND exe</code> </p>\n<p>Removing any false positives is a necessary finishing stage and so the wildcard field does this check on all the matches produced by the rough n-gram query. This is done by retrieving the full original value from a Lucene binary doc value store and running the wildcard or regexp pattern on the full value. </p>\n<h4>Regexp example</h4>\n<p>Regular expressions are more complex and can include choices of value paths&nbsp;— e.g. this search for references to DLL or EXE files: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code>.*\\.(dll|exe)</code> </p>\n<p>To accelerate this sort of query the expression is parsed into n-grams arranged with this Boolean logic: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code> (.dl AND ll_) OR (.ex AND xe_)</code> </p>\n<p>Note in this example that the _ character is used to show where a non-printable character is added to mark the end of the indexed string. </p> \n<h4>Regular expressions and case sensitivity</h4>\n<p>We know security analysts have <a href=\"https://socprime.com/blog/elastic-for-security-analysts-part-1-searching-strings/\">adapted</a> their Elasticsearch regexp searches to use mixed case expressions e.g when searching for references to <code>cmd.exe</code> regardless of case they will write: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code> [Cc][Mm][Dd].[Ee][Xx][Ee] </code> </p>\n<p>The wildcard field recognises these mixed case expressions and the rough-cut query for the above expression would be optimised to the equivalent of this Lucene query: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><code>cmd AND d.e AND exe</code> </p>\n<p>(Note the n-gram index used to accelerate queries is always lowercased). </p>\n<p>Existing security rules that use these mixed case expressions on keyword fields should run faster when used on content indexed into a wildcard field. </p>\n<p>However, these expressions still look ugly and are a pain to write, so in a future Elasticsearch release we also hope to introduce a <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/59441\">case sensitive flag</a> to the regexp query which can be set to “false” to make a query case insensitive. It will essentially make a search for <em>abc</em> search for <code>[Aa][Bb][Cc]</code> without the need for the user to write all those square brackets. The net result will be simpler, faster rules. </p>\n<h2>Comparison with keyword fields</h2>\n<p>One key goal of the wildcard field is to be a drop-in replacement for keyword fields where it makes sense. We have worked hard to ensure that it produces the same results for all query types — albeit sometimes wildcard will be faster and sometimes slower. This table should help compare the two fields: </p>\n<table style=\"width:100%\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#E8F6FE;\"> \n   <td style=\"font-weight:700;\">Feature </td> \n   <td style=\"font-weight:700;\">Keyword </td> \n   <td style=\"font-weight:700;\">Wildcard </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Sorting speeds </td> \n   <td>Fast </td> \n   <td>Not quite as fast<em> (see *1)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Aggregation speeds </td> \n   <td>Fast </td> \n   <td>Not quite as fast <em>(see *1)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Prefix query speeds (foo*) </td> \n   <td>Fast </td> \n   <td>Not quite as fast<em> (see *2)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Leading wildcard query speeds on low-cardinality fields (*foo) </td> \n   <td>Fast </td> \n   <td>Slower <em>(see *3)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Leading wildcard or regexp&nbsp;query speeds on high-cardinality fields (*foo) </td> \n   <td>Terrible </td> \n   <td>Much faster </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Term query. full value match (foo) </td> \n   <td>Fast </td> \n   <td>Not quite as fast<em> (see *2)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Fuzzy query</td> \n   <td>Y <em>(see *4)</em> </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Regexp query</td> \n   <td>Y <em>(see *4)</em> </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Range query</td> \n   <td>Y <em>(see *4)</em> </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Supports highlighting </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n   <td>N </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Searched by \"all field\" queries </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Disk costs for mostly unique values </td> \n   <td>high <em>(see *5)</em> </td> \n   <td>lower <em>(see *5)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Disk costs for mostly identical values </td> \n   <td>low <em>(see *5)</em> </td> \n   <td>medium <em>(see *5)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Max character size for a field value </td> \n   <td>256 for default JSON string mappings, 32,766 Lucene max </td> \n   <td>unlimited </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Supports normalizers in mappings </td> \n   <td>Y </td> \n   <td>N </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"background-color:#F6F7FA;\"> \n   <td>Indexing speeds </td> \n   <td>Fast </td> \n   <td>Slower <em>(see *6)</em> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n<ol> \n <li>Somewhat slower as doc values retrieved from compressed blocks of 32</li> \n <li>Somewhat slower because approximate matches with n-grams need verification</li> \n <li>Keyword field visits every unique value only once but wildcard field assesses every utterance of values</li> \n <li>If “allow expensive queries” setting enabled</li> \n <li>It depends on common prefixes — keyword fields have common-prefix based compression whereas wildcard fields are whole-value LZ4 compression</li> \n <li>Will vary with content but a test indexing weblogs took 499 seconds Vs keyword’s 365 seconds</li> \n</ol>\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\n<p>To make life easier for search and analytics applications contemplating the growing list of field types, we have simplified the way indexes describe fields in the field capabilities API. Physical fields like <code>wildcard</code> and <code>constant_keyword</code> that are functionally equivalent to the <code>keyword</code> field now describe themselves as belonging to the <code>keyword</code> <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-field-caps.html#search-field-caps-api-response-body\">family</a>. The introduction of <em>family</em> types mean other field type groupings can be made in the future and adopted without downstream client applications needing to know about new physical field types. As long as they behave the same as other members of the same family they can be used without any changes to the client application. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-elastic-common-schema\">Elastic Common Schema</a> (ECS) defines standardised index mappings for popular data fields. </p>\n<p>In 7.9, ECS has not been updated to use wildcard fields but in the future we can expect that several high-cardinality keyword fields will be changed over to use wildcard fields instead. When this happens client applications should typically not need to change anything as a result but should benefit from faster searches. </p>\n<h2>All sounds great, what does it cost me?</h2>\n<p>As usual, the answer is “it depends”. Storage costs mostly depend on the level of duplication in your field’s data. For mostly-unique values the storage costs can actually be less than those of using a keyword field. This is because we made an <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9211\">addition</a> to Lucene to compress the binary doc value store used to access the original content. </p>\n<p>We tested an example dataset of 2 million weblog records where each line in the file is indexed as a single value held in a single field. An index using a keyword field was 310MB but thanks to compression the equivalent index using the new wildcard field was 227MB. Admittedly the timestamp helped ensure each document value was unique but combinations of URL, IP address and user-agent could also lead to many unique strings. </p>\n<h2>Summary cheat sheet — when should I use a wildcard field?</h2>\n<p>We recognise all of the above is a lot to think about so a rough guide to when a wildcard field is appropriate is given below. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt086af7a2897168a8/5f37050cdb5c28785b6f0413/blog-wildcard-field-workflow.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt086af7a2897168a8\" alt=\"When and when not to use a wildcard field\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"> </img></p>\n<h2>Take it for a spin</h2>\n<p>As someone who’s helped develop this feature, I’m excited to see it production-ready. Wildcard fields can provide an immediate boost for almost every Elasticsearch user, not just folks in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">security</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/observability\">observability</a> spaces. I know I’ll be using it to search my own Elasticsearch log files. </p>\n<p>If all this has piqued your interest, try wildcards out for yourself in a <a href=\"https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?elektra=blog-wildcardfields\">free trial of Elasticsearch Service</a>, and let us know what you think in our <a href=\"https://discuss.elastic.co\">forums</a>.

Other new developments include Gmail content source integrations in Workplace Search, the introduction of Elastic Enterprise Search into Kibana, improvements in index management and logging, and intuitive UI updates. Let’s dive into a few of the details.\n</p> <strong><h2>Features of Workplace Search added to our free distribution tier</h2></strong><p>\n\tThe addition of Workplace Search features to our free distribution tier means that you can <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise-search\">download</a> and use the entire Elastic Enterprise Search solution to easily get started and boost productivity with modern search experiences. Whether it’s App Search for your apps and websites or Workplace Search for your internal teams, with the features included in the free distribution tier&#160;you can download and evaluate our full product suite. Workplace Search includes connectors to a host of popular collaboration, storage, and productivity tools, along with access to the Custom Source API for creating your own connectors. You also get group and user management tools, easily tunable content source prioritization by team, and much more. Then, as you need additional customization, integrations, granular access control, and single-sign-on (SSO) support, you’ll find it all in our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions\">Platinum subscription</a>.\n</p><p><strong></strong>\n</p><h2><strong>Introducing Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana</strong></h2><p>In 7.9, Kibana rolls out the welcome mat to Elastic Enterprise Search, offering easy navigation to your search deployments right alongside all your other favorite analysis and visualization tools. As the window into the Elastic Stack, Kibana allows users to do everything from rich data visualization using Elasticsearch indices to administering and managing the whole of the Elastic Stack. With this release, Kibana admins can customize spaces to show or hide Enterprise Search in the main navigation menu, and give users the capability to quickly access deployments and in-app dashboards.\n</p><p><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd64ad0cc9a899866/5f3599c5327a6201d7ebba32/enterprise-search-7-9-in-kibana-blog.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltd64ad0cc9a899866\" alt=\"Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><strong><h2>Announcing the federated Gmail connector for Workplace Search</h2></strong><p>Gmail joins Google Drive, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Confluence, and a number of other <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search/content-sources\">prebuilt content source integrations</a> for Workplace Search. Google is obviously no slouch at search, of course, but Workplace Search offers a single search bar for not just the G Suite, but across a slew of sources, regardless of the origin, manufacturer, or ecosystem. Users can conduct search without needing to remember where that data lives, and they’ll see their own private <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/7.9/workplace-search-gmail-connector.html\">Gmail content</a> right alongside all those other sources, with pretuned search relevance baked right in.&#160;\n</p><p><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb8b3fc0b19a40778/5f3556811fe0e07eae8141bc/enterprise-search-7-9-gmail-connector-blog.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltb8b3fc0b19a40778\" alt=\"Gmail content source integration in Elastic Workplace Search \" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><strong><h2>Gleaning new insights from your knowledge landscape</h2></strong><p>Workplace Search tracks and logs document and record activity as it unfolds on third-party systems synchronized to the search experience, providing a centralized location for keeping track of organizational information shifts and hot spots. Over time, this provides businesses with critical insight into user behavior in third-party systems as well as auditing capabilities for information security purposes that often are not otherwise available. Combining this functionality with the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">Elastic Security</a> solution and our machine learning capabilities introduces a new and unique value for system administrators and IT teams.\n</p> <strong><h2>Gaining more control over scale</h2></strong><p>Because Elastic Enterprise Search is built atop the Elastic Stack, powerful features can be pulled into App Search and Workplace Search based on user needs. In 7.9, App Search and Workplace Search inherit the index lifecycle management (ILM) policies feature from the Elastic Stack to automatically manage logs and analytics.\n</p><p>The logs and analytics for Elastic Enterprise Search are now cycled automatically with ILM. Users can also change how long logs and analytics are retained with existing Elastic Stack tools, like the Kibana ILM policy management tool.&#160;\n</p> <strong><h2>What else?</h2></strong><p>There are a few other Workplace Search updates in 7.9. You can use OpenSearch to quickly add a shortcut to your browser’s search bar to jump right to Workplace Search. There’s no need for tab switching just to conduct a quick search.\n</p><p>Workplace Search also sports new document thumbnail previews, giving you snappy visual cues with robust document excerpts and metadata, for quickly finding just what you need.\n</p><p>And rounding out the update are more personalized search results based on user behavior. The Search API inside Workplace Search now supports auto-filter detection as well as query-time boosting. This means authenticated user context on a page can be provided in the Search API to deliver a more customized search experience.\n</p> <strong><h2>Try it today!</h2></strong>There’s a lot to like in 7.9, and we hope you’re as excited to try it as we are to introduce&#160;it.

It offers powerful APIs and developer tools, advanced search relevance and tolerance controls, built-in real-time analytics for actionable insights, and more.\n</p><p>Workplace Search boosts your team's productivity by unifying all your content platforms — Google Drive, Salesforce, etc. — into a personalized search experience with flexibility of deployment (in the cloud or on-prem), pretuned relevance, and an intuitive interface.\n</p><h3>Observability</h3><p>Elastic Cloud’s features for data management and out-of-the-box UIs allow you to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/observability\">centralize your logs, metrics, and APM data</a>. The hot-warm template lets you scale your data with both fast NVMe SSDs (hot) as well as cost-effective spinning disks (warm). You can also pair hot-warm templates alongside index lifecycle management and index rollups to gain full control around your observability data. Then, use the dedicated Logs, Metrics, and APM apps to quickly troubleshoot and diagnose issues.\n</p><h3>Security</h3><p>The data management features of Elasticsearch Service, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">together with Elastic Security</a>, help you eliminate blind spots and stop threats at scale.

We provided the community with an environment to learn and practice threat hunting with our team, and cultivated new relationships with attendees. By sharing information with security practitioners, we can help prepare them to defend their organization’s data from attack through knowledge transfer. Our free and open approach to security includes not only technologies, but our philosophy and methodologies around threat hunting based on the research and content that we also share. </p>\n<p>Like many other conferences this year, <a href=\"https://www.bsidessatx.com/\">BSides SATX</a> shifted to a virtual format in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The conference was a great experience thanks to the organizers and everyone who participated. Attendees utilized our CTF environment, built with free and open technologies, before learning how to use version 7.8 of the Elastic Stack to hunt for an attacker’s malicious behavior in the proverbial <em>needle in a haystack</em>: 11 million events. </p>\n<h2>The scenario</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the CTF competition, participants were provided with an all-too-common scenario that included a notification from a business partner. Their network had been compromised and some endpoints were infected with ransomware. They recovered from the incident and offered their assurances that “you shouldn’t be affected.” However, in this scenario, leadership is skeptical and has asked attendees&nbsp; — the participating threat hunters — to look for any suspicious behavior in their environment. After all, the third party has a valid user account for systems in the enterprise that they use occasionally to connect to your network… </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt01c85624c58d522b/5f31cb38327a6201d7ebaa0a/1-fictitious-breach-blog-capture-the-flag.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt01c85624c58d522b\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black; width: 90%\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Figure 1 - An excerpt from the fictitious breach notification from a business partner\n</figcaption>\n<h2>Threat hunting methodology</h2>\n<p>Threat hunting is the <em>proactive</em> pursuit and elimination of adversaries in an organization’s environment before they cause damage and loss. In the spirit of threat hunting, we did not generate any security alerts for participants before the CTF event. After providing attendees with a demonstration of how to use the Discover and Visualize apps in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/kibana\">Kibana</a> and execute queries using <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.8/kuery-query.html\">Kibana Query Language (KQL)</a>, we provided them with the fabricated breach notification. As threat hunters, they would need to form hypotheses about which actions the attacker may have taken before searching for the behavior. </p>\n<p>An initial hypothesis that could be quickly proved or disproved may be something like: “the attacker abused the valid user account used by the business partner by authenticating to one or more of the endpoints in my network.” If the hypothesis was proven to be true, an additional hypothesis could be formed based on assumptions on what the attacker could have done next. Did they perform any actions to discover the network? Did they establish a command and control channel or exfiltrate any data? </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt976e705549be29cf/5f31cb4b48d3b57cb974969b/2-visualize-in-kibana-blog-capture-the-flag.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt976e705549be29cf\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Figure 2 - Using Visualize in Kibana to search for rare process command line arguments \n</figcaption>\n<p>Once CTF participants discovered the first signs of malicious activity, they began to track the adversary’s footprints through the data and untangle the story of what happened piece by piece. </p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the fundamentals of effective threat hunting, you can download our free book, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/campaigns/elastic-guide-to-threat-hunting\">The Elastic Guide to Threat Hunting</a> and watch our presentation, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2Hh5spqA6bw\">How to plan and execute a hunt</a>. </p>\n<p><br> </br></p>\n<div class=\"video embed-container\" style=\"height: 319.725px;\"> \n <img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/8PKneMzyB45NAMP7dBxzYm.jpg\" data-uuid=\"8PKneMzyB45NAMP7dBxzYm\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\"> </img>\n</div>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<h2>Preparing the CTF environment</h2>\n<p>While designing the environment for the CTF, we decided to keep it relatively simple. We configured the following components, as shown in Figure 3: </p>\n<ul> \n <li>x1 Windows Server 2016 host configured as a domain controller</li> \n <li>x20 Windows 10 endpoints joined to the domain</li> \n <li>We installed several applications on each endpoint using <a href=\"https://ninite.com/\">Ninite</a> in order to generate benign events and make the task of finding the flags in the dataset a bit more challenging for participants — after all, the goal of a threat hunter is to find the true threat amidst the noise</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/winlogbeat\">Winlogbeat</a> was installed on all endpoints and configured to ship Windows event logs, PowerShell logs, and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon\">Sysmon</a> events to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack\">Elasticsearch</a>.

Our team executed offensive techniques across the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</a> matrix in order to simulate attacker activity and achieve their objective. </p>\n<p>Attacker techniques were executed using both <a href=\"https://github.com/LOLBAS-Project/LOLBAS\">living-off-the-land</a> methods and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/embracing-offensive-tooling-building-detections-against-koadic-using-eql\">off-the-shelf offensive tools</a> to complete objectives such as obtaining initial access to an endpoint, establishing a command and control channel, maintaining persistence, and moving laterally between endpoints. CTF participants were asked to hunt for evidence of the nefarious activity without many leads and earn points for submitting the correct flags. The winner was the first person to submit all of the correct flags. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt862241dc6591d60b/5f31cb6e7f3b7908db0322b0/4-ctfd-scoreboard-capture-the-flag.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt862241dc6591d60b\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Figure 4 - Our CTFd scoreboard \n</figcaption>\n<p>For the benefit of people who had not used Kibana to execute queries or build visualizations before, we provided them with a brief demonstration and links to resources to jump start their threat hunting efforts. We saw a few people who were new to threat hunting with Elastic arrive on the leaderboard early on. We received positive feedback from attendees, including someone who was new to Elastic and was looking to sharpen their skills before starting a new job the following week.

Whether a security practitioner belongs to a threat hunting, security operations, or incident response team, they must be able to rely on both their tools and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality\">quality</a> of their data. </p>\n<h3>Ensuring data quality with Beats and Elastic Common Schema</h3>\n<p>To help ensure security teams have the right data available to them in Elastic Security for monitoring and detection, we have <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.8/filebeat-modules.html\">numerous </a>Beats that can collect, normalize, and ship data directly to Elasticsearch. Each Beat comes with a variety of modules that will create the index mappings and predefined dashboards, specific to the log source. </p>\n<p>A security team must be able to rely on the accuracy and timeliness of their data. If you don’t know which systems have logging and event forwarding enabled, which fields are available in each log and the expected data types or values for those fields, or if the schema for a data source changes unexpectedly, you cannot rely on the results of your queries. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html\">Elastic Common Schema (ECS)</a> defines a common set of fields to be used when storing event data in Elasticsearch, such as logs and metrics. This may sound simple at first, but taking on the task of extracting, transforming, and loading events from multiple sources into a single destination can be a costly, time consuming, and continuous effort. Since version 7.0 of our Beats framework, the normalization of data to ECS is taken care of for you, ensuring consistency across your data and helping users execute searches effectively. </p>\n<figcaption>\n <img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltaa232bbebf5385b1/5f32c8787ca22b018aed893b/5-ECS-fields-blog-capture-the-flag-2.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltaa232bbebf5385b1\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black; width: 55%\" />\n</figcaption>\n<figcaption>\n Figure 5 - ECS fields shown in Kibana Discover along with event filter options \n</figcaption>\n<p>ECS also adds <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-category-field-values-reference.html\">categorization fields</a> to each event, allowing threat hunters to describe the data they are looking for as opposed to querying for the specific event information. For example, Windows event ID 4624 records a “Successful Logon” event. With ECS we can find it using the query <code>event.category: authentication and event.outcome: success</code>. This allows a threat hunter to search across multiple data sources without having to be concerned about the specific fields and values in each log. </p>\n<figcaption>\n <img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltebda99de5a7b19e6/5f32c94c8e1e8d4046e9f300/6-event-category-field-blog-capture-the-flag-2.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltebda99de5a7b19e6\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black; width: 55%\"><br>Figure 6 - Example values for the event.category field </br></img>\n</figcaption>\n<h3>Schema on write and for faster search results</h3>\n<p>Elastic uses <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/schema-on-write-vs-schema-on-read\">schema on write</a> to extract the necessary fields from logs <em>prior </em>to storing them. With schema on write, analysts do not have to figure out how to extract fields after the fact, speeding up their queries, and dramatically increasing the value they get from their log data. </p>\n<p>Elastic takes care of the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/mapping-types.html\">mapping</a> of data types to the various fields in an event. This allows for additional functionality when searching. For example, by mapping the <code>source.bytes</code> field as a <code>long</code> data type, threat hunters can use a range of numbers as opposed to a single number. If <code>source.bytes</code> was mapped to the <code>text</code> or <code>keyword</code> data type, it could not be used the same way. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1f8964774e3b49df/5f31cb9f168ec908bebe96cb/7-winlogbeat-blog-capture-the-flag.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt1f8964774e3b49df\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Figure 7 - Reviewing field mappings for the winlogbeat index \n</figcaption>\n<p>Using schema on write also allows for the enriching of data with other information such as indicator of compromise (IOC) matches, user information such as department and role, and the risk level of an asset. When events are enriched, it’s easy to search for the relevant fields and help with an analyst’s situational awareness. </p>\n<p>Figure 8 shows how <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.8/discover.html\">Discover</a> helps users construct search queries by utilizing KQL’s autocomplete feature to suggest valid field names. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt488cb414ba2c0a3d/5f31cbb18e1e8d4046e9eec9/8-kql-autocomplete-blog-capture-the-flag.gif\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt488cb414ba2c0a3d\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black; width: 90%\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Figure 8 - Using KQL’s autocomplete feature \n</figcaption>\n<p>After choosing a field to include in a query, KQL’s autocomplete asks the user what operator they would like to use with the field, based on its <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/mapping-types.html\">data type mapping</a>. For example, a numeric field type like <code>source.bytes</code> can be used with the operators, as shown in Figure 9 below. </p>\n<img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt317c1d68ac8d77a5/5f31cbbec9ec57071816e76b/9-numeric-field-types-blog-capture-the-flag.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt317c1d68ac8d77a5\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black; width: 90%\">&nbsp;\n <figcaption>\n  Figure 9 - List of operators that can be used with the numeric field type, source.bytes \n </figcaption><h2>Detecting malicious behavior with Elastic Security</h2><p>Elastic Security builds on the power of the Elastic Stack to deliver out-of-the-box capabilities that help security operations teams do their jobs more effectively. For example, Elastic Security has 140+ prebuilt <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules\">detection rules</a> to alert on attacker behavior on endpoint, network, and cloud platforms. All detections are mapped to the relevant ATT&amp;CK techniques and include useful references to help analysts triage and investigate alerts. Users also have the option to create their own rules and we are always excited to work alongside members of the community to help with and accept their <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contributions</a>. </p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf4319b5921db4cb3/5f31cbc9c9ec57071816e76f/10-alerts-detection-rules-blog-capture-the-flag.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltf4319b5921db4cb3\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; border:1px solid black\"> </img></p>\n <figcaption>\n  Figure 10 - Alerts generated by detection rules in Elastic Security \n </figcaption><p>Analysts can drag and drop fields of interest into the Timeline for further investigation.

beyond!","link":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-at-kubecon-europe-2020-orchestration-to-observability-and-beyond","description":"<p>KubeCon Europe 2020 is virtual this year, and Elastic is doing our part to help \"keep cloud native connected.\" We would rather be there in person to shake hands, tell stories, and laugh, but the challenges of a virtual conference also provide the opportunity to share great content and materials that we might not be able to at a crowded booth.\n</p><p>So please join us at our virtual booth at Virtual KubeCon 2020 (Amsterdam) to see a virtual demo session, get access to custom content, grab exclusive virtual swag, and chat with real people.\n</p><p>At the booth we’ll give a quick introduction to Elasticsearch (the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-free-open-limitless\">free and open</a>, scalable, and highly-available search engine and datastore) and show how it powers use cases like enterprise search, observability, and security. We’ll demonstrate how the applications that power Elastic Observability (Logs, Metrics, APM, and Uptime) consolidate the event streams from your Kubernetes cluster, cloud and physical infrastructure, Prometheus, and other CNCF projects and services with your application traces in a fast, scalable, and unified data store. We'll also show you how to spin up an Elastic Stack cluster with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK), the official operator for orchestrating Elasticsearch on Kubernetes.\n</p><h2>Orchestration with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes</h2><p>At KubeCon 2019 in San Diego, the buzz was about the beta of Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK). ECK is the official operator for orchestration of Elasticsearch and the Elastic Stack — not just for initial day-one deployments, but also for day-two administration and beyond.&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>This year, we’re excited to chat with folks who have been using ECK to simplify the orchestration of their Elastic Stack deployments and get feedback around how we can continue to improve their experience. The ECK operator is now generally available (GA) and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/release-notes-1.2.0.html\">was recently updated</a> to include the ability to orchestrate the lifecycle for Elastic Enterprise Search as well as Beats. Deploying an Elastic cluster with ECK is as simple as installing the operator: \n</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/1.1.2/all-in-one.yaml</pre> <p>Then applying a configuration, as shown in this example, to create a three-node cluster:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">cat &#60;&#60;EOF | kubectl apply -f - \napiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1 \nkind: Elasticsearch \nmetadata: \n  name: quickstart \nspec: \n  version: 7.8.0 \n  nodeSets: \n  - name: default \n    count: 3 \n    config: \n      node.master: true \n      node.data: true \n      node.ingest: true \n      node.store.allow_mmap: false \nEOF\n</pre><p>ECK can streamline the orchestration of your Elastic deployments when running on Kubernetes, but when using the Elastic Stack you have more than one choice. If you'd prefer a SaaS experience, you can <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service\">sign up for a free trial of the Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud</a>.&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>Of course, you can always download <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/start\">Elasticsearch and Kibana</a>, and provision your own clusters, or get the best of both worlds and choose <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/ece\">Elastic Cloud Enterprise</a>, which provides the SaaS experience of Elastic Cloud, but on your infrastructure.&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>The freedom to run how and where you choose gives you full control of where your data lives and its complete lifecycle.\n</p><h2>Elastic Observability</h2><p>Orchestration is one side of the coin. The other, of course, is observing the health and performance of those deployments. Our focus around Kubernetes and other CNCF projects is not solely based on orchestration of the Elastic Stack on Kubernetes, but digs deep into the observability of these systems and the workloads running on them as well. Automatic discovery of new or scaled containers or pods means that you don't need to update static configurations when your dynamic ecosystem changes, whether it be hour to hour, minute to minute, or second to second.&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>Elastic Observability lets you gather logs and metrics from your full application stack. With support for many CNCF projects — sandbox, graduated, and in between — gathering logs and metrics from your CNCF services and sending them to Elasticsearch is easy. Elastic also recently added support for resource quota metricsets, supporting all fields exposed by the <code>kube-state-metrics</code> agent, along with expanded support for ingesting Prometheus metrics by adding <code>remote_write</code> capabilities, bringing long-term, highly-available storage of high-cardinality Prometheus data.\n</p><p>Logs and metrics are a good start, but for full visibility you also need to see what the applications are doing both behind the scenes as well as how they behave from the outside — and that's where application performance monitoring (APM) and service monitoring come in.\n</p><p>Elastic APM provides developers with native language instrumentation agents for many common programming languages and frameworks, along with support for several other open source instrumentation services and frameworks. Elastic APM expanded open instrumentation support by implementing a <a href=\"https://elastic.zoom.us/j/94938108180?pwd=ZExXM01KbGR3WTJpeHpOMlQyaEhrUT09\">Jaeger intake</a>, allowing developers to send traces from the CNCF-graduated Jaeger project directly to Elastic APM. In addition, we recently created an <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-apm-opentelemetry-integration\">OpenTelemetry collector</a> to allow gathering of OpenTelemetry traces, which joins the OpenTracing support that was added in 2018. &#160;\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt494612fff7d43dfc/5f2449d07ca22b018aed5b77/apm-distributed-trace.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt494612fff7d43dfc\" alt=\"Elastic APM distributed tracing\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><p>APM shows what is going on inside your applications and services — where they are spending their time, what they are interacting with, and any errors that may be occurring — and combining APM with real user monitoring (<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/performing-real-user-monitoring-rum-with-elastic-apm\">RUM</a>) and service monitoring (Uptime and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat\">Heartbeat</a>) allows you to accurately gauge your users' experience. Just because you've sent a response doesn't mean that the transaction is over, and just because it works for one user doesn't mean that it works for all of them.<br>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltea2565778bb04481/5f2449e37f3b7908db02fa47/uptime.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltea2565778bb04481\" alt=\"Service monitoring with Elastic Observability\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><p>Many organizations don't run entirely in one ecosystem, but rather across multiple public and private clouds with virtualization and bare metal sprinkled in: some workloads in an on-prem Kubernetes cluster, and others deployed across multiple cloud providers. When faced with a hybrid-cloud environment, many organizations end up with siloed monitoring tools, one per cloud provider. Elastic Observability allows you to \"monitor the monitors\", providing visibility across your hybrid infrastructure by consolidating logs and metrics from <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-azure-monitor.html\">Azure Monitor</a>, Google Cloud Operations Suite (formerly known as <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-googlecloud.html\">StackDriver</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-aws-cloudwatch.html\">AWS CloudWatch</a>, and interacting with that data alongside your Prometheus metrics, and all of your other logs and metrics, in one single datastore.\n</p><p>All of your logs, metrics, application traces, and availability data are stored in Elasticsearch indices, so you can mix and match, correlate and chart, and analyze and augment across different data streams.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt8021ef9e427afceb/5f244a0f7ca22b018aed5b7b/prometheus-alongside-logs-and-metrics.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt8021ef9e427afceb\" alt=\"Full observability with Elastic\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><h2>Teaming up with more use cases</h2><p>It's not just observability data that you can mix and match. Your observability data can be stored alongside your business KPIs as well — sales metrics, ads served, products shipped, you name it — giving you extra dimensions to slice and dice, and new ways to answer old questions. How much did that last outage cost? How did that last software change to our recommendation engine help sales? Or simple things, like determining the best time of day for an upgrade. With powerful visualizations and tools like <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/what-is/kibana-lens\">Kibana Lens</a> you can <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/webinars/visualizing-your-observability-data-through-the-kibana-lens\">answer those types of questions</a>.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltea29d5cdf26ac853/5f244a317ca22b018aed5b7f/annotations-and-kpis.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltea29d5cdf26ac853\" alt=\"Anomaly detection in observability data with Elastic\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p><p>Observability is just one of the many use cases that the Elastic Stack supports.

Cluster administrators need visibility into the infrastructure and cluster operators need to know the status of their workloads at any given time. And in both cases, they need observability into moving objects. </p> \n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat\">Metricbeat</a> and its autodiscover feature do the hard part for you. Operators can set up fairly complex monitoring scenarios with a self-service approach following the principle of least privilege at the cluster level. </p> \n<p>The self-service approach is great, but what if the service I want to monitor is behind authentication? In this blog, we’ll take a look at how easy it is to configure observability for authenticated services with Elastic. </p> \n<h2>How autodiscover works</h2> \n<p>Applications running on containers and pods become moving targets to the monitoring system. Autodiscover tracks changes at the container and pod level and dynamically adjusts the monitoring configuration using two strategies: </p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Template-based autodiscover:</strong> By defining configuration templates, the autodiscover subsystem can use them to monitor services as they start running.</li> \n <li><strong>Hints-based autodiscover:</strong> The <code>hints</code> system looks for hints in Kubernetes pod annotations or Docker labels which have the prefix <code>co.elastic.metrics</code>. As soon as the container starts, Metricbeat will check if it contains any hints and launch the proper configuration for it. Hints tell Metricbeat how to get metrics for the given container.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Let’s look at an example with <em>template-based autodiscover</em>. Here is a configuration template for automatically detecting Redis pods and starting to collect metrics using the respective Redis Metricbeat module: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">metricbeat.autodiscover:\n  providers:\n    - type: kubernetes\n      templates:\n        - condition:\n            contains:\n              kubernetes.labels.app: \"redis\"\n          config:\n            - module: redis\n              metricsets: [\"info\"]\n              hosts: \"${data.host}:6379\"\n</pre> \n<p>Defining autodiscover templates at Metricbeat’s configuration level is a valid approach, but users must be granted the permission to globally configure Metricbeat. In addition, a restart of Metricbeat is required every time the autodiscover template is updated. With hints-based autodiscover, we let workload owners enable monitoring for their services on the fly, avoiding over-granted permissions without restarting the Beats. The following example configures the same Redis monitoring from above using hints: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">metricbeat.autodiscover:\n  providers:\n    - type: kubernetes\n      hints.enabled: true\n</pre> \n<p>In this case, Redis pods need to be <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/\">annotated</a> accordingly: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: annotations-demo\n  annotations:\n    co.elastic.metrics/module: redis\n    co.elastic.metrics/metricsets: info\n    co.elastic.metrics/hosts: '${data.host}:6379'\n</pre> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<h2><strong>Using passwords with autodiscover</strong></h2> \n<p>In many cases, the target service requires password authentication in order to provide monitoring metrics. For instance, Redis can be configured to be password protected, meaning we have to provide a password to the Redis module in Metricbeat in order to collect metrics successfully. With template-based autodiscover, we would configure the template like this: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">metricbeat.autodiscover:\n  providers:\n    - type: kubernetes\n      templates:\n        - condition:\n            contains:\n              kubernetes.labels.app: \"redis\"\n          config:\n            - module: redis\n              metricsets: [\"info\"]\n              hosts: \"${data.host}:6379\"\n              password: 'myred1sp@ss'\n</pre> \n<p>Similarly, with hints-based autodiscover, we would annotate the pod with a string containing the password: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: annotations-demo\nannotations:\n  co.elastic.metrics/module: redis\n  co.elastic.metrics/metricsets: info\n  co.elastic.metrics/hosts: '${data.host}:6379'\n  co.elastic.metrics/password: 'myred1sp@ss'\n</pre> \n<p>While we can use these setups for development or testing purposes, storing passwords in plain text poses a serious risk and should be avoided. We could put the password in an environment variable and let Metricbeat interpolate the manifest, but this wouldn’t make our security posture any better. Let’s see a preferable alternative. </p> \n<strong> <h3>The Metricbeat keystore</h3></strong> \n<p>Metricbeat provides a feature called <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.8/keystore.html\">keystore</a> that can be used to securely store sensitive information and reference it in the Metricbeat configuration as a secret. Let’s see how we can leverage this feature in our autodiscover template configurations. First, we create the keystore and add the password for Redis under the name <code>REDIS_PASSWORD</code>: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">metricbeat keystore create\nmetricbeat keystore add REDIS_PASSWORD\n</pre> \n<p>And provide “myred1sp@ss” when prompted. </p> \n<p>Then the configuration template will be able to reference the string <code>REDIS_PASSWORD</code> to access the actual password: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">metricbeat.autodiscover:\n  providers:\n    - type: kubernetes\n      templates:\n        - condition:\n            contains:\n              kubernetes.labels.app: \"redis\"\n          config:\n            - module: redis\n              metricsets: [\"info\"]\n              hosts: \"${data.host}:6379\"\n              password: \"${REDIS_PASSWORD}\"\n</pre> \n<p>And that’s all! We managed to avoid using plain text passwords or defining ENV variables, and instead we leveraged the Metricbeat keystore to securely store the password for the target Redis pod. </p> \n<p>Unfortunately, we can't use this strategy with hints-based autodiscovery — it wouldn’t be safe to expose the keystore to the hints mechanism because it could be a target for an attacker trying to exploit the whole keystore just using hints annotations. This is why we introduced a completely new Keystore, the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.9/configuration-autodiscover.html#_kubernetes_secrets\">Kubernetes secrets keystore</a>. </p> \n<strong> <h3>The Kubernetes Secrets Keystore</h3></strong> \n<p>With the Kubernetes Secrets Keystore we allow users to consume <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\">Kubernetes secrets</a> directly in autodiscover configuration. It can be used for both template-based and hints-based autodiscover. </p> \n<p>Users can refer a Kubernetes Secret with the following pattern: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">${kubernetes.&lt;namespace&gt;.&lt;secret_name&gt;.&lt;value&gt;}\n</pre> \n<p>For instance, <code>${kubernetes.default.redisPass.value}</code> where <code>kubernetes.default.redisPass.value</code> specifies a key stored as a Kubernetes secret with the following: </p> \n<ol> \n <li>Kubernetes Namespace: <code>default</code></li> \n <li>Secret Name: <code>redisPass</code></li> \n <li>Secret Data Key: <code>value</code></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Note that pods can only consume secrets that belong to the same Kubernetes namespace. For example if our Redis pod is running in the <code>staging</code> namespace, it cannot access a secret created in the <code>testing</code> namespace. </p> \n<p>Let's see how we could leverage the new Keystore backend. First we need to create the secret: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cat &lt;&lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f -\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: redisPass\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  value: $(echo -n \"myred1sp@ss\" | base64)\nEOF\n</pre> \n<p>Now we can consume the <code>redisPass</code> secret from within our hint based autodiscover configuration: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: annotations-demo\n  app: redis\nannotations:\n  co.elastic.metrics/module: redis\n  co.elastic.metrics/metricsets: info\n  co.elastic.metrics/hosts: '${data.host}:6379'\n  co.elastic.metrics/password: '${kubernetes.default.redisPass.value}'\n</pre> \n<p>Kubernetes secrets keystore also works with autodiscover templates and we can access Kuberentes secrets from our static configurations, too: </p> \n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">metricbeat.autodiscover:\n  providers:\n    - type: kubernetes\n      templates:\n        - condition:\n            contains:\n              kubernetes.labels.app: \"redis\"\n          config:\n            - module: redis\n              metricsets: [\"info\", \"keyspace\"]\n              hosts: \"${data.host}:6379\"\n              password: \"${kubernetes.default.redisPass.value}\"\n</pre> \n<strong> <h2>Conclusions</h2></strong> \n<p>If you find the idea of securing sensitive configurations in your Kubernetes environment of utmost importance, then you will love Metricbeat keystore and Kubernetes secrets keystore — they allow you to securely connect without leaking plain text passwords. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/downloads\">Download Metricbeat</a> and start storing your passwords securely for your autodiscovered workloads without worrying about leaking sensitive data.

To learn more about these updates, you might consider giving our main Elastic 7.9 <a href=\"http://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security\">release blog</a> a read.</p><h2>It all starts with ingest<br></h2><p>Elasticsearch is a data store, search engine, and analytics platform — all in one. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it powers everything from <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search\">Elastic Workplace Search</a> to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/observability\">infrastructure monitoring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security\">endpoint security</a>. Its ability to efficiently transform data into insights and questions into answers is, perhaps, second to none.</p><p>However, none of this is possible without (drum roll): ingest. Ingest is, quite simply, the process of getting your data into Elasticsearch. Over the years, Elastic has steadily improved how ingest is accomplished. With the release of Elasticsearch 7.9, we’re taking another significant step forward.</p><h3>Simplifying ingest with data streams<br></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/data-streams.html\">Data streams</a> are a new concept for ingesting (and managing) time series data. They’re designed to give you the simplicity of a single named resource with the storage, scalability, and cost-saving benefits of having multiple indices.<br><br>Time series data tends to grow over time. And while it might be easier to store and manage this data via a single index, it’s often more efficient and cost-effective to store large volumes of time series data across multiple, time-based indices. Multiple indices enable you to move indices containing older, less frequently queried data to less expensive hardware and delete indices when they’re no longer needed, reducing overhead and storage costs. <br><br>Here’s how data streams work. You can now submit indexing and search requests directly to a data stream instead of a specific index (or specific index + alias). The stream automatically routes the requests to a collection of hidden backing indices that store the stream’s data.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltde1d1ae2b6b174a8/5f3a98671340d47a564b5d65/Screen_Shot_2020-08-13_at_9.33.23_AM.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltde1d1ae2b6b174a8\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2020-08-13_at_9.33.23_AM.png\" style=\"width: 338px; height: 233px; float: left; margin: 0px;\" width=\"338\" height=\"233\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt9120f2c30f75c992/5f3a988f1340d47a564b5d69/Screen_Shot_2020-08-13_at_9.34.06_AM.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt9120f2c30f75c992\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2020-08-13_at_9.34.06_AM.png\" style=\"width: 339px; height: 233px;\" width=\"339\" height=\"233\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A search request using data streams and an indexing request using data streams.</em><br></p><p>Data streams abstract away — and simplify — some of the complexity that comes with having to manage numerous time series indices, making features like index lifecycle management (ILM) a breeze to configure and simple to maintain.</p><h3>Dialing ingest to 11</h3><p>With the <a href=\"http://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security\">introduction of Elastic Agent</a> and its support for endpoint security, it’s easy to imagine a world where tens of thousands of endpoints come online at the same time — creating a tidal wave of data for Elasticsearch to ingest. We’re continually pushing Elasticsearch to ingest data as quickly as possible, whether it’s from a single client or tens of thousands of clients.</p><p>Starting in Elasticsearch 7.9, we’ve increased Elasticsearch ingestion throughout by removing the fixed ingestion queue of 200 documents and replacing it with a new flexible memory-based queue. Through our internal testing, we’ve been able to drastically improve ingestion throughput in Elasticsearch with this new ingestion subsystem, especially when there are large numbers of clients writing data to Elasticsearch.</p><p>At each stage of the indexing process (coordinating, primary, and replication), the new ingestion <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/59487\">subsystem</a> accounts for the number of bytes associated with an operation and <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58885\">rejects requests</a> if a byte-based limit is exceeded (10% of heap memory by default). This feature is enabled by default in Elasticsearch 7.9, and detailed indexing information is exposed via the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/cluster-nodes-stats.html\">node stats API</a> (see the ‘indexing_pressure’ sections).</p><h3>Ingest and enrich</h3><p>Way back in October 2019, with the release of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-4-0-released\">Elasticsearch 7.4</a>, we added the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/shape.html\">shape data type</a>, enabling you to define your own spatial coordinate system. With <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-5-0-released\">7.5</a> we added the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/enrich-processor.html\">enrich processor</a>. And, more recently, with Elasticsearch 7.8 we introduced an <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.9/ingest-node-pipelines.html\">ingest node pipeline builder</a> into Kibana — a handy user interface that makes it easy for you to configure custom ingest pipelines.</p><p>How do these three things relate?</p><p>Well, with the release of Elasticsearch 7.9 we’ve made the process of data ingest and enrichment even better with the introduction of a (new) tree view and support for enrichment when using the shape data type.</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt2965ec3e4b1fdfd7/5f3a99955bf6816117eead23/image3.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt2965ec3e4b1fdfd7\" alt=\"image3.png\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Experimenting with ingest node pipeline builder’s new tree view</em><br></p><h2>Smarter solutions with smarter search</h2><p>Whether you’re using Elasticsearch to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/customers/pscu\">prevent fraud</a> or to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/customers/box\">transform logging data into operational insights</a>, the following new features and enhancements will help you put your data to work.</p><h3>Find relevant results faster with wildcard fields<br></h3><p>Sometimes you only know half of what you’re searching for (think: *.pdf or *.exe). Especially in observability and security use cases, the wildcard operator delivers more powerful searches. Using the wildcard operator when searching logs, however, can often be problematic.<br><br>Why is this? Well, logs are most often stored as strings within Elasticsearch. And until now, strings could be stored in Elasticsearch as either “text” or “keywords.” Borrowing from our recent blog on how to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/find-strings-within-strings-faster-with-the-new-elasticsearch-wildcard-field\">find strings within strings faster with the new wildcard field</a>:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><strong>Text</strong> fields “<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/analysis-tokenizers.html\">tokenize</a>” strings into multiple tokens, each typically representing words. Users looking for <em>quick foxes</em> can therefore match articles talking about a <em>quick brown fox</em>.<br><br><strong>Keyword</strong> fields tend to be used for shorter, structured content like a country code which would be indexed without analysis as a single token. These can then be used by analysts to, for example, visualize popular holiday destinations using aggregations.<br><br>Without an explicit mapping choice by users, Elasticsearch’s default index template assumes that string values presented in JSON documents should be indexed as both a <strong>text</strong> field <u>and</u> a <strong>keyword</strong> field. The intention is that Elasticsearch should work if the string represents prose that should be chopped into multiple word tokens for search or if it represents a single structured value (like the city name “New York”) that should be displayed as one item when displayed in a “top travel destinations” bar chart.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, the limitations to finding things within log files soon becomes apparent. When storing log files as <strong>text</strong>, unlike English text such as “<em>quick brown fox</em>,” we have no clue where words begin or end in typical log messages. This makes it very difficult to construct effective queries, even for experienced users. On the other end of the spectrum, when storing log messages as a single <strong>keyword</strong>, searches for substrings can be particularly slow and the field itself is limited to a default of 256 characters (and only 32K should you attempt to adjust the default value).<br><br>Enter the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/wildcard.html\">wildcard data type</a>.<br><br>This new data type makes searching for partial strings much more efficient. Using a combination of an n-gram index and some new structures that we introduced into <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/celebrating-lucene\">Lucene</a>, we can offer faster regexp and wildcard queries over compressed data.<br><br>Designed to dramatically reduce the time it takes to find what you’re searching for when using regular expressions or the wildcard operator, we anticipate the wildcard data type will be especially useful for security analysts using our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/siem\">SIEM</a> offering as they hunt for threats.</p><h3>Introducing Event Query Language (EQL) in Elasticsearch</h3><p>At Elastic, we've had requests for many years to introduce a correlation query language to support threat hunting and threat detection use cases. When we joined forces with Endgame late last year, we adopted their <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-event-query-language\">Event Query Language (EQL)</a> — a powerful, battle-tested language designed for this exact purpose. It has been running efficiently on endpoints blocking threats in Endgame solutions for years.<br><br>In 7.9, we're excited to release our first public preview of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/eql.html\">EQL</a>, an experimental feature, as a first-class query language in Elasticsearch. We're releasing it today as an API in Elasticsearch, and we have plans to incorporate a robust UI for EQL in Elastic Security and Kibana in the future. Here’s an example of what EQL can do for you:</p><pre>GET /sec_logs/_eql/search\n{\n \"query\": \"\"\"\n  sequence by process.pid with maxspan=1h\n   [ process where process.name == \"regsvr32.exe\" ]\n   [ file where stringContains(file.name, \"scrobj.dll\") ]\n  until [ process where event.type == \"termination\" ]\n \"\"\"\n}</pre><p>This EQL query finds any processes that ran <em>regsvr32.exe</em> and later loaded a file named <em>scrobj.dll</em> within the same hour.</p><p>We'd love your feedback and welcome your creativity, because while EQL was designed for security, we expect it will open many new ways to use Elasticsearch.</p><h2>Unleash even more aggregations on your data</h2><p>For those who might be new to Elasticsearch: <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/getting-started-aggregations.html\">Elasticsearch aggregations</a> enable you to easily extract metadata from your search results and, as a core part of the Elastic Stack’s foundational infrastructure, add value to each of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/\">our solutions</a>.<br></p><p>With the release of Elasticsearch 7.9, we’ve added four new aggregations to the party. These new aggregations are particularly well-suited for security and observability use cases.</p><h3>Variable width histogram</h3><p>Sometimes the easiest way to present data in a histogram diagram is to define the number of buckets, and have their boundaries defined by the data distribution. To that end we worked with James Dorfman (a community member) to merge his <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/42035#pullrequestreview-431597204\">contribution to the Elasticsearch code base</a>. At the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-bucket-variablewidthhistogram-aggregation.html\">variable width histogram</a>&#160;lies a clustering algorithm, which merges values into shard local clusters of buckets and then performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering on the coordinating node to reduce the shard local results to a single histogram.&#160;Put simply, this new aggregation allows for dynamic clustering of the data with a single pass.</p><h3>Histogram aggregation on histogram data type</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-8-0-released\">7.8</a> we introduced the sum, value_count, and avg aggregations for the histogram data type. Histograms and aggregations on histograms are super useful for APM. And sometimes users are interested in running a histogram aggregation across a histogram field (i.e., representing the histogram values from multiple documents in a single histogram). To this end, with the release of Elasticsearch 7.9, we have enabled running a <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html\">histogram aggregation</a> on <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/histogram.html#:~:text=Histogram%20data%20typeedit,the%20buckets%20for%20the%20histogram.\">histogram data type</a>.</p><h3>Normalize aggregation</h3><p>Also new with 7.9 — the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-normalize-aggregation.html\">normalize aggregation</a>. The normalize aggregation provides six methods for normalizing numeric data, enabling you to more easily rescale your data. For example, you may want all the data to be within [0,1]&nbsp;for presentation purposes, while retaining the sorting order and relative distance to the minimum and maximum, and the rescale_0_1 method would provide that using the formula&#160;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-22a65956-7fff-9e0d-9474-2f472231fdb6\"> </span>x' = (x - x<sub>min</sub>) / (x<sub>max</sub> - x<sub>min</sub>). Note that the new normalize aggregation is a parent pipeline aggregation (i.e., it was designed to take the output of another aggregation as its input and thren normalize it). </p><h3>Moving percentiles aggregation</h3><p>In recent releases we made quite a few enhancements geared towards easier analysis of time series data, which is useful for a lot of our customers that use Elasticsearch for security and observability. In 7.9 we are adding the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation\">moving percentiles aggregation</a>, which allows you to calculate cumulative percentiles by sliding a window over a sorted series of percentiles. This aggregation is very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation\">moving function aggregation</a>, but is performed over percentiles.</p><h3>Additional optimizations and enhancements</h3><p>Last, but (certainly) not least, in aggregation news: we’ve made several improvements to aggregation performance and memory consumption. We’ve also refined the way we monitor the memory an aggregation consumes during operation. Beyond the obvious speed and resource consumption benefits, this also allowed us to increase the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-settings.html#search-settings-max-buckets\">search.max_buckets</a> limit default from 10,000 to 65,535. The result is that this “soft threshold” will very rarely be activated, and while one may be excused for thinking this is just a default, it was a default that was changeable only by Elasticsearch admins and frequently remained set to 10,000 because it was a required protection. This is an important scalability improvement to all aggregations that rely on buckets (which, in practice, means the vast majority of aggregations in the real world).</p><h2></h2><h2>Machine Learning</h2><p>As a part of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-6-0-released#machine\">closing the loop on an end-to-end machine learning pipeline</a> within Elasticsearch we introduced a new <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/inference-processor.html\">inference processor</a>\n that enabled you to make predictions using your regression or \nclassification models in an ingest pipeline. Now, with the release of \nElasticsearch 7.9, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/7.9/ml-inference.html\">inference</a> is even more flexible!<br><br>Starting\n today, you can now reference a pre-trained data frame analytics model \nin pipeline aggregations (to infer on the result field of the parent \nbucket aggregation) with the inference bucket aggregation. This new \naggregation uses a model on aggregation results to provide a prediction \nand enables you to run classification or regression analysis at search \ntime. Put simply, if you want to perform analysis on a small set of \ndata, you can now generate predictions with the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-inference-bucket-aggregation.html\">inference bucket aggregation</a> without having to set up a processor in the ingest pipeline.</p><h2>Meet the Tableau Connector</h2><p>Finally, let’s talk about Tableau. Before today, data stored in Elasticsearch was not directly available to Tableau users. In order for this data to be incorporated into existing <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/\">Tableau</a> assets, it had to first be replicated to a relational database (such as MySQL or SQL Server).</p><p>We’re pleased to announce that this indirect process has officially gone the way of the dinosaurs. We’re introducing the <a href=\"https://extensiongallery.tableau.com/connectors/180\">Tableau Connector for Elasticsearch</a>. The Tableau Connector provides direct, real-time access to Elasticsearch data from Tableau Server and Tableau Desktop. It eliminates the need for expensive and error-prone ETL and enables Tableau users to gain insight and value from data stored in Elasticsearch.

To get the full feature rundown, dive into the individual solution and product blog posts, but for now, let’s dig in.<br> </br></p> \n<h2>Introducing a new free way to get started with Workplace Search, part of Elastic Enterprise Search</h2> \n<h3>Welcoming features of Workplace Search to our&nbsp;free distribution tier</h3> \n<p>Following the general availability of Workplace Search in 7.7 and its subsequent availability in Elastic Cloud, features of Workplace Search are&nbsp;now available as part of the Basic free distribution tier. Get started on boosting your team’s productivity by unifying all your content platforms like Google Drive, Gmail, Salesforce, SharePoint, Jira, and more into a personalized search experience for your organization. This free tier&nbsp;includes connectors for all supported content sources, access to the custom API for creating your own connectors, group and user management features, and tools for building modern search user experiences. </p> \n<p>Workplace Search is available for free, with additional features available with Platinum or Enterprise subscriptions. Workplace Search can be used on Elastic Cloud or can be deployed as a self-managed option on your own infrastructure with the Elastic Stack. </p> \n<h3>Viewing Elastic Enterprise Search through Kibana</h3> \n<p>As the window into the Elastic Stack, Kibana allows users to take data from any source, in any format, and search, analyze, and visualize that data in real time. Elastic Enterprise Search is now available in Kibana to provide users with easy navigation to App Search and Workplace Search from a familiar starting point. With this release, Kibana admins can customize spaces to show or hide Elastic Enterprise Search in the main navigation menu. In this release, App Search users can access all their engines and meta engines from Kibana, while Workplace Search users can access user management and content source synchronization tooling. </p> \n<h3>Supercharging email searching capabilities with Gmail support in Workplace Search</h3> \n<p>Email is the central hub of business communication, and a huge proportion of our daily insights gets siloed into email archives over time. With 7.9, Workplace Search supports Gmail as a connector. Each individual Gmail user can easily use the clean, intuitive Workplace Search user interface to search within their own email and see results right alongside all their other content sources. </p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt92151efa7e2f7735/5f2b35d5d9a24d7c67e4f376/Enterprise_Search_7.9_Gmail_connector.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt92151efa7e2f7735\" alt=\"Enterprise_Search_7.9_Gmail_connector.jpg\" style=\"width: 705px; height: 612px;\" width=\"705\" height=\"612\"><br> </br></img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Workplace Search support for Gmail as a connector in Elastic Enterprise Search 7.9 \n</figcaption> \n<h3>Giving more control and automation over scaling your deployments, plus new insight from source activity logs</h3> \n<p>Because Elastic Enterprise Search is built on the Elastic Stack, powerful features can be pulled into App Search and Workplace Search based on user needs. In 7.9, App Search and Workplace Search inherit index lifecycle management (ILM) policies from the Elastic Stack. Users can configure ILM policies to automatically manage indexes (engines) according to user requirements. Examples include: creating a new index once it reaches a predefined size; creating or archiving an index each day, week, or month; and deleting indices based on data retention rules. Create and manage ILM policies directly inside App Search. </p> \n<p>Get a scoop on all of the new Elastic Enterprise Search features in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-enterprise-search-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-kibana-access\">Elastic Enterprise Search 7.9 blog</a>.&nbsp; </p> \n<h2>Delivering a single unified agent with one-click data ingestion</h2> \n<h3>Ingesting data for observability gets a lot simpler with Elastic Agent and Ingest Manager</h3> \n<p>Onboarding data is a critical — and often time-consuming and tedious — step in observability workflows. How quickly can we go from deciding to monitor a system to actually monitoring the system? How easy is it to instrument the system? Is the collected data parsed and structured to be usable? How quickly can we visualize and glean key insights from the data? Now multiply this by the thousands of components in your technology stack — servers, VMs, containers, applications, databases, middleware, etc. — and the operational aspects become critical.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>We are excited to introduce a dramatically simplified data onboarding and ingest management workflow with the launch of several new ingest capabilities in 7.9. Our goal with this initiative is to streamline the entire ingest process so that operators can spend more time acting on insights and less time setting and managing their ingest process. The Elastic Agent, in beta in 7.9, is a single, unified way to collect all kinds of data from a host, including logs, metrics, and endpoint security data, with plans to expand to APM and other data types in the future. Having a single agent to install, configure, update, and maintain is a huge efficiency boost for operators. Ingest Manager, which is also in beta in 7.9, controls all aspects of your ingest universe from a central place. Add and manage integrations for popular services and platforms: we plan to port all 100+ Beats modules over the next few releases. Finally, you can centrally manage all your agents with Fleet — the control tower for all deployed agents. A typical enterprise will usually have agents deployed on tens of thousands of hosts, and Fleet makes it easy for operators to manage this spread from a single place.&nbsp; </p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt14a7b1c489c7b329/5f318d4b48bdc47f3f1e6dc0/7.9-agent-ingest.gif\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt14a7b1c489c7b329\" alt=\"7.9-agent-ingest.gif\" style=\"width: 759px; height: 427px;\" width=\"759\" height=\"427\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Simplified data ingest with Elastic Agent and Ingest Manager in Elastic 7.9\n</figcaption> \n<h3>Enhancing analyst experience with a unified observability overview page</h3> \n<p>Unification of the three data pillars of observability — logs, metrics, and traces — at the data layer is one of the features that sets Elastic Observability apart. Having all the data in a single datastore is essential to supporting investigative workflows that seamlessly move between data streams to speed mean time to resolution.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>Building on this unified data foundation, we are excited to extend unification to the visualization layer with the launch of a new observability overview page in Kibana. The overview page bubbles up key information across all your observability data — logs, metrics, APM, uptime — and presents a curated at-a-glance view of the health of your entire ecosystem. This out-of-the-box view helps you get to insights faster — especially for new users or new deployments. The overview page includes a newsfeed that keeps you informed of product updates and news.&nbsp; </p> \n<h3>Embracing open standards with OpenTelemetry integration in Elastic APM&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>From open code to open community, Elastic is built on openness and transparency. That mindset extends to our support for open standards in the observability space, such as OpenTracing, Jaeger, and W3C Trace-Context. We are happy to add the recently formed OpenTelemetry standard to that list. OpenTelemetry is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project, currently in beta, that provides vendor-neutral, language-specific agents, SDKs, and APIs to collect distributed traces, metrics, and log data from monitored applications. We have added the Elastic APM exporter (and contributed it to the OpenTelemetry collector contrib repo), which takes the trace data collected using the OpenTelemetry collector, translates it to Elastic-compatible protocol, and sends it to Elastic APM. This means that you can start exploring your OpenTelemetry using Elastic APM without any changes to your instrumentation. Just add the Elastic exporter, currently in beta, into your OpenTelemetry setup and start exploring your data in minutes.&nbsp; </p> \n<h3>Strengthening ties between DevOps and SecOps with 50+ turnkey detection rules&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>While you observe, why not protect? Logs, metrics, and traces from applications and infrastructure collected by observability teams are a rich source of information for security teams. The benefit of having Elastic Security and Elastic Observability sit on top of the same Elasticsearch data is that you can ask different questions of the same data without duplicating it across tools. Elastic caters to the needs of both SecOps and DevOps teams, fostering collaboration. Our unified resource-based pricing means that adding different lenses to the same data doesn’t come at an additional cost.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>In 7.9, we are strengthening the bond between Elastic Security and Elastic Observability even more with the beta launch of over 50 turnkey detection rules that allow both DevOps teams and security analysts to benefit from insights for hundreds of services and systems in minutes — with no extra work or cost. And of course, with the flexible detection engine you are welcome to create additional rules to fit your environment. </p> \n<p>Dive deeper in all the new features in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-observability-7-9-0-unified-agent-kpi-overview-dashboard\">Elastic Observability 7.9 blog</a>.&nbsp; </p> \n<h2>Introducing a free distribution tier of one-click endpoint security, built into Elastic Security</h2> \n<h3>Stopping attacks on your endpoints with integrated malware prevention</h3> \n<p>We are excited to introduce the first major milestone in delivering comprehensive, integrated endpoint security — free anti-malware capabilities (beta), built directly into Elastic Security, furthering our mission to help secure organizations around the world. Elastic blocks malware from Windows and macOS hosts with signatureless methods recently validated by AV-Comparatives, and detects threats with MITRE ATT&amp;CK®-aligned rules for Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts. </p> \n<div class=\"video embed-container\" style=\"height: 319.725px;\"> \n <img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/2nSVxLevWsgFi4BjUcvCHq.jpg\" data-uuid=\"2nSVxLevWsgFi4BjUcvCHq\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" data-autoplay=\"1\" data-loop=\"1\" disable_analytics=\"1\" data-hidden_controls=\"1\" data-muted=\"0\" muted=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\"> </img>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n Visualization of integrated host protection in Elastic Security 7.9 \n</figcaption> \n<h3>Enhancing your cloud security posture</h3> \n<p>Our security research team has added prebuilt protections for monitoring cloud infrastructure and identity and access management technologies. These prebuilt machine learning jobs (GA) and threat detection rules (beta) enable customers to detect attacks against&nbsp;cloud infrastructure and applications&nbsp;and are aligned with the ATT&amp;CK&nbsp;Matrix. </p> \n<h3>Unifying prevention, detection, and response with community-driven workflow enhancements</h3> \n<p>Elastic Security 7.9 delivers several workflow enhancements that equip analysts to efficiently triage, hunt, investigate, and respond to attacks. New built-in investigation guides help analysts understand which questions to ask when opening a specific type of alert, and customizable timeline templates optimize data presentation to enable faster insights. </p> \n<p>An efficient workflow for adding exceptions to detection and endpoint rules helps eliminate overhead associated with minimizing false positives. And a new integration with IBM Resilient streamlines incident response workflows, within the security team and beyond. </p> \n<h3>Simplifying data ingestion with expanded data integrations</h3> \n<p>Version 7.9 introduces support for many new host and cloud data sources, including Microsoft Defender ATP, Windows PowerShell, and Google G Suite. These integrations support security operations, DevSecOps, and other common use cases. We are also introducing support for more than 20 common network and application security technologies. </p> \n<p>Get all the details in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-9-0-free-endpoint-security\">Elastic Security 7.9 blog</a>.&nbsp; </p> \n<h2>Introducing instant page loads in Kibana</h2> \n<h3>Delivering instant page loads in Kibana for faster navigation and more natural workflows&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For more than 18 months, we've been overhauling the engine at the heart of Kibana. In 7.9, we've&nbsp;completed that work and migrated all of Kibana’s underlying architecture. The immediate benefit is a dramatically faster experience when navigating Kibana. Flipping from APM to Dashboard to Maps to SIEM is now an instantaneous experience that helps keep you in the flow — whether you are supporting mission-critical systems, protecting against security threats, or building data analyses. Beyond this improved user experience, the new architecture also means big improvements for the Kibana development community with the ability to produce features faster, with greater efficiency resulting in higher-quality code.&nbsp; </p> \n<h3>Simplifying data ingestion with Elastic Agent</h3> \n<p>Building on the foundation of Beats, lightweight data shippers that help get data into Elasticsearch, we are introducing “one Beat to rule them all,” the new Elastic Agent, which is in beta in 7.9. Instead of installing multiple Beats on a host, users can now install a single Elastic Agent, which brings together the necessary components for metric collection, logging, malware prevention, and more. Better yet, users can centrally manage thousands of agents with a new feature called Fleet. These enhanced capabilities are housed in the new Ingest Manager in Kibana. Whether monitoring cloud infrastructure or configuring thousands of endpoints, we expect these new features to make setup faster and steady state operations easier — and this is only the beginning of our journey. </p> \n<h3>Enhancing search with a new wildcard data type</h3> \n<p>Sometimes you only know half of what you’re searching for. Especially in use cases across observability and security, the wildcard operator delivers more powerful searches. Logs often contain lengthy strings without spaces, and consist of standard repeating sections and changing information (e.g., names, duration, IP addresses, etc.). Enter the wildcard data type. To be able to search such strings efficiently, with high performance and low index size, we split them into three letter tokens and apply the same technique to the query. This method allows us to introduce wildcard and regex support in our searches without compromising performance. Designed to dramatically reduce the time it takes to find what you’re searching for when using the wildcard operator, the wildcard data type will be especially useful for security analysts using our Elastic Security solution as they hunt for threats. </p> \n<h3>Offering a preview of Event Query Language (EQL) in Elasticsearch</h3> \n<p>At Elastic, we've had requests for many years to introduce a correlation query language to support threat hunting and detection security use cases. When we joined forces with Endgame late last year, we inherited the Event Query Language (EQL), a powerful, battle-tested language designed for this purpose. It has been running efficiently on endpoints blocking threats in Endgame solutions for years. In 7.9, we're excited to release our first public preview of EQL, a first-class query language in Elasticsearch, as an experimental feature. We're releasing it today as an API in Elasticsearch, and we have plans to incorporate a robust UI for EQL in Elastic Security and Kibana in the future. We'd love your feedback and your creativity — EQL was designed for security, but we expect it will open many new ways to use Elasticsearch.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>Read about these features and more in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-kibana-7-9-0-new-architecture-instant-page-loads\">Kibana 7.9 blog</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-7-9-0\">Elasticsearch 7.9 blog</a>. </p> \n<h2>Enhancing security on Elastic Cloud with support for AWS PrivateLink</h2> \n<h3>Enhancing security and compliance with AWS PrivateLink support, IP filtering, support for Google credentials, and FedRAMP authorization&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>We have also launched support for AWS PrivateLink, which provides private network connectivity between your AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs) and Elastic Cloud. We have also launched support for IP filtering across public cloud providers, enabling you to specify network access to your Elastic Cloud deployment based on IP addresses, address blocks, or ranges. We have also added support for Google Accounts, so that you can sign up for Elastic Cloud using your existing Google Account credentials. With a couple of clicks, you can use your Google identity to access your Elastic Cloud account instead of maintaining separate credentials.&nbsp; </p> \n<p><img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/ajZ3w3e1k3vnwQF6ACojw2.jpg\" data-uuid=\"ajZ3w3e1k3vnwQF6ACojw2\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" data-autoplay=\"1\" data-loop=\"1\" disable_analytics=\"1\" data-hidden_controls=\"1\" alt=\"Using the Elastic Cloud console to apply private link traffic filter\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\"> </img></p>\n<figcaption>\n Configure a traffic filter: PrivateLink endpoint on Elastic Cloud \n</figcaption> \n<p>In addition, the Elastic Cloud AWS GovCloud US East region is designated authorized for FedRAMP Moderate. Federal, state, and local government users, as well as higher education institutions and users with government data, can <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/federal/cloud\">start a free trial today!</a>&nbsp; </p> \n<h3>Supporting more flexible buying options with self-service monthly premium subscriptions and new regions</h3> \n<p>You can now purchase Gold and Platinum monthly subscriptions directly within the Elastic Cloud console. With just a few clicks, you’ll get access to support SLAs and the exclusive capabilities of the Elastic Stack, including our solutions for enterprise search, observability, and security. We’ve also&nbsp;added more regions across multiple cloud service providers, so you can access Elastic Cloud in more locations, including Canada Central, Paris, and Seoul. Our AWS GovCloud region is also now generally available. </p> \n<h3>Improving service performance with in-place configuration changes and new AWS instance types</h3> \n<p>In-place configuration changes allow for faster and more reliable configuration updates. Their speed and reliability come from applying changes to the cluster (like settings, upgrades, and resizing) in place, which is followed by a rolling restart of nodes — avoiding potentially long-running data migration operations. We have also launched support for Amazon EC2 M5d general purpose and R5d memory-optimized instances in all supported AWS regions on Elastic Cloud. M5d instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, while R5d instances are designed to deliver fast performance when processing large data sets in memory.&nbsp; </p> \n<h3>Supporting new self-managed capabilities with Elastic Cloud Enterprise 2.6 and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes 1.2</h3> \n<p>We are pleased to announce the general availability of Elastic Cloud Enterprise 2.6. Elastic Cloud Enterprise lets customers centrally orchestrate a fleet of Elasticsearch clusters using the same capabilities that Elastic uses to run Elastic Cloud. With the 2.6 release, Elastic Cloud Enterprise adds support for the Elastic Cloud Control (ecctl) CLI, management of the new unified Elastic Enterprise Search including support for our new Workplace Search capabilities, and in-place configuration changes. </p> \n<p>We are also pleased to announce the general availability of Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes 1.2. Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes simplifies setup, upgrades, snapshots, scaling, high availability, security, and more for running Elasticsearch and Kibana in Kubernetes. The new 1.2 version lets you easily deploy and orchestrate Elastic Enterprise Search, allowing you to launch an instance of App Search or Workplace Search and connect it to an Elasticsearch cluster with just a few lines of YAML configuration. The new 1.2 version also lets you take advantage of the new Beats Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to deploy and manage data shippers such as Filebeat, Metricbeat, Auditbeat, and others using ECK.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>To get caught up on all of the Elastic Cloud news, check out the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-cloud-aws-privatelink-fedramp\">What’s New In Elastic Cloud blog</a>. </p> \n<h2>There’s always more...</h2> \n<p>So much more.
