(Nor is it even a properly romantic notion &#8212; even Byron, the (mostly self-appointed) monarch of the Romantics, envisioned in his staggering poem &#8220;Darkness&#8221; how when &#8220;the bright sun was extinguish&#8217;d,&#8221; humanity sought not isolation but community as &#8220;men were gather&#8217;d round their blazing homes / to look once more into each other&#8217;s face.&#8221;) Macdonald&#8217;s own first experience of a total solar eclipse in 1999 &#8212; the same eclipse, though partial, in which I too dissolved as a child in Bulgaria &#8212; was instead a revelation of just how much &#8220;a total eclipse wreaks havoc on your sense of self, on rational individuality&#8221;; how it effects, to borrow Iris Murdoch&#8217;s lovely phrase, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">&#8220;an occasion for unselfing.&#8221;</a></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_55647\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/07/trouvelots-astronomical-drawings/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=680%2C552&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Total eclipse of the sun, observed July 29, 1878, at Creston, Wyoming Territory\" width=\"680\" height=\"552\" class=\"size-full wp-image-55647\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=4885&#38;ssl=1 4885w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=240%2C195&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=320%2C260&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=768%2C624&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=600%2C487&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=2040&#38;ssl=1 2040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Total eclipse of 1878, one of Étienne Léopold Trouvelot&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/07/trouvelots-astronomical-drawings/\">groundbreaking astronomical drawings</a>.

You can gaze at a landscape and see it peopled by things &#8212; trees, clouds, hills and valleys &#8212; which have no voice except the ones you give them in your imagination; none can challenge who you are. So often we see solitary contemplation as simply the correct way to engage with nature. </p>\n<p>But it is always a political act, bringing freedom from the pressures of other minds, other interpretations, other consciousnesses competing with your own. There’s another way of escaping social conflict, of course, and that is to make yourself part of a crowd that sees the world the same way that you do, values the same things as you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With an eye to the &#8220;Great American Eclipse&#8221; of 2017 &#8212; a collective experience qualitatively different from the nationalism-tinted mass pilgrimages to see monuments of territorial pride like the Grand Canyon or spectacles of national triumph like the <em>Apollo</em> launches &#8212; Macdonald adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The millions of tourists who flocked to the total eclipse of 2017 didn’t see something time had fashioned from American rock and earth, nor something wrought of American ingenuity, but a passing shadow cast across the nation from celestial bodies above. Even so, it’s fitting that this total eclipse was dubbed The Great American Eclipse, for the event chimed with the country’s contemporary struggles between matters of reason and unreason, individuality and crowd consciousness, belonging and difference. Of all crowds the most troubling are those whose cohesion is built from fear of and outrage against otherness and difference; they’re entities defining themselves by virtue only of what they are against. The simple fact about an eclipse crowd is that it cannot work in this way, for confronting something like the absolute, all our differences are moot. When you stand and watch the death of the sun and see it reborn there can be no them, only us.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71596\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tendering-totality_framed-print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TenderingTotality_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71596\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TenderingTotality_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TenderingTotality_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C240&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TenderingTotality_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TenderingTotality_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C768&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TenderingTotality_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Tendering Totality&#8221; (2017) by Maria Popova.

Depressingly, the sky was thick with clouds, and as the hours passed it became obvious that none of us would see anything other than darkness when totality came. But when the light dimmed, the atmosphere grew electric, and the crowd became a thing of overwhelming importance, a palpable presence in my mind. I felt a fleeting, urgent concern for the safety of everyone around me as the world rolled, and the moon too, and night slammed down on us. Though I could hardly see a hand held in front of my face, far out across the sea hung clouds tinted the eerie sunset shade of faded photographs of 1950s atomic tests, and beyond them clear blue day. </p>\n<p>And then the revelation came. It wasn’t what I’d expected. It wasn’t focused up there in the sky, but down here with us all, as the crowds that lined the Atlantic shore raised cameras to commemorate totality, and as they flashed, a wave of particulate light crashed along the dark beach and flooded across to the other side of the bay, making the whole coast a glittering field of stars. Each fugitive point of light was a different person. I laughed out loud. I’d wanted a solitary revelation but had been given something else instead: an overwhelming sense of community, and of what it is made &#8212; a host of individual lights shining briefly against oncoming darkness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A generation earlier, as <em>Apollo 8</em> was launching into space to take the epoch-making <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/24/earthrise/\"><em>Earthrise</em></a> photograph that would soon awaken our species to its ecological responsibility, the Italian chemist and Holocaust survivor Primo Levi captured this singular gravitational pull of community around a shared cosmic enchantment as he contemplated <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/02/primo-levi-mirror-maker-science-space/\">how science and space exploration bind a fractured humanity back together</a> by breaking our trance of separateness. This trance plays out in myriad ways and on myriad scales across our individual and collective existence. The habitual narrowing of perspective from which it arises is not a defect but a defining feature of our consciousness &#8212; the human animal&#8217;s central coping mechanism for parsing the incomprehensibly vast world beyond the boundaries of our individual experience. <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/01/figuring/\">(We spend our lives trying to discern where we end and the rest of the world begins.)</a>. This narrowing extends most perhaps most perniciously to our perspective on and perception of time, which is our perception of change. Drawing on another eclipse she witnessed with friends on the Turkish coast, Macdonald writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It takes a long while between first and second contact &#8212; that is, when the sun is completely covered by the moon; it’s a long, steady diminution in the amount of light reaching the world. For a long while my brain tricks me. It has a vested interest in reassurance: <em>Nothing is wrong</em>, it says. It tells me I must be wearing reactive sunglasses, which is why I’m seeing the world changing through tinted glass. Why everything, the luggage-strap leaves of dune grass under my toes, the broken walls, bay trees, the sea in front, the mountains behind, everything’s still darkly fine. Then I remember I’m not wearing sunglasses, which hits me with the bad-dream force of an arm brought down hard across a piano keyboard, the psychological equivalent of that discordant crash as I have a fraught little struggle with my brain. Then I shiver. Surely it was absurdly hot here an hour ago? There’s a horrible old chestnut about boiling a frog to death. Put a frog in a pan of cold water and put it on the stove, and apparently the blithe amphibian will fail to notice the incremental rise in temperature until it’s dead. There’s something of that story’s creeping dread in what is now going on. I feel a strong need to warn people, to somehow jump out of the pan. Everything is changing, but our brains aren’t equipped to notice things on this scale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I read Macdonald’s essay, I am struck by something else &#8212; something both entirely unrelated and entirely relevant. (That, of course, is what an excellent essay is supposed to do &#8212; explode your comprehension with a fractal burst of quickenings fanning out to myriad elsewheres.) We have been regarding the environmental collapse around us &#8212; a drama not cosmic but human-made, not sublime but catastrophic &#8212; with the same insentience to incremental change, lulled by the brain&#8217;s same incapacity for noticing large-scale events, by the same <em>nothing is wrong</em> self-protective delusion. We are the amphibian in the seething cauldron. But we are also larger and more luminous, better capable of transcending the limitations of our minds by the force of our spirit &#8212; that, at least, is my hope. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71597\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/casting-crescents_framed-print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71597\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1495&#38;ssl=1 1495w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C240&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C768&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CastingCrescents_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Casting Crescents&#8221; (2017) by Maria Popova.

Where I expect to see sun-dappled shadow cast on the sand through branches &#8212; as confidently as I expect any other unacknowledged constant of the world &#8212; I am confounded: amid the shade are a perfect host of tiny crescents, hundreds of them, all moving against the sand as a wind that has come out of nowhere pushes at branches.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Out of that noticing &#8212; that sudden wakefulness to the absolute strangeness of it all, the soul&#8217;s sudden cry of <em>Everything is wrong</em> over the brain&#8217;s lulling deception &#8212; arises a profound, humbling awareness of one&#8217;s own existence as both inseparable from and inconsequential to a larger cosmic inter-belonging with all other existences: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The backs of the swallows tracing their sinuous hunting flights over the ruins are no longer iridescent blue in the sun, but a deep indigo. They’re calling in alarm. A sparrowhawk is flying over, slipping down the sky, losing height, stymied in its search for thermals to soar upon. They’re all disappearing in the rapidly cooling air. The hawk shrugs its way north-west, falling all the while. I check the sun, again, through my eclipse glasses. All that is left of it now is a bare, fingernail curve of light. The landscape is insistently alien: short, midday shadows in a saturated world. The land is orange. The sea is purple. Venus has appeared in the sky, quite high, up to the right. And then, with a chorus of cheers and whistles and applause, I stare at the sky as the sun slides away, and the day does too, and impossibly, impossibly, above us is a stretch of black, soft black sky and a hole in the middle of it. A round hole, darker than anything you’ve ever seen, fringed with an intensely soft ring of white fire. Applause crackles and ripples across the dunes. My throat is stopped. My eyes fill with tears. Goodbye, intellectual apprehension. Hello, something else entirely. Totality is so incomprehensible for your mental machinery that your physical response becomes hugely apparent. Your intellect cannot grasp any of this. Not the dark, nor the sunset clouds on every horizon, nor the stars, just that extraordinary wrongness, up there, that pulls the eyes towards it. The exhilaration is barely contained terror. I’m tiny and huge all at once, as lonely and singular as I’ve ever felt, and as merged and part of a crowd as it is possible to be. It is a shared, intensely private experience. But there are no human words fit to express all this. Opposites? Yes! Let’s conjure big binary oppositions and grand narratives, break everything and mend it at the same moment. Sun and moon. Darkness and light. Sea and land, breath and no breath, life, death. A total eclipse makes history laughable, makes you feel both precious and disposable, makes the inclinations of the world incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>And then something else happens, a thing that still makes my heart rise in my chest and eyes blur, even in recollection. For it turns out there’s something even more affecting than watching the sun disappear into a hole. Watching the sun climb out of it. Here I am, sitting on the beach in the underworld, with all of the standing dead. It is cold, and a loose wind blows through the darkness. But then, from the lower edge of the blank, black disc of the dead sun, bursts a perfect point of brilliance. It leaps and burns. It’s unthinkably fierce, unbearably bright, something (I blush to say it, but here it comes) like a word. And thus begins the world again. Instantly. Joy, relief, gratitude; an avalanche of emotion. Is all made to rights, now? Is all remade? From a bay tree, struck into existence a moment ago, a spectacled bulbul calls a greeting to the new dawn.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement this slender fragment of the transcendent totality that is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vesper-Flights/dp/0802128815/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Vesper Flights</em></strong></a> with Coleridge on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/07/08/coleridge-storm-letter/\">the dissolution of the self in a terrifying storm</a> and Mabel Loomis Todd&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/09/mabel-loomis-todd-total-eclipses-of-the-sun/\">poetic 19th-century primer on the science of eclipses</a>, with help from Emily Dickinson, then revisit Macdonald&#8217;s extraordinary memoir of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/16/h-is-for-hawk/\">what a hawk taught her about love, loss, control, and surrender</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.

And like all that is true of nature, this duality of beauty and terror is also true of the subset of nature comprising our experience &#8212; the subset we call human nature: When happiness comes at us unbidden and elemental, there is almost a terror to its coming &#8212; to the totality of it, to the way it submerges and saturates and supinates us with something vast and uncontrollable and sublime, thrusting us past the limits of our longing. </p>\n<p>This essential battery is what <strong>Mary Oliver</strong> (September 10, 1935&#8211;January 17, 2019) &#8212; a Rilke for our own time: a rare philosopher-poet of immense and tender attentiveness to the living world and to our human interiority &#8212; explores in one of the pieces collected in the 2003 treasure <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Owls-Other-Fantasies-Poems-Essays/dp/0807068756/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Owls and Other Fantasies: Poems and Essays</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/owls-and-other-fantasies-poems-and-essays/oclc/1111861091&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tengmalms-owl-and-pigmy-owl-1893_print?sku=s6-11456624p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?resize=680%2C552&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"552\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68522\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?w=2085&#38;ssl=1 2085w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?resize=240%2C195&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?resize=320%2C260&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?resize=768%2C623&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?resize=600%2C487&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pigmyowl.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Owls from Richard Lydekker&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/29/lydekker-royal-natural-history-owls/\">1893 natural history of owls</a>.

But the scream of the owl, which is not of pain and hopelessness and the fear of being plucked out of the world, but of the sheer rollicking glory of the death-bringer, is more terrible still. When I hear it resounding through the woods, and then the five black pellets of its song dropping like stones into the air, I know I am standing at the edge of the mystery, in which terror is naturally and abundantly part of life, part of even the most becalmed, intelligent, sunny life &#8212; as, for example, my own. The world where the owl is endlessly hungry and endlessly on the hunt is the world in which I live too. There is only one world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In this one world &#8212; a miraculous and irreplaceable world; a world in which, as the poetic scientist and nature writer Loren Eiseley <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/06/22/loren-eiseley-muskrat/\">so memorably observed</a>, &#8220;we forget that nature itself is one vast miracle transcending the reality of night and nothingness&#8230; that each one of us in his personal life repeats that miracle&#8221; &#8212; the bloodthirst in the owl&#8217;s bosom is inseparable from the lifethirst in our own, as beauty and terror are inseparable from one another and from the fulness of being that is life being lived. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69840\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/red-poppy-by-elizabeth-blackwell-from-a-curious-herbal-1737-benefits-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=680%2C986&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"986\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69840\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?w=1429&#38;ssl=1 1429w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=240%2C348&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=320%2C464&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=768%2C1114&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=600%2C870&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Red poppy by the self-taught 18th-century artist and botanist Elizabeth Blackwell from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/29/elizabeth-blackwell-curious-herbal/\">the world&#8217;s first encyclopedia of medicinal plants</a>.

Fields full of flowers &#8212; poppies or lupines. Or, here, fields where the roses hook into the dunes, and their increase is manyfold. All summer they are red and pink and white tents of softness and nectar, which wafts and hangs everywhere &#8212; a sweetness so palpable and excessive that, before it, I’m struck, I’m taken, I’m conquered; I’m washed into it, as though it was a river, full of dreaming and idleness &#8212; I drop to the sand, I can’t move; I am restless no more; I am replete, supine, finished, filled to the last edges with an immobilizing happiness. And is this not also terrible? Is this not also frightening?</p>\n<p>Are the roses not also &#8212; even as the owl is &#8212; excessive? Each flower is small and lovely, but in their sheer and silent abundance the roses become an immutable force, as though the work of the wild roses was to make sure that all of us, who come wandering over the sand, may be, for a while, struck to the heart and saturated with a simple joy. Let the mind be teased by such stretches of the imagination, by such balance. Now I am cringing at the very sound of the owl’s dark wings opening over my head &#8212; not long ago I could do nothing but lounge on the sand and stare into the cities of the roses.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tawny-owl-1893_print?sku=s6-11456629p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?resize=680%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"729\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68531\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?resize=240%2C257&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?resize=320%2C343&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?resize=768%2C823&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?resize=600%2C643&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Owl from Lydekker&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/29/lydekker-royal-natural-history-owls/\">1893 natural history of owls</a>.

I don’t know what I want or how to get it. I act like I know what I want, and I appear to be going after it &#8212; fast, but I don’t, when it comes down to it, even know.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a passage of extraordinary precocity, he echoes the young Van Gogh&#8217;s reflection on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/02/van-gogh-fear-risk/\">fear, taking risks, and how inspired mistakes propel us forward</a>, and considers how <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/16/annenberg-commencement/\">the trap of self-comparison</a> is keeping him from developing his own artistic and human potential: </p>\n<blockquote><p>I guess it’s because I’m afraid. Afraid I’m wrong. And I guess I’m afraid I’m wrong, because I constantly relate myself to other people, other experiences, other ideas. I should be looking at both in perspective, not comparing. I relate my life to an idea or an example that is some entirely different life. I should be relating it to my life only in the sense that each has good and bad facets. Each is separate. The only way the other attained enough merit, making it worthy of my admiration, or long to copy it is by taking chances, taking it in its own way. It has grown with different situations and has discovered different heights of happiness and equal sorrows. If I always seek to pattern my life after another, mine is being wasted re-doing things for my own empty acceptance. But, if I live my life my way and only let the other [artists] influence me as a reference, a starting point, I can build an even higher awareness instead of staying dormant&#8230; I only wish that I could have more confidence and try to forget all my silly preconceptions, misconceptions, and just live. Just live. Just. Live. Just live till I die.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And then &#8212; in a testament to my resolute conviction, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/14/william-blake-john-trusler-letter/\">along with Blake</a>, that all great natures are lovers of trees &#8212; he adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I found a tree in this park that I’m gonna come back to, someday. It stretches sideways out over the St. Croix river and I can sit on it and balance lying on it perfectly.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_70184\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giant_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C907&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"907\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70184\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giant_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giant_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C320&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giant_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C427&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giant_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giant_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Perspective&#8221; by Maria Popova</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Within a decade, Haring&#8217;s resolve to &#8220;just live&#8221; until he dies collided with the sudden proximity of a highly probable death &#8212; the spacious <em>until</em> contracted into a span uncertain but almost certainly short as the AIDS epidemic began slaying his generation. A century after the uncommonly perceptive and poetic diarist Alice James &#8212; William and Henry James&#8217;s brilliant and sidelined sister &#8212; wrote upon receiving a terminal diagnosis that the remaining stretch of life before her is <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/07/diary-of-alice-james-death/\">&#8220;the most supremely interesting moment in life, the only one in fact when living seems life,&#8221;</a> Haring, having taken a long break from his own diary, returns to the mirror of the blank page and faces the powerful, paradoxical way in which the proximity of death charges living with life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I keep thinking that the main reason I am writing is fear of death. I think I finally realize the importance of being alive. When I was watching the 4th of July fireworks the other night and saw my friend Martin [Burgoyne], I saw death. He says he has been tested and cleared of having AIDS, but when I looked at him I saw death. Life is so fragile.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a sentiment evocative of neurologist Oliver Sacks&#8217;s memorable observation <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/30/oliver-sacks-gratitude-death/\">in his poetic and courageous exit from life</a> that when people die, &#8220;they leave holes that cannot be filled, for it is the fate &#8212; the genetic and neural fate &#8212; of every human being to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death,”</a> Haring adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is a very fine line between life and death. I realize I am walking this line. Living in New York City and also flying on airplanes so much, I face the possibility of death every day. And when I die there is nobody to take my place&#8230; That is true of a lot of people (or everyone) because everyone is an individual and everyone is important in that they cannot be replaced.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But even as he shudders with the fragility of life, Haring continues to shimmer with the largehearted love of life that gives his art its timeless exuberance: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Touching people’s lives in a positive way is as close as I can get to an idea of religion. </p>\n<p>Belief in one’s self is only a mirror of belief in other people and every person.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/26/drawing-on-walls-keith-haring/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/drawingonwalls_haring4.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Josh Cochran from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/26/drawing-on-walls-keith-haring/\"><em>Drawing on Walls: A Story of Keith Haring</em></a> by Matthew Burgess</figcaption></figure>\n<p>He returns to the love of life that charged his days with meaning and his art with magnetism &#8212; a love both huge and humble, at the center of which is our eternal dance with mystery:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it is very important to be in love with life. I have met people who are in their 70s and 80s who love life so much that, behind their aged bodies, the numbers disappear. Life is very fragile and always elusive. As soon as we think we “understand,” there is another mystery. I don’t understand anything. That is, I think, the key to understand everything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again and again, Haring declares on the pages of his journal that he lives for work, for art &#8212; the purpose of which, of course, if there is any purpose to art, is to make other lives more livable. As the specter of AIDS hovers closer and closer to him, this creative vitality pulses more and more vigorously through him, reverberating with Albert Camus&#8217;s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/30/albert-camus-travel-lyrical-critical-essays/\">“there is no love of life without despair of life.”</a> </p>\n<p>In early 1988, weeks before his thirtieth birthday and shortly before he finally received the diagnosis perching on the event horizon of his daily life, Haring composes a seething cauldron of a journal entry, about to boil with the overwhelming totality of his love of life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I love paintings too much, love color too much, love seeing too much, love feeling too much, love art too much, love too much.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By the following month, he has metabolized the terrifying too-muchness into a calm acceptance radiating even more love:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I accept my fate, I accept my life. I accept my shortcomings, I accept the struggle. I accept my inability to understand. I accept what I will never become and what I will never have. I accept death and I accept life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the sudden death of one of his closest friends in a crash &#8212; a friend so close that Haring was the godfather of his son &#8212; he copies one of his friend&#8217;s newly poignant poems about life and death into his journal, then writes beneath it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Creativity, biological or otherwise, is my only link with a relative mortality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But perhaps his most poignant and prophetic entry came a decade earlier &#8212; a short verse-like reflection nested in a sprawling meditation on art, life, kinship, and individuality, penned on Election Day:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am not a beginning.<br />\nI am not an end.<br />\nI am a link in a chain.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Keith Haring died on February 16, 1990, barely into his thirties, leaving us his exuberant love of life encoded in mirthful lines and vibrant colors that have made millions of other lives &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/26/drawing-on-walls-keith-haring/\">mine included</a> &#8212; immensely more livable.</p>\n<p>Couple with <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/26/drawing-on-walls-keith-haring/\"><em>Drawing on Walls</em></a> &#8212; a wonderful picture-book biography of Haring inspired by his journals &#8212; then revisit a young neurosurgeon&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/13/when-breath-becomes-paul-kalanithi/\">poignant meditation on the meaning of life</a> as he faces his own death, an elderly comedian-philosopher on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/24/emily-levine-ted-reality/\">how to live fully while dying</a>, and an astronomer-poet&#8217;s sublime <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/04/10/antidotes-to-fear-of-death-rebecca-elson/\">&#8220;Antidotes to Fear of Death.&#8221;</a></p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.
