And neither is this one. These are hand-painted billboards on the walls of New York City.</p><p><strong>Nicole Greco-Lucchina:</strong> It looks like you can drink the beer off the wall, eat the sandwich off the wall.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Brooklyn-based Colossal Media creates these photo-realistic murals as ads for major brands like Google, Nike, and Coca-Cola. And they can cost up to $150,000. We got a look inside Colossal's colorful workshop to see how painters bring these once bygone masterpieces to life.</p><p>Large-scale billboards first popped up in the 1830s. The tough painters that hung from buildings through all kinds of weather were affectionately nicknamed wall dogs. Their heyday came in the 1920s, when hand-painted ads for everything from Coca-Cola to cold medicines dotted the walls of New York City. By the mid-1900s, the industry started drying up. First, electric signs took over in popularity.</p><p>Then, the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 heavily regulated hand-painted billboards. Despite the artistry of the wall dogs' work, their walls weren't considered art; they were advertisements. And as such, the walls were subject to these new regulations. Around the same time, faster vinyl-printed billboards began replacing time-consuming hand-painted ones. Wall dogs and their walls were obsolete.</p><p>But a handful of niche artists quietly kept the craft alive. Until 2004, when best friends and street-sign artists Paul Lindahl and Adrian Moeller started Colossal Media. With a team of 31 artists, Colossal ushered in a mainstream comeback for hand-painted murals. And big brands took notice.</p><p>It all starts here, at this Brooklyn workshop, which is basically a work of art itself. First, Colossal's in-house creative studio works with a brand to come up with the artwork. Graphic designers will drop that finalized artwork into Photoshop and break it down into layers based on color, form, and value changes.</p><p><strong>Greco-Lucchina:</strong> When we're done breaking that down, we drop it into a template, which scales it to the size of the wall. It's gridded into 4-by-8-foot boxes for however big the wall is.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> A laminated version of the gridded image becomes the road map for the whole project. First, the road map heads downstairs. The color mixers blend a rainbow of paint shades to try and match the colors on the road map. Sometimes they get a match pretty quickly. Other times, it takes a lot of patience and a lot of paint. Nicole estimates the artists go through about 50,000 gallons of paint a year.</p><p><strong>Greco-Lucchina:</strong> This is the mixing room. It has a green-roof ceiling, and that is so they're mixing as true to daylight as possible.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> But even if they have the perfect paint, how do these artists transfer an image from a computer to a wall? The secret lies here, in the dark room. Artists unfurl a massive roll of paper and project a wall-sized version of the road map on it. In a process known as burning, artists transfer the projection onto the paper using an electro-pounce machine.</p><p><strong>Greco-Lucchina:</strong> You're essentially tracing, and as you're tracing, it's burning a bunch of tiny holes into the paper, which we call the patterns.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> They're left with a giant outline of the image in tiny burned-in holes. This is the key to producing those photo-realistic murals.</p><p><strong>Greco-Lucchina:</strong> When the guys get out to the wall, they unroll that paper in sequence, and in a process called pouncing, which essentially is like charcoal powder in a rag, they hit it in those places that we burned on the pattern, and the charcoal transfers through those tiny holes on the wall, and that's how the image gets transferred to scale on the wall with the details that we broke down.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The artists will draw over that powered tracing with a marker or pencil. They now have a detailed outline of the image on the wall.</p><p><strong>Greco-Lucchina:</strong> From there, between the road map, what they have pounced on the wall, they're ready to go.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Where they start painting is up to the artists. Usually, newer artists take larger areas, while expert painters take on details, like hands and eyes. Painting usually takes four to five days, but bigger walls sometimes mean up to 12-hour days on 10-day assignments. And the painters work through any kind of weather: rain, heat waves, and even polar vortexes. It's a tough spirit that finds its roots with wall dogs of the '20s.</p><p><strong>Ian Potter:</strong> To be a true wall dog, you need to be able to do all of that. So, the rigging, the construction side of it, the painting side, the breakdown, all of that physical labor, plus you gotta be a pretty d--- good artist to paint all of that, as well.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> With how much planning and detail goes into each wall, it's no surprise these ads can cost a lot. Colossal's walls tend to range from $35,000 to $150,000, depending on the size. Even with a steep price tag and lengthy turnarounds, big brands don't seem to mind waiting. Today, Colossal paints over 500 murals a year in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, LA, and, of course, New York City.</p><p><strong>Rina Kim:</strong> It's definitely becoming more of an experience rather than you just passing by a flat billboard. Our painters who are working on-site are catching the eyes of any passersby, people who drive by, and then they share it on social media and create a new level of interaction within advertising.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> But ever since the heavy regulation of wall dogs and their walls first came down, one question has circled the industry: Are these advertisements art?</p><p><strong>Potter:</strong> The fact that it's advertisements, I mean, yes, we're trying to replicate what somebody else gave us, but we're doing it in our own way. I, quite frankly, think you have to be a tradesman and a craftsman to do this correctly, but you also have to be an artist to do it.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> And a highly skilled one at that, considering just how realistic they look.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published in November 2019.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-colossal-media-makes-150000-hyperrealistic-murals-in-nyc-2019-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5To8QkxjVfA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 21:20:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5dd6e3affd9db203194a8e37?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"489be579c5893e77754f53ba3c2a7080","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/15/08-29-30-885_504bb9c728ecee33.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":211892,"destBytes":211892,"author":"insider@insider.com (Abby Narishkin,Steve Cameron)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_2/2020/11/15/08-29-39-482_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_4/2020/11/15/08-29-30-874_618154ecc4880b4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_4/2020/11/15/08-29-33-333_26d903be97fb7dae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/15/08-29-25-135_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5To8QkxjVfA:2vsZhiZDg5g:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/08-29-38-890_af54a654ba866101.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5To8QkxjVfA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_6/2020/11/15/08-29-25-604_38203bccc32f280b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605428959661},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 16:29:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 16:29:19","title":"Fox host Lou Dobbs calls on GOP to help Trump secure a second term that's 'rightfully his' despite the failed lawsuits and insufficient electoral votes that say otherwise","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/lou-dobbs-fox-donald-trump-second-term-claim-election-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb033be1c741f0019ac9dad?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Lou-Dobbs-3\" height=\"3875\" width=\"5166\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Fox Business host Lou Dobbs.\n<p class=\"copyright\">John Lamparski/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Fox Business host Lou Dobbs on Friday backed up President Donald Trump's claims that the 2020 election was unfair, insisting that accurate election results are \"being denied to him.\"</li>\n<li>In an interview with Rep.

on Friday</a> that replaces a President George W. Bush-era test that's been used for the last 12 years. It's the final hurdle to naturalization before America's immigrants receive their decision from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services and take the Oath of Allegiance in a naturalization ceremony.&#160;</p><p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Read more</em></strong><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">:&#160;</em><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-burrowing-administration-biden-government-employees-agencies-deep-state-2020-11?r=tp-sub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-burrowing-administration-biden-government-employees-agencies-deep-state-2020-11?r=oo-kush\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">EXCLUSIVE: Documents reveal Trump is building his own 'deep state' by leaving political appointees behind in government for the Biden administration</a></em>&#160;</p><p>The USCIS began revising the test in 2019 in an effort to refresh it every 10 years. The last time it was updated was in 2008 during Bush's presidency, leaving the Obama administration with no pressing need to touch the test during its tenure. With the 10-year mark coming in 2018, it fell squarely in the Trump administration's purview.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/the-2020-version-of-the-civics-test/128-civics-questions-and-answers-2020-version\">Basic civics questions</a> remain the same including \"how many U.S. senators are there?\" and \"how many amendments does the U.S. Constitution have?\" but the wording for some is more complex. Applicants are asked to \"name two important ideas from the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution\" instead of \"what are two rights in the Declaration of Independence?\"&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/questions-and-answers/100q.pdf\">In the former test</a>, the applicant need only say a combination of terms in the famous phrase: \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Correct answers to the new test, however, include more specifics terms such as \"equality,\" \"social contract,\" \"natural rights,\" \"limited government,\" and \"self-government.\"</p><p>The term \"citizen\" also replaces \"people\" when it comes to representation in some questions, as the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/new-us-citizenship-test-trump/2020/11/13/2029723e-25e9-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html\">Washington Post</a> noted. When asked, \"who does a member of the House of Representatives represent?\" or \"who does a U.S. senator represent?\" the correct answer must include citizens and not people.</p><p>For US representatives, the right answers would be \"citizens in their (congressional) district\" and \"citizens in their district,\" while for senators, the right answer would be \"citizens of their state.\"</p><p>In the previous test, the term citizen is typically used when discussing explicit rights not given to non-citizens, such as the right to vote. And when asked \"who does a U.S. Senator represent?\" in the previous test, the correct answer would be: \"all people of the state.\"</p><p>The idea of using the term \"citizens\" instead of \"people\" was a staple of the Trump presidency, especially as it came to the census and representation. The president fought to have the US Census Bureau ask respondents their citizenship status but <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-citizenship-census/\">dropped the question following legal battles</a>.&#160;</p><p>The soon-to-be Americans can also put their maps away as geography will be removed entirely from the test. Former geography questions were typically lay-ups that included \"what ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?\" and \"what is the capital of the United States?\" The answers to those are the Pacific Ocean and Washington, DC, respectively.&#160;</p><p>Changes are also coming to the testing procedure and scoring. Instead of correctly answering only six questions, candidates must correctly answer 12 and must answer the full 20 instead of stopping once they've reached the passing mark, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/new-us-citizenship-test-trump/2020/11/13/2029723e-25e9-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html\">Washington Post</a>.</p><p>And that's after studying from a list of 128 potential questions, an increase of 28 from the 2008 study guide. The threshold to pass remains the same at 60%.</p><p>Applicants of advanced age, 65 years or older, or those with 20 years of permanent residency in the US need only answer six correctly out of 10 instead of 20. Those applicants will also have the number of questions they're required to study reduced to 20.</p><p>Luckily, applicants can view the test and its answers before they take it. Both the new 2020 and former 2008 versions are available on the <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/the-2020-version-of-the-civics-test/128-civics-questions-and-answers-2020-version\">USCIS website</a>.&#160;</p><p>But advocates fear that the test changes will make it harder to become a US citizen and increase wait times to become a citizen, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/new-us-citizenship-test-trump/2020/11/13/2029723e-25e9-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html\">Washington Post</a>. The process to become a US citizen can already take upwards of <a href=\"https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/\">two years once you've met the requirements</a>, and that doesn't include the potentially years-long process of getting permanent residency just to begin living and working in the country.</p><p>Those already scheduled to take the test won't need to brush up on the new lingo and study guides just yet, however. Citizenship applicants with a filing date later than December 1, 2020, will receive the 2020 test while existing applicants will be administered the 2008 test.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-admin-rolls-out-new-lengthier-citizenship-exam-for-immigrants-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/0Q6gDQnT8D4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 21:01:19 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fb01e4c402d49001924eff4?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"86bd08cc4e8285a3501400932c70e860","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/15/08-29-19-990_88f52dc9da0e3421.webp","destWidth":2141,"destHeight":1606,"sourceBytes":303372,"destBytes":303372,"author":"tpallini@businessinsider.com (Thomas Pallini)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fb01e4c402d49001924eff4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_1/2020/11/15/08-29-19-990_88f52dc9da0e3421.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_2/2020/11/15/08-29-39-482_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn44@2020_2/2020/11/15/08-29-31-404_3e4ab40c6997ec78.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/15/08-29-33-083_4ae6ddd4a3b2ec93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/15/08-29-25-135_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0Q6gDQnT8D4:1wJy572uvAI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_3/2020/11/15/08-29-24-429_007b3955d0e63e6a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/0Q6gDQnT8D4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn39@2020_2/2020/11/15/08-29-24-698_6cadfcf630aa5dc1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605428959658},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 16:29:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 16:29:19","title":"An average of 1,100 Americans are dying every day from COVID-19 as the death rate quickly climbs, heading towards summer and spring levels","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/1100-americans-dying-every-day-covid-19-death-rate-climbs-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb0b90f402d49001924f019?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coronavirus US deaths\" height=\"675\" width=\"900\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The daily death count was 1,321 on Saturday, reaching a 7-day average of 1,100.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>On average, 1,100 Americans are dying every day from COVID-19 as the death rate quickly climbs, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1327753044809764864?s=20\">The COVID Tracking Project</a>.</li>\n<li>The daily death count was 1,321 on Saturday, reaching a 7-day average of 1,100.

It's even got its own hotspot. I spend about four hours out there in the driveway taking calls. I'm usually wearing yoga pants and some nasty old t-shirt. My rate is $1.99 a minute, and my average call lasts half an hour. On a slow night, I might bring in $100; on a great night, I've been known to earn $2,000 ‚Äî but most nights I earn between $300 and $400. I had a regular once send me a $2,000 Amazon gift card as a 'tribute,' which is the industry's term for a tip.</p><p>I keep meticulous spreadsheets on all my callers. My wife used to work in military intelligence, so she helps me. Maybe it's my Aspergers, but I'm obsessed with numbers because they tell me where to put my time and energy. I track the sales cycles of my guys ‚Äî everything from what days they call, to how often they call, to how much they spend. This way I can be proactive, and send a note or special offer if they haven't called in a while and bring them back over to the dark side.</p><p>My personal life hasn't changed much because I'm a homebody ‚Äî but business has been poppin' lately.&#160;</p><h2><strong>During the pandemic, it feels like my customers are all at home spending their unemployment money on me.</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f47c764db1ed000297143ed?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amberly Rothfield\" height=\"2249\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rothfield takes calls from her car usually between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amberly Rothfield</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>My numbers have nearly doubled since COVID-19 started. I also offer model consultations and teach women how to increase their bottom line, and I've been booked solid most days.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Lately, there's a lot more sadness from my callers. I'm very attuned to it. Even my happy, peppy people, like my superfans, the ones who usually make me feel like a rock star, even they're pretty down. They'll tell me their grandma died or their dad's got COVID. My job is to give them some relief. I'll ask if anything good has happened to them and try to get them to talk about that. You know, like they're doing me a favor by sharing some good news with me. I know it sounds like the common trope of Captain Save-a-Ho, but I love my job.</p><h2><strong>I started doing phone sex in 2005 when I was 18 and broke.</strong></h2><p>I was couch-surfing and surviving on the generosity of my friends. I had been a straight-A student, but my parents wouldn't sign for financial aid, so college wasn't an option. When I saw an ad in the local Penny Saver seeking adult voice actors, I jumped on it. I thought I could impress them with my weird impersonations and accents. When I found out it was phone sex, I still took the job. I figured I could either make $5 an hour bagging groceries or $15 doing phone sex. You do the math.&#160;</p><p>First, I did it from an office. Then I started forwarding calls to my friend's houses, and we'd be like MacGyver dangling the landline out the window and I'd take calls from their yard. Eventually, I wound up on Niteflirt, where I still am today. On Niteflirt, you're the boss. You set your own schedule and rates, and you can pretty much work from anywhere as long as you've got an internet connection.&#160;</p><p>In addition to this work, I've served as a YouTube and Twitter marketing consultant for adult entertainment companies as well as a few vanilla ones since 2007. I'll work with them on their overall ideation process, help develop their social media posts, and determine how best to utilize influencers.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Although I'm best known for my work as a phone sex operator, my primary revenue stream actually comes from recording and selling audio Mp3s. I sell them for between $5 and $20 each, and demand is through the roof. I also regularly sell video clips, do webcam by appointment, and offer model consults. During my most successful year to date, I earned $258,000 on Niteflirt alone.</p><h2>Two years ago, my wife and I and our three young sons moved from Las Vegas to a seven-acre farm 90 minutes outside of Pittsburgh.&#160;</h2><p>I've never been a city girl, but I'm not a farmer either. I don't get up to the sound of roosters crowing. I usually get up around 8 a.m. just as my wife takes the bacon out of the pan for breakfast.&#160;</p><p>These days our boys, who are all under the age of 10, are home doing remote school because of the pandemic.

Many of these discounts were price matched from other retailers like Amazon and Walmart, so if you were a REDcard holder, it was beneficial to shop the deals from Target to get an extra 5% off.</p><p>Both consoles and games saw great prices during last year's Black Friday. <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fvideo-games%2F-%2FN-5xtg5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">All PS4 and Xbox One games</a> were only $30, the <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-one-x-1-tb-console-black%2F-%2FA-52637446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Xbox One 1 TB</a> console was $150 off, and many other bundle deals featured discounts on games and consoles combined.
