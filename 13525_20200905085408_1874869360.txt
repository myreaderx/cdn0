However, knowing that your air conditioner is working around the clock can naturally lead to concerns about high electricity bills and your homeâ€™s environmental footprint.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Understanding that this is a real worry for many consumers, Samsung Electronics works tirelessly to make its appliances more energy efficient. For example, Samsungâ€™s Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Air Conditioner features Digital Inverter Boost technology, an energy-saving innovation that reduces the deviceâ€™s energy consumption by up to 73%Â compared to traditional fixed-speed type air conditioners.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Air Conditionerâ€™s Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Mode can even cut energy consumption by 77%Â compared to the unitâ€™s Fast Cooling Mode, even while at maximum output. Samsung Newsroom sat down with two Samsung engineers to learn more about the Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Air Conditioner and its revolutionary energy-saving technologies.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118614\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118614\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main1-845x563.jpg 845w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main1-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">(From left) Kilsoo Son and Byoung-Ok Ahn, engineers at Samsungâ€™s HVAC Solution R&#38;D Lab</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Reducing Electricity Usage With Digital Inverter Boost Technology </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Just as the water in a waterfall cascades from higher ground to lower terrain, so does energy move from high to low. Air conditioners that use compressor technology to lower temperatures have to reduce heat through a process that runs contrary to this natural flow of energy â€“ which is why air conditioners conventionally require a lot of energy to function. â€œThe compressor serves as a pump that circulates the heat, moving matter from a lower point to a higher point,â€� explained Principal Engineer Byoung-Ok Ahn. â€œThis means that the unit has to consume a lot of electricity.â€�</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>To help users save energy, Samsung adopted an inverter compressor â€“ Digital Inverter Boost technology &#8211; that can regulate its own revolutions per minute (RPM) to maintain its energy use at maximum efficiency.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>A fixed-speed compressor will run at maximum speed until the desired temperature is reached, and will then turn off once this is achieved. If the temperature exceeds this desired rate after the first round of cooling, it will switch on again at maximum output to lower the temperature. This repeated on-and-off process is incredibly energy-intensive, and also creates a fluctuation in room temperature as cooling is turned on and off again.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Inverter technology is more efficient since it simply slows down once the desired temperature is achieved and then only has to speed up slightly once the temperature goes up again, meaning that energy consumption is reduced by up to 73%. This process results in less temperature fluctuation, meaning that users can enjoy a consistently comfortable room temperature.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118609\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main2-768x418.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>â€œThe bigger the difference between the room temperature and the desired temperature, the higher the amount of energy that is consumed when the air conditioner is turned on,â€� noted Ahn. â€œWhen we compare the accumulated amount of consumed electricity between the fixed-speed compressor and the inverter compressor, the inverter type is notably more economical than the fixed-speed type since the latter turns on and off repetitively.â€�</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Ahn also provided a tip for getting the most out of your air conditioner. â€œThe most efficient way to use an air conditioner equipped with an inverter compressor is to set the desired temperature at between 24<span>Â°</span>C and 25<span>Â°</span>C (between around 75<span>Â°F</span><span>Â </span>and 77<span>Â°F</span>) and to keep it on continuously when using it. S<span>amsungâ€™s inverter technology</span> performs powerfully and efficiently because the total flux of its motor is maximized and the motor has multiple poles. Furthermore, this technology reduces vibration and noise for user peace of mind.â€�</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Â </strong></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Enjoying a Comfortable Breeze at All Times</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Often with air conditioners, once the temperature in a room has been reduced to the desired temperature, the continued airflow from the indoor unit can become uncomfortably chilling. Continuous, direct exposure to cold wind can dry out the respiratory system and affect userâ€™s health, making them more sensitive to illnesses. Homes with young children or family members who suffer from respiratory symptoms may be wary about keeping their air conditioner on continuously.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>â€œThe Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Air Conditionerâ€™s Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Mode was developed to alleviate this inconvenience. The 2020 version of this air conditioner features 23,000 micro air holes, which gently disperse the cold air evenly throughout a room. This way, users can enjoy a cool air stream without being directly exposed to cold wind,â€� explained Ahn. â€œWind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Mode can even cut energy consumption by 77% compared to the unitâ€™s Fast Cooling Mode, even while at maximum output.â€�</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Another unique feature of Samsungâ€™s Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> air conditioner is its bigger inlet and fan which allow for more air to be drawn in at once. â€œThe air conditionerâ€™s fan, the diameter of which is 15% bigger than conventional fans, along with the optimized width and angle of the outlet, means that energy consumption is reduced by 10%. Furthermore, air is cooled down to the desired temperature even faster,â€� said Engineer Kilsoo Son.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118610\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118610\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main3-804x563.jpg 804w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wind-Free-Energy-Efficiency-Interview_main3-768x538.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">â€» Figures drawn in comparison to the existing AQV12TWS model</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The air conditionerâ€™s inverter technology and its Wind-Free<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology work together in a synergy that creates even higher efficiency when it comes to bring users comfort at home.

Further strengthened by our industry-leading partnerships with Google and Microsoft, weâ€™re reshaping and redefining the possibilities of the mobile device experience.â€�</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>New Refined Design</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold2 pairs bold design with advanced engineering so you can feel confident using it every day.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span><strong>Complete and Immersive Content Experiences</strong></span><sup>1</sup> â€“ <span>A 6.2-inch Infinity-O Cover Screen provides maximum usability so you can check email, look up directions, or even watch your favorite content without needing to unfold your device every time. When unfolded, the massive 7.6-inch Main Screen, with minimized bezels and notch-less Front Camera, immerses you with a 120Hz adaptable refresh rate for smooth scrolling and gameplay. To complete the experience, the Galaxy Z Fold2 comes with the best dynamic sound available on a Galaxy device to date, with enhanced stereo effect and clearer sound provided by high-dynamic dual speakers. </span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span> </span><span><strong>Solid Design and Expert Craftsmanship</strong></span><span> â€“ The Galaxy Z Fold2 is re-engineered with a sleek, unified design that delivers a smooth, high-end feel. </span>Samsung Ultra Thin Glass is now on the Main Screen, providing <span>a more premium and refined feel for the display. Its design is anchored by the Hideaway Hinge, which fits seamlessly into the device body with the CAM mechanism and enables free standing capabilities</span><sup>2</sup><span> that power all new Flex mode experiences. Galaxy Z Fold2 also employs </span><span>sweeper technology,</span><span> first introduced on the Galaxy Z Flip, within the gap between the body and hinge housing to repel dust and undesirable particles. As Galaxy Z Fold2 features a third-generation refined design, the space for the sweeper structure is even smaller than on the Galaxy Z Flip. To achieve this, Samsung developed new innovative sweeper technology to achieve the same level of protection in a smaller space. The Galaxy Z Fold2 Hideaway Hinge features revolutionary slim cutting technology, modified fiber composition and adjusted fiber density. </span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span><strong>Customizable to Match Your Style </strong>â€“Â </span><span>For those </span>looking to stand out even more, Samsung is offering an online tool to customize your Galaxy Z Fold2 with four distinct Hideaway Hinge colors &#8211; Metallic Silver, Metallic Gold, Metallic Red, and Metallic Blue.

The Galaxy Z Fold2 pairs Flex mode<sup>4</sup>Â with App Continuity<sup>5</sup>Â to provide expanded usability, crossing the boundary between the Cover and Main Screen. This flexibility enables you to create or view content that is curated to your exact preferences, from folded to unfolded.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span> </span><span><strong>A Device That is as Flexible and Productive as You</strong></span><span> <strong>Are</strong> â€“ With Flex mode, </span><span>itâ€™s now easier than ever to capture content and review in real time. With Capture View Mode,</span><sup>6</sup><span>Â now you wonâ€™t have to leave the Camera app. Clearly see the photo or video you just took or review up to five of your most recent captures on the bottom half of the Main Screen, and the preview of your next shot will be on the top half.Â </span><span>Or take your creativity one step further with Auto framing.</span><sup>7</sup><span>Â Whether youâ€™re jumping in on the latest social dance or showing off your cooking skills, the Galaxy Z Fold2 can record hands-free video and keep the subject in focus even when it moves.</span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span> </span><span><strong>Features to Support Your Creativity </strong></span><span>â€“ Rethink content capturing by incorporating both the photographer and subjectâ€™s perspective into getting the shot.

Quickly and easily switch layouts between a large screen layout or traditional phone layout in the Settings.<sup>14</sup></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span> </span><span><strong>Optimized App Display</strong></span><span>â€“</span> <span>Maximize every moment in your daily life and upgrade the viewing experience of your favorite apps, including Gmail, YouTube and Spotify. Use the Main Screen with Office apps in Microsoft 365 to mimic the tablet experience. For example, use Microsoft Outlook to its true potential by viewing your inbox on the left side with current conversations at the same time. </span>Draft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets or PowerPoint presentations with PC-like toolbar arrangements.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Galaxy Leadership Strengthened by Strategic Partnerships</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span>Samsung has an open and collaborative approach to partnerships.

The possibilities of configurations are endless with Bespoke, as it offers consumers complete flexibility to create a personalised solution for their kitchens throughout every stage of their lives.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118808\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_main3-768x388.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung is also paying attention to the increased focus on flexibility of consumerâ€™s lifestyle. Recent trends are showing that consumers are visiting the supermarkets less but buying more when they do, Samsung identified a need for refrigerators that maximise your grocery shop and keep food fresher for longer. The <strong>RB7300T Classic Refrigerator</strong> offers revolutionary storage capacity thanks to Samsungâ€™s unique SpaceMax<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology that allows for up to 385 litres of storage and three different height options, so you can keep up with longer grocery lists. Its energy performance also helps consumers maintain a sustainable lifestyle. Optimised to save, the Digital Inverter Compressor automatically adjusts its speed depending on whatâ€™s in your fridge, using up to 50% less power.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung also welcomed a new era of smart, energy efficient laundry with the new <strong>WW9800T</strong> <strong>Washing Machine </strong>and<strong> DV8000T Tumble Dryer. </strong>The AI Washing Machine comes with an intuitive AI control panel that automatically learns your preferred settings and cycles. Samsungâ€™s EcoBubble<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology also maximises the efficiency of detergent by mixing it with air and water to turn it into soft bubbles. Powered by the iconic QuickDrive<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology, the new line-up cuts wash times by up to 50% and energy usage by up to 20%.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When the AI Washing Machine is paired with Samsungâ€™s new AI Tumble Dryer, it is an end-to-end personalised laundry experience. They communicate through an Auto Cycle Link to automatically set the right drying course for the load youâ€™ve just washed. The new dryer also has A+++ energy rated Heat Pump technology which is Samsungâ€™s most efficient yet.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For more information on Samsungâ€™s 2020 line-up, please visit <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.samsung.com</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span><br />\n<strong>Â </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><sup>1</sup><em>Wearable Fitness Technology: Key Trends and Statistics for 2020, <a href=\"https://codete.com/blog/wearable-fitness-technology-trends-and-statistics-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Codete</a>, June 2020</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><sup>2</sup><em>Based on average battery life under typical usage conditions.

But now, Samsung has introduced the â€˜Tap Viewâ€™ feature, which allows you to enjoy mobile content on a large screen by simply tapping your smartphone on the edge of the TV. With Tap View, you can even enjoy content on a big screen without having to connect to Wi-Fi or data networks. To prevent devices from sustaining damage, you should not tap hard, but rather gently touch the top or side of the TV with your phone.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118914\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main3_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main3_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main3_F-768x389.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For those who want not just a bigger screen but also bigger sound, the new â€˜Tap Soundâ€™ feature embedded in latest Samsung soundbars<sup>3</sup>Â is the answer. By lightly tapping your smartphone on the soundbar, you can quickly and conveniently enjoy richer sound quality, making the feature perfect for environments such as outdoor parties with loved ones.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>To activate the Tap View and Tap Sound features, launch the SmartThings app on your smartphone and select the menu icon in the top left corner, where you can turn on Tap View and Tap Sound. From there, simply tap your smartphone on either the TV or the soundbar to enter a whole new world of sound.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118915\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main4_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main4_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main4_F-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>â€˜Multi Viewâ€™ â€“ Powering Multi-Tasking With Two Screens on One TV </strong></span></h3>\n<p>According to a Samsung survey, 92% of respondents say they enjoy using other devices while they are watching TV, with most users doing things like consuming other content or browsing social media. Thus, the &#8216;Multi View&#8217; feature was introduced to allow you to display your smartphone screen on your television, and then divide your TV display into multiple screens so that you can keep using the TV as well. This allows you to view all of your content on one screen, making it easier to divide your attention without missing anything.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118916\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main5_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main5_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main5_F-768x422.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Users of the outdoor TV The Terrace will also find this feature useful for a range of reasons.

When listening to calming classical music, you will see a smooth, visualized motion that resembles flowing water on your TV screen, while playing exciting electronic music will create energetic visualized motions to enliven your experience. The Terrace delivers an average brightness of 2,000 nits (and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits), which is three times brighter than that of regular TVs. For a broad range of genre and tempo types, users can create a host of music visualization combinations to complement a wide range of experiences.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>â€˜My Albumâ€™ â€“ Sharing Memories Through Photos </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Another feature available when using Mobile View is â€˜My Album.â€™ With 2020 models of Samsung TVs, uploading and displaying photos on your TV has become quicker and easier. Whereas before displaying pictures on your television required you to access the SmartThings app and go through a series of steps, now pictures can be exported directly from the Gallery app. Simply select the pictures you want to see on your TV, press â€˜Shareâ€™ and select â€˜View pictures on TV,â€™ and watch your photos spring to life on your television before your eyes. For users with multiple TVs, a preferred television for viewing photos can be selected.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118918\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main7.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main7-728x410.jpg 728w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Terrace-Part3_main7-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In outdoor settings where people gather together and take group pictures, the auto gallery and slide show features make taking and displaying high-quality photos easier too. In cases where individual images have different aspect ratios, these features automatically adjust the photo layouts and play them in a series on your TV. The number of art filters has also been increased from three to a maximum of fifteen, allowing for a wider range of effects to ensure you find the one that best matches your shot.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>â€˜Smart Viewâ€™ â€“ Connecting Your Smartphone and TV</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Another way to display a range of mobile content on your TV is through the use of â€˜Smart Viewâ€™.

When it comes down to it, the attitude of the Galaxy Z Fold2 can be summed up as a combination of three elements: determination (to redefine what smartphone users can do with their device), flexibility (to seamlessly alternate between work and play), and last but not least, the confidence to stand out.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118900\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_1-768x404.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold2 was designed to empower users to be just as determined, flexible and confident as the smartphone itself. Samsungâ€™s latest flagship device unfolds an entirely new way of life â€“ one that transcends the limitations of yesterday, makes it easier to juggle more roles than ever, and allows you to focus on being yourself.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Follow along as we examine each fascinating facet of the Galaxy Z Fold2â€™s design.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Built for Broadening Horizons</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold2 has been optimized, inside and out, to take the foldable smartphone experience to the next level.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The deviceâ€™s delicately refined UI elevates the quality of the overall user experience, while its expanded Cover Screen further enhances usability. The Cover Screen itself has been made larger, measuring a full 6.2 inches, and its bezels have been made thinner. The combination of a 6.2-inch Cover Screen and a 7.6-inch Main Screen makes the Galaxy Z Fold2 similar in size to a typical smartphone when folded, and a small tablet when opened. When viewing content, the thinner bezels and notch-less Infinity-O Display maximize immersion, allowing users to enjoy the full benefits that come with a bigger screen.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118892\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_2-768x264.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The smartphoneâ€™s expanded Cover Screen unlocks a variety of convenient experiences. Now, users can do just as much on the Galaxy Z Fold2â€™s Cover Screen as they could on a typical smartphoneâ€™s screen. When folded, the display makes it easy to do everything from viewing content to taking pictures or replying to messages. When unfolded, the deviceâ€™s Main Screen is handy for capturing and viewing photos and videos.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118893\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_3-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold2â€™s enhanced UI offers users a variety of ways to divide up the Main Screen for seamless multitasking. When texting with friends, attaching photos is as simple as dragging an image from one window to another. Thanks to a newly introduced feature, users also have the option to utilize a single app in multiple windows. This means that you can load an article in a browser in one window, and search for more info on the subject of the article in another. You can also save your split screen configurations to the Multi-Window tray as an App Pair, so you wonâ€™t need to go through the hassle of setting up separate windows each time youâ€™d like to launch your apps.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In these uncertain times, more individuals are learning to accept change and broaden their horizons. The Galaxy Z Fold2 is the embodiment of this kind of progression, designed for those who are constantly defying limitations, seeking out new experiences, and boldly facing the challenges of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>The Freedom of Flexibility</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold2 adds a bold new chapter to a category that Samsung pioneered with the launch of the original Galaxy Fold. Like its predecessor, the Galaxy Z Fold2 was designed with an emphasis on flexibility and versatility. It adjusts its form to suit the task at hand, perfectly complementing the many roles that users juggle throughout their daily lives.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118894\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-118894 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_4-728x410.jpg 728w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_4-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">App compatibility with Flex mode may vary.</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold2 can be used at a variety of angles to suit usersâ€™ needs â€“ opened wide, opened just enough for comfort, or even standing upright in a folded position. The available Aramid Standing Cover takes this convenience a step further by enabling you to prop up your Galaxy Z Fold2 like a picture frame, in addition to allowing you to use your device at any angle you desire. When taking pictures or recording videos, you can fold the device so the camera meets your eye level and view a preview of your shot using the top part of the screen, which gives you a wider field of vision for a much more comfortable experience.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118895\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_5-728x410.jpg 728w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_5-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The key here is the Galaxy Z Fold2â€™s convenient Flex mode, which automatically splits the Main Screen into two sections, allowing you to comfortably view content on the top half and control it on the bottom. The smartphone can also be held upright when partially folded, freeing your hands to handle other things. Thatâ€™s the beauty of the Galaxy Z Fold2â€™s flexible design: it offers complete freedom to multitask. This includes everything from displaying videos while folded to enabling users to execute video calls on one side of their screen while taking notes on the other.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>We live in a time in which people wear many different hats, as the saying goes, and identify with various personas. Our behaviors and attitudes can vary depending on whether weâ€™re working, resting or having fun, and we may express ourselves differently in our everyday lives and on social media. The fact that our characters and behaviors are so multifaceted and nuanced underscores the idea that none of us can be easily defined with a single identity. The Galaxy Z Fold2 and its many forms and functions cater to modern usersâ€™ many personas, offering the perfect tool for tackling the wide range of tasks that we manage every day.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>The Confidence To Be Different</strong></span></h3>\n<p>With its simple form, consisting of straight lines, and colors that exemplify modern elegance, the Galaxy Z Fold2 exudes a kind of confident and premium style that captures the attention of everyone around it.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118896\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_6.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Z-Fold2-Design-Story_main_6-768x391.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The smartphone comes in a choice of two colors that are sure to strike a chord with all kinds of users.

The confidence that comes from knowing who we are and being positive enhances our sense of worth and adds conviction to our every move.

Samsungâ€™s Digital Inverter Compressor adds to energy efficiency by utilizing strong magnets for quieter and stronger performance, while using less energy compared to a universal motor.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The new washers also come with Samsungâ€™s EcoBubble<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology that maximizes the effect of detergent by turning it into soft bubbles â€“ allowing for faster penetration into fabrics, even in cold water. Colder washes save heating energy, while also protecting the fabrics and colors of garments.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Adding to Samsungâ€™s reliable performance is artificial intelligence, which learns usersâ€™ behavioral patterns to recommend cycles and offer a truly personalized laundry experience. With AI Control, the new Samsung washer familiarizes itself with user preferences and combines that knowledge with big data to provide the industryâ€™s first automatic suggestion of wash cycles on its display. Paired with a simple user interface, AI Control eliminates the need for users to scroll through cycles to find the right one, or to input their individualized settings each time. The AI Wash feature uses sensors to detect the laundry loadâ€™s weight and soilage, to determine the optimal amount of water and detergent to dispense.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The user convenience extends to the drying process with Auto Cycle Link, which pairs compatible washers and dryers directly to automatically set the best dryer cycle for each load.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>All of the appliances in Samsungâ€™s new laundry lineup are compatible with SmartThings, offering users control over laundry settings from their smartphone and features like Laundry Planner and Laundry Recipe to customize laundry routines.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Maximized Storage Space With Freshness that Lasts </strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118597\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Laundry-Lineup-and-Refrigerator-RB7300-WW9800T_main_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Laundry-Lineup-and-Refrigerator-RB7300-WW9800T_main_1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Laundry-Lineup-and-Refrigerator-RB7300-WW9800T_main_1-768x388.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Thanks to Samsungâ€™s SpaceMax<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Technology, the new BMF refrigerator maximizes fridge space without needing wider exterior dimensions that may clash with modern kitchen cabinets.

The new refrigerator therefore matches the standard 600mm cabinet-depth design while offering more space. This feature is especially welcome now, as grocery-shopping habits are changing; people are reducing trips to the shop to purchase large quantities of groceries at a time, shopping online more, and seeking out ready-to-cook meal kit solutions to minimize food preparation. All these trends lead to the need for greater efficiency when it comes to storage space in refrigerators.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The new Samsung refrigerator is also designed to preserve the freshness of food items twice as long.** Featuring a revolutionary Optimal Fresh+ box that serves as an adjustable drawer, users can choose to either split the drawer into two zones with different temperatures or use it as one. The left side is cooler, so itâ€™s optimized for meat and fish storage, while the right side is great for fruit and vegetables.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The new model ensures that all stored food is properly cooled no matter where itâ€™s placed within the refrigerator. Equipped with the most popular Samsung refrigeration technology features, the new fridge is decked out with All Around Cooling and Metal Cooling for maximum freshness.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The new BMF refrigerator also boasts a contemporary built-in look that introduces an added level of sophistication to any modern kitchen interior. The stainless-steel finish and sleek flat front are representative of Samsung appliancesâ€™ simple yet refined design. With a Clean Back that comprises of a smooth metal safety cover for vital coils and cables behind the unit, the BMF refrigerator offers a minimalist approach look and feel.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The compressor for the latest BMF refrigerator automatically adjusts its speed based on cooling demand across seven levels. The advanced compressor thus requires less energy, minimizes noise, and even reduces wear and tear for a durable, long-lasting performance from the refrigerator.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The RB7300 refrigerator and new laundry lineup will be featured at Samsung&#8217;s &#8216;Life Unstoppable&#8217; virtual event on September 2.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118596\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Laundry-Lineup-and-Refrigerator-RB7300-WW9800T_main_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Laundry-Lineup-and-Refrigerator-RB7300-WW9800T_main_3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Laundry-Lineup-and-Refrigerator-RB7300-WW9800T_main_3-768x379.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>*<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em>Tested on WW8000T compared with Samsung WW6500K.

But now, as many people around the world practice social distancing, home becomes more important than ever.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The pandemic has resulted in all of us re-assessing the spaces in which we live along with the ways we operate and prioritize things in our daily routines. This had led to many people reorienting their lifestyles, personal and professional, to lead the most healthy, sustainable and productive lifestyle possible, whatever the situation they may be in.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Such changes of mindset and habits are in line with the vision Samsung Electronics has for its digital appliances division, one of moving beyond simply manufacturing appliances and towards becoming a truly consumer-centric lifestyle brand. We look to innovate so that consumers can enrich their home experiences and express their own personalities through our appliances in this changing world.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>The Home as a Flexible, Personalized Space</strong></span></h3>\n<p>As our consumers spend more and more time at home, the boundary between places of work and places of relaxation has shifted and people are increasingly repurposing their space to serve as multi-function spots â€“ be they as a vacation spot, a party room, a makeshift gym, an office space, a bar or a cafe.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Today, the concept of the â€œhomeâ€� has become more flexible so as to include all kinds of individual lifestyles and habits. Naturally, we felt that it was time for appliances to evolve in the same way, too.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>The Era of Customizable Home Appliances </strong></span></h3>\n<p>With our customizable home appliances, Samsung has pioneered a new age in the history of domestic gadgets based on the belief that todayâ€™s appliances should go beyond simply helping users complete their housework and that they must take the lead in innovating the lifestyles they fit into. We are constantly listening to our consumers and innovating our portfolio accordingly in a way that will allow us all to reflect our actual lifestyles â€“ no matter how they may change, now or in the future.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Our Bespoke refrigerator line is the forerunner of this new direction. The concept started with on fundamental question: the average consumer users their refrigerator for ten years, a period of time in which so much can change, so way shouldnâ€™t their refrigerator be able to change with them? Getting married, moving to a new city, having children, getting a new job â€“ all of these changes can result in new needs, want and requirements for users of their domestic appliances. Therefore, for each change, the Bespoke line offers a variety of types, colors, and finishes that can answer the call.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>However, the Bespoke line is not the only Samsung product to offer such personalization; this capability has expanded beyond refrigerators with our new line of laundry devices that are designed to adapt to user preferences with each use. Equipped with artificial intelligence, the new WW9800T washer learns user-preferred settings and combines this knowledge with big data to recommend the best cycle for optimal washing.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Our AirDresser also serves as a customized garment care solution for a diverse range of lifestyle needs, such as cleaning, sanitizing, or de-wrinkling. Whether your main cleaning priority is your suit jackets, your evening dresses, or your babyâ€™s soft stuffed toys, the AirDresser has a cycle for you to gently steam and sanitize, keeping your lifestyle hygienic. When desiging the AirDresser, we merged sleek, contemporary design with high-performance technology, opening up a whole new appliance category capable of addressing the increasing consumer demand for health and hygiene-conscious products at home.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Keeping Hygiene Top of Mind for Both Indoors and Outdoors</strong></span></h3>\n<p>We at Samsung are aware that the pandemic has made consumers much more aware of the need to maintain and manage best-practices hygiene routines, both for themselves personally and also within their homes.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This recent heightened demand for cleanliness has boosted our vacuum cleaner sales in the Latin American region by 350% compared to the previous year. Our global air purifier sales have also increased by 410% from January to July this year compared to the same timeframe last year. What this has led to is that in addition to creating innovative new products like the AirDresser, Samsung is looking closely at its entire existing portfolio through the lens of hygiene, as well.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For example, Samsungâ€™s Clean Station<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> took aim at an inconvenience that most of us accepted as being unavoidable: having dust fly back into the air whenever we emptied our vacuum cleanersâ€™ dustbins. Pairing seamlessly with the Samsung Jet<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> stick vacuum cleaner, the Clean Station<span><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></span> lets consumers empty their dustbins right into a disposable bag with the touch of a button â€“ and with no dust escaping back into the air.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118886\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Editorial-Creating-Homes-that-Reflect-Each-Consumer-Lifestyles_main2F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Editorial-Creating-Homes-that-Reflect-Each-Consumer-Lifestyles_main2F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Editorial-Creating-Homes-that-Reflect-Each-Consumer-Lifestyles_main2F-563x563.jpg 563w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Editorial-Creating-Homes-that-Reflect-Each-Consumer-Lifestyles_main2F-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Sustainability is Here to Stay </strong></span></h3>\n<p>As they spend more time at home, consumers have also become more acutely aware of how their daily habits, including the use of home appliances, can impact the environment. Consumers today are challenging us to be bolder in our pursuit of eco-friendly, energy-efficient, sustainable products that align with their personal values surrounding environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For example, in the midst of the current pandemic, consumers are now shopping for groceries fewer times a week but buying in bulk when they do. This means that many consumers are looking for larger refrigerators but donâ€™t want to see their electricity consumption spike. Samsungâ€™s new RB7300 BMF refrigerator maximizes storage capacity with Samsungâ€™s SpaceMax<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> and applies eco-friendly structures to improve energy efficiency by 30%.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our new lineup of high efficiency washing machines and dryers also reduces washing time by up to 50% and energy usage by 20% thanks to Samsungâ€™s proprietary QuickDrive<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology. Additionally, with our EcoBubble<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"â„¢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology that is capable of activating detergent even in cold water, consumers can save additional energy that may have been used to heat water.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Looking Ahead: Innovation That Reflects Our Users</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Samsung is committed to developing appliances that do more than just clean, cool, and purify. Our trusted home appliances are now being upgraded to the next level with Samsungâ€™s leading IoT and artificial intelligence capabilities which allow our products to communicate with their users and vice versa. Digital appliances are set to evolve into digital â€œassistantsâ€� that understand our patterns of behavior and work to create a home environment optimized for each household.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>By continuing our close collaborations with internal research organizations as well as external experts, we hope to introduce home appliances that will truly understand you and your home.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>We will always challenge ourselves to find the next big technical breakthrough and deliver on higher performance for users, but we know that technology without purpose leads to nowhere.

Built on Samsung&#8217;s third-generation 10nm-class (1z) process, the new 16Gb LPDDR5 boasts the highest mobile memory performance and largest capacity to enable more consumers to enjoy the full benefits of 5G and AI features in next-generation smartphones.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The 1z-based 16Gb LPDDR5 elevates the industry to a new threshold, overcoming a major developmental hurdle in DRAM scaling at advanced nodes,&#8221; said Jung-bae Lee, executive vice president of DRAM Product &#38; Technology at Samsung Electronics. &#8220;We will continue to expand our premium DRAM lineup and exceed customer demands, as we lead in growing the overall memory market.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Expanding Manufacturing Capacity in Pyeongtaek Complex</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Spanning more than 128,900 square meters (over 1.3 million square feet) â€“ equivalent to about 16 soccer fields â€“ Samsung&#8217;s Pyeongtaek Line 2 is the largest-scale semiconductor production line to date.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The new Pyeongtaek line will serve as the key manufacturing hub for the industryâ€™s most advanced semiconductor technologies, delivering cutting-edge DRAM followed by next-generation V-NAND and foundry solutions, while reinforcing the company&#8217;s leadership in the Industry 4.0 era.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Fastest, Largest-capacity Mobile Memory</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Based on today&#8217;s most advanced (1z) process node, Samsungâ€™s new 16Gb LPDDR5 is the first memory to be mass produced using EUV technology, providing the highest speed and largest capacity available in mobile DRAM.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>At 6,400 megabits per second (Mb/s), the new LPDDR5 is about 16 percent faster than the 12Gb LPDDR5 (5,500Mb/s) found in most of today&#8217;s flagship mobile devices. When made into a 16GB package, the LPDDR5 can transfer about 10 5GB-sized full-HD movies, or 51.2GB of data, in one second.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Thanks to its use of the first commercial 1z process, the LPDDR5 package is 30 percent thinner than its predecessor, enabling 5G and multi-camera smartphones as well as foldable devices to pack more functionality into a slim design. The 16Gb LPDDR5 can build a 16GB package with only eight chips, whereas its 1y-based predecessor requires 12 chips (eight 12Gb chips and four 8Gb chips) to provide the same capacity.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>By delivering the first 1z-based 16GB LPDDR5 package to global smartphone makers, Samsung plans to further strengthen its presence in the flagship mobile device market throughout 2021. Samsung will also expand the use of its LPDDR5 offerings into automotive applications, offering an extended temperature range to meet strict safety and reliability standards in extreme environments.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 11:00:21 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ed5fe53515c7225a25403ab1f06afef3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Samsung Newsroom","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296010317},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:53:30","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:53:30","title":"Samsung Launches 4K Ultra Short Throw Laser Projector: The Premiere","link":"https://bit.ly/3jyof5p","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118681\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Press-Release_The-Premiere_main.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Press-Release_The-Premiere_main.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Press-Release_The-Premiere_main-804x563.jpg 804w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Press-Release_The-Premiere_main-768x538.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung Electronics announced its all new 4K Ultra Short Throw laser projector, The Premiere, at its virtual press conference event â€œLife Unstoppableâ€� on September 2nd. The new 4K laser projector provides a big picture cinematic experience in the comfort of oneâ€™s home. The Premiere is the new anchor product in the award-wining Lifestyle product portfolio that now transcends the display experience â€“ without the display.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung will begin to rollout The Premiere globally starting from the US, Europe, Korea, and other regions later this year.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Premiere will be available up to 130- and 120-inch models â€“ LSP9T and LSP7T respectively &#8211; that support a laser powered 4K picture resolution. The Premiere LSP9T is the worldâ€™s first HDR10+ certified projector with triple laser technology and delivers revolutionary contrast details as the user watches from bright to dark scenes with a peak brightness of up to 2,800 ANSI lumens. The Premiere also supports Filmmaker Mode for the first of its kind as a projector allowing users to enjoy watching movies as director intended. The smart projector comes equipped with Samsungâ€™s Smart TV platform and experience full of streaming video apps from major content partners and mobile connectivity features such as Tap View and mirroring.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Premiere comes in an all-in-one compact, space-saving design that blends into a variety of living room settings and arrangements. As it is an ultra-short-throw projector, The Premiere can be placed just in front of the wall. It is designed for an easy-to-install set up and sports fabric finishes around its edges to harmonize different environments. The Premiere has powerful built-in woofers and Acoustic Beam surround sound, providing one of the best cinema experiences of projectors on the market today and reduces the need for additional bigger sound equipment in tighter spaces.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>â€œOver the past few months, we have seen how consumers are spending more time at home and how the role of everyday life continues to change. TV has become the center of entertainment, a fitness partner, a co-worker and a source for news,â€� said Jongsuk Chu, Executive Vice President of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. â€œThe Premiere re-imagines the home cinema experience with an all-new, compact design, 4K picture quality and big sound for tight spaces that can be used for any at-home activity and living room arrangements.â€�</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung first launched its Lifestyle product portfolio with The Serif in 2016 and has since expanded it to the award-winning TV line-up of The Frame, The Sero and The Terrace. By enhancing elements that speak to the consumer passion points for art, interior designs and the mobile experience, Samsungâ€™s Lifestyle product line-up functions have evolved to become a central hub for a wide array of lifestyles.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 17:00:48
