Convert.com has a good summary of the <a href=\"https://blog.convert.com/analytics-ab-testing-cookies-after-consent-in-europe.html\">impact of analytics and A/B testing after the recent changes to the cookie consent rules</a>. The regulators’ guidelines are clearer now than they were in 2018—and are more demanding than many website owners interpreted them to be. Consent must be explicit, not just implied.</p> \n<h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcuts-to-help-you-use-google-docs-faster\">Keyboard shortcuts to help you use Google Docs faster</h3> \n<p>If you use Google Docs’ comments feature a lot, the official <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738\">Keyboard shortcuts for Google Docs</a> can save you a lot of time. However, here’s a useful keyboard shortcut that’s mysteriously missing from Google’s official guide:</p> \n<p>If you’re processing a Google Doc that contains many comments, then…</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>To jump from one comment to the next</strong> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hold down Control-Command (Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) and then type N followed by C (short for “next comment”).</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><strong>To jump back to the previous comment</strong>, \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hold down Control-Command (Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) and then type P followed by C (short for “previous comment”).</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Curious fact:</strong> In German, Ctrl-Alt-Delete is known as “monkey grip” (“Affengriff”), referring to the awkward position the left hand needs to adopt. We find “monkey grip” to be a useful name to remember Ctrl-Alt (Windows) or Control-Command (Mac)—so the above keyword shortcuts become “monkey grip N then C” and “monkey grip P then C.”</p> \n<h3 id=\"a-toolbox-for-design-thinking\">A toolbox for design thinking</h3> \n<figure class=\"browser\"> \n <picture style=\"\n        \n          background-color: #fff;\n        \n        \n      \"> \n  <div class=\"browser__controls\"> \n   <div class=\"window-controls\"> \n    <span></span> \n    <span></span> \n    <span></span> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/conversion-rate-experts/image/upload/w_auto,dpr_auto,c_scale,f_auto,q_auto/screenshot-of-hyper-islands-design-thinking-toolbox.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of some of the design-thinking tools on Hyper Island’s website.\" class=\"cld-responsive padding\" /> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://toolbox.hyperisland.com/\">Hyper Island’s Design Thinking Toolbox</a> contains many useful tools, techniques, and processes for innovation, collaboration, and self-leadership.</p> \n<h3 id=\"improve-autofill-for-your-forms\">Improve autofill for your forms</h3> \n<p>You can increase your conversion rate by making your forms easier to use.</p> \n<p>eBay might not be your go-to place for UI inspiration, but its article <a href=\"https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/autofill-deep-dive/\">Autofill on Browsers: A Deep Dive</a> contains some excellent advice to improve your forms’ autofill functionality.</p> \n<h3 id=\"how-to-manage-all-the-text-you-have-highlighted-over-the-years\">How to manage all the text you have highlighted over the years</h3> \n<figure> \n <picture style=\"\n        \n        \n      \"> \n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/conversion-rate-experts/image/upload/screenshot-of-kindle-notebook-page.gif\" alt=\"An animated GIF of a Kindle Notebook page.\" class=\"cld-responsive\" /> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<p>It turns out you can see all your Kindle highlights on one page: your <a href=\"https://read.amazon.com/kp/notebook\">Kindle Notebook page</a>.

It can import them from Kindle, Apple Books, Instapaper, Pocket, Twitter, and more. The Readwise phone app even lets you take photos of the highlights in your paper books.</p> \n<p>Readwise can export the notes into whichever notebook you use. But its killer feature, for us, is spaced repetition. Each day, it shows (or emails) a random selection of five highlights.
