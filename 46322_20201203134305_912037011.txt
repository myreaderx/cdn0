{"code":1,"isDone":false,"toInsertArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 21:42:01","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 21:42:01","title":"Instantly Improve Your Month","link":"https://www.rdegges.com/2013/instantly-improve-your-month/","description":"\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/hollow-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Hollow Sketch\" title=\"Hollow Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>Two months ago I was having a pretty lousy time.  I was in a serious rut.  The\nnew project I&rsquo;d been working on was struggling with various scaling issues\n(something I&rsquo;m going to cover in subsequent articles), and I was routinely\npulling 16 hour days trying to get things working without much luck.</p>\n\n<p>In a desperate attempt to find some sort of relief, I was looking through my\n<em>Ideas</em> Google doc and came across a hidden gem: a few paragraphs I had written\nto myself at some point in the past few years which outlined a few simple things\nI should do when I&rsquo;m in a rut to help me pull myself out of it.  Thanks, past\nme!</p>\n\n<p>After practicing the list of things below, I felt a lot happier, less stressed,\nand gradually went back to feeling like my cheery self within a week or two.</p>\n\n<p>So, without further ado, here is my list of things you can do to instantly\nimprove your month and pull yourself out of whatever rut you&rsquo;re currently in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"drink-a-lot-of-water\">Drink a Lot of Water</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/water-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Water Sketch\" title=\"Water Sketcb\" /></p>\n\n<p>While this point seems moot, it&rsquo;s actually quite important.  <strong>Drink a ton of\nwater.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes when I&rsquo;m at my desk all day, I don&rsquo;t move around enough to drink\nwater, and end up having a dry mouth all day long &ndash; ugh.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve found that drinking about a gallon of water a day makes me feel really well\nhydrated and just better overall.</p>\n\n<p>It also helps to completely cut out all other types of liquid drinks you might\nnormally have: soda (diet or otherwise), caffeine drinks, tea, juice, coffee,\netc.  I typically drink a lot of caffeine, but when I lay off it completely for\na few days (minimum) I feel a lot more relaxed and less on edge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"eat-vegetables\">Eat Vegetables</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/broccoli-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Broccoli Sketch\" title=\"Broccoli Sketcb\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Eat at least one full serving of green vegetables per day.</strong>  Why green\nveggies?  They&rsquo;re the best ones for you: broccoli, peas, pea pods, leafy\ngreens, celery, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Green vegetables have a very low amount of carbohydrates, are great for\nstaying slim, reducing insulin levels in the blood, and taste good with a\nlittle bit of pepper :)</p>\n\n<p>Maintaining steady insulin levels (blood sugar) is useful as it helps decrease\nvariation in blood sugar levels throughout the day which can lead to all sorts\nof stuff: afternoon crashes, hunger, irritability, etc.</p>\n\n<p>They&rsquo;re also full of vitamins and minerals that you might not be getting enough\nof on a day-to-day basis</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"eat-lean-meats\">Eat Lean Meats</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/chicken-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Sketch\" title=\"Chicken Sketcb\" /></p>\n\n<p>Almost nothing is as good for you as some lean meat: chicken, turkey, lean\nsteak, <sup>95</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> ground beef, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Meat is incredibly filling and makes you feel satisfied quicker than other types\nof foods.  It has lots of protein which supports muscle tissue and muscular\ndevelopment, and helps regulate body fat levels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lift-heavy-weights\">Lift (Heavy) Weights</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/weight-lifting-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Weight Lifting Sketch\" title=\"Weight Lifting Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>Go to the gym and lift some weights!  Seriously.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s your\nfirst time or not &ndash; lifting weights is one of the best things you can do for\nyour health and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>Lifting weights has been shown to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Increase testosterone levels (a very good thing).</li>\n<li>Decrease body fat levels.</li>\n<li>Increase metabolic burn rate (more muscle = more calories burned every day,\nregardless of whether you&rsquo;re active or not).</li>\n<li>Increases endorphin levels: making you feel happier and lowering your stress\nlevels.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"spend-an-hour-outside\">Spend an Hour Outside</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/squirrel-sketch.png\" alt=\"Squirrel Sketch\" title=\"Squirrel Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>Getting outside helps you clear your mind, gets you a healthy dose of Vitamin D\n(unless you&rsquo;re outside at night!), and increases happiness.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also quite relaxing to force yourself outside without a computer for an\nhour each day: it helps me to appreciate all the non-tech things in the world,\nand gives me some time to do more basic human things: go for a walk, take a\nshort bike ride, and even think about problems I&rsquo;m having in a stress-free\nenvironment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visit-a-friend\">Visit a Friend</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/futuristic-monster-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Futuristic Monster Sketch\" title=\"Futuristic Monster Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Visit your friends at least once every other week.</strong>  Maintaining contact\nwith your buddies is a great way to relax and pull yourself out of a rut.</p>\n\n<p>Hanging out with friends reduces stress, increases endorphins, and has even been\nshown to increase your lifespan!</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve found that hanging out with friends at least once every other week is\nenough to keep me feeling happy and normal &ndash; more than that and I find myself\nmissing the interaction :(</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"read\">Read</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/books-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Books Sketch\" title=\"Books Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>Reading is a really important part of relaxing and feeling happy.  If you&rsquo;re\nnot already spending at least 30 minutes per day reading a book that interests\nyou, you should start immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Reading increases your knowledge, relaxes your mind, and is a great way to &lsquo;zone\nout&rsquo; of the craziness of life for a short period of time.  Focusing on a book\nfor 30 minutes a day is an excellent way to increase your personal\nsatisfaction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you commute each day, you might want to consider getting an\n<a href=\"http://www.audible.com/\" title=\"Audible\">Audible</a> subscription.  Audible is the biggest audio book subscription\nservice &ndash; they have tons of books that you can download to your phone and\nlisten to on the go.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"write\">Write</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/writing-sketch.gif\" alt=\"Writing Sketch\" title=\"Writing Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>Writing is also an important tool in reducing stress.</p>\n\n<p>Writing about your day (journaling) is a proven way to reduce stress and is\nincredibly therapeutic.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you&rsquo;re journaling or writing about other stuff: work\nproblems, programming, hobbies, whatever &ndash; spending 30 minutes writing per day\nis a great way to make yourself feel happy and productive.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a good way to journal each day, I&rsquo;d recommend using\n<a href=\"http://750words.com/\" title=\"750 Words\">750 Words</a>.  It&rsquo;s a great tool you can use to maintain a private journal\nonline, which forces you to write at least 750 words each day to keep up your\nchain.  Once you give it a try, you&rsquo;ll see why it&rsquo;s so awesome: there are no\ndistractions, and it gives you a really simple throw-away space to write about\nwhatever you want without worrying about formatting, structure, etc.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"focus-on-one-thing\">Focus on One Thing</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/eye-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Eye Sketch\" title=\"Eye Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>Make a list of things you need to do in the next few days.  Every morning when\nyou wake up, pick the most important thing on that list, and write it on a tiny\npost-it note.  Then put that post-it note on your computer.</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of the day, focus on doing that one thing as good as you possibly\ncan, and ignore everything else (within reason).</p>\n\n<p>If you can successfully finish that one thing by the end of the day: be happy\nwith your progress.</p>\n\n<p>I find that when I&rsquo;m working on too many things I get easily distracted,\noverwhelmed, and stressed out.  Having a single thing to focus on makes me feel\na lot less stressed, and helps me stay on target for the day.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also nice to get the feeling that you&rsquo;ve made progress at the end of each\nday by finishing something completely.  When I&rsquo;ve got a million things to do and\nI&rsquo;m hurriedly finishing lots of things, I somehow feel like I haven&rsquo;t\naccomplished anything significant at the end of day, and feel bad about myself.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a lot better to keep that post-it note within view, and know that by the\ntime I&rsquo;ve finished the day I&rsquo;ve actually accomplished a win.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maintain-an-idea-list\">Maintain an Idea List</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.rdegges.com/static/images/2013/thought-bubble-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Thought Bubble Sketch\" title=\"Thought Bubble Sketch\" /></p>\n\n<p>The last piece of advice I have is to maintain your own idea list.</p>\n\n<p>I always keep a Google document named <em>Ideas</em> open when I&rsquo;m working &ndash; this way,\nif I get a cool idea for something (a blog post, business, app, library,\nwhatever) &ndash; I can quickly jot it down and move on without worrying about losing\nthe idea.</p>\n\n<p>I periodically come back to my idea list when I&rsquo;m bored or need inspiration, and\nhave a place to view all of my ideas and thoughts that I&rsquo;ve had in the past.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s really great knowing that anytime I&rsquo;m feeling bored or uninspired I can\ntake a quick look through some awesomeness and cheer myself up.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"that-s-all\">That&rsquo;s All</h2>\n\n<p>Hope some of my suggestions can help you out at some point in the future.  If\nyou implement all of the above things in your life for a week or more, it&rsquo;s\npretty difficult to have a bad month.</p>\n\n<p>Keep making progress each day (both physically and mentally) and you&rsquo;ll feel\nhappier, less stressed, and more awesome.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 00:00:00
