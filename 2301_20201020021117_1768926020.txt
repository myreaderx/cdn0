The conference will look at best practices and technologies for integrating development and security teams, tools, and processes, with a specific nod of the secure use of containers, from images used as a starting point to apps shared with teams and the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Docker, we know that security is vital to successful app development projects, and automating app security early in the development process ensures teams start with the right foundation and ship apps that have vulnerability scanning and remediation included by default. This year we <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-scanning-from-snyk-for-docker/\">announced a broad partnership with Snyk</a> to incorporate their <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/secure-from-the-start-shift-vulnerability-scanning-left-in-docker-desktop/\">leading vulnerability scanning across the entire Docker app development lifecycle</a>. At Snykcon, attendees will learn how to successfully incorporate security scanning into their entire Docker app delivery pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the highlights from Docker at this event include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Docker CEO Scott Scott Johnston will join Snyk CEO Peter McKay in the keynote fireside chat on Thursday, October 22 at 8:30am PDT. Scot and Peter will talk about the partnership between Docker and Snyk and share new collaboration between the companies that strengthen the integration of Snyk scanning into Docker container workflows. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/inDvK7Arj-49ZumfLA8MVS5nnYHtCNTHyjOpigPg_TtM39EVyMN2oyJy4-S7oT6JwsLVrQHlddrtCziyVnubDcxMtNgCVKgtAsQneWmWzjfP_6nCCFNlHHhkfMON_8U7_0Z3sxWQ\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Later that day, Docker’s Justin Cormack will deliver a breakout session with Danielle Inbar from Snyk on <a href=\"https://sched.co/f2kG\">how to secure containers directly from Docker Desktop</a>. In this session, Justin and Danielle will take you on a technical deep dive into how you can integrate Snyk and Docker for continuous integrated security scanning, in your command line and throughout the SDLC. This session will give you an insider’s perspective to quickly start benefiting from these new integrations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iGb3AE405iOjQ9gpjvvUFlqju8zR9_uTBA4ukuhPibzuSD2mtLnOwfRRMcoWupP1EVMblQzqfYxV07_6Yrb5cmrp-vLSu2K5_tZimfgnzccDeI-GKD_MhL8jQglFh5ctQTPX9Edr\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get more details about these sessions, as well as the rest of the Snykcon program at the <a href=\"https://snyk.io/snykcon/#agenda\">Snykcon agenda page</a>.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snykcon starts this Wednesday, but it&#8217;s not too late to register (and it&#8217;s free!). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SnykConDocker\">go to the Snykcon registration page </a>and sign up today.
