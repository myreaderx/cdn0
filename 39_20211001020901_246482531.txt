Giving emerging UK designers a platform, festival attendees a free open-air exhibition, and showing the potential of an underused, highly sustainable material, American red oak, were the overall goals of the project.</p>\n<p>Each of the ten Designposts were designed by a student or recent graduate of either London Metropolitan University or the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL. Designers were assigned an LDF Design District and asked to create a large-scale sculptural structure with guidance from AHEC and the furniture makers.

After LDF, the Designposts themselves will likely be donated to London institutions, either to live permanently or be repurposed for new student projects.</p>\n<p>The project hopes to communicate to both designers and the public that hardwoods, such as red oak, are viable material options from a sustainability perspective. Red oak is the most abundant species in American hardwood forests, yet is often overlooked in European design. Over-reliance on a small area of forests can have a damaging effect on ecosystems, and AHEC believes that designers and architects have a responsibility to use whatever nature provides. Growing wild rather than being planted, red oak is both a sustainable and renewable material option with significant aesthetic appeal for designers and architects.</p>\n<p>Photos by Thom
