Figure 1, from the <a title=\"Healthgrades site\" href=\"http://www.healthgrades.com/hospital-directory/new-york-ny-manhattan/hospital-for-special-surgery-hgst6cf97b36330270#Satisfaction\">Healthgrades site</a>, shows the results for the first six questions from a survey of the patient experience measures from the Hospital of Special Surgery. This demonstrates that a single graph can be acceptable by itself but confusing or even misleading when placed in a group of graphs. The particular problem with this group is the use of different scales, ranging in maximum values from 70% to 100%.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1422\" style=\"width: 220px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://b-i.forbesimg.com/naomirobbins/files/2014/01/Patient_experience.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1422\" title=\"Misleading Healthcare Graph\" alt=\"Different scales make figure misleading\" src=\"http://b-i.forbesimg.com/naomirobbins/files/2014/01/Patient_experience-210x300.png\" width=\"210\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2014/01/Patient_experience-210x300.png 210w, https://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2014/01/Patient_experience.png 647w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 1. Misleading Group of Graphs. Click to enlarge</p></div>\n<p>Each panel presents the percentage of patients at the Hospital for Special Surgery that gave the hospital a rating of 9 or 10 and compares that value to that of the national average of hospitals.  Note that both bars in each panel have the same scale so that the comparison within panels is valid. A reader might also be interested in the comparisons of ratings of different questions for the same hospital; for example, whether patients are more satisfied that the hospital staff always explained medicines or that the patients felt that their pain was always well controlled. The bar for explaining medicines is longer than the bar for controlling pain for both the Hospital for Special Surgery and for the national average. However, the labels show that patients are more satisfied with the control of pain. These figures are visually misleading since their scales differ.</p>\n<p>Groups of graphs should use consistent scales, colors, order of categories and other graphical elements. Sometimes this is not possible because the values in the different panels vary so much. See The <i>Elements of Graphing Data</i> by William S Cleveland or my <i>Creating More Effective Graphs</i> for advice on handling this situation. Just because a single panel is acceptable does not mean the graph with several panels is also acceptable.</p>\n<p>Added a week later: This post has a happy ending. The IT folks at healthgrades.com became aware of the post, thanked me for alerting them to the problem, and quickly changed their figures.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 14:25:00 +0000","feedId":46447,"bgimg":"http://b-i.forbesimg.com/naomirobbins/files/2014/01/Patient_experience-210x300.png","linkMd5":"699aed7ec45bb4174ab091108951a190","author":"Naomi Robbins","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://b-i.forbesimg.com/naomirobbins/files/2014/01/Patient_experience-210x300.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602262027640}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 00:47:07","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 00:47:07","feedId":46447,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 16:47:07 +0000","fetchMs":38,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":242117,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"72e021969f56c10206ce79830911afb1","hostName":"us-035*","requestId":"4264be99d07a4409a0cda8ee93dddf2c_46447","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:41:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:04:20","id":46447,"name":"Effective Graphs","url":"http://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/feed/","subscriber":69,"website":null,"icon":"https://blogs.forbes.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-59-59-205_df10b0c8fbc25b62.ico","description":"[Please go to 'Settings' to change your Tagline]","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 00:51:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 00:51:09","id":null,"feedId":46447,"linkMd5":"699aed7ec45bb4174ab091108951a190"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602262027593,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":39,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":8,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":120377,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":120567,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-039.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-027.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
