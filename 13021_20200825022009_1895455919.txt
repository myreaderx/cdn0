I guess some users are going to hate me for this, so I want to explain the rationale in this post.</p>\n\n<p>Four years ago, a couple of R users, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_inundata/status/510448862880727040\">including Karthik</a>, requested Github to add this feature. Since then, I have found it more bothersome than convenient, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/662332967532957700\">eventually thought it was a mistake</a>. There are rarely things that are absolutely good or bad. It is always about trade-offs. Rendering Rmd as Markdown has the one and only advantage: it makes the text of Rmd files more human-readable, because reading a rendered output file (an HTML page) is more pleasant than reading the (Rmd) source file.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the disadvantages outweigh the advantage, and obviously I do think so. There are two drawbacks of rendering Rmd as Markdown on Github.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"r-markdown-is-not-100-markdown\">R Markdown is not 100% Markdown</h2>\n\n<p>R Markdown is a source format, which looks like Markdown, but it is not equivalent to Markdown. The bottom line is that the source is the source. If it needs to be rendered (to HTML), it has to be rendered in the way that it is supposed to be rendered (via the R package <a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com\"><strong>rmarkdown</strong></a>). Rendering <code>*.Rmd</code> as <code>*.md</code> on Github loses critical information, which can be highly confusing. In particular, the code chunk headers are lost, and the chunk headers can be critical for the purpose of learning. For example, when you see a nice R Markdown output page somewhere, and you may want to know how it was generated. Then you go to the Github repo, open the <code>*.Rmd</code> source file, and you cannot see the full source code in the default normal view.</p>\n\n<p>There have been people who struggled with trying to show other people the verbatim source Rmd file. One day I saw an instructor posted an Rmd example on Github, and tweeted about it with the Github raw link to the Rmd file. Then it seemed she was not happy with the raw link, because it pointed to a plain text page. Then she indented the whole content of the Rmd file by four spaces, which would make it easier for people to see the Rmd source from the normal Github view, but the Rmd source was essentially wrong. In short, between a nice view and the correct Rmd source, you could only choose one.</p>\n\n<p>Later I emailed her and she told me her students were often confused, too:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] that is sad! I was teaching R Markdown the other day with a github repository full of .Rmd solution files and someone pointed out that they don&rsquo;t get the solution precisely because of this! Quite a lot of people (especially beginners) don&rsquo;t know they can check &ldquo;Raw&rdquo; to see the raw content so it&rsquo;s quite a pity it&rsquo;s treated as a Markdown file now :(</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have many Rmd examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples\">knitr-examples</a> repo, and I have always been worried that users don&rsquo;t know how to read the source of these Rmd files. The chunk options in these examples are vital in teaching them <strong>knitr</strong> features.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"linking-to-specific-lines-of-rmd-files\">Linking to specific lines of Rmd files</h2>\n\n<p>The other thing that deeply bothered me was that I could not link to specific lines in an Rmd file. For those who are familiar with Github, you know when you click the line numbers in a source file on Github, you can get a permanent link to a line or multiple lines like <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/blob/44895dd/R/utils.R#L269\">https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/blob/44895dd/R/utils.R#L269</a>. This feature is great because it saves you time to say something like &ldquo;Hey, open the file <code>R/utils.R</code>, take a look at the line #269, and you&rsquo;ll learn a great thing&rdquo;. This is extremely useful for many purposes, such as teaching others a specific trick or reporting bugs. A simple link takes your audience to the specific destination. They don&rsquo;t need to clone or download your repo or follow the multiple-step instructions.</p>\n\n<p>When Rmd is rendered as Markdown, I have to use a hack to obtain such links. That is, use the &ldquo;Blame view&rdquo; of the Rmd file. For example: <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blame/master/inst/examples/lucy-demo.Rmd#L20\">https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blame/master/inst/examples/lucy-demo.Rmd#L20</a>. This view looks odd, because it also presents all commit messages in the history of this file in the left column. I don&rsquo;t know if beginners understand what &ldquo;blame&rdquo; means in GIT, or are aware of the &ldquo;Blame&rdquo; button.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apologies-and-a-solution-to-a-new-problem\">Apologies, and a solution to a new problem</h2>\n\n<p>Before requesting Github to undo this feature, I reached out to a few people who were originally happy with the feature, including Karthik. <del>I threatened them that we would no longer be friends if they would not allow me to contact Github to revert the change. Just kidding. I didn&rsquo;t do that.</del> They all agreed that displaying Rmd files verbatim rather than rendering them to HTML was a better idea. However, I understand that whenever something has an advantage, there will be a number of users feeling annoyed if it is gone. Please accept my sincere apologies you are one of these users.</p>\n\n<p>Displaying Rmd verbatim on Github does bring one annoying disadvantage: (at least for now) Github does not soft-wrap lines in source files, so you&rsquo;ll have to use the horizontal scrollbar when the lines are too long. Yes, horizontal scrollbars on web pages are terrible! However, this problem is much easier to solve. We don&rsquo;t have to contact Github (<a href=\"https://github.com/github/markup/pull/1235\">actually I have contacted them</a>). If you hate anything related to CSS styles on the web, I&rsquo;d recommend that you install a plugin or extension in your web browser and change the CSS by yourself. For example, I have installed the extension <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha\">Stylebot</a> in Google Chrome long time ago (there may be better and newer extensions now), and I have applied the following CSS to github.com:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.type-rmarkdown .blob-code-inner {\n  white-space: pre-wrap;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you have installed Stylebot, you can click its icon (CSS) after opening any Github web pages, hit the &ldquo;Edit CSS&rdquo; button, and paste the above CSS code in it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/47231527-bcbd2b00-d392-11e8-8a77-193dc74a1d58.png#border\" alt=\"Before applying the CSS in Stylebot\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then you&rsquo;ll see the long lines nicely wrapped in Rmd files:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/47231528-bcbd2b00-d392-11e8-82df-a72f11dc1c29.png#border\" alt=\"After applying the CSS in Stylebot\" /></p>\n\n<p>I hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt you too much by asking for this change on Github. If I have brought any unexpected annoyance, please feel free to let me know, and I&rsquo;ll try my best to make it up. Thanks for your understanding!</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/10/rmd-github/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/47231527-bcbd2b00-d392-11e8-8a77-193dc74a1d58.png#border","linkMd5":"746c3dbea910035bfca16e77510dd46c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-36-342_e7e7c50202f2972a.webp","destWidth":1069,"destHeight":698,"sourceBytes":58289,"destBytes":61678,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/47231527-bcbd2b00-d392-11e8-8a77-193dc74a1d58.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-36-342_e7e7c50202f2972a.webp","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/47231528-bcbd2b00-d392-11e8-82df-a72f11dc1c29.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn27@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-20-00-704_35d9515a5bd81a6d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973444},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Slowly but Steadily, They Started to Help Me Answer Questions","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/help-answer-questions/","description":"\n        <p>Earlier this year, I said &ldquo;<a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/thanks-marcel-schilling/\">nothing feels better than someone else answering questions for me</a>&rdquo;.

It was a great issue, and I appreciated that she took the time to write such a detailed issue, so I tried to reply the issue as quickly as I could. However, if this issue were posted from someone I don’t know, I would be likely to delay the reply significantly (if a reproducible example were not provided, I’d just ignore the issue). I know this sounds unfair to many people, but with only two hands and 24 hours a day, I have no choice but to skip certain issues.</p> \n<p>What made me hesitate when looking at this issue was the incorrect format of the reproducible example. Here is what it looks like:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">---\ntitle: \"Presentation Ninja Headache\"\nauthor: \"Sam Tyner\"\n....\n---\n\n\\```{r setup, include=FALSE}\noptions(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)\n\\```\n\n....\n\n---\nclass: primary \n# Slide with bg image and  \"too much\" code\n\nHere is some code \n\n\\```{r}\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\nsummary(x)\ny &lt;- rgamma(100,shape = 1)\nsummary(y)\nsummary(x+y)\n\\```\n\n....\n</code></pre> \n<p>Did you notice the backslashes before three backticks? The reason that Sam put in these backslashes was because she forgot <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/05/four-backticks-github/\">the four-backtick rule</a>, which I had blogged about before, and frequently referenced in my Github replies. The rule is quite simple but many people don’t know it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>If you want to show N verbatim backticks in the Markdown output, you have to enclose them in at least N+1 backticks.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Without knowing this rule, users will find it hard to post a reproducible example in R Markdown that contains code chunks, because R Markdown’s code chunks use three backticks. Sam put the backslashes in front of the three backticks to prevent the text below from being rendered as code blocks in the output. However, what this means to me, as someone who plans to investigate the issue, is that I will have to copy this example, remove the backslashes, and run the example.</p> \n<p>Note the additional step of removing the backslashes. Sometimes that could be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_that_broke_the_camel%27s_back\">the last straw to break the camel’s back</a>. If I cannot simply copy an example and run it, I may ignore the issue and move on to the next 30 unread issues.</p> \n<p>You may call me inconsiderate, but before I wrote this blog post, I have edited hundreds of Github issues as well as Stack Overflow posts over the years to correct their formatting problems. This three-backtick problem is only one of them. Other common problems include:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Do not use verbatim code blocks, e.g., R comments are displayed as section headers because of the <code>#</code> character, or YAML metadata looks funny because <code>---</code> is interpreted as the second-level section header.</p></li> \n <li><p>Use the blockquote environment for a verbatim code block, i.e., <code>&gt;</code> instead of <code>```</code>. That is wrong. The Markdown content in the “blockquote” may look funny when it contains special characters, e.g., a line starting with <code>+</code> could become a list item. Unless you really intend to quote some words, always use the syntax for verbatim code blocks. If you are not sure if it should be a quote or a code block, use a code block.</p></li> \n <li><p>Do not indent the content nested within a list item. I guess many people don’t know the four-space rule, either. I wish my eyes were not picky of such formatting issues…</p></li> \n <li><p>Do not put HTML tags in a pair of backticks. Because Github will ignore some HTML tags if you do not show them verbatim, the issue can look highly confusing to me. I remember once someone was talking about the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag, and I had no idea what the issue meant until I hit the edit button to edit his issue.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Now I have reached to a point where I feel tired of editing issues to correct the formats. I guess we could blame it on the surprising Markdown syntax, but anyway, now if I see an incorrectly formatted issue, I tend to<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Only-tend-to-Exc\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/05/github-issue-format/#fn:Only-tend-to-Exc\">1</a></sup> keep calm and quietly move on.</p> \n<p>BTW, if your reproducible example really requires external files, I strongly recommend you to compress all files into a zip archive, and upload it to the Github issue. I have also seen issues in which all files are provided as verbatim text blocks in the issues, with filenames indicated above the blocks. In such cases, what I will have to do is to copy these code blocks and save them as the associated filenames to my disk, then run the example. That is also too much work compared to downloading a zip archive and decompressing it. In short, if it is a single file, show the content in the issue; if the example consists of multiple files, use a zip archive.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Only-tend-to-Exc\">Only “tend to”.

One commenter (Michael&mdash;I believe I know this Michael) of that post pointed out the function <code>makeActiveBinding()</code> in base R. I have almost forgotten it. It was once the most magical function in my eyes, and was the foundation of one of my only two academic papers, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1408368571\">Reactive Programming for Interactive Graphics</a>&rdquo; (Xie <em>et al</em> 2014).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/43879425-a5818b36-9b69-11e8-98d8-51db61c66a2f.png#border\" alt=\"Figure 2 in the paper\" /></p>\n\n<p>Basically <code>makeActiveBinding()</code> binds a function to a symbol in an environment. The magic is that, when you try to <em>get</em> the value of this symbol, the function is executed without arguments, and when you try to <em>set</em> the value of the symbol, the function is executed with the value as its argument.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-toy-example\">A toy example</h2>\n\n<p>That may be difficult to understand if you have just heard of this function for the first time. Let me give an example by rewriting the &ldquo;sword&rdquo; sound effect I used in <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr-talks/blob/master/useR2014/2014-knitr-ninja-Yihui-Xie.R\">my useR! 2014 talk</a> (a few of you might still remember <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2014/07/a-few-notes-on-user2014/\">that</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">xfun::pkg_load2('beepr')  # install beepr if necessary\n\nmakeActiveBinding('sword', function(i) {\n  if (missing(i)) i = sample(1:11, 1)\n  beepr::beep(i)\n  i\n}, globalenv())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if you type <code>sword</code> in the R console and hit Return, you should hear a random beep. If you assign a number to <code>sword</code>, you should hear the beep corresponding to that number, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">sword = 11  # sword\nsword = 7   # shotgun\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When you try to <em>get</em> the value of <code>sword</code>, the argument <code>i</code> of the function will be missing. Basically the test <code>if (missing(i))</code> inside the function tells you whether you are trying to get or set the value of <code>sword</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-toy-implementation-of-shiny\">A toy implementation of Shiny</h2>\n\n<p>Active bindings can be a lot of fun to play with, simply because a function is executed no matter if you try to obtain or set the value of an object. When you have a function, you have the full control of the world. I have shown an example of brushing a scatterplot in the paper I mentioned in the beginning of this post. Next I&rsquo;m going to show a super naive implementation of <a href=\"https://shiny.rstudio.com\">Shiny</a> based on active bindings.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">input  = new.env()\noutput = list()\n# a dependency table, e.g. list(input1 = c('output1', 'output2'))\ndeps = list()\n# name of the current output being rendered\noutput_cur = NA\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A new input in the system is an active binding in the <code>input</code> environment. When we need to get the value of the input element, we try to connect it with the output element that actually uses this input value, and store this information in the dependency table <code>deps</code>, so that we know which output elements to render when the input element is changed later.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">add_input = function(ID, init = 0) {\n  makeActiveBinding(ID, local({\n    val = init\n    function(new) {\n      if (missing(new)) {\n        # figure out which outputs use my value\n        if (!is.na(output_cur)) {\n          deps[[ID]] &lt;&lt;- unique(c(deps[[ID]], output_cur))\n          output_cur &lt;&lt;- NA\n        }\n        return(val)\n      }\n      # if value not changed, do nothing\n      if (identical(val, new)) return()\n      # trigger changes in relevant outputs\n      val &lt;&lt;- new\n      for (i in deps[[ID]]) output[[i]]()\n    }\n  }), input)\n}\n\nadd_input('slider', 0)\nadd_input('toggle', TRUE)  # not used this example\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we provide a couple of output elements. One uses the value <code>input$slider</code>, and one does not.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">output$render_value = function() {\n  message('The slider value is ', input$slider)\n}\noutput$render_random = function() {\n  message('A random value is ', rnorm(1))\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, we generate all outputs to build the dependency table.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># figure out which output depends on which input\nlocal(for (i in names(output)) {\n  output_cur &lt;&lt;- i\n  output[[i]]()\n  output_cur &lt;&lt;- NA\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now our system should know that when <code>input$slider</code> is modified, <code>output$render_value()</code> should be called (but not <code>output$render_random()</code> since it does not depend on <code>input$slider</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you are dragging a &ldquo;slider&rdquo; to modify its value (we just directly assign values to the &ldquo;slider&rdquo; below):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">input$slider = 5\n#&gt; The slider value is 5\ninput$slider = 5  # nothing happens\ninput$slider = 100\n#&gt; The slider value is 100\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the above &ldquo;Shiny&rdquo; system written in 40 lines of code actually works. The real Shiny framework is certainly far more complicated than that (thousands of lines of R and JS code), but the toy implementation has shown the possibility of automatically executing a function (mostly for side-effects) when you modify an object.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"r-objects-as-command-aliases\">R objects as &ldquo;command aliases&rdquo;</h2>\n\n<p>The reason that Michael pointed out <code>makeActiveBinding()</code> was because Baptiste Auguie wanted a shortcut for <code>system('open .')</code>. Here is how you could do it:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">makeActiveBinding('open', function() {\n  system('open .')\n  invisible(getwd())\n}, globalenv())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then when you type <code>open</code> in the R console, your current working directory should be opened in your file viewer. This example only works on macOS. For other OSes, you need other commands (perhaps <code>xdg-open</code> for Linux, and <code>shell.exec()</code> for Windows).</p>\n\n<p>The object can be viewed as an alias of a function, in which you can run arbitrary commands.

I was very glad to know that. In this post, I want to briefly explain how to publish a book with Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC. Actually I <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2013/06/tips-for-writing-an-r-book/\">blogged about it</a> five years ago after I published my first book, but at that time, I was still in the LaTeX (LyX) world, and this time I want to talk about R Markdown instead. I have also written about my experience with <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/09/the-bookdown-book-in-retrospect/\">the <strong>bookdown</strong> book</a> and <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/12/blogdown-book/\">the <strong>blogdown</strong> book</a> previously.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-minimal-template-bookdown-crc\">The minimal template <code>bookdown-crc</code></h2>\n\n<p>While I was working on <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown\">the <strong>bookdown</strong> book</a> in 2016, I created a minimal book example on Github in the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-crc\">https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-crc</a>. This repository contains the LaTeX class file <code>krantz.cls</code> as well as many LaTeX tricks that I copied and pasted from Stack Overflow (e.g., how to print the page numbers in the correct format&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need <code>\\frontmatter</code>, <code>\\mainmatter</code>, and <code>\\backmatter</code>). Hopefully they will save you a lot of time. Basically you can just start writing the content of your book after you clone or download this repository.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/43736420-218f56ec-9983-11e8-8740-ec0a1fce660f.png#border\" alt=\"The front page of the bookdown-crc example\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-started\">Get started</h2>\n\n<p>The first file you may edit is <code>index.Rmd</code>, in which you should change at least the title and author in the YAML metadata. You should update the <code>github-repo</code> field if your book source is available on Github, otherwise just delete this field.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>index.Rmd</code> is the preface of your book. It usually contains unnumbered sections (the syntax is <code>{-}</code> after a section header), such as &ldquo;Why read this book&rdquo; and &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>You can edit/rename existing chapters (e.g., <code>01-introduction.Rmd</code>), or add new chapters. When you need an appendix, you need a special header <code># (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}</code>, which you can find in <code>90-more.Rmd</code> in the example. Any chapters after this chapter will be in the appendix.</p>\n\n<p>If you need an index at the end of your book, currently you have to use the raw LaTeX command <code>\\index{}</code> in Markdown. When building your book to PDF, an index page will be generated automatically. Please note that you have to escape special LaTeX characters in <code>\\index{}</code>, e.g., <code>\\index{bookdown::pdf\\_book}</code> (the underscore should be escaped).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customization\">Customization</h2>\n\n<p>I have talked about the possible options to customize the PDF in <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishers.html\">Section 6.3</a> of the <strong>bookdown</strong> book. You are free to use any typeface you like. I have used Alegreya, Palatino, and Source Code Pro myself. When choosing fonts for your code blocks, I suggest you use either a relatively narrow font or reduce the font size (e.g., I use 70%), because your code can easily exceed the page margin when printed on a book (the paper size is roughly B5, which can hold about 55 characters on a line of code).</p>\n\n<p>I think the typeface should be the only thing you may want to customize. Other things are trivialities and not worth too much time. Don&rsquo;t be preoccupied with customizing the appearance of your PDF (at least don&rsquo;t do this too early). I guess the No.1 reason that authors fail to publish their books is not because the PDF does not look good, but they just cannot get the book done. Think about what is essential, and what are cosmetic issues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"need-more-examples\">Need more examples?</h2>\n\n<p>The above example is a minimal one. If you want full examples, you can find a few more from <a href=\"https://bookdown.org\">https://bookdown.org</a> (e.g., the three of my books, and Hadley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Advanced R&rdquo;). They will be more complicated, but may be useful if you want to learn a particular trick, such as how to place two figures side by side.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"open-source-and-public-access-are-totally-possible\">Open source and public access are totally possible</h2>\n\n<p>To me, the most exciting change brought by <strong>bookdown</strong> regarding publishing books with Chapman &amp; Hall is that there has been a trend for authors to make the source of books and the web versions of the full books freely available online. Now Chapman &amp; Hall only asks for the right for printing and selling the books. Authors can keep the free online versions. I consider one of my life dreams fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>I have believed there are multiple ways of tearing down the paywall. Personally I want to choose a way that does not really hurt the publishers but benefits the readers nonetheless. I feel it is really unfortunate that some people think authors/readers and publishers must be enemies of each other, and we should either kill the publishers (by pirating) or (literally) kill ourselves. Sometimes we really need a little more patience and understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m looking forward to more exciting books! You don&rsquo;t have to publish with Chapman &amp; Hall. I just happened to choose them after hearing good words about John Kimmel from a random friend. You can certainly use <strong>bookdown</strong> to write books with Springer or O&rsquo;Reilly (there are examples on bookdown.org).</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/bookdown-crc/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/43736420-218f56ec-9983-11e8-8740-ec0a1fce660f.png#border","linkMd5":"1ffe5486d3b2e19aa31cc40ac595e042","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-209_864c7dc5cee09bf7.webp","destWidth":633,"destHeight":295,"sourceBytes":24078,"destBytes":13062,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/43736420-218f56ec-9983-11e8-8740-ec0a1fce660f.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-209_864c7dc5cee09bf7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973458},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"In HTML and the Web I Trust","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/","description":"<p>One <strong>bookdown</strong> user seemed to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conjja/status/1023621901602770944\">very unhappy</a><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5RqREyv.png\"> with</a> the HTML output format.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:And-two-months-l\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/#fn:And-two-months-l\">1</a></sup> Although I don’t quite understand how difficult it is to generate a PDF from <strong>bookdown</strong> (sounds like two mouse clicks to me in RStudio), this tweet did remind me of a broader topic that I wanted to write about: PDF/LaTeX vs HTML.</p> \n<p>In short, I believe <a href=\"https://www.authorea.com/users/5713/articles/19359\">LaTeX is dead (long live LaTeX)</a>. It will definitely survive for a few more years (maybe twenty or thirty years), but I believe HTML has much more potential to prosper. The fittest will survive, and HTML is the fittest. If you choose LaTeX, you are pretty much tied to PDF. If you choose HTML, you will have much more freedom and fun (e.g., interactivity). In terms of typesetting, HTML cannot beat LaTeX, but it all depends on how good you want the typesetting to be. On one extreme, you could spend an infinite amount of time on improving the appearance of your work, but I’m sure most people won’t do that. Getting things done is often more important than making things extremely beautiful or fancy. There has to be a point where you stop investing time in styling and typesetting. The question is when to stop. I tend to stop a little earlier myself, and I understand some people want to stop later.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/flip-table.jpg\" alt=\"Forget about formatting\" /></p> \n<p>One project that made me believe even more in HTML is <a href=\"https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed\">ReLaXed</a>. The typesetting quality of web pages will surely catch up with LaTeX, but on the other hand, LaTeX will probably never be able to catch up with HTML in other aspects.</p> \n<p>On a related note, last week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1022873179532996609\">I tweeted about my dream</a> of liberating authors from the typesetting tasks. I was envisioning that in the (far) future, it would be the readers instead of authors or journal editors who would decide how an article or a publication should look like. The authors should only take care of the content, and the editors only take care of the review. There could be a recommended style, but is not enforced. If an article is published in HTML, styling it with CSS will be much easier than LaTeX. Readers can even choose to do so in their own web browsers. Web designers could also contribute and share themes and styles. Choosing the style that makes you, <em>the reader</em>, the most comfortable when reading the document. Changing the style on the fly. Think about it. Why should we spend time on inventing a style and then blindly hope all readers will like it? People can argue to death on things like serif vs sans-serif fonts, line-heights, colors, white vs dark themes, and so on. What introduced these <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality\">bikeshedding</a> wars? I think it is our belief that what looks good in our own eyes must look good in other people’s eyes, too. Look! I’m using this beautiful font! How can it possibly look ugly in your eyes?!</p> \n<p>My blog post is relatively short, and I strongly recommend that you read the full article “LaTeX is dead” above.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:And-two-months-l\">And two months later, I heard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_p_simpson/status/1040689040419368960\">another similar complaint</a>. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/#fnref:And-two-months-l\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/flip-table.jpg","linkMd5":"6eeab7fea0072c0edf3480989aeaaad9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-33-744_1a90f01f5f8dfb3d.webp","destWidth":480,"destHeight":252,"sourceBytes":28125,"destBytes":21196,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/flip-table.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-33-744_1a90f01f5f8dfb3d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973458},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Quietly Struggling (with Software)","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/quietly-struggling/","description":"<p>Recently I was kind of amused by two instances of quiet yet long-time struggles with software.

I just tried to install it because I need to check the reverse dependencies of some of my R packages, which happened to use <strong>rJava</strong>.</p> \n<p>Anyway, if a software package seems to try to turn an average user into a sysadmin, that is probably not a good sign.

Seriously, it is awesome. But somehow it seems to have something in common with LaTeX: if you look at the output, it is often amazingly beautiful and elegant, but when you start to learn the source code, it starts to hurt (I have to say I’m much more comfortable with JavaScript than LaTeX, though).</p> \n<p>I’m sure if I learn it seriously and step by step, I wouldn’t struggle much. I kind of know JavaScript and SVG, but my brain has been poisoned by R graphics. D3 is even more low-level than base R graphics. I don’t want to spend too much time on learning it, so to some extent, I just deserve my failures.</p> \n<p>So I wanted to create a simple bubble chart after seeing <a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269\">the beautiful official example</a>. It turned out that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1022231125970903041\">it took me about six hours</a>, which made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JiaShenTracy/status/1022463247440601091\">Tracy Shen</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoldbergData/status/1022318653306548224\">Joshua Goldberg</a> feel relieved. The last time when I touched D3 was six years ago, and I still remember the examples of three dots.</p> \n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion?</h2> \n<p>Is there anything we can learn from these two examples? One obvious lesson is that it can be very normal for one to struggle with something, even if one is an expert in other areas. Another lesson is that you may soothe other users if you share your secret struggles.</p> \n<p>While I was writing this post, an idea came to my mind: How about editing a contributed book on all our failed attempts or struggles in installing/using software packages? I think it can be valuable because it will show the average users’ perspectives. From the perspective of software authors, everything may be obvious and easy, and they may not even be able to imagine the possible ways in which users can fail. One challenge for this book, however, is to avoid turning it into a book of complaints.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Not-sure-if-ther\">Not sure if there is an equivalent version in the western culture, but we sometimes joke in Chinese: “What made you so unhappy?

It was definitely one of the best bug reports I had seen over the years. I was busy with something else when I saw the pull request, so I only briefly looked at it. I found it did three things: (1) Fixing the original bug; (2) Adding a new feature; (3) Fixing another &ldquo;bug&rdquo; that turned out not to be a bug. These things were related to each other, but the changes did not depend on each other. For example, you could fix the bug in a PR without adding the new feature. So I suggested him submit &ldquo;bite-sized&rdquo; PRs if possible next time. That way, I can quickly accept one change without considering the other. For example, I may like the new feature (I do in this case), but am not satisfied with the bug fix. The new feature won&rsquo;t be delayed by the bug fix.</p>\n\n<p>The cognitive load of PR reviewers will also be lighter when PRs are bite-sized. Each small PR may take one minute to review and merge, but if three small changes are placed in a moderate PR, it may take more than three minutes to review and merge (1 + 1 &gt; 2).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1026831038587326464\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkAJYk6XgAAEVt2.jpg:large\" alt=\"Hey I've got a pull request for you\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Because I understand how busy developers are, I&rsquo;ll try to submit small PRs when possible, and avoid bringing too many changes in a single PR. For example, I have submitted <a href=\"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ayihui+is%3Aclosed\">three PRs</a> to Hugo so far. In <a href=\"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3639\">#3639</a>, I focused on the essential changes (making Hugo work with Disqus out of the box). I was not satisfied with the JavaScript code and wanted to make some cosmetic changes, but I refrained from doing it in this PR to make it really minimal and highlight the essential changes. After it was accepted, I submitted a separate PR <a href=\"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3655\">#3655</a> for the cosmetic changes. I didn&rsquo;t care if the second PR would be accepted or not.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of cosmetic changes, Leonardo actually paid close attention to my coding style, and tried to use <code>=</code> instead of <code>&lt;-</code> for assignments. That was very considerate of him. However, he can only win the second-place award for being considerate of Yihui&rsquo;s coding style this week, because Ian Lyttle will definitely win the first-place award for his PR <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/265\">rstudio/blogdown#265</a>: I didn&rsquo;t ask him to use the style</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">foo(\n  arg1, arg2, ...\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but apparently he noticed my style, respected it, and started the long list of arguments <em>below</em> the left parenthesis <code>(</code>. Of course, I&rsquo;m not saying my style makes sense or advocating my style (it is a weird style!), but it will be such a smooth experience to review PRs like this, since there is zero mental friction (as if the PR were created by myself). He also meticulously corrected <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/265#discussion_r170489377\">a funny typo</a> of mine in <code>NEWS.md</code> &mdash; apparently my brain was poisoned by the Rd syntax <code>\\code{}</code>. That was a great extra thing to do in a PR (no questions asked).</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This is what it feels like when opening a PR on Github only to find too many changes in it (cannot bite with a single bite):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/dog-fish.gif\" alt=\"Reviewing a PR with too many changes\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/bite-sized-pull-requests/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkAJYk6XgAAEVt2.jpg:large","linkMd5":"3f4b6197a0a782bebfe9b93dd3e44abb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn59@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-176_48c88fc6bf9e6b63.webp","destWidth":928,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":91901,"destBytes":54464,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkAJYk6XgAAEVt2.jpg:large":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn59@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-176_48c88fc6bf9e6b63.webp","https://slides.yihui.org/gif/dog-fish.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-20-04-185_c9b27a9053261aa3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973464},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Accidentally Pressing 'm' on xaringan Slides","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2020/04/xaringan-mirror/","description":"\n        <p>Ted Laderas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tladeras/status/1249827822174007296\">just discovered</a> a surprising and probably also funny feature of <strong>xaringan</strong> slides: when you press <code>m</code> on a slide, the slide will be mirrored.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVhHV5QU4AA_DVu?format=png&amp;name=900x900\" alt=\"The mirrored mode of xaringan/remark.js slides\" /></p>\n\n<p>Ted was certainly not alone, as you can see from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1249829850946211840\">Alison&rsquo;s reply</a>. Alison also said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have never once used this feature on purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first time I saw this feature in the JS library remark.js (on which <strong>xaringan</strong> was built) in 2016, I imagined a possible scenario in which it might be useful. That is, when you let your students work on an exercise, you can freely show them the solution on the screen, but&hellip; with the solution slide in this mirrored mode. Students would struggle to decide if they should just work on the exercise or twist their neck in vain for the next few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>I admit I&rsquo;m evil.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this reminded me of something in my childhood in the 90&rsquo;s. At that time, films were rare in my village. Films were typically played once or twice in the summer evenings every year. They were projected to a screen (which was pretty much a large piece of white cloth tied to two bamboo poles) in a large open place, so <a href=\"https://www.sohu.com/a/220821759_720273\">lots of people could watch together</a>. Sometimes it was so crowded in the front of the screen that I could barely see the screen because I was buried in the crowd as a little child. One day I figured out a solution, which was to go to the back side of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to read any characters on the screen, and usually there weren&rsquo;t many characters to read in the films. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter when pictures are mirrored&mdash;it was equally awesome no matter if Bruce Lee was kicking to the left or right.</p>\n\n<p>The really nice thing on the other side of the screen was that I could enjoy a huge dedicated theater. I have never had such luxury again later in my life.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays there is no way that you could see anything from the back side of a screen. For most screens, perhaps you cannot even go to the back side because you&rsquo;d just hit a wall. So I think it should be safe to present the mirrored solution slide to your students.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/look-hard.gif\" alt=\"No matter how hard you look at the screen, you won't be able to read it\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2020/04/xaringan-mirror/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVhHV5QU4AA_DVu?format=png&name=900x900","linkMd5":"63d720ab6b14dfc513c71e3f1d3d0665","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-35-216_a2beb8bd5a4861c0.webp","destWidth":895,"destHeight":423,"sourceBytes":29143,"destBytes":24364,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVhHV5QU4AA_DVu?format=png&name=900x900":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-35-216_a2beb8bd5a4861c0.webp","https://slides.yihui.org/gif/look-hard.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-20-01-558_3373bf108dfd7d9a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973435},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Pour Positive Energy into Github Issues","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/positive-energy-github/","description":"\n        <p>Github issues often make me nervous. Like emails, they are pretty much a TODO list made by others for me, and the items on the list keep growing. That said, sometimes Github issues could also be very amusing or inspiring. Last year, Miles McBain posted an issue to my <strong>tinytex</strong> repo, which only said &ldquo;<a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/7\">THIS IS AMAZING</a>&rdquo;. Of course, I loved this &ldquo;issue&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m excited when other people feel the excitement as I did when I worked on a project.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, I heard about the <a href=\"https://github.com/datalorax/slidex\"><strong>slidex</strong></a> package on Twitter (to convert PowerPoint to <strong>xaringan</strong> slides), but didn&rsquo;t have time to look into it until today. After briefly reading its source code, it precisely reminded of Miles&rsquo;s issue, so I also posted an &ldquo;issue&rdquo; titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://github.com/datalorax/slidex/issues/3\">This is amazing</a>&rdquo;. It indeed is. I have never thought about reading PowerPoint as XML and converting the content to Markdown.</p>\n\n<p>I always believe in the super power of encouragement. I knew people would love positive energy, but I was still surprised by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/datalorax_/status/1003867459999285248\">the Twitter thread</a> that Daniel Anderson started about the Github issue I posted. I was surprised in two aspects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I think it got the largest number of likes among all tweets that ever involved me. It is great to see this many people appreciated the appreciation.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>While I certainly enjoyed all GIF bombs in the thread (there was also a funny one in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pkqstr/status/1004242338057580549\">a sub-thread</a>), I felt excited again when Adam Gruer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGruer/status/1003943957724737536\">asked if it was possible</a> to bring the changes in Word/PowerPoint back to the original Markdown document. I think that is the biggest challenge in convincing Office users of R Markdown (currently it is pretty much a one-way process going from R Markdown to Office only). Let&rsquo;s see what Daniel could come up with in the future.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, there is no point of just blindly saying good words. That doesn&rsquo;t count as encouragement. The more specific your praise is, the more effective the encouragement will be, especially when you happen to point out the one thing that also excites the person you intend to encourage most.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/positive-energy-github/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b469822db2f81a3172da1e06c2ef2ea8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973461},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Is that a Mickey Mouse Blowing a Trumpet?","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/on-emoji/","description":"\n        <p>At one dinner last year, my 4-year old looked at the table and said &ldquo;there is a Mickey mouse on the table.&rdquo; I was confused at first. We didn&rsquo;t have a Mickey mouse toy at home at all. We only had a few music books that had the Mickey mouse in them. Apparently there was no Mickey on the table. Should I take him to see the doctor to cure his illusions?</p>\n\n<p>He pointed his finger at three bowls that I put against each other on the table. One big bowl, and two smaller bowls. Oh&hellip; Okay. A Mickey mouse it was indeed.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not as good as my little kid at recognizing shapes. Although it seems emojis are extremely popular nowadays, I often fail to figure out what they mean. They are as hard to decipher as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script\">oracle bone scripts</a>. Sometimes I also don&rsquo;t understand why they have to be used at all, since the alternative way seems to be much clearer, i.e., writing in text instead of pictographs. Are we so bored by our current writing system? Why are we so interested in going back to a writing system in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph\">3000 BCE</a>?

How about the rest of emojis?</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>emoji</th>\n<th>actual meaning</th>\n<th>what I thought it meant</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>🌟</td>\n<td>title of the talk</td>\n<td>bling bling! shiny! twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are?</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>🔈</td>\n<td>speaker</td>\n<td>the top half of a snap fastener</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>🔗</td>\n<td>link</td>\n<td>link</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>📜</td>\n<td>slides</td>\n<td>a raw spring roll wrap, ready to be filled with sausage, shrimp, mushrooms, and bean sprouts&hellip; yummy!</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>🎥</td>\n<td>video recording</td>\n<td>a Mickey mouse blowing a trumpet</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Except the Mickey mouse, I was mostly kidding above.

After reading my colleague Jim Hester’s feedback and doing some research on the differences between <code>brew install r</code> and <code>brew cask install r</code>, I decided to switch to the latter.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:One-reason-for-t\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/cranextra-macos/#fn:One-reason-for-t\">1</a></sup> Consequently, I changed the scope of the repository <code>macos.rbind.io</code> to only building the missing binary packages on CRAN. Windows users may have heard of the so-called “CRANextra” repository, which contains binary R packages that are not available on CRAN. The repository <code>macos.rbind.io</code> is also a CRANextra repository, but created for macOS users.</p> \n<p>The full documentation is on the repository homepage <a href=\"https://macos.rbind.io\">https://macos.rbind.io</a>. In short, you just add an extra CRAN repository in your global option <code>repos</code>, e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">options(repos = c(\n  CRANextra = 'https://macos.rbind.io',\n  CRAN = 'https://cran.rstudio.com'\n))\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then you will be able to install some missing binary R packages, such as <strong>RGtk2</strong>, provided that your R was installed via <code>brew cask install r</code>.</p> \n<p>While working on this CRANextra repository, I briefly looked at some users’ work on <a href=\"https://rattle.togaware.com/rattle-install-mac.html\">installing the <strong>rattle</strong> package</a>, which depends on <strong>RGtk2</strong> and <strong>cairoDevice</strong>. It was such a big mess! There were people still using MacPorts, and some were trying to edit the <code>gtk+</code> formula in Homebrew and building <code>gtk+</code> from source. With the above CRANextra repository, all you need is:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">system('brew install gtk+')\ninstall.packages('rattle')\n</code></pre> \n<p>There will be no more Step 1, 2, …, and 12.</p> \n<p>To be clear, eventually I hope this repository can be retired and CRAN can provide the missing binaries. From what I understand, the major obstacle at the moment is the missing support for OpenMP (<code>-fopenmp</code>) in the system Clang on macOS, so CRAN provided a homemade version of Clang. I don’t know why that is so critical, but I wish one day packages could just build out of the box (or at least make it possible to automate the process). Personally I always frown upon software that tries to turn average users into sysadmins: What does <code>-fopenmp</code> even mean? What is <code>Makevars</code>? And <code>SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS</code>? And <code>R CMD javareconf</code>? Sigh. We all love software.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:One-reason-for-t\">One reason for this was that <code>brew install r</code> does not support <code>cairo</code>, so you cannot use graphical devices such as <code>svg()</code> or <code>cairo_pdf()</code>. Anyway, <code>brew cask install r</code> installs the official version of R from CRAN, which supports features like <code>install.packages(..., type = 'both')</code>. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/cranextra-macos/#fnref:One-reason-for-t\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/cranextra-macos/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7f54b5ab26bc3298cf6f987c9cf6e4eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973460},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"The Ultimate Infinite Moon Reader for xaringan Slides","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2019/02/ultimate-inf-mr/","description":"<p>Recently I have been playing with WebSocket, partly due to the <code>chrome_print()</code> function in <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown\">the <strong>pagedown</strong> package</a>. Last Friday, it suddenly occurred to me that there could be a very interesting way to improve the user experience of the “Infinite Moon Reader” in the <strong>xaringan</strong> package (i.e., <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code>). After three days’ work, I have finally become happy with it:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/53144527-35f7a500-3562-11e9-862e-892d3fd7036d.gif\" alt=\"The ultimate infinite moon reader for xaringan slides: when navigating in the source, the corresponding slide in the output will be automatically displayed; when typing in the source, you can instantly preview the output.\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"two-unpleasant-issues-about-authoring-documents-with-r-markdown\">Two unpleasant issues about authoring documents with R Markdown</h2> \n<p>I have been slightly unhappy with the user experience of authoring documents with R Markdown. The two particular issues are:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>It is hard to hold the desire to preview the document. I feel like I want to click the <code>Knit</code> button after I write every single sentence. With <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code>, this problem is a little less unpleasant: you just save the document, and the output will be automatically recompiled and refreshed. However, this often takes a couple of seconds. Yes, even a couple of seconds bothers me.</p></li> \n <li><p>The source document and the output page are completely independent. When the documents are long, it can be time-consuming for the user to navigate to the R Markdown source corresponding to a certain part in the output, or go from a certain part of the output page to the corresponding source.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Fortunately, these general issues are solvable in the case of HTML5 slides, because slides are usually short and regular pages. It is relatively easy to establish the map between the slide source (Markdown) and the slide output (an HTML element).</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-new-xaringan-inf-mr\">The new <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code></h2> \n<p>If you install the development version of <strong>xaringan</strong> (I recommend that Windows users also install <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\">the latest preview version of RStudio</a> if you cannot preview <strong>xaringan</strong> slides in RStudio Viewer):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">remotes::install_github('yihui/xaringan', upgrade = TRUE)\n</code></pre> \n<p>and run the “Infinite Moon Reader” addin in RStudio, or <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> on an R Markdown document that has the output format <code>xaringan::moon_reader</code>, you should be able to observe these new features:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>When you navigate through the R Markdown source document in RStudio, the slide output will be automatically navigated to the page corresponding to the current line in the R Markdown source.</p></li> \n <li><p>When you modify the R Markdown source, you can preview the output immediately (by default, the delay is one second, but this is configurable via the global option <code>options(servr.interval = N)</code> before you run <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code>; you can set <code>N</code> to an arbitrary time interval, e.g., <code>0.5</code>). LaTeX math expressions can also be previewed. Code blocks will be syntax highlighted if necessary.</p></li> \n <li><p>When you click on the slides and navigate through them, the cursor in the RStudio editor will also be automatically moved to the first source line corresponding to the current page in the slides.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Please note that these features only exist for <strong>xaringan</strong> slides. General HTML output formats are not supported: no automatic navigation or instant preview, but the feature of automatically recompiling Rmd and refreshing output as soon as Rmd is modified and saved still works like before.</p> \n<h2 id=\"when-in-doubt-save-the-source-document\">When in doubt, save the source document</h2> \n<p>The above features work when the document is modified but not saved. The navigation won’t work if the numbers of pages of slides calculated from the source and the output are not equal (e.g., after you add a new slide in the source). The preview doesn’t run R code chunks, respect slide attributes (such as classes or background images), or understand any <strong>knitr</strong> code chunk options.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:One-exception-is\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2019/02/ultimate-inf-mr/#fn:One-exception-is\">1</a></sup> As soon as the source document is saved, the whole document will be recompiled, and things should be normal again.</p> \n<p>However, if you dynamically generate slides via R code, these features won’t work (<code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> won’t be that smart), e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, results='asis'}\ncat('\\n---\\n# A new slide\\n\\n')\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>In this case, it is hard for me to know how to map a line in the source to a page in the output.</p> \n<h2 id=\"please-help-me-test-it\">Please help me test it</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/commit/97922037b38a\">The implementation</a> was not super complicated. At least the mechanism was simple enough: create a websocket in the browser, keep sending the page information to R, let R send the source of the current slide back to the websocket when necessary, and render the Markdown source to HTML. I may have been too excited about the new <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> and failed to consider certain edge cases, so please help me test it and let me know what you discover or think.</p> \n<p>P.S.

You won’t really appreciate how powerful Pandoc’s Markdown is until you read the full manual once. The <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-link_attributes\"><code>link_attributes</code> extension</a> is just one of the many, many, many useful features of Pandoc’s Markdown.</p> \n<h2 id=\"what-s-target-blank\">What’s <code>target=\"blank\"</code>?</h2> \n<p>In Albert’s case, however, you still won’t know how to make a link open in a new browser tab unless you understand <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp\">what <code>&lt;a target=\"_blank\"&gt;</code> means in HTML</a>. The <em>two</em> prerequisites, reading Pandoc’s manual <em>and</em> knowing HTML, is probably why many users couldn’t figure out how to write a URL in Markdown to be opened in a new tab.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-real-tricky-issue\">The real tricky issue</h2> \n<p>Pure technical issues are often relatively easy to resolve. Things will become complicated whenever humans are involved.</p> \n<p>As I expected, there will be people who hate links that always open in new tabs, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bootvis/status/1042448271350943749\">Bob</a> in the Twitter thread:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Please don’t decide for the user. If I want to open a link in a new tab, my browser makes it easy to do so, and if I want to go back to your document, I use the back button.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Without <code>target=\"_blank\"</code>, readers can actually make the decision by themselves. If they do want the link to be opened in a new tab, they can right-click on the link and use the context menu “Open Link in New Tab”, or hold a key while (left-)clicking the link (e.g., on macOS, hold <code>Command</code>). This is no big deal<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:It-might-be-tric\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/target-blank/#fn:It-might-be-tric\">1</a></sup>. If you force a link to be opened in a new tab, you may offend readers who would rather hit the Back button instead of closing a new tab when they want to leave the new tab.</p> \n<p>The benefit of opening a link in a new tab is that <em>the state of the current page can be preserved</em> while you read the page in the new tab. This is not something that the Back button can absolutely guarantee. Many of you may have been warned when you make payments online that you should not use the Back button (because you may end up paying twice). What happens when you hit the Back button is not necessarily just to bring you back to the previous page.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, opening a link in a new tab may sound like a good idea (at least it never hurts technically), but as I mentioned in <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/\">a previous post</a>, it is easy to overdo good ideas. Users may hate it when too many new tabs/windows are opened from your web page.</p> \n<h2 id=\"what-on-earth-do-new-tabs-indicate\">What on earth do new tabs indicate?</h2> \n<p>Let’s back up a little from the technical stuff and think more about the core problem: what do new tabs mean, and when are you most likely to open a link in a new tab?</p> \n<p>There may not be a universal answer that satisfies everyone, but to me, a new tab means <em>a new context</em>. Then the question becomes, which links are more likely to take the readers to new contexts? I tend to think that an <em>external</em> URL indicates a new context. By “external URL”, I mean a URL that takes you to a different website. Roughly speaking, two websites are different if their domain names are different.</p> \n<h2 id=\"open-external-links-in-new-tabs-automatically\">Open external links in new tabs automatically</h2> \n<p>Finally we are back to the technical world again. On my personal website, I use a few lines of JavaScript to automatically add <code>target=\"_blank\"</code> to external links:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">(function() {\n  var links = document.getElementsByTagName('a');\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; links.length; i++) {\n    if (/^(https?:)?\\/\\//.test(links[i].getAttribute('href'))) {\n      links[i].target = '_blank';\n    }\n  }\n})();\n</code></pre> \n<p>To fully understand the code above, you have to understand URLs. You may think URLs are simple, but they may not be. People <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/valid-url/\">make mistakes</a> all the time. People <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1040441928087683072\">get confused</a> over and over again. Relative URLs? Absolute URLs? Absolute relative URLs? Protocol-free URLs? You may read my least favorite part of the <strong>blogdown</strong> book to know more: <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/html.html\">Appendix B.1</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/shoot-myself.gif\" alt=\"I'm just going to shoot myself\" /></p> \n<p>Long story short, when I add links to my web pages, I omit the protocol and domain in the URLs<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:This-makes-the-U\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/target-blank/#fn:This-makes-the-U\">2</a></sup> if they are internal links to pages that are still on my website (under <code>https://yihui.org/</code>), e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">[the knitr website](/knitr/)\n</code></pre> \n<p>and I use full URLs for links to other websites, e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">[the rmarkdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)\n</code></pre> \n<p>This way, I know that URLs starting with <code>https://</code> are supposed to be external links, hence I can detect them using the JS regular expression <code>/^(https?:)?\\/\\//</code>, which can match <code>https://</code>, <code>http://</code>, and <code>//</code>. Once I detect a link of which the <code>href</code> attribute points to an external URL, I add the attribute <code>target=\"_blank\"</code> to it. So whenever you see a new tab after clicking a link on my website, it means you are being navigated to a different website (be prepared for the new context).</p> \n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2> \n<p>I presented a way to make links open in new tabs without requiring the author of the web page to hard-code the <code>target=\"_blank\"</code> attribute in links, and at the same time, without annoying readers too much (hopefully). The fundamental assumption of this approach is: a different tab == a different context == a different website. Is this a reasonable assumption for everyone?

It saves a little bit typing effort since you don&rsquo;t need to type the quotes, but it also opens a can of worms, and introduces more non-standard things due to this non-standard thing (e.g., when you do code analysis, you have to make a special rule for the <code>library()</code> calls to make sure those &ldquo;variables&rdquo; in parentheses are not real variables but character strings of package names). The above <code>xfun::pkg_attach()</code> call is essentially a for-loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">for (i in c('ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'shiny')) {\n  library(i, character.only = TRUE)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"automatically-install-missing-packages\">Automatically install missing packages</h2>\n\n<p>It is also common to see code like this in R scripts (install a package if not installed or loadable):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if (!require('shiny')) install.packages('shiny')\nlibrary(shiny)\nif (!require('ggplot2')) install.packages('ggplot2')\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The argument <code>install = TRUE</code> in <code>xfun::pkg_attach()</code> allows you to do the above task, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">xfun::pkg_attach(c('ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'shiny'), install = TRUE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or use the shorthand <code>xfun::pkg_attach2()</code>, which is essentially <code>pkg_attach(..., install = TRUE)</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">xfun::pkg_attach2(c('ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'shiny'))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some people may argue that you should never install software packages without the user&rsquo;s permission. That is a good point. If your R script is meant to be run by other users, you need to be a little conservative, but some users may actually prefer convenience (i.e., don&rsquo;t bother me with error messages about missing packages). Of course, if you are writing a script for yourself, you can always use <code>pkg_attach2()</code>. If you want to ask for permission, you certainly can, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">xfun::pkg_attach(\n  c('ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'shiny'),\n  install = readline('Install missing packages (y/n)? ') == 'y'\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"suppress-package-startup-messages\">Suppress package startup messages</h2>\n\n<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like package startup messages. I think those messages are fine if they only appear once or at most a couple of times to a new user. When you see the same messages over and over again, you will be bored, but you cannot shout at your screen that &ldquo;I KNOW <code>dplyr::filter()</code> MASKS <code>stats::filter()</code>! PLEASE DON&rsquo;T TELL ME THIS AGAIN!&rdquo; when you <code>library(tidyverse)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>How to suppress package startup messages? As you could have guessed, the function is named <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages()</code>. Do you like it? I don&rsquo;t, because it is too long and often calls for disproportional attention when you read the code (worse if you have to call it multiple times). Do I have a better name? No (so I&rsquo;ll shut up on naming).</p>\n\n<p>If you are attaching a package in <strong>knitr</strong>, you can use the chunk option <code>message = FALSE</code> to suppress package startup messages, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">```{r, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that this will suppress <em>any types of messages</em>, including package startup messages. It might be a problem, but I often load packages in a separate code chunk in the beginning of a <strong>knitr</strong> document, so it is unlikely to suppress messages that I didn&rsquo;t mean to suppress.</p>\n\n<p>Since my colleague Winston <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1583\">was not satisfied</a> by this solution, I added a <code>message</code> argument to <code>xfun::pkg_attach()</code> to suppress startup messages (and he didn&rsquo;t like it, either, which was understandable).</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">xfun::pkg_attach('tidyverse', message = FALSE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The default value of <code>message</code> in this function comes from the global option <code>xfun.pkg_attach.message</code>, so you may set it in your <code>.Rprofile</code> to always suppress startup messages, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">options(xfun.pkg_attach.message = FALSE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wish the <code>library()</code> function has a similar argument, so I don&rsquo;t have to hack at it this way.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"will-xfun-pkg-attach-become-the-new-library\">Will <code>xfun::pkg_attach()</code> become the new <code>library()</code>?</h2>\n\n<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe so, and I don&rsquo;t mean so, either.

What happened to this post partially confirmed my thought in <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/05/right-easier-than-wrong/\">my previous blog post</a>: some people tend to do easier things that are not very helpful, and avoid doing things that are harder but tremendously more helpful.</p>\n\n<p>In Caddisfly&rsquo;s first post, (s)he showed good intentions: (s)he found a solution to a problem in a hard way (my bad), and wanted to share this solution with the community. Unfortunately, the answer was mixed right in the question. When I first saw the post, Caddisfly&rsquo;s reputation point was only one, meaning no experience in posting anything at all on Stack Overflow. Then the post was downvoted once, and a user voted to close the post. To me, that is <em>technically</em> understandable, but also very, very bad in terms of building a welcoming community.</p>\n\n<p>Downvoting or voting to close a question only requires clicking your mouse once or twice, which is extremely easy. Educating the beginner that an answer should be separate from the question requires you to type more words, which could take a minute or two, and therefore is much harder to do, but also much more helpful and meaningful (thanks, @gparyani, for doing that in the second comment).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/50164548/559676\"><img src=\"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-good-intention.png#border\" alt=\"A Stack Overflow post that shows good intentions but was voted to be closed\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps my words &ldquo;slap in the face&rdquo; are too strong. My point is that if a user is showing good intentions, we should try to welcome and encourage him/her. Formality problems such as splitting a post into a question and answer are fairly easy to fix, but kind users who are willing to share solutions are relatively difficult to find (some are busy, and some don&rsquo;t bother). Between the two choices, a Stack Overflow post correct in the form and a generous Stack Overflow user, which would you value more? I think the answer should be obvious.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/05/no-slap-to-smiles/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 07 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-good-intention.png#border","linkMd5":"95bc171b92056820aeab7c0a915f9981","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-138_c65c1e4992559618.webp","destWidth":759,"destHeight":835,"sourceBytes":53937,"destBytes":79064,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-good-intention.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-138_c65c1e4992559618.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973462},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"The Best Way to Support LaTeX Math in Markdown with MathJax","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/latex-math-markdown/","description":"<p>Recle Etino Vibal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/recleev/status/1020134832519565312\">discovered a MathJax trick</a> I used early last year in the hugo-lithium theme to render LaTeX math in Markdown. However, it was not an elegant trick in my eyes, and I came up with a much better way later. I mentioned before that <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/ian-lyttle/\">Ian Lyttle asked me a question</a> during rstudio::conf 2017, which was exactly the problem that Recle had. I believe a lot of Markdown users must have the same question, too, so I’ll share my solution in this post.</p> \n<p>If you use Pandoc or R Markdown, there is no need to read this post, because Pandoc supports LaTeX math very well. This post is only for plain Markdown users. If you understand Chinese, you may read <a href=\"https://yihui.org/cn/2017/04/mathjax-markdown/\">this post</a> I wrote last year instead.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-problem-of-latex-math-expressions-in-markdown\">The problem of LaTeX math expressions in Markdown</h2> \n<p>The biggest problem of Markdown is that it has way too many flavors that are not completely compatible with each other. One common problem, however, is that most of them do not properly support LaTeX math expressions (inline <code>$ $</code> or display style <code>$$ $$</code>). Even if the support exists, it is often awkward (e.g., in a flavor called <a href=\"https://github.com/miekg/mmark\">Mmark</a>, you have to use double dollars to write inline math expressions, which is wrong LaTeX syntax).</p> \n<p>There are two difficulties when you try to write LaTeX math with plain Markdown, as I mentioned in the <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/javascript.html\">Appendix B.3 of the <strong>blogdown</strong> book</a>.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>You want to make sure the Markdown render will not touch your special characters, e.g., <code>$x_{i} + y_{i}$</code> should not be rendered as <code>$x&lt;em&gt;{i} + y&lt;/em&gt;{i}$</code> (i.e., a pair of underscores should not mean italics).</p></li> \n <li><p>MathJax does not treat a pair of single dollars as an inline math expression (only <code>\\(</code> and <code>\\)</code> work). You may force it to, but you may have false positives. For example, in a phrase “I have a $10 and $5 bill”, the text between the two dollar signs is not math.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>It is relatively easy to solve the first problem: you can put your math content in a pair of backticks to protect it as <code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code>. Most Markdown renders will not touch the characters in this case, but this will bring a new problem: MathJax does not parse LaTeX math in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags. Again, you may force it to, but your math expressions will inherit CSS styles from the <code>code</code> tag. For example, if you defined</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">code {\n  background: lightgray;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>your math expressions will have a light-gray background, too. It is possible to remove the background color, but it is relatively complicated.</p> \n<p>Even if you use a pair of backticks, you still have the second problem above.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-solution-pre-process-code-tags\">The solution: pre-process <code>code</code> tags</h2> \n<p>I have mentioned and briefly explained the solution in the <strong>blogdown</strong> book, too. The basic idea is:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>You write math expressions in pairs of backticks.</p></li> \n <li><p>Use JavaScript to examine all <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags in HTML, and identify possible math expressions.</p></li> \n <li><p>Remove the outside <code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code> tags if they contain math expressions, e.g., convert <code>&lt;code&gt;$$x + y$$&lt;/code&gt;</code> to <code>$$x + y$$</code>.</p></li> \n <li><p>Additionally, convert a pair of single dollars <code>$ $</code> to <code>\\( \\)</code>, so that MathJax can understand it without any special configurations.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>My JavaScript solution is available at <a href=\"https://yihui.org/js/math-code.js\">https://yihui.org/js/math-code.js</a>. It is not very long (about 20 lines). After loading this script, you can include MathJax (even <em>asynchronously</em>):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script src=\"//yihui.org/js/math-code.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;!-- Just one possible MathJax CDN below. You may use others. --&gt;\n&lt;script async\n  src=\"//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML\"&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then in Markdown, you can write math expressions as usual, e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code>Hi `$z = x + y$`.\n\n`$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`\n\n`$$\\begin{vmatrix}a &amp; b\\\\\nc &amp; d\n\\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$`\n</code></pre> \n<p>Output (you can see the output on this page because I used the JavaScript code above):</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Hi <code>$z = x + y$</code>.</p> \n <p><code>$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$</code></p> \n <p><code>$$\\begin{vmatrix}a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d \\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$</code></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is the best solution I could come up with to support LaTeX math expressions in Markdown if the Markdown renderer does not have native support for them like Pandoc.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:I-used-this-tric\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/latex-math-markdown/#fn:I-used-this-tric\">1</a></sup> If you are able to use Pandoc, I still suggest that you use Pandoc instead of my hack, because it is targeted only at HTML output.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:I-used-this-tric\">I used this trick in the <strong>xaringan</strong> package to support LaTeX math, because the Markdown renderer <strong>remark.js</strong> does not support LaTeX math. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/latex-math-markdown/#fnref:I-used-this-tric\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/latex-math-markdown/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"377d41f9f3dabf1fdab8108cc7cf97cd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Using TinyTeX from a Flash Drive","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/tinytex-flash-drive/","description":"\n        <p>One nice fact about <a href=\"https://yihui.org/tinytex/\">TinyTeX</a>, the custom LaTeX distribution I created last year, is that once you install it, it is just a self-contained folder that can be moved elsewhere, even across computers of the same operating system. That is what &ldquo;portable&rdquo; means.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I pushed a new version (v0.8) of the R package <strong>tinytex</strong> <a href=\"https://cran.rstudio.com/package=tinytex\">to CRAN</a> mainly to address the issue of using TinyTeX from a portable device such as a flash drive. I added two new functions in this version:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><code>tinytex::copy_tinytex()</code> copies your existing TinyTeX installation to another location, such as your flash drive or a Dropbox folder (this could take a minute or two depending on the I/O speed of your devices). Of course, this means you have installed TinyTeX before (e.g., via <code>tinytex::install_tinytex()</code>). By default, it will pop up a dialog box asking you to choose the destination folder to copy to, if you don&rsquo;t want to explicitly provide a path like:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">tinytex::copy_tinytex('E:/Software/')\n</code></pre></li>\n\n<li><p><code>tinytex::use_tinytex()</code> asks you the location of TinyTeX, so that <strong>tinytex</strong> can find it later when compiling LaTeX documents. By default, it also pops up a dialog asking you to choose the TinyTeX folder, which can be on your flash drive.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood, it runs the command <code>tlmgr path add</code> to add TinyTeX to the environment variable <code>PATH</code> of your system (or create symlinks of TinyTeX&rsquo;s executables that can be found via <code>PATH</code>). If this fails, you still have a fallback plan. That is, set the global option <code>tinytex.tlmgr.path</code> and point it to the executable <code>tlmgr</code> in your system, e.g. (remember to replace the path in the example with the actual path to your TinyTeX),</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># a Windows example\noptions(tinytex.tlmgr.path = 'E:/Software/TinyTeX/bin/win32/tlmgr.bat')\n    \n# a macOS example\noptions(tinytex.tlmgr.path = '~/Dropbox/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can do this in your <code>~/.Rprofile</code> (recommended) or a code chunk of an R Markdown document that generates PDF output. Don&rsquo;t set this option in your R console unless you are trying to generate PDF in the R console via functions like <code>rmarkdown::render()</code> or <code>knitr::knit2pdf()</code>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One folder to rule them all.

The PDFs I generated from <strong>bookdown</strong> were directly ready for the publisher&rsquo;s printer (at least I didn&rsquo;t need to do anything else).</p>\n\n<p>I guess the moral is, if you want to use Feature X of a software package, you may ignore its documentation for the first time. If everything goes well, great. But when you run into problems, it is probably a good idea to read the relevant documentation.</p>\n\n<p>And don&rsquo;t panic.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/you-can-do-it.gif\" alt=\"You can do it\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/whole-bookdown/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/you-can-do-it.gif","linkMd5":"d831d9fcd09f13bcdbb2c4d1032ee949","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-19-35-209_f24dd66a489554ff.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":225,"sourceBytes":1031711,"destBytes":598588,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/you-can-do-it.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-19-35-209_f24dd66a489554ff.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Build Binary R Packages for the Homebrew Version of R?","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/homebrew-binary-r-packages/","description":"\n        \n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Update on 2018-07-01</strong>: I have changed the scope of the repository <a href=\"https://macos.rbind.io\">https://macos.rbind.io</a>.

The project is called <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">Homebrew</a>. In my eyes, it is <em>the</em> most successful open source project in history in several aspects. I saw an interesting graph <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nayafia/status/1004526578175361024\">on Twitter</a> a few days ago, which perfectly characterized the amazing community nature of Homebrew:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfDI76AUwAAHE8m.jpg\" alt=\"Magnet or Sticky?\" /></p>\n\n<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t really care about if a project is &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;, and I believe being magnetic is a lot more difficult and valuable than being sticky for an open source project. Okay, that is a little bit digression for this blog post.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-using-homebrew\">Why using Homebrew?</h2>\n\n<p>Do I need to repeat the merits of Homebrew? The key is automation. In most cases, you can install a system software package with one command, and it does not require <code>sudo</code>. Compare this with the traditional way of installing software on macOS: how many mouse clicks does it take for you to find, download, open, and install a package? No matter how inconvenient it was the last time you installed a package, the next time you will have to go through the painful process again if you want to upgrade a package. Worse, if you want to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/25925752/559676\">uninstall a package</a> installed from a <code>*.pkg</code> installer, sometimes you may want to kill yourself, and Windows users will be able to laugh out loud at you, since it is so awkward to cleanly uninstall a package on macOS.</p>\n\n<p>Isn&rsquo;t Homebrew just <code>apt(-get)</code> on Debian/Ubuntu or <code>yum</code> on CentOS? Well, I believe Homebrew did one thing absolutely correctly: it does not require <code>sudo</code> (and everything is written to <code>/usr/local</code>). This is important and a perfect decision for personal computer users. Yes, <code>sudo</code> makes perfect sense for a system with multiple users (e.g., a Linux server), but I really don&rsquo;t like it in the case of a single user installing software on his/her own computer. Requiring <code>sudo</code> also makes me nervous: What exactly will the installer do? Does it write to <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code> or elsewhere? I have no idea. I&rsquo;m just a dumb user of my own computer. I don&rsquo;t want to be a sysadmin, and I don&rsquo;t want to touch the directories to which I don&rsquo;t have write permission without inputting my password. If I touch them, I&rsquo;m likely to forget what I did someday.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"homebrew-and-r\">Homebrew and R</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to many contributors to <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/r.rb\">the R formula</a> in Homebrew, it is easy to install a pre-built binary package of R:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">brew install r\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For developers, you may also want TeXinfo (for <code>R CMD check</code>) and XQuartz (for R packages like <strong>rgl</strong>):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">brew install texinfo\nbrew tap homebrew/cask\nbrew cask install xquartz\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-missing-cran-repository\">The missing CRAN repository</h2>\n\n<p>If you use the Homebrew version of R, it will be super easy to upgrade or remove R in the future. However, the biggest problem is the add-on R packages from CRAN. Currently you can only install those packages from source with the Homebrew version of R (because it is not officially supported by CRAN), i.e.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">install.packages(..., type = 'source')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Actually, installing R packages from source may not be as bad as you thought. About 75% packages on CRAN do not need compilation, which means they are pure R packages, without C/C++/Fortran code. These packages can be easy and fast to install from source.</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of 25%, most don&rsquo;t require external system dependencies, so your Hombrew version of R should be able to compile them (you have Clang, and also <code>gfortran</code> from Homebrew&rsquo;s <code>gcc</code> formula). The only problem is some packages take long time to compile (e.g., <strong>stringi</strong>), so we may want to prebuild the binaries for them.</p>\n\n<p>The trickiest packages are those with (heavy) system dependencies, such as <strong>RGtk2</strong>, <strong>cairoDevice</strong>, and <strong>rJava</strong>. They are not too bad, either, because their dependencies typically exist as Homebrew formulas, e.g., you can <code>brew install gtk+</code> for <strong>RGtk2</strong>. The problems are: 1) you need to know the names of the formulas (you may look it up in the <a href=\"https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb\">r-hub/sysreqsdb</a> repo), and 2) the R packages may also take a long time to compile.</p>\n\n<p>With the above background information, the problem of &ldquo;the missing CRAN repository of binary R packages for the Homebrew R&rdquo; is actually not too bad. We may not really need to build 12,000 binary R packages. Perhaps building only the top 30 trickiest and also frequently used R packages is enough for most R users on macOS.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"an-experiment-macos-rbind-io\">An experiment: macos.rbind.io</h2>\n\n<p>I have been hoping to experiment with this for a couple of years. Finally I finished <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book\">the R Markdown book</a>, which pretty much swallowed the first half of my 2018. Then I got a short break mainly because I started to run the reverse dependency check for the <strong>rmarkdown</strong> package. To those who are not R package developers, this basically means I have to run <code>R CMD check</code> on more than 2000 reverse dependencies of <strong>rmarkdown</strong>. This usually takes a couple of days. Every time I do this task, I need to figure out how to install a few tricky R packages (same pain comes when I check the <strong>knitr</strong> package).</p>\n\n<p>This time I just gave up and decided to take a stab at building some binary R packages against the Homebrew version of R, so that I won&rsquo;t need to worry about installing them again in the future. I used the <code>osx</code> environment for the first time on Travis, built some packages on Travis, and automatically deployed to <a href=\"https://macos.rbind.io\">https://macos.rbind.io</a>. So far so good, although I have to admit I&rsquo;m definitely not an expert in compiling packages from source. I just have some bare minimum knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Currently the scripts for building the packages are in the Github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/homebrew-r-packages\">yihui/homebrew-r-packages</a> (I may move it to a certain organization in the future if a wider community shows interest in it). The main script is <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/homebrew-r-packages/blob/master/build.R\">build.R</a>, which I believe is not too complicated.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://macos.rbind.io\">https://macos.rbind.io</a> for detailed instructions on how to install these pre-built binary packages, as well as things that I need help with. You have been warned that this is only a quick experiment of mine over two days. Trust me: I&rsquo;m not an expert, I&rsquo;m not an expert, and I&rsquo;m not an expert (e.g., OpenMP? What&rsquo;s that?)! I&rsquo;ll be waiting for experts&rsquo; feedback and help!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"appendix-hello-rgtk2-finally\">Appendix: Hello, RGtk2, Finally!</h2>\n\n<p>In January this year, I wrote down some notes <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/install-rgtk2-macos/\">on how to install <strong>RGtk2</strong> on macOS</a>.

If that is the case, I’d like to talk about a very common situation in questions and bug reports in this post.

I believe most users understand this, but every now and then, I receive “reproducible examples” in the form of verbal descriptions when a full example can speak for itself. Had a full example been provided, I could be able to simply copy and run it, and hopefully see the problem immediately, instead of following a number of steps from the verbal description to prepare the example by myself.</p> \n<p><strong>Words can be ambiguous. Code is precise.</strong></p> \n<p>That is why you should provide a fully reproducible example whenever possible, instead of describing all the steps to create such an example.</p> \n<p>I have seen this kind of issues many times in the past, and finally decided to write this post after I saw <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1562\">yihui/knitr#1562</a> yesterday.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:And-rstudio-blog\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/copy-and-run/#fn:And-rstudio-blog\">1</a></sup> Think about the work I had to do for this issue:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>For step 1, I had to copy it to an Rmd document in my RStudio session.</p></li> \n <li><p>For step 2, I had to copy the code and put it in an R code chunk.</p></li> \n <li><p>For step 3, I had to add more headers, and it was unclear how many “more headers” or what kind of headers I would need.

Within five seconds, I was able to reproducible the problem after I copied and ran the full example.</p> \n<p>BTW, when you discover bugs about something that you can <em>see</em> on your screen, screenshots can be highly useful. They can be strong evidence of bugs. Although it is not really what I think in my head, but when you file a bug report, you may imagine that the developer would deny it if you don’t show enough evidence. If you provide a relatively simple reproducible example and attach screenshots, there will be no way for me to escape but acknowledge the problem, which means a much higher chance to fix it.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:And-rstudio-blog\">And <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/337\">rstudio/blogdown#337</a> is another example a couple of months later. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/copy-and-run/#fnref:And-rstudio-blog\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/copy-and-run/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/images/cant-do-it.jpg","linkMd5":"5015e3b52446e0501953454f1b0c185f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn97@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-34-033_a2c0ec3486007871.webp","destWidth":577,"destHeight":770,"sourceBytes":63747,"destBytes":41226,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/images/cant-do-it.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn97@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-34-033_a2c0ec3486007871.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973460},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"On a Clear Night","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/on-a-clear-night/","description":"\n        <p>When I finished writing <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/\">the <strong>bookdown</strong> book</a>, I started to think about what I should put on the dedication page.

The default behavior of MiKTeX is to ask you whether you want to install missing LaTeX packages, but it may fail to pop up the dialog box to ask you in the first place. I&rsquo;m still not sure why it could fail (I feel when MiKTeX is installed by the system admin, it may fail to pop up the dialog), but you can change the default setting and let MiKTeX install the missing LaTeX packages without asking. In the MiKTeX Console (you can find it from the Start menu on Windows), choose &ldquo;Always install missing packages on-the-fly&rdquo;:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/37617602-9e2ffe38-2b81-11e8-9e98-0853a08a4413.png\" alt=\"Always install missing packages on-the-fly\" /></p>\n\n<p>From the viewpoint of the developer, it is absolutely the right thing to do to ask users before installing the missing LaTeX packages.

Just stare at the screen, let LaTeX fail, and feel the miserable life? I don&rsquo;t think you want to do that. Convenience outweighs the potential risk of letting certain software install (random) packages automatically in this case.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>rmarkdown</strong> bug #1285 once again confirmed that <a href=\"https://yihui.org/tinytex/\">TinyTeX</a> could be a better option than MiKTeX on Windows.

Although I started learning English in middle school 22 years ago, and even have been in the US for more than 9 years, I still struggle with English as a foreign language on a daily basis. I’m only slightly content with my English writing. For reading, speaking, and listening, they are all miserable. In particular, my listening sucks. For example, when someone tells a joke in a conversation or talk and everyone laughs, I often have to smile awkwardly like an idiot, not knowing what exactly the joke was.</p> \n<p>Those who know me may think I’m being modest: “Come on, Yihui, you have written four books and given numerous talks in English! How could you possibly struggle with English?”</p> \n<h2 id=\"some-of-my-struggles-with-english\">Some of my struggles with English</h2> \n<p>You see my four books, but you don’t know that I used the dictionary for thousands of times. I use the dictionary when writing anything in English, including books, papers, software documentation, blog posts, Github replies, and emails.</p> \n<p>I read books almost every day, but I rarely read books in English. If I hear a good book in English, I’ll find its translation in Chinese (e.g., “Poor Charlie’s Almanack”, “Deep Work”, and “Principles”). My English reading speed is too slow, not to mention the trouble of constant pause to look up words in the dictionary. I guess my vocabulary is no larger than a 3rd grader of native English speakers. Even when I read books for toddlers, I often find words that I don’t know. In the adult’s world, some English words are just so confusing and I can never remember what they mean. Today I just saw <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Julie_B92/status/1058330883927797761\">the example of “bi-weekly” vs “biannual”</a>. There are too many hills for me to die on…</p> \n<p>For speaking, my biggest headaches are the pronunciation and my limited vocabulary. Let me give you four (funny) examples of my pronunciation problems:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>During my PhD defense in 2013, I said “paradigm” multiple times and pronounced it as “para-dig-m”. Yes, I said “dig”. I guess it didn’t matter, though, since I passed the defense anyway. It was quite some time later that I heard someone else said “paradigm” and realized my pronunciation had been wrong for years. I hate those silent letters in English. Tom<em>b</em>. I<em>s</em>land. Gra<em>h</em>am. Dam<em>n</em>. BTW, there is a Durham building at Iowa State, and most new Chinese students pronounce it incorrectly.</p></li> \n <li><p>I went to LA in 2015 and <a href=\"http://datascience.la/yihui-xie-presents-html-widgets/\">gave a talk</a> there on HTML widgets after <a href=\"http://datascience.la/joe-cheng-presents-shiny/\">Joe Cheng’s talk</a> on Shiny. It was in Joe’s talk that I learned for the first time in my life that I had pronounced the word “verbatim” incorrectly for years (I learned the word from LaTeX by reading). I thought “ba” in “verbatim” should obviously be as in “bat”, but Joe’s pronunciation clearly told me it should be as in “bake”. I could hear my inner world collapsed at that moment.</p></li> \n <li><p>One evening in September this year, as I watched my 3-year old playing in a park, I listened to Nick Tierney and Saskia Freytag’s podcast on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious/sweave-knitr-and-rmarkdown\">Sweave, knitr, and rmarkdown</a>. It struck me when Nick mentioned my book “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide”. Again, for the first time of my life, I realized I had pronounced “definitive” incorrectly for years. I thought it was similar to “definite”. I had used the wrong pronunciation in the promotion video of my upcoming <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/conference/\">R Markdown workshop</a> before I listened to Nick’s podcast. Damn it. They might doubt if I’m really the author of the book.</p></li> \n <li><p>Last weekend my neighbor’s son came to my backyard to play with my son. His parents followed him over. I was frying some sesame balls outside.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Cooked-sweet-pot\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/english-is-hard/#fn:Cooked-sweet-pot\">1</a></sup> I invited them to taste the balls and told them these were “see-same” balls. I’m not sure if they really heard me, but after I returned to my pot to fry the rest of balls, I overheard the wife told her husband that those were “/ˈsɛsəmiː/” balls. Wait? What is “se-sa-me”?!… What was worse was that when I came inside, looked it up in the dictionary, and realized that I had not only screwed up the pronunciation for ten years, but also misspelled it as “seesame” (which explains my wrong pronunciation).</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>I don’t really worry about the problem of pronunciation or even accent. I’m sure people can understand me in most cases anyway. The other problem, the limited vocabulary, is a substantial trouble in speaking. When I give a talk, I have to start a background process in my brain to find the proper words, and this parallel process may or may not succeed. During a talk, you cannot pause in the middle of a sentence, ask your audience to wait for a moment, and use a dictionary. In writing, it will be much easier since there is no requirement of immediacy.</p> \n<p>For listening, I have to blame myself for being too shy to talk to native speakers more often or ask them to repeat when I don’t get it. I can only deal with technical conversations. For conversations on other topics, sometimes I can understand 30% to 50%, and sometimes I’m basically deaf, especially when the environment is noisy, such as in a bar or when there is live music around. I feel most American restaurants are just too loud for me, so I rarely feel comfortable dining in those restaurants.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:My-listening-is\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/english-is-hard/#fn:My-listening-is\">2</a></sup> In a group conversation, I also feel awkward to interrupt others when I don’t understand certain things due to language problems (like, “Excuse me, could you repeat your joke and say it more slowly?”).</p> \n<p>By sharing my experience above, I mean it can be surprisingly hard to master a foreign language (at least for me).</p> \n<h2 id=\"why-wars-on-computer-languages-or-tools-are-a-waste-of-time\">Why wars on computer languages or tools are a waste of time</h2> \n<p>First things first: Don’t <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18319717\">ever</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18336202\">ever</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18342415\">ever</a> read comments about computer languages or tools on Hacker News.

Why don’t people also argue to death on human languages? My theories are:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Most people only have one native language. They don’t know enough about foreign languages. When they learn a foreign language, they know attacking this language will make no sense even if they see all kinds of unexpected rules compared to their native languages. For example, from the point of view of Chinese speakers, none of plural nouns (hence countable/uncountable nouns), the subject-verb agreement, or tenses of verbs in English make practical sense. Surprises to one language speaker may feel fairly natural to another language speaker who has learned all these “surprises” since he/she was one year old.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:For-example-just\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/english-is-hard/#fn:For-example-just\">4</a></sup> When talking about computer languages, people seem to forget this. They become snarky about surprises in other languages, even if they haven’t really spent any substantial time on learning the foreign computer languages.</p> <p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/wrong-usage.gif\" alt=\"Some people don't bother learning a language or tool seriously\" /></p> <p>I don’t mean you should spend 22 years on a computer language before you are qualified to comment on its disadvantages, but I won’t listen to arguments from someone who hasn’t learned a language for more than half a year. I guess if someone hates a language, he won’t even bother learning it seriously, so language wars tend to be shallow.</p></li> \n <li><p>Native languages of humans are learned when humans are still little babies and don’t have a choice. Computer languages are learned much later, and often consciously chosen by the learners. To some degree, you may feel insulted when someone criticizes or insults your computer language, because it implies you made a stupid choice of an inferior language, which often urges you to defend your wisdom. By comparison, if someone insults a human language, I believe everyone will agree that it is sheer discrimination, because we were pretty much born with our native languages.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>To sum it up, people are reluctant to learn a different language seriously, so surprises in other languages will stay in their mind and be denied forever. Computer languages also tend to become a part of people’s identities, which can be hard to deprive.</p> \n<p>There may also be people who lack the sense of inner security, and they seek confidence by looking down upon other people’s choices of languages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Mathematicians-s\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/english-is-hard/#fn:Mathematicians-s\">5</a></sup> This is apparently the wrong way to go, and unfortunately, it triggers endless wars, too.</p> \n<h2 id=\"keep-your-identity-small\">Keep your identity small</h2> \n<p>Paul Graham wrote an essay “<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html\">Keep your identity small</a>” in 2009.

I love my native language, so I blog extensively in Chinese, even though I feel Chinese people have been losing confidence in the Chinese language mainly due to the dominance of English (and endless English exams!). English makes me struggle, but I write frequently in English anyway. Of course, speaking of computer languages, I like R, and also find JavaScript a lot of fun. In early years, I used to scorn and make fun of SAS and MS Office (<a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2009/09/how-to-import-ms-excel-data-into-r/\">example</a>), but I have stopped it in recent years because it is absolutely not wise,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:If-you-read-one\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/english-is-hard/#fn:If-you-read-one\">7</a></sup> and I have gained enough confidence in R (as well as Pandoc’s Markdown).</p> \n<p>Sometimes I’m surprised that even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ivanov/status/243244721034637312\">leaders and experts</a> of extremely popular languages still need <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesmckinn/status/326771315170230273\">endorsements about languages</a> from higher-level experts.

I’d applaud the open-mindedness of the conference committee to invite Joel to give such a talk to (presumably so many) notebook lovers. I agree with Joel that criticizing a popular tool is not “an unhelpful way to spend time” (see slide #4). I wish there were more criticism to popular tools in the R world, and personally I’d welcome criticism and complaints about my own work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:It-doesn-t-mean\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:It-doesn-t-mean\">1</a></sup></p> \n<p>Joel’s talk triggered a lot of discussions on Twitter (come on, people, let’s get off Twitter whenever there is something worth a deep discussion). For example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hspter/status/1034511489632067584\">Hilary Parker doesn’t like notebooks</a>, either. Philip Guo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgbovine/status/1034626381735317504\">declared</a> that the summer 2018 ended with “the first great notebook war”. “A war between whom and whom?” You may ask. I guess it was a war between notebooks and editors/IDEs.</p> \n<p>Before I start this post, I want to mention that I know little about Python (I have written one short Python script in total in my life), and I don’t use Jupyter myself. In fact, I also rarely use any notebooks, including R Markdown notebooks. That is mainly because I’m a software developer (engineer). For this reason, I think I can understand Joel’s complaints about notebooks pretty well. My main point is that if you use notebooks for <em>software engineering</em>, you are probably using the wrong tool, no matter how popular it is. I’m not sure if Joel would agree with me, but if I were to give this talk, that would be my main message to the audience.</p> \n<p>While reading Joel’s critiques on Jupyter notebooks, I couldn’t help thinking whether they apply to R Markdown notebooks, or R Markdown documents in general, so I’ll mention how some of the problems have been addressed in the R Markdown ecosystem in this post, too.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-two-cultures-the-r-vs-python-culture-or-data-analysis-vs-software-engineering-culture\">The two cultures: the R vs Python culture, or data analysis vs software engineering culture</h2> \n<p>I feel a major difference between the R culture and Python culture is that Python users seem to <em>create</em> code more often, whereas R users often <em>use</em> code. There seems to be a strong atmosphere of software engineering in the Python world: in the beginning was the custom <em>class</em> (with methods). For R users, in the beginning was the <em>data</em>.</p> \n<p>I think notebooks are more suitable for a world where the data analysis culture is stronger than the engineering culture. Joel insists that even if you are only experimenting or prototyping, you should follow good software engineering rules (slides #46-49). I tend to disagree, because prototyping is prototyping, and engineering is engineering. Good software engineering is important, but I don’t think it is necessary to write unit tests or factor out code at the prototyping stage. It is fine to do these things later, but again, I agree with Joel that if you are going to develop software seriously later, you’d better leave the notebook and use a real editor or IDE instead (e.g., to write reusable modules or packages).</p> \n<p>How about doing data analysis in notebooks? Is “good software engineering” relevant? I’d argue that it is not highly relevant, and it is fine to use notebooks. Analyzing data and developing software are different in several aspects. The latter is meant to create generally useful and reusable products, but the former is often not generalizable—you only analyze a specific dataset, you want to draw conclusions from the specific data, and you may not be interested in or have the time to make your code reusable by other people (or it may not be possible). When the analysis is done, it is done (pretty much). Of course, if you happen to discover any parts that could be potentially reusable and useful, you could factor them out into a package, but I think this should be relatively rare—how many packages like <a href=\"https://dplyr.tidyverse.org\"><strong>dplyr</strong></a> have been abstracted or distilled from the process of data analysis? Not many.</p> \n<p>How would you write unit tests for data analysis? I feel it will be both tricky and unnecessary. For a function/method, if you defined it, you know what its expected output should be. For data, you often don’t know what exactly to expect in the output. For example, when you subset a dataset, how do you know the result is correct?</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">mtcars2 = dplyr::filter(mtcars, hp &gt; 100)\n</code></pre> \n<p>That is probably not something you, as a data analyst, need to worry about. It is the responsibility of the package author (the software engineer) to write enough unit tests in the package that you are using.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, data analysts often do tests in an informal way, too. As they explore the data, they may draw plots or create summary tables, in which they may be able to discover problems (e.g., wrong categories, outliers, and so on). Notebooks are great for these inline output elements, from which you can make quick discoveries.</p> \n<h2 id=\"what-do-notebooks-and-spreadsheets-have-in-common\">What do notebooks and spreadsheets have in common?</h2> \n<p>Or ask it another way, why are notebooks so popular? My answer is that they make the (typically boring and abstract) program code much more <em>tangible</em>. You can see the output of each snippet of source code right below the snippet of source code. Although Joel’s #1 complaint about notebooks is that it is hard to reason about the output due to the possible out-of-order execution of cells, I think being able to see the output inside the source document can actually help you reason about the code better. Yes, you can use the traditional way of running code line by line, and see the output in the console, but the distance between source and output is much longer. Imagine you create ten plots in ten snippets of code, it will be quite messy to have ten separate plot windows floating around on your screen, and it is hard to know which piece of code created which plot. It will be worse if a plot doesn’t have a title, in which case you may not even remember what story a particular plot is supposed to tell.</p> \n<p>I think notebooks are popular for the same reason that explains the popularity of spreadsheets such as Excel. I haven’t met a single software engineer who loves Excel. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1/status/1037462991015432195\">Everyone hates it and makes fun of it</a>, but why do so many users still use it? Again, Excel makes things tangible. You can touch the data (although it is usually a very bad idea), and draw graphics in a sheet that contains the source data (bad idea again). It makes you feel everything is well under your control: oh here is my data, and here is a graph next to it; oh I should use that column to draw the graph instead, so let me change it and I can see the updated graph immediately.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:I-have-to-say-th\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:I-have-to-say-th\">2</a></sup> You can do everything in a single place, and the short distance between the source (data) and the output is ace.</p> \n<p>Excel makes things tangible at the price of making things messy (e.g., it may contain manually edited data that is hard to keep track of, or merged cells or graphs that make it hard for other software to read the data). By comparison, although notebooks can mess up the state, but that is only an intermediate problem. At its core, it is still relatively clean and encourages the reproducibility principle, i.e., you shall use code to generate results automatically instead of manually copying and pasting results in your report. If you are concerned about the state, you can restart the session and recompile the whole notebook from scratch. Spreadsheets are often hopeless here—you cannot easily restart your brain and redo exactly the same things.</p> \n<h2 id=\"things-joel-likes-about-notebooks\">Things Joel likes about notebooks</h2> \n<p>Joel mentioned two things he liked about notebooks: well-documented code (and the idea of mixing Markdown and code) and inline plots. I want to expand the first thing a bit. The idea should be attributed to literate programming, a <em>programming</em> paradigm invented by Donald Knuth. Knuth probably didn’t expect its popularity in tools for data analysis decades later, but I absolutely love the idea of writing narratives in a specialized authoring language (such as Markdown or LaTeX) instead of the traditional code comments. Using an authoring language makes the narratives easier to read. By comparison, code comments are always boring plain text with no structure or rich-text elements. Literate programming is more suitable in the data analysis culture.</p> \n<h2 id=\"joel-s-complaints-about-notebooks\">Joel’s complaints about notebooks</h2> \n<p>If I have read Joel’s slides carefully enough and counted it correctly, he mentioned the following 11 problems about Jupyter notebooks.</p> \n<h3 id=\"1-hidden-state-and-out-of-order-execution\">1. Hidden state and out-of-order execution</h3> \n<p>I agree when this happens, the output can be highly confusing, but I think the biggest issue brought forward from his arguments against notebooks is the lack of mentioning the serious problem of hidden state in all those “notable tutorials”, “definitive guide”, and “comprehensive beginner’s guide”. I care a lot about reproducibility, so does RStudio, and we have made a decision on Day One that R Markdown documents should be compiled in new R sessions, which will (mostly) get rid of the problems of hidden state and out-of-order execution. Although many users have complained about it and wanted to run R Markdown documents in the current R session instead, we have never changed the decision. After we created R Markdown notebooks, we have also been constantly alerting users about the potential problems of notebooks. For example, in our book “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide”, <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/compile.html\">we emphasized this issue</a> over and over again:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[…] Again, for the sake of reproducibility, you will need to compile the whole document eventually in a clean environment.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Joel admitted that “the ipython console has plenty of hidden state, too” (slide #26) but he “can scroll back and see the command history to reason about the state” (slide #27). Jupyter provided the <code>%history</code> magic to print the command history, and Joel thought it was too much hassle and counterintuitive. I want to mention that this isn’t a problem for R Markdown notebooks. When you run cells (we call them “code chunks” in the R world), you can always see the history in the “History” pane in RStudio, e.g., I ran the second cell before the first one, and you can tell it from the right pane below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/45166263-379ffd00-b1bc-11e8-9ade-ceeaeef7b594.png\" alt=\"Command history of R Markdown notebooks in RStudio\" /></p> \n<p>Anyway, I think as long as Jupyter users are educated well enough to develop the habit of recompiling the whole notebook from scratch in the end instead of just leaving the results from out-of-order execution as the final product, Jupyter is probably fine.</p> \n<h3 id=\"2-notebooks-are-difficult-for-beginners\">2. Notebooks are difficult for beginners</h3> \n<p>This (slides #33-43) is essentially a corollary of the above hidden state issue. Joel suggested that the (beginner’s) tutorials scream out loud “DON’T RUN YOUR CELLS OUT OF ORDER YOU FOOL”. I can see the point, but honestly this is not strictly true. Some cells may be independent and do not introduce (hidden) state, and they could be run in arbitrary order, which is sometimes a benefit (you can work on a small part of the notebook a time). Allowing users to run cells in an arbitrary order doesn’t necessarily mean giving them enough rope to hang themselves. Even when you script in a text editor or IDE, I don’t believe you always run the code in the linear order from beginning to end—you may still need to focus on or iterate certain parts from time to time.</p> \n<h3 id=\"3-notebooks-encourage-bad-habits\">3. Notebooks encourage bad habits</h3> \n<p>Joel mentioned three bad habits encouraged by notebooks:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Unnamed notebooks like <code>Untitled24.ipynb</code>, <code>Untitled25.ipynb</code>, etc. I don’t believe this problem is specific to Jupyter notebooks. Everyone must have a bunch of these files (<code>Untitled.docx</code>, <code>Untitled.pptx</code>, <code>Untitled23.R</code>, <code>Untitled5.Rmd</code>, …). Sometimes it is just that the file is not worth saving, and sometimes the user is just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/959806329693941760\">too busy</a> or lazy to name a file, which is completely understandable.</p></li> \n <li><p>Notebooks don’t encourage users to follow good software engineering rules. I tend to agree with the person (whose name was blacked out on slide #46) that data science is not about creating software. However, Joel’s “data science” might involve more “creating software” than others. After all, who knows what “data science” really means…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:I-only-know-that\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:I-only-know-that\">3</a></sup> Of course, if your data science is about creating software, you should definitely follow software engineering rules.</p></li> \n <li><p>Notebooks encourage users to import notebooks instead of writing modules or libraries. Joel’s complaint here (slides #50-53) makes perfect sense to me.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Joel-mainly-crit\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:Joel-mainly-crit\">4</a></sup> If you want to import code, import code (instead of a notebook). That’s it.</p> <p>Importing a notebook in another is not necessarily a totally bad idea, if you actually import the whole thing (not only the code but also text). This feature is known as “<a href=\"https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/child/\">child documents</a>” in the R Markdown world (actually in the broader <strong>knitr</strong> world). I think this is a very useful feature, because you can break a giant notebook into smaller ones, on which you can work individually. In the end, you can compile the master notebook, which will run the child notebooks.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<h3 id=\"4-notebooks-discourage-modularity-and-testing\">4. Notebooks discourage modularity and testing</h3> \n<p>As I said earlier, if you use notebooks to develop software, you are probably using the wrong tool.</p> \n<h3 id=\"5-jupyter-s-autocomplete-linting-and-way-of-looking-up-the-help-are-awkward\">5. Jupyter’s autocomplete, linting, and way of looking up the help are awkward</h3> \n<p>Again, don’t use notebooks to develop software. However, autocomplete and linting are also very helpful even when you are not developing software. I cannot say anything for Jupyter, but for R Markdown notebooks, you get autocomplete and linting “for free” from the RStudio IDE, e.g.,</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/45172761-e7c93200-b1cb-11e8-83ad-b19be396526b.png\" alt=\"Variable defined but not used\" /></p> \n<p>For the help info of a function, you will see the hint as you type the function name.

Most tools for helping you write code work anywhere. I know it is unfair to compare Jupyter with an fully functional IDE, but using an IDE gives you access to many features that a notebook alone cannot easily provide.</p> \n<h3 id=\"6-notebooks-encourage-bad-processes\">6. Notebooks encourage bad processes</h3> \n<p>Joel thinks it is an extremely bad idea for two notebooks to share state. I agree that sharing state can make things complicated (and introduce potential security risks), but Joel didn’t answer the question on slide #75: if the data is huge, reading it once in one notebook and letting another notebook have access to it may be a good idea (or perhaps the only way to go, given the memory limit or time constraint). I think this is fine as long as the user knows clearly what he/she is doing.</p> \n<p>Note that when we run scripts in an editor environment, we usually also use a shared process when different scripts are executed interactively in the same console. This is not necessarily bad when doing exploratory data analysis.</p> \n<h3 id=\"7-notebooks-hinder-reproducible-extensible-science\">7. Notebooks hinder reproducible + extensible science</h3> \n<p>Joel quoted another person on slide #78 that “poorly factored code is bad science”. Again, it sounds like he was talking more on the software engineering side. I have no doubt that notebooks are not a great medium to distribute reusable and extensible code.</p> \n<p>But… the particular example (the Github repo using neural network to generate music) he used is not very convincing to me. Some problems in the example (slide #84) are completely irrelevant to using notebooks, such as the hard-coded paths, hard-coded parameters, and lack of comments. These problems are very common outside the notebook world, too. As you gain more experience in software engineering, you will surely know that hard-coded paths and parameters are very bad, and you shall comment your code, but these things really take time to learn. The mindset of writing code that can be easily used by others is even harder to obtain. Practically, the authors may not just have the time and only want to get things done for themselves. I don’t believe it is the notebook that <em>encouraged</em> these poor practices. On a side note, I actually think notebooks encourage commenting, but it cannot force the user to write enough narratives about the code.</p> \n<p>In my opinion, the valid points in his arguments are:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>If you use notebooks as the only medium to distribute software, you will force other people (who want to reuse your code) to use notebooks, too. This is pretty bad.</p></li> \n <li><p>Jupyter doesn’t offer a way to manage requirements (<code>requirements.txt</code>).</p> <p>I have a question, though. Should it be the responsibility of the notebook tool (such as Jupyter) to manage requirements? Not necessarily. There may be third-party solutions. I don’t know enough about Python (maybe <code>virtualenv</code> or conda environments?). In R, there are multiple solutions, one of which is <a href=\"https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/\"><strong>packrat</strong></a>. As you might have guessed, RStudio has integration with <strong>packrat</strong>, which works for any RStudio projects (the project doesn’t have to contain notebooks). Again, this is something an IDE can give you for free but may be too much for a notebook tool to offer.</p> <p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/45180674-af345300-b1e1-11e8-8199-9c81fe0ec64d.png\" alt=\"Enable packrat in an RStudio project\" /></p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Except for these two points, I wouldn’t attribute the problems Joel mentioned to notebooks. If there is anything to blame, I guess we have to blame the popularity of notebooks—so popular that people even use them to write software (perhaps they are just victims of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument\">law of the hammer?</a>).</p> \n<h3 id=\"8-notebooks-make-it-hard-to-copy-and-paste-into-slack-github-issues\">8. Notebooks make it hard to copy and paste into Slack/Github issues</h3> \n<p>The main lesson I learned from this part of Joel’s slides (#91-102) is that users often don’t know how to create <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/09/the-minimal-reprex-paradox/\"><em>minimal</em> reproducible examples</a>. If you know how to minimize an example, you can probably completely get rid of the notebook and provide pure code when asking questions (unless your problem is actually caused by the notebook itself). Debugging code in a notebook is certainly less pleasant than debugging pure code.</p> \n<p>On slide #102, I’m curious since Joel doesn’t like notebooks, why did he use the notebook format himself to file <a href=\"https://github.com/chimpler/pyhocon/issues/171\">the Github issue</a>? Did he just file the issue for someone else who passed a notebook to him? I didn’t get the point of this slide (maybe I should watch the video recording if it exists somewhere).</p> \n<p>Anyway, Jupyter notebooks are not easy to copy and paste because they are not plain text. Well, they are, but they are essentially JSON and feel more like Word (essentially XML) instead of the plain text in the sense of <code>.txt</code>. By comparison, R Markdown documents are true plain text (in the sense of <code>.txt</code>), so you can easily <code>Ctrl + C</code> and <code>Ctrl + V</code> (or <code>Command + C/V</code>).</p> \n<h3 id=\"9-errors-will-always-halt-execution\">9. Errors will always halt execution</h3> \n<p>…unless you install a certain notebook extension. The installation seems to be too much work for Joel and users with whom he wants to share the notebook.</p> \n<p>In R Markdown, you just set the chunk option <code>error = TRUE</code>, and errors will be shown in the output without halting the process. This is very convenient and useful for people who write tutorials to demonstrate errors on purpose. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, error=TRUE}\n1 + \"a\"\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then in the output document you will see the error message:</p> \n<pre><code>Error in 1 + \"a\" : non-numeric argument to binary operator\n</code></pre> \n<p>By default (<code>error = FALSE</code>), errors will halt the R process.</p> \n<h3 id=\"10-notebooks-make-it-easy-to-teach-poorly\">10. Notebooks make it easy to teach poorly</h3> \n<p>I feel the problem is more about “the notable Jupyter tutorials are bad” than “notebooks are bad for tutorials”. Joel is strongly against the “Ctrl-Enter” type of tutorials. He didn’t mention what type of tutorials were good in the slides, but I guess besides the interactive way of running code in notebooks, there are pretty much only two other types of tutorials:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Code that you can only stare at. A typical example is hardcopies of books. You cannot easily copy code from paper.</p></li> \n <li><p>Code that you could copy and run by yourself, but you are strongly discouraged to do so. Instead, you are recommended to type out the code by yourself. That is what is advocated by the “<a href=\"https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/intro.html\">Learn X (Language) The Hard Way</a>” series of books.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Yes, notebooks can make the learner lazy (code is given and ready to run), and other types of tutorials force the learner to be diligent. My question is, is it definitely a good thing for everyone to type out the code line by line when learning a programming language? Honestly I have learned a great deal from “copying and pasting from Stack Overflow” (I don’t mean <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Does-reading-Copying-and-Pasting-from-Stack-Overflow-make-you-a-better-developer\">that book</a>; I mean I do copy and paste code from Stack Overflow from time to time). Of course, I don’t blindly copy code. I only copy code after I read and fully understand it.</p> \n<p>In my opinion, notebooks can save learners time (which may or may not affect the quality of learning, depending on whether the code is worth typing). One unique advantage of notebooks for learning is that learners can modify the code and run it again. This is a great way of learning—<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/720257210161311744/\">changing stuff and seeing what happens</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"11-notebooks-make-it-hard-to-teach-well\">11. Notebooks make it hard to teach well</h3> \n<p>By “hard to teach well”, Joel meant Jupyter notebooks make it hard for him to write two types of code:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Code that is split across multiple cells, and each cell contains an incomplete snippet (slides #114-123).</p></li> \n <li><p>Code that is not meant to be actually executed (slide #124).</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>For the second problem, if you use R Markdown, the chunk option <code>eval = FALSE</code> is all you need, e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, eval=FALSE}\nstopwords_list = c(\"a\", \"an\", \"at\", hundreds_of_other_words, \"yet\", \"you\")\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>The three existing solutions to the first problem in Jupyter are all awkward: <code>%%add_to dog</code>, <code>class MyClass(MyClass)</code>, and <code>Table.update = update</code>. Again, this is not a problem in the <strong>knitr</strong>/R Markdown world. You can write arbitrary incomplete code in code chunks, and compose code chunks freely. <em>This</em>, I believe, is the true spirit of literate programming, but is often overlooked by software authors who implement software products using the idea of literate programming. Literate programming is a <em>programming</em> technique. It does not simply mean mixing code and text in a linear order.</p> \n<p>Below is a toy example of R Markdown, in which we create a function in three parts in three code chunks respectively:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">We define a function to add one to a number:\n\n```{r, func-def, eval=FALSE}\nadd_one = function(x) {\n```\n\nIt is a very simple function: it just returns `x + 1`.\n\n```{r, func-body, eval=FALSE}\n  return(x + 1)\n```\n\nAnd we are done!\n\n```{r, func-end, eval=FALSE}\n}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>None of the above code chunks are meant to be executed individually, so I used the chunk option <code>eval=FALSE</code>. I also labeled the code chunks, so I can reference them later in a code chunk that is to be actually executed:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, func-full, ref.label=c('func-def', 'func-body', 'func-end')}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>which will be automatically parsed (by <strong>knitr</strong>) to a complete code chunk like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, func-full}\nadd_one = function(x) {\n  return(x + 1)\n}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you don’t want to display the R source code of the chunk <code>func-full</code> in the output document (because you have already displayed the three parts before), you can add the chunk option <code>echo=FALSE</code>, e.g.,</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, func-full, echo=FALSE, ref.label=c('func-def', 'func-body', 'func-end')}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>The code chunk <code>func-full</code> can appear <em>before</em> the three code chunks in the document if you want. For example, in a tutorial, you may want to run the function and show your readers the results before you explain each part of the function.</p> \n<p>You can even reference other code chunks in the body of a code chunk. For example, if you decide to check if <code>x</code> is numeric before computing <code>x + 1</code>, you can do:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, func-full-more}\n&lt;&lt;func-def&gt;&gt;\n  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop(\"The argument 'x' must be numeric\")\n&lt;&lt;func-body&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;func-end&gt;&gt;\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>I guess although R Markdown is very popular in the R world, not many users are aware of these ways of composing code chunks, which is understandable to me, because not many users actually need to explain a long piece of code by parts. Joel is a book author, and happens to want this feature badly.</p> \n<p>Joel ended up with copying and pasting code (and explaining each part) in Markdown to his book, as most people do traditionally. I’d argue that this traditional way may actually hinder reproducibility, because it is hard to verify if your code always works after it is pasted into the book. There might be human errors introduced in the process of copy-and-paste. When writing tutorials or books, I believe literate programming is the safest way to go. The problem is just that Jupyter’s implementation of literate programming seems to rather limited in Joel’s case.</p> \n<h2 id=\"how-you-could-win-joel-over\">How you could win Joel over</h2> \n<p>Jake VanderPlas proposed a “reproducibility mode” for Jupyter notebooks (slide #130), in which</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Code cells are read-only once executed;</p></li> \n <li><p>New code cells cannot be inserted above previously executed cells;</p></li> \n <li><p>No cell can be executed until all previous cells are executed.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Joel said this would alleviate a lot of his complaints, but as far as I can see, this mode will only address the first problem in the above 11 problems he mentioned in the talk. I’m not sure if this means the rest 10 problems do not matter much to Joel.</p> \n<p>Anyway, personally I feel this mode will be a very, very bad idea. It reminds me of a paradox mentioned by Charlie Munger in the book “Poor Charlie’s Almanack”:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>It’s not the bad ideas that do you in, it’s the good ideas. And you may say, “That can’t be so. That’s paradoxical.” What he [Graham] meant was that if a thing is a bad idea, it’s hard to overdo. But where there is a good idea with a core of essential and important truth, you can’t ignore it. And then it’s so easy to overdo it. So the good ideas are a wonderful way to suffer terribly if you overdo them.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Out of question, reproducibility is a good idea, but you shouldn’t push it so far as to let users suffer.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:The-best-strateg\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:The-best-strateg\">5</a></sup> Here are my specific comments to the proposal:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>Code cells are read-only once executed;</p> <p><em>Who can write the correct code in a single pass? What should users do if they make mistakes in a cell? What if they change their mind?</em></p></li> \n <li><p>New code cells cannot be inserted above previously executed cells;</p> <p><em>Who can plan everything in advance in a data analysis? What should users do if they want to add another model to analyze the data but show it earlier? What shoudl they do if they want to introduce another dataset to be merged into the current dataset?</em></p></li> \n <li><p>No cell can be executed until all previous cells are executed.</p> <p><em>What if a later cell doesn’t depend on previous cells, but previous cells are very time-consuming to run? Should the user just sit there and wait?</em></p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>The ideal solution in my opinion is very simple, and I have mentioned it earlier in this post when talking about the out-of-order execution problem: just let users do whatever they want in the notebook, but alert them loudly that they shall not fully trust the results until they restart the session and recompile the whole notebook in the linear order. Even when you do serious software engineering, I believe this may be what you do routinely—you may execute different parts of your scripts in the console not in the strictly linear order as you develop the software, you may modify the code after you have executed it, you may insert new code, and so on. In the end, when you build the library, everything will be executed in the linear order in a new session. So why must we make the life of notebook users so different and hard?</p> \n<p>Likewise, software engineering rules are certainly good, but I feel we will be overdoing the good idea if we force data analysts to follow these rules. For example, for a data analyst who doesn’t write a single function but only uses functions in an existing package to analyze the data, how should she write unit tests? What should she test? Different people have different priorities and constraints.</p> \n<p>Joel even wished Jupyter to force people to name new notebooks (slide #131). Naming a file is a good idea, but to force naming is bad. I don’t know if Visual Studio Code (the IDE that Joel uses) forces users to give meaningful names to new files.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, I don’t think we will be able to win Joel over to Jupyter, because he seems to be looking for an IDE to develop software, but Jupyter is not an IDE.</p> \n<p>BTW, the last slide (#138) is my favorite. I find vertical slides in reveal.js ridiculous, too. That is a good example of “people are often preoccupied with what they <em>can</em> do and don’t think about whether they <em>should</em> do it”.</p> \n<h2 id=\"how-about-r-markdown-notebooks\">How about R Markdown notebooks?</h2> \n<p>Jupyter notebooks are notebooks. Jupyter is the product. R Markdown notebooks are just plain text R Markdown documents. The “notebook” is only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1034629338275016704\">a special execution mode</a> of R Markdown documents (as we mentioned in the book “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide”). Or you may treat it as a by-product instead of a product. If you like it, use it; if you don’t, use the original R Markdown mode, i.e., the batch mode—click the <code>Knit</code> button to compile the whole document in a new R session every time. We don’t lock you in the notebook (you can check out anytime and you can <em>always</em> leave).</p> \n<p>The other unique thing about R Markdown notebooks is the RStudio IDE support. Autocomplete, linting, and documentation tooltips—they all come from the IDE. When you stand on the shoulders of an IDE, your life with notebooks can be much easier. However, please note that we don’t lock you in the RStudio IDE, either. You can compile notebooks through command line or other editors, too (the underlying R packages and Pandoc are all open-source).</p> \n<p>Among the 11 problems above, #1 is real for pretty much all notebooks including R Markdown notebooks, but in general I don’t think it is a big problem (remember: restart your session and recompile the whole notebook). The RStudio IDE has even explicitly provided a menu for you to restart R and run all code chunks:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/45199046-66a38680-b22f-11e8-80de-ea639ea32f82.png\" alt=\"Restart R and Run All Chunks\" /></p> \n<p>Joel seems to have helped Jupyter users debug many painful problems due to the hidden state and out-of-order execution issues. For some reason, I have never heard such problems from an R Markdown notebook user. Perhaps R users are just too shy to ask or they quietly give up.</p> \n<p>For problems #3, #4 and #7, I have argued that notebooks are not suitable for software engineering, and you should consider using a true IDE. For R Markdown users, there is an obvious IDE for you to use. Problem #5 is also solved by the IDE.</p> \n<p>Problem #6 is not necessarily bad in my eyes, although it also exists in R Markdown notebooks.</p> \n<p>Problem #8 doesn’t exist in R Markdown. Problem #9 is trivially easy to solve in R Markdown.</p> \n<p>I have no conclusion for problem #10. I don’t really know being able to run cells by <code>Ctrl + Enter</code> is good or bad for learning. I feel it is not necessarily a bad thing, but I don’t have data to support it.</p> \n<p>Problem #11 doesn’t exist in R Markdown.</p> \n<p>Overall I guess Joel’s life would be a little easier if he were an R user. Well, actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035727684524040194\">R Markdown does support Python</a> through the <a href=\"https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/\"><strong>reticulate</strong></a> package. In my (biased, of course) opinion, the support is reasonably good, although I guess the RStudio IDE is unlikely to satisfy hardcore Python users looking for features like autosuggest based on the static analysis of type annotations (slide #65). Besides, if you are interested in writing books, you can check out <a href=\"https://bookdown.org\">the <strong>bookdown</strong> package</a>, which is an R Markdown extension. Your life as a book author could be even easier.</p> \n<h2 id=\"should-we-rename-notebook-to-scratch-pad\">Should we rename “Notebook” to “Scratch Pad”?</h2> \n<p>I read through some comments on Twitter (e.g., threads started by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hspter/status/1034511489632067584\">Hilary Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rdpeng/status/1034606358237245440\">Roger Peng</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1034626933961572352\">Jenny Bryan</a>). My major impression is that those who don’t like notebooks feel notebooks are messy, and they are messy in two aspects:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>The state can be messy, which is exactly the Problem #1 above. Interestingly enough, I found that a fair amount of R Markdown users <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1034633407299559424\">didn’t seem to know</a> what R Markdown notebooks really are (repeat: a notebook is only <em>one possible execution mode</em> for R Markdown). As a result, they have never suffered from this problem, because they have always been using the batch mode instead of the notebook mode. For those who know what notebooks are, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raphg/status/1034642407034314752\">they just switch to</a> the traditional batch mode, which is exactly what we expect them to do.</p> <p>Note that we (R Markdown developers) released R Markdown with the batch mode first, and introduced the notebook mode about four years later. That probably explains why the state problem seems to be rare in the R Markdown world.</p></li> \n <li><p>The content can be messy. This point was brought forward by Hilary, and I tend to agree. A notebook encourages you to dump experimental and even random things in it. To quote Hilary:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>[…] I think they [notebooks] encourage people to write crummy analyses. They’re usually not much more than a stream-of-consciousness narrative, like raw model output, then some insufficient comment on it, then a plot, then insufficient comments… etc.</p> \n  </blockquote> <p>To quote Roger Peng:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>I think notebooks encourage putting everything into a single document, but that goes against clear communication and developing a coherent narrative of an analysis.</p> \n  </blockquote> <p>Do these words remind you of something I mentioned earlier?…</p> <p>Yes, Microsoft Excel. In Excel, you put raw data, raw output, and everything in a single sheet, with insufficient comments (actually often no comments at all).</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Notebooks do encourage experimenting and prototyping. That is why the content can be messy. With that in mind, I feel “scratch pad” would be a more appropriate name practically than “notebook” (and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deronaucoin/status/1034513653452746752\">some people</a> do use notebooks as scratch pads).</p> \n<p>Can notebooks be used to write a well-structured, thoughtful, and reproducible (data analysis) report? I believe they surely can. Nothing stops you from extracting the useful parts from the scratch pads to write a formal document.</p> \n<p>What was the real problem above? I think it is that the expectation of going from a notebook to a sophisticated analysis in a single pass is wrong. In most cases, you cannot skip experimental or exploratory analysis. You don’t have to use notebooks for exploratory data analysis, but they are just one possible way to do it. You can, for example, use pure R scripts to do it, too, but you probably will never publish the raw output of all these R scripts as is.</p> \n<p>In short, chances are your first notebook will/should not be your final product (e.g., a customer report).</p> \n<h2 id=\"xaringan-inf-mr-another-lesser-known-unpopular-solution-to-the-out-of-order-execution-problem\"><code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code>, another (lesser-known/unpopular) solution to the out-of-order execution problem</h2> \n<p>I mentioned four ways to compile an R Markdown document <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/compile.html\">in the Definitive Guide book</a>:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>click the <code>Knit</code> button in RStudio;</p></li> \n <li><p>call the function <code>rmarkdown::render()</code>;</p></li> \n <li><p>use the notebook mode;</p></li> \n <li><p>or run <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> (here <code>inf_mr</code> stands for <a href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi\">Infinite Moon Reader</a>).</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Only the notebook mode can suffer from the out-of-order execution problem. For the other three ways, the first two have a tiny problem, which may or may not bother you: they require a manual operation each time you recompile the document (click a button, or type a function call).</p> \n<p>The fourth way may sound odd but it is also pretty cool. At least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cantabile/status/1034216497634131971\">one person has been excited about it</a> for quite a while. It doesn’t have the out-of-order execution problem, yet it gives you a pseudo-notebook experience. Essentially it is similar to the first two ways, i.e., it compiles the whole R Markdown document, but it features LiveReload. That is, when you modify the R Markdown source and save the file, the output page will be automatically refreshed after the R Markdown document is recompiled. More importantly, the previous scroll position is preserved after the page is refreshed. This means if you were looking at a code chunk (in the RStudio editor) and its output (in RStudio Viewer) side by side previously, they will still be side by side after you make changes to the source document.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:If-you-are-editi\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:If-you-are-editi\">6</a></sup> However, please note that there is no mechanism of synchronizing the scroll positions of the source and output file. They are scrolled independently. Anyway, I think it is helpful that the document can be recompiled automatically on save.</p> \n<p>This way can suffer from the state problem, because it compiles R Markdown in the current R session, which means anything in your workspaces is available to the R Markdown document, and anything created by the R Markdown document will be exposed in your workspace. They can pollute each other. This is not necessarily a bad thing (repeat: when in doubt, restart and recompile), and sometimes can be beneficial. For example, if you have a huge data object that takes time to read, you only need to read it once in the current R session, and you can keep using it until the session is ended or you intentionally delete it.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># read the data only if it has not been read\nif (!exists('MY_HUGE_DATA')) MY_HUGE_DATA = read_the_data(...)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Besides, you can freely examine any objects created in your R Markdown document in the R console. For example, you can draw different plots using the object <code>MY_HUGE_DATA</code> in the console before you decide which plot you want, and write the code in R Markdown. This can save you a lot of effort and time, since you don’t have to recompile the whole document in a new R session after every single change to see the output. The reproducibility principle is important, but you can leave it to a later stage. Worrying about it in every single minute in your data analysis is costly (in terms of your mental power and time).</p> \n<h2 id=\"literate-programming-for-real-for-software-development\">Literate programming, for real (for software development)</h2> \n<p>As I mentioned in Problem #11 above, you can use the literate programming technique for programming. I have prepared <a href=\"https://yihui.org/rlp/\">a concrete example</a> a couple of years ago. You can see how you could write code in small (incomplete) pieces in different chunks and compose them to a complete package. When reading that example, I strongly recommend that you also read its <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/rlp/edit/master/vignettes/LP-demo1.Rmd\">R Markdown source document</a> on Github to know how it actually works.</p> \n<p>So yes, you <em>can</em> develop software using literate programming and R Markdown (notebooks). The natural question is whether you <em>should</em>. To be honest, I will probably never use this technique to develop software. “Haha, Yihui, so you are only kidding us?” You may ask. No, I’m not. I still believe this technique has its unique advantage that cannot be found in traditional programming methods. That is, the rich documentation (narratives) to explain the code. The narratives can be infinitely <em>rich</em> and <em>granular</em>: rich because you can write anything that the authoring language (e.g., Markdown) allows you to write (images, videos, and math equations, etc.), and granular because your can break your long code into any number of smaller units and explain each unit.</p> \n<p>Literate programming is unbeatable when you need to explain your code very clearly. Note that Knuth’s original implementation was base on TeX (the authoring language) and Pascal (the computing language). To my knowledge, only a few people in the TeX community have adopted this technique—they use literate programming to explain TeX code.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Is-that-because\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:Is-that-because\">7</a></sup> The vast majority of programmers just use comments to explain code in software.</p> \n<h2 id=\"what-if-i-m-standing-at-the-intersection-of-software-engineering-and-data-analysis\">What if I’m standing at the intersection of software engineering and data analysis?</h2> \n<p>I’ll only answer this question for R users since I’m not familiar with the Python ecosystem. There isn’t a clear borderline between software engineers and data analysts. It is likely that sometimes data analysts do need to factor out code and write functions. In this case, should you use the IDE or notebook?</p> \n<p>My answer is, if your project is small enough, it is fine to write a few external R scripts and <code>source()</code> them in the notebook, otherwise you may consider using the IDE to write an R package, and include your notebooks as <em>package vignettes</em>. To quote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cboettig/status/1034665522904723457\">Carl Boettiger</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I think a good .Rmd notebook acts like an #rstats vignette: complex code belongs in functions in a package, (with docs and tests if appropriate); the notebook part merely ensures code underlying the narrative &amp; results are reproducible.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Yes, if you have complex code, considering putting them in a package, instead of throwing a thousand lines of code in a notebook.</p> \n<p>Although I’m a statistics PhD, I didn’t read many papers during my training, but I did read “Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research” by <a href=\"https://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2/\">Gentleman and Temple Lang (2004)</a>. This 14-year old<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:The-only-thing-t\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fn:The-only-thing-t\">8</a></sup> paper basically proposed that we use the R package structure to manage the data analysis of research projects, because this structure has pretty much everything you need: you can have a <code>data/</code> folder, the <code>R/</code> and <code>src/</code> source folders, the <code>tests/</code> folder, and the <code>vignettes/</code> folder, etc. You can write good software (yes, please do write unit tests now) and do good data analysis in different folders.</p> \n<p>Then after <code>R CMD build</code>, you get both a reusable R package that can be distributed to others, as well as data analysis reports that are reproducible.</p> \n<h2 id=\"reasons-why-you-don-t-like-r-markdown-notebooks\">Reasons why you don’t like R Markdown (notebooks)?</h2> \n<p>Okay, I’m looking for the Joel Grus in the R Markdown world, and I’d like to know what you don’t like about R Markdown and R Markdown notebooks. I saw a few comments on Twitter, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/romunov/status/1034659703173914626\">Roman Luštrik’s</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I stopped using notebooks because in RStudio, they don’t allow a <code>browser()</code> call, but otherwise very helpful.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>which doesn’t seem to be true, though. Perhaps it is because I’m using <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\">a newer version of RStudio</a>. I tried to run the code chunk in the following minimal example, and <code>browser()</code> works as expected.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">---\ntitle: \"R Notebook\"\noutput: html_notebook\n---\n\n```{r}\nf = function() {\n  x = 1:10\n  browser()\n  x + 1\n}\nf()\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>What else? Please feel free to pour out your thoughts (also feel free to email me if you prefer a private conversation).</p> \n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2> \n<p>This is a long post. It took me four full days to write. I like writing and I hope writing can help me think deeply on things of importance. In this case, R Markdown is important to me, so I used Joel Grus as my “mirror”. Although he was criticizing Jupyter, I wondered if the criticism could also apply to R Markdown. My overall conclusion is that R Markdown has a relatively solid base and enough deep roots in literate programming to defend itself. That said, I’ll be excited if someone plans to give a talk “I don’t like R Markdown” at the next <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/conference/\">RStudio Confernce</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>In this post, I first talked about the two cultures, namely the data analysis culture, in which people often use code, and the software engineering culture, in which people often create code. I believe notebooks are great for exploratory data analysis, but bad for software engineering.</p></li> \n <li><p>Then I tried to explain why notebooks become so popular by an analogy to Excel: people love seeing immediate output that is close to its source, and love putting everything in a single place, so they don’t have to constantly switch from one tool or one window to another. Reproducibility introduced by notebooks is more or less merely a coincidence, and users are not attracted by the reproducibility principle but convenience instead. Notebooks cannot guarantee reproducibility, especially when you run cells in a weird order, but they are much better than Excel in terms of reproducibility due to the fact that you always use scripts to do tasks.</p></li> \n <li><p>Joel’s #1 complaint (hidden state and out-of-order execution) is real but not the end of the world in my eyes. Users have to be better educated on this problem. Problems related to software engineering are better to be solved by an IDE instead of the notebook itself. Jupyter is not an IDE, and that is probably why Joel struggled so much. The rest of problems seem to be the real limits of Jupyter itself. Fortunately, in the R world, the “IDE + Notebook” combo has made a lot of things easier.</p></li> \n <li><p>Notebooks encourage experimenting and prototyping, which can lead to crummy analyses, because users simply dump a lot of raw content (such as raw model output) to a notebook. Such a notebook is unlikely to be a proper final data analysis product or report. Don’t send this to your boss or customer.</p></li> \n <li><p>If you want the notebook feel but absolutely hate the possible out-of-order execution, you may try <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> (or equivalently, the RStudio Addin “Infinite Moon Reader”) on your R Markdown document.</p></li> \n <li><p>If you want to use the literate programming technique to develop software, you can, but chances are you don’t want to.</p></li> \n <li><p>If you do both software engineering and data analysis heavily in a project, consider using an IDE to develop an R package, instead of stuffing your poor notebooks with thousands of lines of code.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Okay, I’m done. If you have made it to the end not through a quick scroll, congratulations!

Oh, this post title was… was so… so… Forget it. You know what I was going to say. After Joel’s talk, the author removed “the Right Way” in the title (what does that mean?), but it is still such a general and broad title, which sounds like the title of a 300-page book. Why not using an explicit and clear title “How to import one Jupyter notebook into another” (which is currently the subtitle)? To quote Andrew Gelman, “<a href=\"https://andrewgelman.com/2018/05/13/say-less-clearly-please-general-purpose-data-garbler-applications-requiring-confidentiality/\">Could you say that again less clearly, please?</a>” The enthusiasm of writing tutorials is great, precious, and will be appreciated, but if you decide to use an attractive title, you should take the responsibility of providing relevant, correct, and solid content, which eyeballs and page views will naturally follow, if you care about this sort of things. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fnref:Joel-mainly-crit\">↩</a></li> \n  <li id=\"fn:The-best-strateg\">The best strategy is to let people “fall into the pit of success” if possible. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fnref:The-best-strateg\">↩</a></li> \n  <li id=\"fn:If-you-are-editi\">If you are editing an R Markdown source document of which the output format is <code>xaringan::moon_reader</code>, the slide page number will be preserved after refreshing.

XML would be a terrible authoring language in my opinion. You can see that 14 years later, Markdown has pretty much dominated all plain-text authoring languages. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/#fnref:The-only-thing-t\">↩</a></li> \n  <li id=\"fn:Facepalm-Sorry-I\">Facepalm!

It was originally called “S” and developed by AT&amp;T Bell Labs for UNIX. StatSci has expanded upon its capabilities and converted it for PCs. It differs from other statistical programming languages in many ways.</p> \n<p>I consider it to be a cross between Minitab and object-oriented C. It is like Minitab in that it is interactive and fully integrates graphics and matrix operations with the statistical routines. Unlike Minitab, it also provides programming capabilities like object-oriented C. This makes the language very powerful, because one can easily and quickly develop nonstandard or repetitive routines.</p> \n<p>This package has several advantages over more common statistical language packages such as SAS. SAS has DATA steps to prepare your data and PROC steps to analyze your data. In S-PLUS, there is no distinction. You can manipulate your data at any time, even within routines. This saves programming time and frees you from many of SAS’s constraints. Another major difference is that SAS comes in modules: one for basic functions, one for statistical analysis routines, one for graphics routines, one for matrix algebra, plus others. It even has a separate macro language for repetitive operations. This means you must buy - actually, rent - and install several products, and, more importantly, figure out how to program them together. This is not an easy task. With S-PLUS, these capabilities are integrated, which results in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) being very easy to perform, unlike SAS.</p> \n<p>S-PLUS does have its disadvantages, mainly due to its data structure organization. The inherent matrix algebra-like organization requires a higher level of thinking than other packages do. Also, creating a data structure is a nontrivial task. However, once these concepts are mastered and a proper data set is created, analyzing the data is much easier and faster than other packages, because there are very few constraints to program around.</p> \n<p>Another aspect that some people might consider a drawback is that S-PLUS does not have an exhaustive supply of routines to do everything under the sun. It doesn’t try to please everyone all the time. What it does try to do is provide a tool for scientist to analyze their data in a meaningful way. And if there is something else you want it to do, you can program it.</p> \n<p>To give you a better idea of what S-PLUS can do, I’m enclosing an index of S-PLUS’s functions and examples of some of its capabilities. The first example is a matrix or “draftsman’s” plot of some automotive data. It is a multivariate technique to show the relationships between several variables. The second example is a partial listing of star plots of the same data set. The spikes on the stars represent a metric and the length of the spikes represents the value of the metric. This type of display makes it easy to see how items are similar or different. Both complex examples required only a few commands once the data structure was set up. The last examples are the plots and S-PLUS code for a reliability growth plan I did for □□□ □□□□□□□□ □□□□□□□ program. As you can see from the code, not much work was required to generate the plots, and if the parameters change, I can easily generate new plots by changing the arguments for the function.</p> \n<p>I recommend that we buy two copies: one for the □□□□□□□ office and one for the □□□□□□□ office. The cost of one copy is $1195. But if you buy between two to five copies, the cost is $995 per copy. If you have any specific questions, either call me or call StatSci at (206) 283-8802.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:A-footnote-by-Yi\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2019/05/review-of-s-plus/#fn:A-footnote-by-Yi\">1</a></sup></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">library(corrgram)\npairs(\n  auto[c(\"MPG\", \"Weight\", \"Length\", \"Turn\", \"Displa\", \"Gratio\")],\n  main = \"1979 Consumers Reports Automotive Data\"\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/56985261-9819eb00-6b4d-11e9-9e64-048e08a95f64.png\" alt=\"1979 Consumers Reports Automotive Data\" /></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">stars(\n  auto[1:16, ], \n  main = \"Star Plot of 1979 Consumers Reports Automotive Data - 1st 16 models\",\n  labels = as.character(auto[1:16, \"Model\"])\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/56985262-9819eb00-6b4d-11e9-9f81-b74f2026477a.png\" alt=\"Star Plot of 1979 Consumers Reports Automotive Data - 1st 16 models\" /></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">ideal &lt;- function(alpha, Ti, Mi, Mf) {\n  # S function to plot idealized growth curve from alpha, Ti, Mi, &amp;

The idea is that we just randomly insert new slides with background images (the default is <a href=\"https://kbroman.org/blog/2014/08/28/the-mustache-photo/\">Karl&rsquo;s mustache photo</a>) into existing slides. We know that slide pages are separated by three dashes <code>---</code>, so what we need to do is to find out the three dashes, and replace a random set of them with</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">---\nbackground-image: url(path/to/the/image)\n\n---\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In fact, there is a function <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/2543fa1/R/utils.R#L51-L65\"><code>xaringan:::yolofy()</code></a> to implement this. It has two arguments: <code>x</code>, a character vector of the Markdown source of the original slides, and <code>config</code>, a list of configurations that specify how many times (or probability) you want the image to appear in the slides, and which image you want to use.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">x2 = xaringan:::yolofy(\n  x = c('---', 'First', '---', 'Second', '---', 'Third'),\n  config = list(times = 2, img = 'karl-mustache.jpg')\n)\ncat(x2, sep = '\\n')\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>---\nbackground-image: url(karl-mustache.jpg)\n---\nFirst\n---\nSecond\n---\nbackground-image: url(karl-mustache.jpg)\n---\nThird\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you have read the source code of <code>xaringan::yolofy()</code>, you will realize that the <code>yolo</code> option of <code>xaringan::moon_reader</code> is flexible. Below are all valid usage:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">output:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo: true  # make Karl appear once randomly\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">output:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo: false\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">output:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo: 3  # let Karl appear at most 3 times\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">output:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo: 0.2  # appear in 20% of original slides\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">output:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo:\n      times: 5\n      img: kangaroo.jpg  # use a different image 5 times\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This has been one of the most representative &ldquo;low effort, high return&rdquo; examples in my packages. I think the actual implementation contributed the least to its influence. The key was Karthik&rsquo;s idea and Karl Bromona-Lisa&rsquo;s picture. I was just lucky enough to have seen both.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2019/03/yolo-karl/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 06 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1101434265231798272/pu/img/BLOrnmcx_AARqWyH.jpg","linkMd5":"fee2d59b38f5c49d470e76d2152d95df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-022_14aeb72bf1a9de97.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":675,"sourceBytes":49478,"destBytes":30828,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1101434265231798272/pu/img/BLOrnmcx_AARqWyH.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-34-022_14aeb72bf1a9de97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973439},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"HTML Widgets for Non-HTML Output Formats","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/html-widgets-non-html/","description":"\n        <p>Not surprisingly, <a href=\"http://www.htmlwidgets.org\">HTML widgets</a> were designed for HTML output formats (e.g., <code>rmarkdown::html_document</code> and <code>rmarkdown::ioslides_presentation</code>). Their interactivity relies on JavaScript. In general, you should not expect JavaScript to work in LaTeX/PDF or Word or PowerPoint.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2015, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV4gtARPvu8\">I gave an introductory talk</a> on HTML widgets in the LA R User Group. I joked in the talk that &ldquo;If you ask me how to use HTML widgets in Word or LaTeX, we cannot be friends .&rdquo; (I meant, how could you possibly ask such a question?) A year later, this became only a half joke.</p>\n\n<p>While developing <strong>bookdown</strong> in 2016, I added a feature in <strong>knitr</strong> to &ldquo;support&rdquo; HTML widgets for non-HTML output, which basically means if the output is not HTML, <strong>knitr</strong> will try to use the <strong>webshot</strong> package to automatically take a screenshot of the widget, and embed the static screenshot in the output. Of course, you won&rsquo;t be able to interact with this static image, but it may be better than nothing (or throwing an error).</p>\n\n<p>The detailed documentation about this feature can be found in <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html-widgets.html\">Section 2.10 of the <strong>bookdown</strong> book</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Shiny apps won&rsquo;t work in non-HTML output, either. If you want to include a screenshot of a Shiny app in a <strong>knitr</strong> document, you may explicitly use the <code>knitr::include_app()</code> function after you publish the app to a server. More generally, you can include a screenshot of any web page via <code>knitr::include_url()</code> when the output format is not HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Screenshotting HTML widgets, Shiny apps, and arbitrary URLs works in any non-HTML output formats: PDF, Word, EPUB, RTF, and PowerPoint, etc. If you want, you may even force a screenshot in HTML output, too (see documentation).</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank Winston for the heavy-lifting in <a href=\"https://github.com/wch/webshot\">the <strong>webshot</strong> package</a>. It is a very neat package.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/html-widgets-non-html/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3a9f7d44868ed7b91cca201486dfe96d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973460},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"The \"Talk-Driven Development\" Model","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/talk-driven-development/","description":"<p>Last year at rstudio::conf 2017, I said I used the “conference-driven development model”. Right before I gave the talk on <strong>blogdown</strong>, I wrote an RStudio addin to demonstrate in my talk, which later evolved into the “New Post” addin you see today. I really meant the “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/970841704625356801\">talk-driven development</a>“: when I’m going to give a talk, I’ll surely ask myself how I could make better use of the unique chance to show something exciting to the audience.</p> \n<p>This year, I thought about the same thing before I gave the talk at rstudio::conf, but didn’t risk writing new code right before my talk (sigh, I’m becoming old and my brain is becoming slow). I mentioned a tiny feature <a href=\"https://slides.yihui.org/2018-blogdown-rstudio-conf-Yihui-Xie.html#22\"><code>options(blogdown.title_case = TRUE)</code></a> in my talk, which was a <strong>blogdown</strong> feature I added two days before the talk. When you set this option, your post title will be converted to title case if the post is created via the “New Post” addin in RStudio or <code>blogdown::new_post()</code>, thanks to the function <code>tools::toTitleCase()</code>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:As-you-all-know\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/talk-driven-development/#fn:As-you-all-know\">1</a></sup></p> \n<p>The number of my own blog posts has been skyrocketing after I (pretty much) finished developing the <strong>blogdown</strong> package last year. I write a lot of posts and use title case myself, but I have two pains: (1) Sometimes I’m not sure if I should capitalize the initial letter of a word or not; (2) I don’t enjoy holding the <code>Shift</code> key to type capitals. I had thought about <code>tools::toTitleCase()</code> but was too lazy to implement it in <strong>blogdown</strong>, and the upcoming talk at the conference was an excellent motivation.</p> \n<p>It is a very tiny feature, but I believe it is very useful to those who blog frequently. As I mentioned in my slides, <a href=\"http://joelcalifa.com/blog/tiny-wins/\">tiny wins</a> are also important. Now I’m glad that I don’t have to press <code>Shift</code> over and over again, and there is less stress on the little finger of my left hand.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/penguin-stumble.gif\" alt=\"Always pressing the Shift key\" /></p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:As-you-all-know\">As you all know, R is a language for statistical computing, graphics, and English grammar. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/talk-driven-development/#fnref:As-you-all-know\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/talk-driven-development/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/penguin-stumble.gif","linkMd5":"3a27c21d7f4b5561dc3761a12a9e8788","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-39-318_41c331b60da50d15.webp","destWidth":317,"destHeight":201,"sourceBytes":1318569,"destBytes":1243550,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/penguin-stumble.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-39-318_41c331b60da50d15.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973463},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Solving Statistical Computing Problems with SQL","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/sql-stats-computing/","description":"\n        <p>Thomas Lumley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tslumley/status/1023850297028829184\">shared a smart way</a> to fit generalized linear models by a SQL query to a database.

This 300-page book was finished by the end of May. I <a href=\"https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/07/13/announcing-the-r-markdown-book/\">just announced</a> the book in the RStudio official blog, but want to write a personal blog post to reflect some personal thoughts, too.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/cover.png\" alt=\"R Markdown: The Definitive Guide\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"happily-eating-my-own-dog-food-for-the-third-time\">Happily eating my own dog food (for the third time)</h2>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know other people&rsquo;s secrets on how to create successful software, but my experience is that if you create a software package that you like to use by yourself on a daily basis, it is likely to succeed and will be used by many other people, too. In other words, if even you don&rsquo;t enjoy your own dog food, how would you expect other people to eat it?</p>\n\n<p>Before creating the <strong>bookdown</strong> package, I had written two long-form documents. One was my PhD thesis, and one was the <strong>knitr</strong> book. They were written in LaTeX (using LyX). You may think &ldquo;two&rdquo; is a small number, but it turned out to be big enough to me. I didn&rsquo;t want to bury myself in the LaTeX world again if I were to write anything longer than ten pages. LaTeX is great. The only problem is that I don&rsquo;t need so much power (i.e., it is too good to me).</p>\n\n<p>I still love writing long documents. I just don&rsquo;t want to feel like a typesetter all the time.</p>\n\n<p>This is the third book I have published with <strong>bookdown</strong>. Had I not worked on <strong>bookdown</strong> first, I don&rsquo;t know if I would be able to keep the momentum of &ldquo;one book a year&rdquo; (well, only since 2016 &ndash; it is hard to tell how many more years I can keep going).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"simple-steps-to-writing-a-book\">Simple steps to writing a book</h2>\n\n<p>If you ask me if there are simple steps to write a book. The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The simple steps are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Take a deep breath. Write Chapter 1.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Write Chapter 2.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>&hellip;</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Write Chapter 19.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Write the Acknowledgements. Done. Lie on the couch, stare at the ceiling, and speculate about the meaning of life for a day.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That was pretty much what happened (except that I didn&rsquo;t lie on the couch or stare at the ceiling) if you <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book/commits/master?after=9868887b843de2e30596727fddba1a5902c7e6de+69\">take a look at some of my GIT commit messages</a> (like &ldquo;add chapter 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;add section 2.1 - 2.6&rdquo;, &ldquo;add section 2.7&rdquo;, &hellip;).</p>\n\n<p>Of course you know I&rsquo;m kidding. If you look for &ldquo;simple steps&rdquo; to do any nontrivial tasks, you are already losing. More often than not, you have no choice but bite the bullet, over and over again. You need to be prepared for that.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I have to say that Step 1 is important, i.e., it is important to at least get started. A dreadful task is less dreadful after you actually start working on it, even if it is only 1% less dreadful.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"managing-distractions\">Managing distractions</h2>\n\n<p>I have said enough about managing distractions in <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/acknowledgments.html\">the acknowledgements section</a> of the book. It is absolutely not fun. I ruthlessly turned down the invites to some meetings on my company calendar when I felt the meetings wouldn&rsquo;t be very productive (I preferred emails because emails could be async). I set my Slack status to &ldquo;Writing a book: may not respond to messages&rdquo; to inform my colleagues who may message me. Fortunately, my role in the company is relatively independent, and not many colleagues really rely on me heavily.</p>\n\n<p>Managing distractions from others is one thing. Managing myself is another, and actually harder. I&rsquo;m constantly drowning in Github issues, emails, and Stack Overflow questions, although I have been trying to ignore some of them. The problem is, these things are often more enjoyable than writing a book, mainly because each of them, individually, looks significantly easier than writing the book. It is tempting to put aside the book, and voluntarily jump into these small tasks. The fact is that even if I spend all my time on them, I still won&rsquo;t ever be able to finish them. Good news is that several people have started answering questions on Github and Stack Overflow before I see them.</p>\n\n<p>During the four months, I had yet another source of distraction that I absolutely could (and should) not get rid of &ndash; small kids. My younger boy was 6-mo old when I started writing this book. I almost thanked him in the book (like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/12/02/announcing-bookdown/\">big thanks to my younger boy</a>, without whom I should have finished this book two months earlier&rdquo;). Fortunately, he didn&rsquo;t deprive too much of my sleep, and quickly &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; not to take the bottle at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"this-is-a-reference-book\">This is a reference book</h2>\n\n<p>Just to set your expectation, I have to clarify that this is primarily a book for your reference. It is not a text book. If you read it from the beginning to end, you may feel exhausted or overwhelmed. It is meant to be a guide, and some chapters are not comprehensive (but should be good enough to get you started). You may need to read more about the specific R Markdown extension in its own full documentation (e.g., <strong>blogdown</strong>, <strong>pkgdown</strong>, and <strong>learnr</strong>).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"once-again-thanks-to-the-chapman-hall-team\">Once again, thanks to the Chapman &amp; Hall team</h2>\n\n<p>Both our publisher Chapman &amp; Hall and us have tried to make this book a little more affordable to readers. We have waived the royalties. We are allowed to keep the online version of this book, so readers can read it for free anytime.</p>\n\n<p>Our editor John Kimmel and copy-editor Suzanne Lassandro were super fast, partly because we are familiar with each other now, I guess. When sending me the comments for a revision, Suzanne said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even going to set a deadline for you.&rdquo; She knew I&rsquo;d return the revised manuscript the next day.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s next? I don&rsquo;t really know at the moment. As I said <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/12/busy-vs-productive/\">in a previous post</a>, I always have interesting ideas that I want to work on. It is hard to decide. On the other hand, as I maintain more and more R packages, perhaps it will be harder and harder for me to focus on larger projects. For example, <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/issue-zero/\">I just spent two good weeks</a> on the <strong>rticles</strong> package.</p>\n\n<p>Another book? An alternative to LaTeX? A fancy JS visualization library? Recording more video tutorials? There are just too many interesting projects. I&rsquo;ll need a quiet environment for such projects anyway, so first of all, I have to walk through all the chaos accumulated and left behind while I wrote the book, which I think can easily take me a month. Oh, by the way, I just noticed the other day that some rabbits managed to get into my garden and ate all my cilantro. I probably need to fix my garden fence, too. My hardware skills are extremely poor. Darn it.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/r-markdown-book/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/cover.png","linkMd5":"5aac18573f342a9d62521af19800e113","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-33-673_1863269ca43e6bf6.webp","destWidth":441,"destHeight":677,"sourceBytes":19468,"destBytes":19528,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/cover.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-33-673_1863269ca43e6bf6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Winners Take All in the Dependency World (or Hell)","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/","description":"<p>Yesterday I read <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1059616001937960960\">a tweet on the marketing of software</a>, which encourages software engineers to promote their good software packages. It seems to be reasonable at the first glance. The problem, in my opinion, is that we are now living in this miserable age in which we are deeply manipulated by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy\">attention economy</a>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:So-deeply-manipu\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fn:So-deeply-manipu\">1</a></sup> At the same time, there are just so many great software packages. As a result, marketing more or less depends on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tslumley/status/950806599232192512\">how loud you can shout out</a> and whether you are able to keep raising your voice in a room that has already been fairly loud (or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJ_Emerson/status/945830711503634432\">using more emojis</a>).</p> \n<p>That was one of the main reasons I have pretty much stopped marketing since a few years ago, at least on social media. The other reason is that I consider myself to be famous <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/enough-1d48019c7335\">enough</a>, and people can hear me even if I’m just murmuring to myself in my own world (like what I’m doing right now). There is a problem (or side-effect) of being famous and influential: people tend to trust and use everything you do based on your past good track record. That is natural and understandable, because our brain tends to simplify the process of evaluation and judgement and avoid the effort of collecting more information for strict objectivity.</p> \n<p>All software developers know the problem of the dependency hell: your package may be broken if any of your upstream packages is broken. The more packages you depend on, the higher the risk of breakage is.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Speaking-of-the\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fn:Speaking-of-the\">2</a></sup> However, this definitely does not mean you should absolutely avoid dependencies. Not many people can live the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden\">life in the woods</a> like Thoreau. The meaningful question is, what are the cost and gain of introducing a dependency?</p> \n<p>Actually that is not what I want to talk about in this post. The dependency hell problem has been discussed many times by many people. The observation that I want to share here is that I discovered a phenomenon of “winners take all” in the world of dependencies. That is, if a package (or its author) is extremely famous, other users tend to depend on it unconditionally. I have seen such examples several times, and will give one below (with my apologies to Patrick Schratz and Miles McBain in advance—I don’t mean to judge your code, but show how tempting it is to introduce dependencies).</p> \n<p>Recently the cool hacker Patrick Schratz sent a pull request to <strong>xaringan</strong> to create PDFs from <strong>xaringan</strong> slides, in which he <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/pull/177#discussion_r227974726\">initially introduced two dependencies</a>, <strong>glue</strong> and <strong>PBSmodelling</strong>. I could definitely see the advantages of <strong>glue</strong> (including the fact that it has <a href=\"https://github.com/jimhester/presentations/blob/26056248/2018_07_13-Glue_strings_to_data_with_glue/2018_03_28-Glue_string_to_data_with_glue.Rmd#L133\">zero depedencies</a>), but in this case, the feature introduced in the PR didn’t seem to be essential to me (i.e., it is a “nice-to-have” feature). On the other hand, there is no essential gain by using <code>glue::glue()</code> instead of <code>sprintf()</code> or <code>paste()</code> in base R:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">function(p1, p2) {\n  glue::glue(\"docker run ... {p1} {p2}\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>It could be well written with <code>sprintf()</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">function(p1, p2) {\n  sprintf(\"docker run ... %s %s\", p1, p2)\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>or <code>paste()</code>:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:I-hope-nobody-wi\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fn:I-hope-nobody-wi\">3</a></sup></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">function(p1, p2) {\n  paste(\"docker run ...\", p1, p2)\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The dependency on the <strong>PBSmodelling</strong> is even heavier with a marginal gain, which was not worth it in my eyes.</p> \n<p>Yesterday Romain Lesur<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:At-some-point-th\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fn:At-some-point-th\">4</a></sup> told me a truly amazing package developed by Miles McBain. By “truly amazing”, I mean it is the kind of packages that can make me sleepless at night (together with my one-year old). When I started looking at its source code, I saw it used <code>glue::glue()</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/MilesMcBain/chradle/blob/295705f12d3423010f5a454a03e064e19d0b7db2/R/chradle.R#L25\">multiple times</a>. This case is actually better than the previous case, since at least the dependency has been used multiple times, and in my opinion, it demonstrated one benefit of <code>glue::glue()</code>, which is the human-readability of the string template, e.g., the readability of</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">glue('The total is {total}.')\n</code></pre> \n<p>is better than</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">sprintf('The total is %f.', total)\n</code></pre> \n<p>or</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">paste0('The total is ', total, '.')\n</code></pre> \n<p>These examples are by no means to imply that <strong>glue</strong> should never be a dependency of any packages (apologies to my colleague and the author of <strong>glue</strong>, Jim Hester, if readers are misled by my post). Remember, I’m <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/base-r-broman/\">a desiccated baseR-er</a>, so the force on the other side must be strong enough to pull me over, and popularity is not a strong force to me.</p> \n<p>So is “winners take all” truly bad? Actually I don’t think so. Winners should be awarded (by more people depending on them). I don’t think there is a solution to eliminate the side-effect of popularity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Yes-there-exist\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fn:Yes-there-exist\">5</a></sup> Overall I think the main effect is beneficial enough to most people, so that we can ignore the relatively minor side-effects. If you could stop and weigh the cost against the gain of every dependency you introduce, that will certainly be cool. If you don’t bother, I think that’s fine, too.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:So-deeply-manipu\">So deeply manipulated that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hellchick/status/942863353403150336\">you don’t even know it when one of your friends died</a>. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fnref:So-deeply-manipu\">↩</a></li> \n  <li id=\"fn:Speaking-of-the\">Speaking of the number of dependencies, I suddenly recalled the first time when I was surprised by the number.

It was totally magic to me. When I tried to install it by myself, I was kind of terrified because R kept downloading other packages for a while and I thought something went wrong.

BTW, <strong>knitr</strong>’s dependencies are too heavy, which is one of the things I don’t like about it, but some dependencies are <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1552\">really hard to get rid of</a>. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#fnref:I-hope-nobody-wi\">↩</a></li> \n  <li id=\"fn:At-some-point-th\">At some point this year or early next year, I will write a post about this amazing hacker.

Eventually he closed the PR, because I believed there wouldn&rsquo;t be any use cases. The most typical use case would be making zebra striped tables. Perhaps ten years ago, we would need different classes for odd and even rows of a table, but now the <code>:nth-child</code> CSS selector has been widely supported, and it is extremely simple to make striped tables with only <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css3-zebra-striping-a-table/\">a single line of CSS</a> like:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">tbody tr:nth-child(odd) { background-color: #ccc; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In general, I try not to close PRs.

It is the first time I have felt completely satisfied by the video conference equipment. The audio quality was amazing: I was able to clearly hear everyone in the room (they use a wireless microphone), and I feel it is even better than when I physically stand on a podium (in which case I sometimes cannot hear the audience clearly). There was a camera presumably on the ceiling in the front of the room, so I was able to see everyone in the room, too. The visual feedback is important when giving a remote talk. In the past, I often felt I was talking to a brick wall by myself in my room, and half an hour later, I had no idea whether the audience was still listening or even if the Internet connection was still good. Then their video conference system also showed me on a separate screen, so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quiestrho/status/1006535865538146306\">we could actually see each other</a> during the talk (it was a little weird to see myself on an entire screen, though).</p>\n\n<p>For someone who usually does not prefer traveling (and cannot travel too far in a couple of years), I have to say this system is just perfect.

When you become famous, you may lose some opportunities of hearing other people’s disagreements with you. There are a few possible reasons:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>They may not be confident enough with their own opinions, and think you must be correct when there is a disagreement.</p></li> \n <li><p>They may think you are wrong, but choose not to speak up anyway, because they are worried that everyone else would agree with you, which could make them unpopular.</p></li> \n <li><p>Out of courtesy, they don’t want to disagree. They know you often feel good about yourself, and they don’t want to destroy your fantasy.</p></li> \n <li><p>They just don’t bother arguing with you. For example, they may think you are so obviously wrong, or they just don’t care about you.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>So the actual number of disagreements should usually be higher than the number you have seen. From my experience of reading comments and feedback on my blog posts over the years, I feel the vast majority of readers wouldn’t express their disagreement. There is no way for me to tell if they really agree with me, or just choose not to speak up. This has always been a puzzle to me.</p> \n<p>Anyway, I always welcome different opinions. We all have blind spots, which is why different perspectives can be extremely helpful. My words, written or spoken, are not meant to be carved into stone. I may change my opinions, especially after I hear different thoughts or see different perspectives from a discussion with other people. Below are two examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/closed-so-question/\">I ranted about some Stack Overflow users</a> and criticized them for closing posts too quickly. I said I didn’t understand why posts had to be closed. Colin Gillespie kindly explained it to me and defended the Stack Overflow community. I appreciated the explanation very much.</p></li> \n <li><p>Originally I linked to Aaron Swartz when <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/bookdown-crc/\">I was talking about open-access publications</a>. Maëlle Salmon felt uncomfortable with that and thought I was judging Aaron. I admit that some links in my posts are very subtle and deserve explanations, but sometimes I don’t have enough time or the topics are too sensitive.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>I wish more readers could be like Colin and Maëlle. It is totally fine that you don’t agree with me, or dislike what I said—please feel free to let me know in these cases. I think there is a good chance that we can reach an agreement after exchanging more thoughts. Even if we don’t, that is also fine.</p> \n<p>I’m totally open to critiques, too. There are things I hate in my own work and products (and actually, my self). If nobody mentions them, I may not be motivated to fix or improve them. If you criticize me, you will actually be helping me. Here are two examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>I’m not really satisfied by <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/\">the R Markdown book</a>. Before I started writing it, I explicitly aimed at publishing it as quickly as possible,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:On-one-hand-I-m\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/12/on-disagreement/#fn:On-one-hand-I-m\">1</a></sup> so I sacrificed a bit quality. I feel most chapters are fairly dry (especially those about output formats), and some chapters are too brief (e.g., Chapter 17). If people can point out the parts they particularly dislike, I will have a better idea on what to improve in a next edition. For example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bearloga/status/1012422401534058501\">Mikhail Popov mentioned</a> his struggles with customizing templates, and that was great feedback to me.</p></li> \n <li><p>Chester Ismay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/old_man_chester/status/994690785982345216\">published a review of the <strong>bookdown</strong> book</a> in The American Statistician this year, and pointed out several places that are confusing or too challenging in the book. I agree with his critiques. If I publish a second edition of this book in the future, I’ll make sure to take this review into consideration.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In fact, occasionally I want to speak up my disagreement with certain people but I’d hesitate because I don’t know what their attitude is and I don’t want to offend or hurt them. I hope this post will remove the hesitation of readers who disagree with me. Going forward, I’m always looking forward to more of your corrections of my biases and mistakes.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/daaaad.gif\" alt=\"Feel free to correct me when you feel anything is wrong. Don't hesitate.\" /></p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:On-one-hand-I-m\">On one hand, I’m usually busy enough and could not afford too much time on writing the book. On the other hand, R Markdown had been invented for five years, and it should be a good time to have an official guide. I could aim at quality instead of publication speed, but I doubt if I would ever be able to finish the book. BTW, let’s keep our fingers crossed for “the Shiny book”, or the seven volumes of “<a href=\"https://community.rstudio.com/t/plans-for-a-shiny-book/1080/15?u=yihui\">The Art of Reactive Programming</a>”! :) <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/12/on-disagreement/#fnref:On-one-hand-I-m\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/12/on-disagreement/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/daaaad.gif","linkMd5":"196b2db6a1406f4acd6b5505bb39d97d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-34-225_3e5958584ba70e00.webp","destWidth":200,"destHeight":200,"sourceBytes":541126,"destBytes":488628,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/daaaad.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-34-225_3e5958584ba70e00.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973440},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"On Adjectives","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/on-adjectives/","description":"<p>Among all types of words, I have always found adjectives the most challenging to use in communication (either writing or talking). They are challenging because (1) it is so hard to refrain from using them, and (2) it is hard to be precise.</p> \n<p>In my opinion, it is hard to refrain from using adjectives because usually we want to draw attention, and adjectives are the most effective type of words to draw attention. If we want to draw attention, we often tend to use adjectives that are biased and fail to represent facts. For example, we may use “supreme” when we only mean “good”, because we are afraid that other people won’t notice the good quality. Every time I go to grocery stores, I find labels like “<em>extra large</em> eggs” funny – as if the eggs would be a lot larger because of the label.</p> \n<p>The single piece of advice on writing that influenced me the most was this one:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>In writing. Don’t use adjectives which merely tell us how you want us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of telling us a thing was “terrible,” describe it so that we’ll be terrified. Don’t say it was “delightful”; make us say “delightful” when we’ve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers, “Please will you do my job for me.”</p> \n <p>— C.S. Lewis, Letter to Joan Lancaster, 26 June 1956</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Although I have reminded myself several times of this advice, I have to admit that I have failed numerous times to actually follow it. I often exaggerate, and don’t consider how readers would feel. Once a <strong>blogdown</strong><sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Perhaps-bookdown\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/on-adjectives/#fn:Perhaps-bookdown\">1</a></sup> user pointed out to me that I often use “just” and “simply” in my writing (e.g., “just do this” / “simply do that”), just like mathematicians often use “obviously” in proofs. These words are not necessary, and could potentially hurt readers: “You said ‘<em>simply</em> do these twelve things and I’ll be there?!’ How??” Sam Tyner’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sctyner/status/978821060220121088\">recent twitter thread</a> is an excellent example of how you could unconsciously hurt people by using words like “just” or “should”.</p> \n<p>The reason I use “just” or “simply” is that I tend to fool myself into thinking my tools are simple to use, and then hopefully fool readers, too, but the fact is that using the word “simply” alone won’t making tools simple. Only solid efforts in developing the tools will.</p> \n<p>In the real world, I have only found <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/959856196369793024\">a single person</a> so far who only states facts without using unnecessary adjectives or any tricks to draw attention in writing or talking. He is such a different person, and I admire him for his inner peace.</p> \n<p>I have hoped to write this post for long, because I see examples every now and then (including my own). After I saw the adjective <a href=\"http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/03/the-most-prolific-package-maintainers-on-cran.html\">“prolific”</a> today, I thought it might be a good time to write this post (I almost did it the last time when I saw <a href=\"http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/11/most-popular-r-packages.html\">“popular”</a>). To clarify, the purpose of this post is not to criticize anyone, but remind myself of either using adjectives appropriately, or just avoiding adjectives when possible.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Perhaps-bookdown\">Perhaps <strong>bookdown</strong>?

And Yes!” I don’t usually reply emails so quickly, but I had wished for a Midwest R conference for years.</p> \n<p>Born in a poor family, I have always been a frugal person, even though I don’t consider myself poor any more. On the other hand, I usually don’t like traveling, either (especially by air, which is often time-consuming and costly). Sam explained the motivations of the uncoast unconference <a href=\"https://sctyner.github.io/uncoast-unconf.html\">in her blog post</a>, and the travel cost is one of them.</p> \n<p>I drove from Omaha to Des Moines for a little over two hours, and attended my first unconference in April 2019. I should have written this post after I came back, but haven’t had a chance. In the past few days, I saw the announcement of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UUnconf/status/1229796050392829953\">2020 Uncoast Unconference</a>, and thought I should write down some reflections before I completely forget this event. I’m sure I have forgotten many things, and this post is my attempt to recall the rest of them from memory:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>I liked this unconference a lot. One of its striking differences with all other conferences was the food—nothing fancy about the meals or snacks. As Sam mentioned in the post “<a href=\"https://www.aaaspolicyfellowships.org/blog/five-ps-make-most-professional-conferences\">The Five P’s: Make the Most of Professional Conferences</a>“:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/uncoast-unconf/#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Conferences tend to provide a lot of snacks, but they are often things like sweets and muffins.</p> \n  </blockquote> <p>To be honest, personally I wish all conferences (including rstudio::conf) <em>not</em> to provide snacks during breaks. The extra calories are absolutely unnecessary for me. The breakfasts and lunches are often already too good to me. Normally I’m able to control my desire for snacks, but I hate that I have to control it. I’d rather they don’t exist in the first place.</p></li> \n <li><p>I remember Sam mentioned at the last day’s dinner that she wanted the attendees to “have the full Iowa experience”. I don’t take pictures very often, but I took this boring one from my hotel room:</p> <p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/75079989-496c8180-54d0-11ea-993e-fc57a37c2928.jpg\" alt=\"The hotel in which I stayed during the unconfernce\" /></p> <p>I love this feeling of living in the woods. There is no doubt that I enjoyed the “Iowa experience”. During the icebreaker session before the unconfernce, Sam asked us if we loved the Midwest. Craig (Van Pay), a student at Iowa State, told me the criterion to check if someone truely loves the Midwest was whether he/she loves Ames. I absolutely do. Even Omaha is too big to me. I love small villages.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CKVanPay/status/1234839299696119809\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESMGdH-WAAQby6s?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" alt=\"Craig and me, chatting about Ames at the door\" /></a></p></li> \n <li><p>I gave a crash course on HTML/CSS/JS on Day 0. I didn’t prepare the slides and just talked leisurely, since I was busy preparing the next three days’ meals for my family in the morning before I left (and they ordered pizza instead when I was away…). I thought I taught the tutorial quite poorly, but later I found <a href=\"https://uncoast-unconf.github.io/uu-2019-day-zero/04-html-css-js/Amelias-notes.html\">Amelia’s notes</a>, and I was astonished by how well she recorded what I mumbled at the podium.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/uncoast-unconf/#fn:2\">2</a></sup></p></li> \n <li><p>I discovered there was a ping pong table outside the conference room, and remembered someone said in her self-introduction that she liked playing ping pong. Eventually I found it was <a href=\"https://ranae.github.io\">Ranae Dietzel</a>. We played for about half an hour until other people started presenting their projects. Ranae’s ping pong skills were quite impressive! BTW, Laura Ellis just discovered <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RanaeDietzel/status/1228877735663194112\">Ranae’s tweet about <strong>patchwork</strong></a> last week, and I think <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LittleMissData/status/1229176433123168256\">Laura’s tweet</a> has become the single most viral #rstats tweet in history!</p></li> \n <li><p>I promised <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taraskaduk/status/1118591910384476160\">Taras Kaduk</a> that I’d write a blog post about this unconference, and finally here I am! I wrote the prototype of the <strong>rolldown</strong> package in a couple of hours, which surprised a few people because the productivity seemed to be too high. For this package, the prototype was easy for me because (1) I was familiar with the <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-widgets.html\">HTML Widgets</a> framework, and (2) the <a href=\"https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama\">scrollama library</a>’s API was relatively simple. Prototyping is often the easiest stage of developing a package. There will often be mountains of work in later stages. I was unable to afford more time on developing this package, so it should still be considered a prototype even if I have released an initial version to CRAN.</p> <p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4TaN5BWkAEr6Yk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" alt=\"Presenting rolldown at the 2019 uncoast unconference\" /></p></li> \n <li><p>In terms of productivity, I think the key is always to focus. Or in other words, to manage distractions. The unconference gives you a unique chance to hack on something for two days. When you are working with a group of peers side by side, it will be embarrassing if you continuously check email or social media. We do not need a huge amount of time to be productive—we do need an uninterrupted chunk time (it could be only two hours). During the unconference, I was only distracted by <a href=\"https://juliasilge.com/blog/datacamp-misconduct/\">one thing</a> on the first evening, and lost a couple of hours on it. Other than that, I was pretty much focused on the <strong>rolldown</strong> package.</p></li> \n <li><p>Sam asked us several questions in the icebreaker session and we stood by different sides of the room according to our answers. One question was “do you say coke or soda?” I decided that I would form my own group and not go with anyone else in the room because Chinese say neither coke nor soda. We actually say “Cola”. I thought I’d be unique, but to my great surprise, my PhD advisor Heike also joined my group. “Of course it is Cola!” The German said.</p></li> \n <li><p>It was great to catch up with some old friends such as my classmate Karsten Maurer and some RStudio colleagues at this unconference. I was also acquainted with a new friend there, Siqi Zhang. He was an interesting person, also helpful and enthusiastic. On our way back to the hotel, he basically wrote the <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6\"><strong>R6</strong></a> package with his tongue while sitting on the passenger seat in my car, without knowing the existence of <strong>R6</strong>. Five minutes later, I congratulated him on reinventing <strong>R6</strong>.</p></li> \n <li><p>Sam felt so excited when delivering the closing remarks on the last day that she couldn’t help crying in full joy. Yes, it was absolutely wonderful for these great people to get together and hack on interesting projects for two days. I really want to thank all the organizers, especially the other Sam (Helmich).</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>I don’t plan to attend this unconference this year, but I recommend that you do. I don’t think you have a lot of chances to isolate yourself from the rest of the world for a couple of days and focus on coding with a group of people. Meanwhile, this year’s Day 0 workshop will be led by Amelia McNamara, the most amazing note-taker I mentioned above, and Ian Lyttle, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/1222990245991313408\">the nicest person on the Internet</a>.

I don’t often talk about the “literate programming” aspect of <strong>knitr</strong>, but it is very interesting. I guess people mostly use <strong>knitr</strong> for the purpose of report generation from a linear combination of text and code. The power of “<em>programming</em> code chunks” is probably seriously underestimated. Note that here “program” is a verb.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/git-push-force.gif\" alt=\"The force is strong!\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"why-code-in-the-appendix\">Why code in the appendix</h2> \n<p>Last week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexpghayes/status/1039170310560464897\">Alex Hayes showed an interesting trick</a> on how to put all your code in the appendix of a document. This can be very useful when you don’t want to distract your readers with program code in the body of your report, but want to give those who care about the computational details a chance to know the details. An appendix will be the natural place to go for these code (especially when your output format is PDF or other formats to be printed).</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-magical-ninja-alex-s-method\">The magical ninja Alex’s method</h2> \n<p>Alex combined the chunk option <code>code</code> with <code>knitr::purl()</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\"># Code Appendix\n\n```{r code = readLines(knitr::purl(\"path/to/file.Rmd\", documentation = 1)), echo = T, eval = F}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>For those who don’t know the <code>code</code> option well, it is one way to provide the content of the code chunk. For example, the code chunk</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r code=c('1 + 1', 'print(\"Hello woRld\")')}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>is equivalent to</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r}\n1 + 1\nprint(\"Hello woRld\")\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>So the <code>code</code> option can be highly useful when the code of a chunk is <em>dynamic</em>. For example, you can read the code dynamically from an external R script.</p> \n<p>What <code>knitr::purl()</code> does is to extract all code chunks from a document and write them to an external file (an R script).</p> \n<p>Then with chunk options <code>eval = F</code> (don’t evaluate the code in this chunk again because the individual previous code chunks have been executed) and <code>echo = T</code> (display code of this chunk in the output document), you will have a code appendix.</p> \n<p>In Alex’s method, <code>path/to/file.Rmd</code> doesn’t have to be hard-coded, and can actually be replaced by <code>knitr::current_input()</code>, which gives you the path to the current input file.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-cool-hacker-lucy-s-method\">The cool hacker Lucy’s method</h2> \n<p>Although Alex’s method definitely works, it is not very efficient, because every time you compile the document, <strong>knitr</strong> has to parse the document twice (once for <code>knitr::knit()</code> and once for <code>knitr::purl()</code>).</p> \n<p>Among the replies to Alex’s original tweet, the very cool hacker<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:I-wish-I-had-tim\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/code-appendix/#fn:I-wish-I-had-tim\">1</a></sup>, Lucy D’Agostino McGowan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LucyStats/status/1039178545715662848\">pointed out the efficient way</a>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo = T, eval = F}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>After <strong>knitr</strong> parses a document, all code chunks and their labels are stored internally. You have access to these labels via <code>knitr::all_labels()</code>. With the <code>ref.label</code> option, you can pull all code chunks into this code chunk.</p> \n<h2 id=\"another-cool-hacker-in-a-parallel-universe\">Another cool hacker in a parallel universe</h2> \n<p>(Ten months later.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aosmith16/status/1144669579630669829\">Ariel Muldoon</a> independently discovered <code>all_labels()</code>, and also tried to filter the chunk labels programmatically:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r getlabels, echo = FALSE}\nlabs = knitr::all_labels()\nlabs = labs[!labs %in% c(\"setup\", \"toc\", \"getlabels\", \"allcode\")]\n```\n\n```{r allcode, ref.label = labs, eval = FALSE}\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>Clever! You got it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"but-calling-a-single-function-doesn-t-sound-like-programming\">But calling a single function doesn’t sound like <em>programming</em>…</h2> \n<p>Some people may say that the taste of programming in “literate programming” seems to be too light. Don’t judge code by its length. Simplicity is definitely a merit. However, if your task is complicated enough, you can certainly program a <strong>knitr</strong> document in any way you like. The sky is your limit when you can program something.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Practically-your\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/code-appendix/#fn:Practically-your\">2</a></sup></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/40735727/559676\">Here is a slightly advanced example</a>, in which you can extract certain attributes of code chunks, and print them in the end of a document. For example, you can create an appendix with the names of all theorems in your document.</p> \n<p>The fact that <strong>knitr</strong>’s code chunk options are evaluated like function arguments (meaning that you can write arbitrary R code in chunk options) and <strong>knitr</strong> gives you a hook system (<code>knitr::knit_hooks</code>) to manipulate pretty much everything means infinite possibilities to those who want to customize and program <strong>knitr</strong> documents. There was only one thing upon which I hesitated when deciding whether I should give users the access. That is <code>knitr:::knit_code</code>. Here the triple-colon is obviously a danger sign. When you can even modify the content of a code chunk, I have no idea what can happen. Evil or creative?

That sounded like a fun thing to me, so I posted an answer.</p>\n\n<p>Basically all you need to do is serve the website at the IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> instead of the default <code>127.0.0.1</code>, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">blogdown::serve_site(host = '0.0.0.0')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then all people with access to the local network should be able to see the website via your IP address (which typically looks like <code>192.168.0.x</code>) and the port number (<strong>blogdown</strong>&rsquo;s default is <code>4321</code>). If you are not sure about the IP address, take a look at your network preferences (or run the command <code>ifconfig</code> on macOS/Linux). The URL of your website should be of the form <code>http://192.168.0.x:4321</code>. You will see this address when you start serving the website on your computer.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, you can serve Shiny apps at <code>0.0.0.0</code>, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">shiny::runApp(host = '0.0.0.0')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a convenient way to show websites or apps to people in the same local network. They can look at them on their own screens (even on mobile devices) while you develop a website or app.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/programming-movie-actual.gif\" alt=\"Look at a website while the other person is developing it\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/localhost-0-0-0-0/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/programming-movie-actual.gif","linkMd5":"a379997d19466f7bca388ccecaaed80b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn59@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-37-079_d76eebcf930c36ee.webp","destWidth":390,"destHeight":293,"sourceBytes":1924398,"destBytes":435424,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/programming-movie-actual.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn59@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-37-079_d76eebcf930c36ee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973445},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Double Negatives","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/double-negatives/","description":"\n        <p>Every time I use the function <code>stopifnot(...)</code>, I have to stop and think about it: should the conditions in <code>...</code> return <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>?

Even if the repo is the special and conventional <code>*.github.io</code> (meaning Github Pages), you should provide a link explicitly so that visitors can simply click it. I have tried to copy the text <code>*.github.io</code> and paste it in my browser&rsquo;s address bar many times to open such websites when a repo does not provide an explicit and clickable link (yes, I&rsquo;m this curious to read other people&rsquo;s websites). Sometimes I even have to open the <code>CNAME</code> file in the repo to figure out the website URL. I don&rsquo;t think many people are as curious as me in these cases, so unless you want to hide yourself intentionally, please consider providing a description and a website in your Github repo (click the Edit button and fill out the two text fields).</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/bad-marketing/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/42730615-8b35a0be-87be-11e8-8095-f891230134be.png#border","linkMd5":"ca086368968cb56775a96de1758cdc8f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-35-100_3ceeca49c8750785.webp","destWidth":716,"destHeight":216,"sourceBytes":28700,"destBytes":12938,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/42730615-8b35a0be-87be-11e8-8095-f891230134be.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-35-100_3ceeca49c8750785.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Thanks, Alicia Schep, for Digging into knitr Engines","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/alicia-knitr-engine/","description":"\n        <p>Alicia Schep recently discovered an interesting fact about <strong>knitr</strong>: you can not only use other languages in R Markdown (Python, Julia, C++, Bash, SQL, and so on), but also actually have full control of <em>how</em> to run such code chunks.

While thinking about improving the <strong>gganimate</strong> support in <strong>knitr</strong> (per <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1021456429855780865\">Thomas&rsquo;s request</a>), I learned a little more about <strong>gifski</strong>. The usage seems to be quite straightforward to me, so I wrote a hook function in <strong>knitr</strong> today to support this package, which means you can easily create a GIF animation from a code chunk now if you have installed <strong>gifski</strong>, and at least version 1.20.14 of <strong>knitr</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">install.packages('gifski')\nif (packageVersion('knitr') &lt; '1.20.14') {\n  remotes::install_github('yihui/knitr')\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"basic-usage\">Basic usage</h2>\n\n<p>To make use of <strong>gifski</strong>, you may set the chunk option <code>animation.hook='gifski'</code>. Below is an R Markdown example:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, animation.hook='gifski'}\nfor (i in 1:2) {\n  pie(c(i %% 2, 6), col = c('red', 'yellow'), labels = NA)\n}\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will produce the &ldquo;Pac man&rdquo; below (assuming the output format is HTML):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/44246516-30c93000-a1a4-11e8-8aa5-8876e51a227f.gif\" alt=\"A gif animation of Pac man\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customization\">Customization</h2>\n\n<p>The main things you may want to tweak for the GIF animation are perhaps the dimension (controlled by <code>fig.width</code> and <code>fig.height</code>, or <code>fig.dim</code>), and <code>interval</code> (the delay between frames), e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, animation.hook='gifski', interval=0.2, fig.width=4}\nfor (i in 1:2) {\n  pie(c(i %% 2, 6), col = c('red', 'yellow'), labels = NA)\n}\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are other options that you can customize, but I guess you probably don&rsquo;t care (e.g., <code>dpi</code>). Note that the graphical device must produce PNG images since <strong>gifski</strong> only supports PNG at the moment, which means the chunk option <code>dev</code> must be a PNG device (e.g., <code>'png'</code> or <code>'CairoPNG'</code>).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ffmpeg-also-works\">FFmpeg also works</h2>\n\n<p>You can also use <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org\">FFmpeg</a> to create a GIF animation, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r, animation.hook='ffmpeg', ffmpeg.format='gif', dev='jpeg'}\nfor (i in 1:2) {\n  pie(c(i %% 2, 6), col = c('red', 'yellow'), labels = NA)\n}\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without setting <code>ffmpeg.format='gif'</code>, you will get a video instead (the default format is WebM). Gifski claims to be &ldquo;the fastest GIF encoder in the universe&rdquo;, and the package <strong>gifski</strong> does not have system dependencies (you don&rsquo;t need to install external software like FFmpeg), so if you want to create a GIF, it is probably the best way to go.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"please-test-it-yourself\">Please test it yourself</h2>\n\n<p>Please help me test the development version of <strong>knitr</strong>, and I&rsquo;ll appreciate your feedback. Many thanks to the R ninja Jeroen Ooms for the <strong>gifski</strong> package! For <strong>gganimate</strong> users, I guess a tighter integration between <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>gganimate</strong> should be coming soon. <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/issues/134\">Please stay tuned</a>.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/gifski-knitr/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/44246516-30c93000-a1a4-11e8-8aa5-8876e51a227f.gif","linkMd5":"e9b9b33dc278143810987874de4af924","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-33-781_7d758e03064be7a1.webp","destWidth":672,"destHeight":480,"sourceBytes":12717,"destBytes":10552,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/44246516-30c93000-a1a4-11e8-8aa5-8876e51a227f.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-33-781_7d758e03064be7a1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973447},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"On source(\"https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/source-bioclite/","description":"\n        <p>About six years ago when <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2012/10/visiting/\">I visited Bioconductor</a> for the first time in Seattle, I asked them a question that I had for long: Why is <code>source(&quot;https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;)</code> the recommended way to install Bioconductor?

Instead, you may want a character string <code>&quot;a, b, and c&quot;</code> (Oxford comma FTW!). In 2014, I gave a guest lecture in a course at Iowa State. I prepared an example in which I wanted to output the names of some genes dynamically with an inline R expression in a <strong>knitr</strong> document. In the beginning, I didn&rsquo;t want to spend too much time on this task, so I just used <code>`r paste(x, collapse = ', ')`</code>, which would output a character string like <code>&quot;a, b, c&quot;</code>. This did not feel natural in the context (e.g., &ldquo;We identified genes a, b, c.&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>Driven by perfectionism, I decided to write a function, which ended up in the <strong>knitr</strong> package as <code>knitr::combine_words()</code>. The implementation was actually quite simple. Basically, for a single word, it will just return this word; for two words A and B, it return <code>&quot;A and B&quot;</code>; for three or more words, it returns <code>&quot;A, B, C, ..., Y, and Z&quot;</code>. The function also has a few arguments that can customize the output. For example, if you want to output the words in pairs of backticks, you may use <code>knitr::combine_words(x, before = '`')</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">knitr::combine_words(LETTERS[1:5], before = '`')\n# output: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since then, I have used this function by myself several times.

It is never about how cool the technology is, or how smart a developer is. It is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\">bus factor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of days ago I saw <a href=\"http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/CRAN-Update-protocol-buffers-on-macOS-for-RProtoBuf-td4750815.html\">an interesting reply</a> from Prof Ripley (I have to take a deep breath right now) re: building the macOS binary of an R package, in which he said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only one person can help you with that, and it is most effective to contact him directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think you all know whom he meant. The whole R world on macOS is pretty much on his shoulders. Help us, Simon Wan Kenobi, you are our <a href=\"http://scifiquotes.net/quotes/152_Youre-My-Only-Hope\">only hope</a>. We all macOS R users should be extremely grateful to him. But&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>That is also what I&rsquo;m deeply worried about. When users run into certain problems, only one person can help. One person managing more than 12,000 binary packages (although most should be easy to build).</p>\n\n<p>I have been waiting for CRAN to fully embrace Homebrew &ndash; not only the Homebrew packages, but the Homebrew development model: <em>let the most motivated people work on the particular problems</em>, instead of having one person to manage them all. You care about a certain binary package? Then you bring a pull request to build it yourself, and make sure you pass the automated tests. The repo maintainer does not really have to know well about every single package.</p>\n\n<p>To some degree, building an open source project is like growing cucumbers. When the project is large enough, it is much more important and sustainable to build a trellis for cucumbers to grow by themselves than taking care of individual cucumbers.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/single-driver/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d099ab1093b3d5f07b33c6808ada9d45","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Do You Have to Use FontAwesome or Other Libraries for Web Symbols?","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/character-entity/","description":"\n        <p>As a software developer, I prefer lightweight stuff and avoid dependencies when possible. Over the years, I have been leaning more and more towards &ldquo;frugality&rdquo;. I used to be big fan of libraries like jQuery and FontAwesome, but now I rarely use them any more. I started to write vanilla JavaScript after I suddently discovered <code>document.querySelector()</code> one day (before that, I thought <code>$()</code> was the only way to select a node in the world).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, I stopped using special libraries such as FontAwesome for icons and symbols after I looked through the full list of <a href=\"https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref\">HTML character entities</a>. Yes, this list of symbols is much shorter than that in FontAwesome, but I often refrain from using fancy symbols, so this list is rich enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, I only need a couple of symbols, so I really don&rsquo;t want to import a full external JS/CSS library. For example, yesterday I wanted to add icons after those external links on <a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com\">the <strong>rmarkdown</strong> website</a>, to indicate that they will be opened in new windows. Eventually <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/commit/02a87d69bf\">I found and added the entity <code>&amp;boxbox;</code></a> (double boxes &boxbox;), which was a perfect symbol for my purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, when I was designing <a href=\"https://xmag.yihui.org\">the hugo-xmag theme</a> for Hugo, I also got an inspiration from the list of HTML entities: I realized I could easy turn a letter into a Blackletter, e.g., <code>&amp;Afr;</code> is &Afr;, and <code>&amp;Bfr;</code> is &Bfr;, etc. So the default site name is generated in Blackletter in the hugo-xmag theme. It looked cool to me, and didn&rsquo;t need any third-party dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>Certain HTML entities may not work in all web browsers, but I don&rsquo;t really care. For my personal websites, I have no intention to support legacy browsers.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/character-entity/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"87e4d279196a47042d0782f34b9ab93d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Yue Jiang: A Ninja with Sharingan","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/yue-jiang/","description":"\n        <p>So you all know that the package name <strong>xaringan</strong> was from <a href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan\">Sharingan in Naruto</a>.

In software development, we often face such difficult decisions as developers. Sometimes one road may seem to be “obviously” better than the other, so you make the decision for your potential users, and only support that road.</p> \n<p>The only problem is “obviously”. Obviousness is in the eye of the beholder.</p> \n<p>When designing the <strong>knitr</strong> package, I thought it was obvious that the working directory when running a code chunk should be the parent directory of the input file, instead of whatever the current <code>getwd()</code> is. This decision turned out to be the one that users hated most. I think I can still defend my decision, but I can also see their point and cannot deny the confusion caused by this decision. Anyway, <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/limit-of-bureaucracy/\">I didn’t block the other way</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"to-docker-or-not-to-docker\">To Docker or not to Docker</h2> \n<p>Recently, Patrick, one of the contributors of <strong>xaringan</strong>, wrote a function <code>decktape()</code> to export slides to PDF via DeckTape, which looked like this originally:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">decktape = function(file, output) {\n  args = shQuote(c(file, output))\n  system2('docker', c(\n    'run', '--rm', '-t', '-v', '`pwd`:/slides', '-v',\n    '$HOME:$HOME', 'astefanutti/decktape', args\n  ))\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>He liked Docker, and I could definitely see the benefits of Docker. DeckTape can run with or without Docker, like any other software packages, but DeckTape is a NodeJS package, so you know… The lovely dependency hell there…</p> \n<p>When I saw Patrick’s function, I decided to make it work without Docker, too. The reason was that the alternative way was trivially easy to implement. For conciseness, the four dots <code>....</code> below indicates identical code in the above function so that you can easily see the extra code I added:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">decktape = function(...., docker = Sys.which('decktape') == '') {\n  ....\n  if (docker) system2(....) else system2('decktape', args)\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>That is low cost in implementation, but high return in usability. There might be users who’d rather deal with the Node dependency hell instead of pulling a Docker image of several hundred megabytes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Well-if-you-npm\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/two-roads/#fn:Well-if-you-npm\">1</a></sup> It is not necessary to block their way or convince them why Docker is the ultimate best solution.</p> \n<p>BTW, note that the default <code>docker = Sys.which('decktape') == ''</code> means if the user has chosen to install <code>decktape</code> locally and it can be found via the <code>PATH</code> variable, <code>xaringan::decktape()</code> will not use Docker (i.e., <code>docker = FALSE</code>). The default should reflect the user’s intention reasonably well. If the guess is incorrect, they can manually specify <code>docker = TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"from-file-or-not-from-file\">From File or not from File</h2> \n<p>Here is another example of two roads in a wood: <a href=\"https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/issues/265\">jeroen/jsonlite#265</a>. I don’t mean to criticize the bestest ninja in the R community (i.e., Jeroen), but this example is very representative in my eyes. I want to talk about it so others can learn from it. Basically, when there is a function that is supposed to deal with text data, it is common that the first argument of the function can be either the text or a file path (or a URL, etc.). A common trick is like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">process_text = function(x) {\n  if (file.exists(x)) x = readLines(x)\n  paste(x, collapse = '\\n')\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>So both <code>process_text('foo/bar.txt')</code> and <code>process_text(c('a', 'b'))</code> will work. This looks very neat, but the problem is, what if the input <code>x</code> is literally a character string that only happens to be a real file path?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:The-function-sho\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/two-roads/#fn:The-function-sho\">2</a></sup> And what if the user entered a wrong file path by accident?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:The-function-sho\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/two-roads/#fn:The-function-sho\">3</a></sup> The cleverness will bite us in these cases. What I often do is this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">process_text = function(x, content = readLines(x)) {\n  paste(content, collapse = '\\n')\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>It provides both ways to users. They can process either a text file, or a character string. They know more about their data, and we don’t have to guess for them.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">process_text('foo/bar.txt')\n# if foo/bar.txt is not meant to be a file path\nprocess_text(content = 'foo/bar.txt')\n# signal an error if the file path is wrong\nprocess_text('foo/baz.txt')\n</code></pre> \n<p>Actually <code>jsonlite::fromJSON()</code> is cleverer than that in guessing. <a href=\"https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/blob/a68e1d46e2ae6450cd46c12be0e32fd66d12a90c/R/fromJSON.R#L86\">It has multiple rules</a> to decide whether the input is text or a file path, but no matter how clever it is, it still can backfire if the user doesn’t have a way to tell it if the input is text or a file path, because guessing, is guessing, after all.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># what if there is really a file named [1]?\nxfun::in_dir(tempdir(), {\n  f = '[1]'\n  writeLines('[1, 2, 3]', f)\n  on.exit(file.remove(f))\n  jsonlite::fromJSON(f)  # expecting c(1, 2, 3) but returns c(1)\n})\n</code></pre> \n<p>FWIW, <a href=\"https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/commit/e384ddd\">Jeroen has added a new function</a> <code>jsonlite::parse_json()</code> that only deals with text input, which is great!</p> \n<p>In short, we could absolutely love one road, or be clever on one road. Just make sure you have thought about whether it makes sense to block the other road.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/latex-ignore.gif\" alt=\"This way or that way?

When I fill out questionnaires, I often cannot help thinking if the designer has tried to fill out his/her own questionnaire (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food\">eating your own dog food</a>), because some questions are essentially very difficult to answer, although they look easy.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier last month, I took the 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, and I found a few really difficult questions, such as the one that asked me to rank 10 aspects of a job opportunity in order of importance:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-survey.png\" alt=\"Ranking 10 aspects of a job opportunity\" /></p>\n\n<p>You may think 10 is a small number. Indeed it is. I can count to 10 without using my toes. The problem is that when you compare <code>n</code> aspects with each other, you will end up with doing <code>n * (n + 1) / 2</code> comparisons. In this case, you need to do 55 comparisons to accurately answer this question. How long do you think it will need to make 55 decisions? The time is probably not trivial. Also consider that this is only one of the many questions in the survey.</p>\n\n<p>So what would a busy developer do? For me, I just dragged the most important aspect to the top, and left the rest of them untouched. I could imagine some other people would do the same. If any Stack Overflow employee (hey <a href=\"https://juliasilge.com\">Julia</a>) is interested, it will be great to verify it next year: randomize the 10 options for every developer who is going to fill out the questionnaire, and check if only a very small number of options have been moved when the survey is done. It could be verified this year, but since everyone filled out the same questionnaire, there is a tiny probability that most people actually agreed the default order was the order they believed to be appropriate. Without randomization, it is hard to exclude this possibility.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m not really sure how I should interpret the results of such surveys when they are published, because they are based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_sampling\">convenience sampling</a>. For example, developers of one programming language could be more responsive than those of another language, so it could be potentially biased to infer that one language is more popular than the other.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/stackoverflow-questionnaire/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-survey.png","linkMd5":"bcba869ab6a6446e69bc6c79b546e0ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-36-094_3f7c50fe8e8eada3.webp","destWidth":786,"destHeight":644,"sourceBytes":17709,"destBytes":52044,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-survey.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-19-36-094_3f7c50fe8e8eada3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973465},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Another R-Podcast with Eric Nantz","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/r-podcast/","description":"\n        <p>Eric Nantz <a href=\"https://www.r-podcast.org/episode/013-interview-with-yihui-xie/\">interviewed me in 2013</a> while we both were attending a workshop in Muncie, Indianapolis. This time we met again at the RStudio Conference, and he asked me to do another interview. I thought it might be a good idea to review the past five years, so I accepted the invite. Below are some of the questions he prepared to ask me, and my initial responses, in case anyone prefer reading over listening (like me). The audio version of the interview is <a href=\"https://r-podcast.org/episode/024-rstudioconf-yihui-xie/\">here</a>. <strong>EN</strong> is Eric and <strong>YX</strong> is me below.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: Since the last time you appeared on my podcast you&rsquo;ve become a software engineer at RStudio and from my perspective have been very successful! Has your role been everything you envisioned?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: I believe pretty much everyone in this world has a bright and dark side, just like the moon. But usually people only notice the bright side of others. From your perspective, I might have been &ldquo;very successful&rdquo;. Over the five years I worked at RStudio, I did get a few things done. When I first joined RStudio in the Fall of 2013, I was assigned to the Shiny team, and I mainly added DataTables and selectize.js support in Shiny. In 2014, I started working on <strong>DT</strong>. In 2015, I spent a fair amount of time on <strong>leaflet</strong>. At that point, I had been working extensively on JavaScript applications. I was definitely not a JS professional. I kind of enjoyed hacking with JS, but I was obviously not passionate enough about my job at that time.</p>\n\n<p>Now here comes my dark side. Due to several reasons, including that I was not super passionate (I was passionate, but just not <em>super</em> passionate) about JS and I was poor at interpersonal communication, I started to put aside my official job, procrastinated frequently, and disappeared from the team from time to time. As time went by, it became a serious inner crisis of mine. In 2014 and 2015, I constantly felt depressed. It is probably hard for you to imagine the huge amount of my depression, anxiety, shame, and guilt. I&rsquo;ll write <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/\">a longer blog post</a> on this matter later. For now, I just want to say that it was completely my own fault, and I learned some very bitter lessons. I joined a dream company very easily, but I ruined myself and let several people down in the first two years.</p>\n\n<p>It took me a while to recover from my early career crisis, but things got better in 2016 as I started to work on the <strong>bookdown</strong> package. My personal interest and the company interest were finally aligned, and I became highly motivated. The year 2017 was similar. I absolutely love writing, and I really wish to improve tools for writing, no matter it is writing books, or blog posts. To answer your initial question: yes, now I&rsquo;m very satisfied with my role in the company.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: It&rsquo;s safe to say that R Markdown has become its own R ecosystem with powerful frameworks and extensions to create interactive reports, entire web sites, and more recently blogs via <strong>blogdown</strong>. What&rsquo;s next in the continuing evolution of R Markdown?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: At this point, you can compile single documents, make slides, create dashboards, build interactive applications, write journal papers, author books, and generate websites with R Markdown. That does sound like an amazing ecosystem, and I&rsquo;m very proud of it (although I definitely should not take all the credit). It is natural to ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t have a clear idea at the moment. I do have something to do in the next couple of months, but I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it. It is not because it is a secret, but because I usually don&rsquo;t want to make early promises.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of things to do in the farther future, I think there is still quite a bit of work to do to make R Markdown work seamlessly with journals. We have a package named <strong>rticles</strong>, but honestly I don&rsquo;t think it has fully met the standards of journals yet. The other thing I&rsquo;m very interested in is to build books from blog posts. It is kind of like a combination of <strong>bookdown</strong> and <strong>blogdown</strong>. I think it will be useful, and may generate a lot of new books from the R community. Have you heard of or read the book &ldquo;Rework&rdquo;? It was compiled from blog posts of its authors, and became a bestseller.</p>\n\n<p>Many people don&rsquo;t understand the point of Markdown, especially those LaTeX users. They don&rsquo;t understand why we invest so much time in such a simple and weak authoring language. My philosophy is that the pursuit of features can sometimes be harmful for both software developers and users. You may spend too much time on features of software, and even forget what you actually need to do (e.g., write a book). To exaggerate a bit, no feature is a good feature. The weakness of Markdown is a good feature. It forces you to focus on the content, and more importantly, it makes your content portable: you can generate PDF, HTML, Word, and many other formats.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I have my strong faith in the R Markdown ecosystem. I think it will save users a lot of time and make them productive, so I&rsquo;ll certainly keep working on it until the whole ecosystem is complete.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: You recently mentioned that you want to get back to other R packages you&rsquo;ve developed, in particular the <strong>DT</strong> package. I know I can have a difficult time jumping from one large scale project to another completely different effort (say from an enterprise shiny application to some statistical modelling packages). Do you have any tips on balancing the development and maintenance of projects that have fundamentally different purposes and code bases?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: This is a really hard question for me. I think it is essentially a question about psychology. It happens that I&rsquo;m extremely interested in psychology, and sometimes I think I&rsquo;m good at applying psychological methods to other people, but ironically, I&rsquo;m poor at dealing with myself. For example, it is hard to motivate myself to switch to a different project.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest part of switching to a different project is the initial psychological friction. Once you get past that, things will be a lot easier. I believe most people understand this, however, not many people really have the willpower to overcome the initial friction. It is like doing physical exercises. You know it will be good for your health, but you still hate it every time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: Since we last talked at the 2017 rstudio::conf your <strong>blogdown</strong> package has matured and is rapidly growing in popularity for R users who want to start an online blog (and thank you for giving me the foundation for my new R-Podcast site the way I always envisioned it!) Has developing blogdown been any easier or harder than say <strong>knitr</strong>, <strong>rmarkdown</strong>, and <strong>bookdown</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: In terms of programming, yes, it was much easier than <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>rmarkdown</strong>. The total number of lines of code in <strong>blogdown</strong> was less than 2000 (<strong>knitr</strong> has about 8500).</p>\n\n<p>The main challenge in the development was not about writing clever code, but user experience. I spent a fair amount of time on listening to beginners. I wanted to see the possible ways that they might get stuck, and things in the documentation that they might misunderstand.</p>\n\n<p>The documentation, i.e., the <strong>blogdown</strong> book, was also a difficult problem to tackle. I mentioned in <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/valid-url/\">a previous post</a> that Chapter 2 (Hugo) and the appendix were particularly hard to write. There were so many things to explain, and I need to think carefully how not to overwhelm readers (I don&rsquo;t think I was very successful in this regard).</p>\n\n<p>I invited Amber Thomas and Alison Hill to join me and co-author the book mainly because after I read their <strong>blogdown</strong> tutorials, I felt they cared a lot about beginners and were patient enough to explain things. This is the spirit that I value most. I don&rsquo;t really care much about the level of technical skills.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: Recently your new book about <strong>blogdown</strong> was published and it was developed completely in the open. Do you think this is a viable model for say others in the R community who want to start creating a book?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: Honestly I don&rsquo;t know. It is up to the publisher. I was fortunate enough to work with Chapman &amp; Hall, and my editor John Kimmel did a great job negotiating with his boss. They were granted the exclusive right to print and sell the hardcopies, and we would reserve the right to keep the free versions online. Some people <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wvykta/status/960112256351694848\">have found it hard to believe</a> that there are so many free books on <a href=\"https://bookdown.org\">bookdown.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I want to bring up another relevant topic: Should books and papers be free? I feel there is prejudice against commercial companies especially in the academia. In my opinion, you need to consider the work behind the publications (e.g., my copyeditors were helpful and I think they deserve being paid well). People who did the work to publish the work (authors and employees of publishers) need to survive, like you and me. They may have families to support, and so on. That said, sometimes I do feel certain journal papers and books are way too expensive. I feel the marketing and sales people didn&rsquo;t do a great job, or perhaps it is just that we don&rsquo;t really need publishers anymore (low demand leads to ridiculously high price).</p>\n\n<p>For me, I can make my books free just because my employer pays me well, and I don&rsquo;t need the extra income.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be a member of the RBind team and I am very excited to see how it&rsquo;s helped other R users quickly get their content from <strong>blogdown</strong> online. Tell our listeners more about RBind, how they can get involved, and your overall goals with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: Rbind is a Github organization <a href=\"https://github.com/rbind/\">https://github.com/rbind/</a>. The name obviously came from the R function <code>rbind()</code>. The goal is to bind all websites related to R and stats to a single place, so that we can discover these websites more easily, and more importantly, we can study the source files of websites that we are interested in (e.g., an exceptionally beautiful website).</p>\n\n<p>I think this aligns well with the spirit of open source. I attended a speech by Richard Stallman in 2010 at the useR! conference, where he emphasized the freedom to study, modify, and reuse software. When you see a great website, I hope you have the freedom to study its source, too, and apply the great things you learned from other people&rsquo;s websites to your own website.</p>\n\n<p>A small gift to Rbind member is a free subdomain <code>*.rbind.io</code>, if you like it. You may request one from <a href=\"https://github.com/rbind/support/issues\">https://github.com/rbind/support/issues</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>EN</strong>: What tips do you have for achieving a healthy work-life balance? I know for myself I can struggle with how to manage a demanding job with a young family and contributing to the R community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>YX</strong>: You have got several really hard questions for me, Eric. Although I can provide an answer to you, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not a representative sample due to my distinctive personality, and what I&rsquo;m going to say probably won&rsquo;t apply to other people in the R community. First of all, I don&rsquo;t feel there is a clear border between work and life to me, probably because I enjoy working so much that working becomes a part of my life. I constantly work in late nights and over weekends, whenever I get a chance. By &ldquo;getting a chance&rdquo;, I mean the little ones are not crying or pulling my legs. Secondly, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of personal hobbies, but only a few effective ones that can help me relax and enjoy life. My only hobbies are badminton, cooking, reading, and writing. I&rsquo;m not interested in things that most people are, e.g., computer games, movies, entertainment programs, or sightseeing. Yes, I&rsquo;m such a boring person.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I want to emphasize the importance of a healthy body, although you must have heard of this many times before. Don&rsquo;t exchange your health with other things such as wealth or fame or anything. When I feel sleepy, I just go to sleep (of course, thanks to the flexibility of working from home).</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/r-podcast/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4d56648b1b97749e638c3ed0ce8fec4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973465},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"The Second Pull Request Could be (Much) Better","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/second-pull-request/","description":"\n        <p>When considering pull requests on Github, we need to keep in mind that even if someone&rsquo;s first pull request is not 100% perfect, his/her second one could be much better (if he/she is willing to continue the contribution).

Problems like this are so hard to debug.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I always configure my text editors to add a newline to the end of text files (below is a screenshot of my RStudio options), so I probably would never have discovered this issue by myself.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://db.yihui.org/images/rstudio-newline.png\" alt=\"Ensure that source files end with newline in RStudio\" /></p>\n\n<p>Update on 2018-06-05: This issue just <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/50686292/559676\">continues to confuse more users</a>.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/04/rprofile-trailing-newline/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://db.yihui.org/images/rstudio-newline.png","linkMd5":"eccc9a714f90a734398929b70cbcbb10","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-33-700_cfb1e4d613998ddd.webp","destWidth":594,"destHeight":584,"sourceBytes":18796,"destBytes":20944,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://db.yihui.org/images/rstudio-newline.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-19-33-700_cfb1e4d613998ddd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973462},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"A Follow-Up Post on My Early Career Crisis Post (Finally)","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/career-crisis-follow-up/","description":"<p>In the post “<a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/\">My Early Career Crisis</a>” earlier this year, I promised that I’d write a follow-up post to talk about my thoughts and advice for managers and fresh PhDs. This is the major “debt” I owe you before I can focus on my next project. I thought I’d better pay it off now, so I can have something new to talk about at rstudio::conf 2019.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Again-this-is-th\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/career-crisis-follow-up/#fn:Again-this-is-th\">1</a></sup></p> \n<h2 id=\"the-statue-of-responsibility\">The Statue of Responsibility</h2> \n<p>I guess everyone knows the Statue of Liberty, but not many know the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Responsibility\">Statue of Responsibility</a>. Dr. Viktor E. Frankl, the person who came up with the original idea, stated that:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This was very insightful. I don’t know if it is worthwhile building such a physical statue on the west coast, but whenever you talk about freedom, you should also think about the other half of the truth: responsibility.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/45893844-3b25ad80-bd92-11e8-82ff-9702a1900198.png\" alt=\"The statue of responsibility\" /></p> \n<p>Freedom was one of the main topics of my career crisis post. I enjoyed too much freedom and independence for too long, and didn’t think much about responsibility. My first advice to graduate students is that you should bear responsibility in mind while enjoying the freedom in academia.</p> \n<p>However, I should mention that responsibility is actually fairly tricky in academia, because people are <em>knowledge workers</em>. In general, it is hard to measure responsibility for knowledge workers. Even when you have a weekly meeting with your advisor to talk about your progress, you may be able to survive the meeting with just half an hour’s work instead of the expected twenty hours. Usually there are no physical products from your research projects like those produced by labor workers. It is tempting to change your goal from “deliver a research project” to “just survive the next meeting”. You will develop a habit of avoiding responsibility with the latter goal.</p> \n<p>For managers and advisors, you may have to spend a little more time on making responsibility more measurable when you realize an employee or student seems to be unproductive. It can be slow for one to gain the sense of responsibility, and you may start with assigning explicit bite-sized tasks to them. At the same time, also keep the long-term goal in their mind, and let them feel the possible future excitement from time to time (e.g., how awesome you will be when you accomplish this project). I understand that some projects may go nowhere and can fail. In this case, make sure they have at least learned something in the process, such as a good habit for working, a sense of responsibility, or knowledge for another project.</p> \n<p>Responsibility may be accompanied by anxiety, which is extremely poisonous. If you, as a manager/advisor, discover that an employee/student is failing to keep the responsibility, you need to figure out the cause. If it is because the task is too challenging, consider reducing the difficulty or providing more resources. If it is because they are dodging the assigned task and working on their side projects, you may need to be a little forgiving for a while and see if you can pull them back. It may be worth changing the task, too, if it turns out that their side projects are valuable. Anyway, try not to let anxiety grow quietly in their mind.</p> \n<h2 id=\"why-talents-fail-easily-burned-by-strong-passion-and-too-many-choices\">Why talents fail: easily burned by strong passion and too many choices</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouyang_Xiu\">Ouyang Xiu</a>, a famous Chinese essayist of the Song dynasty one thousand years ago, once lamented that “智勇多困于所溺” (those clever and brave are often trapped by what fascinates them).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:From-https-zh-wi\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/career-crisis-follow-up/#fn:From-https-zh-wi\">2</a></sup> This resonated well with me, although I don’t consider myself clever but I do consider myself brave.</p> \n<p>There are two dangers in being a talent. One is that failures seem harder to endure, especially after you have poured a lot of enthusiasm but suddenly fall flat. The other is that you may have many more choices than others when thinking about what to do, so you only pick what you will enjoy. Both enthusiasm and your favorite choices can trap you.</p> \n<p>A month after I wrote my crisis post, <a href=\"https://purrple.cat/blog/2018/03/22/i-m-not-looking-for-a-job/\">Romain François wrote his version</a>, titled “I’m (not) looking for a job”. This post has stayed in my browser for six months till today,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:As-you-can-see-f\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/career-crisis-follow-up/#fn:As-you-can-see-f\">3</a></sup> because I saw we had so much in common. Well, I have to admit that I always did all pages of my exams, and Romain didn’t bother to open the second page of his physics exam. Both of us fell in love with programming and were not interested in statistics theories but passed the exams with flying colors anyway. Both of us tended to overcommit ourselves, not knowing how to say no. Both of us created websites for statistical graphics galleries, and those websites died. Both of us had given training courses that we had no idea about, and prepared that the night before. Both of us were structureless and lost from time to time.</p> \n<p>To some extent, we were punished by our cleverness and passion. Here are some of my advice to those clever, brave, and passionate graduate students:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Passion is not necessarily good or bad. It is <em>unguided</em> passion that is dangerous. As long as your passion is carefully guided, it is extremely powerful. Don’t let your passion kick you around randomly. Without delivering results and products, you are just wasting your energy, even if you feel you are busy and working hard.</p></li> \n <li><p>Being smart on one subject doesn’t guarantee you will succeed on anything or be able to work on anything. Both your knowledge and time are limited. You are likely to be more famous than your peers because of your talent, so more people may reach out to you for various matters, but don’t work or promise/agree to work on things just because you (potentially) can.</p></li> \n <li><p>Be brave to work on challenges, but don’t throw the whole world behind and disappear in the woods. The dark side of being brave is that you may be unreasonably stubborn, too. You don’t have to listen to other people’s feedback and opinions, but you have to at least make sure to hear them. Be brave to start, but more importantly, be brave to stop (which is much more difficult). On the other hand, although you have a lot of choices, don’t always only pick up things you like to work on. In April, I said this in <a href=\"https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/04/01/data-is-my-job/\">an interview by Amstat News</a> when being asked “what career advice would you give your 20-year-old self”:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Try more often to do things you don’t like but are important at the same time. It is easy to do things you like, but in the real world, there is no guarantee you will like all tasks assigned to you.</p> \n  </blockquote> <p>I was basically paraphrasing Huxley’s words, which I learned from “Poor Charlie’s Almanack”:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>“Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a man’s training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly.”</p> \n   <p>— Thomas Henry Huxley</p> \n  </blockquote></li> \n</ul> \n<p>For managers and advisors, the most important task is to guide these talents. Keep teaching them to say no, focus, and structure their lives. Let them feel the joy of accomplishments and remember it. Cal Newport’s book “<a href=\"http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\">Deep Work</a>” has been very useful to me. I think talents suffer more from distractions because they have both inner distractions (such as the strong desire to work on random side projects) and outer distractions (such as people reaching out to them for help).</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-guilty-you-are-not-alone\">The guilty you are not alone</h2> \n<p>One major observation I made from my crisis post was that many people could relate my situation (procrastination, guilt, and anxiety, etc.) to their own. I received several public comments and private feedback. Apparently, I was not the only one who struggled, but probably only one of the minority who had written about it publicly.</p> \n<p>I don’t want to blindly soothe those who feel guilty when they procrastinate or fail to do what they are supposed to do. That would be irresponsible of me. As long as you don’t abandon yourself, I think there is still hope. You need to figure out the root cause of your procrastination. Is the cause from outside or inside?</p> \n<p>For example, I had both external and internal causes. The internal cause was that I had other interesting projects that I hoped to work on. The external cause was all kinds of distractions (emails, Github issues, questions, social media, and so on). To solve the internal issue, all I had to do was talk to my manager. For external issues, they are trickier to deal with. I guess some of them are not totally my fault, such as the very addictive social media (they use algorithms to make us feel addicted, and it is hard to fight against the addiction). So far two books have helped me most: one is “Deep Work” as I mentioned before, and the other is “Amusing Ourselves to Death”. The former teaches you specific strategies to deal with chaos (e.g., don’t feel obliged to reply to every single email). The latter is more about the (TV) culture in which we are surrounded by irrelevance, meaninglessness, and shallowness, when messages can be passed around at the speed of light and create the unnecessary FOMO (fear of missing out). If you don’t stay alert about this chaotic time we live in, you won’t be able to accomplish anything substantial.</p> \n<p>It turned out that once I was able to fix the internal cause, the impact of the external cause became much smaller, because I was very willing to focus on the projects that I was genuinely interested in. So my last advice to graduate students and fresh PhDs is that when the guilty feeling starts to hit you over and over again, talking to your advisor or manager may be a much better idea than just quietly feeling guilty by yourself. I know this can be challenging especially for introverts (like myself). You may choose an approach that makes you most comfortable to express yourself. For example, I prefer writing over talking, so I’d email my manager.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/images/introverts.jpg\" alt=\"Introverts, unite separately in your own homes! (My favorite image about introverts)\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2> \n<p>In this follow-up post, first I emphasized that with great freedom comes great responsibility. Remember this when you enjoy the freedom. Then I talked about the blind spots and weakness of talents. Prioritize things that lead to your promised deliverable. Lastly, I encourage you to speak out for your vulnerable self. You may be surprised by other people’s willingness to help you.</p> \n<p>In the end, I want to sincerely thank all those who shared thoughts with me and encouraged me after I published that blog post. With so much power gained, I successfully finished and published the R Markdown book this year. Recently I just started working on an exciting new project, which will be an important step toward one of my life goals.

Usually I start working on the source code like most other developers, and I&rsquo;ll finish the R package documentation at the same time. The package documentation is often too dry and not enough for users to learn a package systematically, because the topics in the package documentation are not arranged in a logical manner (only listed alphabetically). So I have also been trying to write books. These things have consumed me a considerable amount of time, so I have been leaving tests behind, even though I hate doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have identifed three packages that seriously lack testing (I have also opened Github issues for them):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>xfun</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xfun/issues/5\">https://github.com/yihui/xfun/issues/5</a></p></li>\n\n<li><p><strong>blogdown</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/318\">https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/318</a></p></li>\n\n<li><p><strong>tinytex</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/59\">https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/59</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope someone could help me with them. Personally I use a tiny package named <strong>testit</strong> for testing: <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/testit\">https://github.com/yihui/testit</a> (I guess most other people use <strong>testthat</strong> but I don&rsquo;t find its sophistication appealing to me). If you use RStudio, you may run the tests via <code>Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T</code>, which essentially runs R scripts under the <code>tests/</code> directory.</p>\n\n<p>A test with <strong>testit</strong> is typically in this format:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">library(testit)\nassert('What a function is expected to do', {\n  (FUN(args, ...)) %==% EXPECTED_OUTPUT)\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">assert('as.character() converts values to character', {\n  (as.character(123) %==% '123')\n  \n  (as.character(1:3) %==% c('1', '2', '3'))\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can write multiple expressions inside the curly braces <code>{ }</code>. If an expression is inside a pair of parentheses <code>()</code>, it is expected to return a logical vector of <code>TRUE</code>&rsquo;s (cannot be of length zero or contain <code>NA</code>), otherwise <code>assert()</code> will signal an error to indicate the test failure. Expressions not in <code>()</code> are evaluated as normal R code and their values are not checked.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The infix operator <code>%==%</code> is a shorthand of <code>identical()</code>, i.e., <code>x %==% y</code> is the same as <code>identical(x, y)</code>. You might use <code>==</code> for less strict comparisons, e.g., <code>1:3 == c(1, 2, 3)</code> will be <code>TRUE</code> (of length 3), but <code>1:3 %==% c(1, 2, 3)</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (because integer is not identical to double).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, many of other packages that I maintain also lack sufficient testing (e.g., <strong>knitr</strong>). Please feel free to work on any packages you like. I believe as you work on these tests, you will understand many internal functions much better, because you have to clearly know what each function is supposed to do! Sometimes you may have to split a big function into smaller ones, and test these small parts separately. Please feel free to refactor/split whenever you think is necessary. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for your pull requests!

This morning I received a <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/266\">Github issue</a> with the same question in the <strong>blogdown</strong> repo. This is bad in several ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I ranted two months ago that <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/12/so-bounties/\">people should be more considerate when closing questions on Stack Overflow</a>. It is fine to close questions or put them on hold, but you should know what you are doing in the first place, i.e., ask yourself &ldquo;Do I really understand this question? Am I an expert in the tags used in the question?&rdquo; Again, a Pandas expert and a Vaadin (??) expert voted to close a <code>blogdown</code> question. They could well be Hugo and <strong>blogdown</strong> experts, although they have answered zero Hugo questions on Stack Overflow so far. How about the rest of three R experts? Zero, too.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>It is a Hugo issue and not directly relevant to <strong>blogdown</strong>, but is a very valid Hugo question. Hugo decided last year that it would no longer generate the full content but summaries of posts in the RSS feed, which has created a lot of headache to users. I believe it was a bad decision, but the developer was trying to conform to the RSS standard. I don&rsquo;t think this particular standard makes much sense, but it is not too bad.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>They suggested the OP post the question to the <strong>blogdown</strong> repo on Github, which means the single, busy, and already burned-out developer (i.e., me) will have to answer it, unless a kind user who has watched the repo and wants to help before I get up (unfortunately, after I had little ones, I started to get up very early). I believe <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/\">questions should be asked in the community first</a> (the OP did it and I appreciate it), which will benefit everyone, including the developer and future users with the same questions. Honestly, I&rsquo;m very, very tired of answering pure questions on Github. It has consumed too much of my time, and constantly <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/\">pushes me to my physical limit</a>. I cannot handle all questions there. I just cannot. I very much want to close pure questions without responding anything, but so far I haven&rsquo;t done so, because I know the innocent users don&rsquo;t understand my situation.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>It was not a great question. I only have a single criterion for not so great questions: if the answer can be found on the first page of a Google search, it is not a great question. Here you go: <a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hugo+rss+full+content\">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hugo+rss+full+content</a>. The direct answer is currently in <a href=\"https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/8368\">the second result</a>, and the fundamental answer is in <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/\">the first result</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand the benefit of closing questions on Stack Overflow. If you close a question, no one can answer it (you&rsquo;ll have to wait for five people to vote to re-open it), even if it is a valid question. If you don&rsquo;t close it in such a hurry, what will be the bad consequences?</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/closed-so-question/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f61f7bdbb0428f366e010fa6fc3775a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973464},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"My Early Career Crisis (2014 - 2015)","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/","description":"<p>When I was interviewed on the R Podcast on Feb 3, I briefly <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/r-podcast/\">mentioned</a> my early career crisis for the first time to the public.

I ran out of time after I finished this post, and I’ll write <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/career-crisis-follow-up/\">another blog post in the future</a> to summarize the explicit advice I want to give to managers and PhDs.</p> \n<h2 id=\"you-ve-always-got-issues-yihui\">You’ve always got issues, Yihui</h2> \n<p>I had dinner with a few Iowa State alumni in San Diego on Feb 3rd when we were attending the RStudio Conference. Someone at the table recalled that I missed the useR! 2016 conference at Stanford due to visa issues, and my classmate Stephanie Zimmer said “You’ve always got issues, Yihui” followed by her trademark “Ha-ha-ha-ha”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Stephanie-was-th\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/#fn:Stephanie-was-th\">1</a></sup> after she heard about the incident. She said so and laughed for a reason.</p> \n<p>When I first arrived in the US in 2009, my backpack was stolen in a restaurant in DC, and I lost a lot of things, including my money, passport, and the plaque of the John Chambers Software Award (I went to DC first because of this). This incident shocked everyone in the stats department at ISU later, and I quickly became “famous” before I arrived at ISU in Ames. The faculty and staff in the department kindly donated a good amount of cash to me. That was the reason I donated the royalties of the <strong>knitr</strong> book to the department four years later. Anyway, this incident was a tragedy to me in the beginning, but became a fond memory later.</p> \n<p>So yeah, I’ve always got issues. Sometimes funny, and sometimes not so funny. Sometimes I make good trouble, and sometimes I make really bad trouble.</p> \n<h2 id=\"what-i-gained-from-doing-a-phd\">What I gained from doing a PhD</h2> \n<p>I want to start this post from my PhD life at Iowa State, because I believe a seed was deeply planted in this period (4.5 years), which eventually led to my crisis. I remember <a href=\"http://www.pgbovine.net\">Philip Guo</a> once said doing a PhD basically means you exchange wealth with freedom, i.e., you gain a lot of freedom, and sacrifice the potentially much higher income.</p> \n<p>Freedom. That was exactly what I gained during my PhD training. I was very fortunate to have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Cook_(statistician)\">Di</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Hofmann\">Heike</a> to be my advisors. They were exceptionally open-minded, and had always been supportive in both my research and my life. Di would grab and pay my bill every time we eat at a restaurant. Heike gave me a large sum of cash when I first arrived in Ames, but never cashed the check I wrote to her a few months later after I no longer had financial difficulties. They treat students like their children.</p> \n<p>I have always been a self-motivated person, and almost always know clearly what I want to do. It happened that I was extremely interested in statistical graphics in the first two years at ISU. I spent most of my time on the <a href=\"https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas\"><strong>cranvas</strong></a> package (a very cool R package for interactive graphics), and I think they were quite happy with my work, so was I. Occasionally I felt it was hard to stop working on it.</p> \n<p>I was not completely focused on <strong>cranvas</strong> all the time, because of a few side projects, including the <a href=\"https://yihui.org/animation/\"><strong>animation</strong></a> package and the community <a href=\"https://cosx.org\">Capital of Statisitcs</a> (COS) that I founded in 2006 to help promote statistics and R in China. In particular, I spent a huge amount of time on the latter, without telling my advisors. Both <strong>animation</strong> and COS were meaningful work, and helped lots and lots of people, but that should not justify my stealing of the PhD research time.</p> \n<p>Things quickly became worse in late 2011, when I started working on <strong>knitr</strong>. I was so fascinated by the fact that I could eventually significantly improve Sweave, which had tortured me for a number of years. I didn’t talk to my advisors in advance, and jumped straight into <strong>knitr</strong>. From that week, I started to have a mixed feeling in my heart: I was super excited by <strong>knitr</strong>, and I felt guilty to leave <strong>cranvas</strong> behind. Every week I met with Di, I felt anxious because I procrastinated indefinitely on <strong>cranvas</strong>, which was supposed to be the topic of my PhD dissertation, whereas <strong>knitr</strong> was not on the original plan at all.</p> \n<p>I was able to read the disappointment<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:As-Prof-Tian-Zhe\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/#fn:As-Prof-Tian-Zhe\">2</a></sup> from her eyes, but usually I’d try to forget the anxiety five minutes after I left her office and continue working on <strong>knitr</strong>.</p> \n<p>As I said, my advisors were very open-minded. I’m pretty sure <strong>knitr</strong> wouldn’t be born, had I worked with other advisors. They were disappointed that I started to work on a package irrelevant to statistical graphics, but they didn’t stop me. To some extent, they sacrificed their own interest in favor of other people’s interest, and the number of “other people” turned out to be huge in the coming years.</p> \n<p>I graduated in December 2013, and my thesis was about <strong>animation</strong>, <strong>cranvas</strong>, and <strong>knitr</strong>. By that time, my habit of procrastination had become very serious. I tried my very best to procrastinate on things that I didn’t intrinsically love, such as writing the PhD thesis. I finished the thesis only a few days before my defense. I was supposed to send the thesis to my PhD committee at least two weeks in advance, but I bet no one would read it two weeks in advance, so I only sent them a Dropbox link instead of a PDF attachment in the email, to give myself a few more days to complete it. That shows what an incredible expert I was at procrastination.</p> \n<p>So Dr Xie got a PhD degree in statistics, with an invisible “master” degree of procrastination. From the eyes of onlookers, I might seem to be a successful PhD. I published a few papers, I wrote a few R packages, I was invited to many conferences, and gave a huge number of talks. I received the Snedecor Award from the stats department, the highest honor that a PhD student in the department could earn. But they didn’t see the shadow in my heart, neither did I (precisely speaking, I saw it but I just denied it).</p> \n<h2 id=\"i-procrastinated-but-didn-t-waste-my-time\">I procrastinated, but didn’t waste my time</h2> \n<p>I have always been interested in psychology (in particular, all kinds of psychological biases). Most people have a tendency to justify and comfort themselves when they actually know they are doing something wrong but enjoying it at the same time. I’m no exception. I procrastinated on my PhD research, but I helped a lot of people, and I enjoyed developing <strong>knitr</strong>. Perhaps unlike other procrastinators, I could confidently say that I didn’t waste my time. I rarely spend time on entertainment (TV, games, or parties, etc). I actually work extremely hard, to a degree that you probably cannot imagine: see how many GIT commits I have pushed to Github, how many Github issues I have resolved, and how many questions I have answered in mailing lists and on Stack Overflow, and so on. The numbers are often on the magnitude of thousands.</p> \n<p>But I wasted other people’s investment in me. Di tried to bring me to Iowa State, hoping that I could do excellent work in statistical graphics. I failed. That was only one of my several examples of wasting other people’s investment.</p> \n<p>I did my summer internship at the AT&amp;T Labs in 2012 with Simon Urbanek, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 2013 with Raphael Gottardo. I never showed up at any meetings at the AT&amp;T Labs, and I probably met Simon four times throughout the summer (including once in the restroom). I was working on <strong>knitr</strong> and didn’t do the work he expected me to do. The last day before I left, I apologized for my inactivity, and Simon was basically speechless. Same thing happened the next year in Raphael’s lab: I never actively reported to him, and he had no idea what I was actually doing. I was still working on <strong>knitr</strong>. In both summers, I often slept all the way to 11am (as a night owl), and nobody checked where I was or what I was doing.</p> \n<p>Yet I heard praises, all the time, which gave me further justifications of only working on things I liked. My software packages are open source, and now I call that type of open source “selfish open source”, because I was only thinking of making myself happy. One of the ways to make myself happy was to make others happy with my software. It was merely a side-effect and coincidence that these packages turned out to be useful to many other people.</p> \n<h2 id=\"my-strengths-and-weaknesses\">My strengths and weaknesses</h2> \n<p>To analyze my personality, I need to start from my elementary school. I have almost always been an A+ student since I was a second grader. I never thought I was smart. I just studied extremely hard, partly due to poverty and partly due to the inspirations from a few of my older cousins who studied hard. In the three years of my high school, I rarely took a nap at noon, although napping was compulsory in the school. I often hid and studied in the restroom after everyone else in the dorm had slept at noon and in the night. It hurt my eyes, but more importantly, I lost the ability to ask questions and ask for help. I just try to figure out everything by myself. Till today, I still feel nervous when someone asks me “Do you have any questions for me?” Because I almost surely have no questions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Tareef-often-ask\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/#fn:Tareef-often-ask\">3</a></sup> If I do, I’ll figure them out by myself. I don’t talk much in daily conversations.</p> \n<p>A couple of weeks ago when I checked in at the front desk of the hotel to attend rstudio::conf, the conversation was like this (which is a typical one of mine):</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“Check in, please.” (Handing over my ID and credit card at the same time. I knew she would need my credit card for incidentals. I just wanted to save her a question.)</p> \n <p>“Okay… You stay here for three nights and check out on Feb 4th, right?”</p> \n <p>“Yes.”</p> \n <p>“Your room was booked by your company, and your personal credit card will only be charged for incidentals.”</p> \n <p>“Okay.”</p> \n <p>“Do you need maps of the hotel and the city?”</p> \n <p>“No.”</p> \n <p>“Do you have any questions?”</p> \n <p>“No.”</p> \n <p>“Okay. Your room number is XXXX, and follow this way to the elevator.”</p> \n <p>“Thank you!” (Phew! Ran off.)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I’m a little afraid of one-to-one conversations on non-technical topics. I often feel the other person is expecting me to say more, looking me in the eye, but I don’t have anything more to say, which leads to awkward silence. That is probably why I often avoid eye contact when talking to people.</p> \n<p>I can also give an example of how I avoid asking for help. I love cooking, but I have a rule in the kitchen: I don’t want anyone to wander in the kitchen when I cook, and I always refuse help, no matter who offers to help, or how many guests I have to cook for.</p> \n<p>Independence is both my strength and weakness. My independence is quite extreme. Somehow all my undergraduate and graduate advisors happened to have made good use of it. I attended Renmin University of China, and obtained my bachelor and master degrees there. My advisor Prof Zhao was more of an economist, and knew nothing (technical) about R. I had no interest in economics (you may feel funny why we chose each other, and that is another story). Most of his students worked on his projects, but I rarely did. He gave me the full freedom to learn R and statistical graphics by myself because he knew I loved them, and rarely asked me to help with his projects, although he had a lot. He offered me the financial support to travel to Germany twice to attend the useR! conference, and a statistical graphics workshop. These were my first international trips, and I met Di and Heike at the workshop for the first time. The consequences of him respecting my independence turned out to be:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>I became a first-generation R user in China, and probably also contributed a little bit to the role of statistical computing and graphics in statistical education in China.</p></li> \n <li><p>I founded COS, which included the earliest web forum for R in China (which is still alive after 12 years and I’m still active in it).</p></li> \n <li><p>I organized the first R conference in China after I came back from the useR! conference in 2008. Now this conference attracts thousands of attendees every year (and it has always been free).</p></li> \n <li><p>I wrote my first R package, <strong>animation</strong>. Because of this package, I got Hadley and Di’s attention. Because of their attention, I was accepted and invited to the graphics workshop. Because of this workshop, I went to Iowa State… You can complete the rest of the circle by yourself.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>These things show another of my strength: if I’m allowed to work completely independently, I can pour an infinite amount of energy into things I love, and I can keep the energy for years and years. Sometimes I’m just too excited to sleep and can even keep working until I’m physically sick. However, my weaknesses are also revealed at the same time:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>No matter if I’m allowed to work independently, I tend to work independently anyway. What’s worse, I avoid communication, because I don’t want to be interrupted, which is selfish.</p></li> \n <li><p>While I’m exceptionally good at focusing on things I love for a really long time, I’m also exceptionally bad at moving my focus to the work I don’t enjoy, and I’ll procrastinate on such work.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Both weaknesses are terrible in a company environment. In the academic environment, they do not really hurt due to several reasons, including (1) there is a lot of freedom in academic research; (2) professors are often nice, kind, and busy; (3) one advisor often has multiple students working on the same project; (4) there are no strict criteria to evaluate the output of academic research (papers might be one, but professors are so good at publishing papers…); (5) sometimes academic researchers have no direct clients to serve, which means nobody cares if you succeed or fail. In general, I feel the pressure in academia is less than that in the industry.</p> \n<p>I think the free atmosphere in academia makes sense, but it was not good for me, because I could easily be spoiled. I would be gradually sliding into a bottomless hole in this environment. I need a tough coach to guide me on how to use my energy. I felt like I had a machine gun in my hands, but I had been shooting at random objects all day long.</p> \n<h2 id=\"joining-rstudio\">Joining RStudio</h2> \n<p>I made JJ’s (CEO of RStudio) acquaintance in 2012 because of the <strong>knitr</strong> package. Later we did four talks together. I liked and admired him. He was both visionary and practical. Of course, I also loved the RStudio IDE. The total time I spent on job hunting was probably five minutes: we had a brief phone call in 2013, and he made an offer. It was that simple. The salary in the offer was way beyond my expectation. I highlighted the salary here because I’ll mention it again later. It will be one of the two solutions to my problems.</p> \n<p>The other great advantage of working for RStudio was that I was able to work from home, which means, freedom. I had already been spoiled by freedom in academia, and then I was offered even more freedom. There wouldn’t a boss in the back watching over me when I work. How free was that!</p> \n<p>I was first assigned to the Shiny team, and worked with Joe Cheng (CTO of RStudio). My first task was to bring DataTables to Shiny. I was not a JavaScript professional and sometimes had to “copy and paste from Stack Overflow”, but I enjoyed the work, and was excited when I saw the beautiful tables rendered in Shiny apps. I have always been fascinated by web technologies.</p> \n<p>It was a good start. Then I was interrupted by my PhD defense. I spent three weeks on my thesis, and defended it. I was still fully paid by RStudio in this period, although I didn’t deserve it. Not long after my defense, I was interrupted again by immigration issues (waiting for work authorization since I was no longer a student).</p> \n<p>When I came back to work in early 2014, I was assigned more tasks related to JavaScript libraries, such as selectize.js. I was also expected to maintain the <strong>shiny</strong> package, since Joe became busy with other things. I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of questions in the mailing list as well as the number of Github issues, thanks to the popularity of Shiny. They were a setback to me. After I tried a while to answer every single question that I was able to answer, and fix bugs that I could fix, I felt frustrated. Basically I had little time left to develop anything new. I saw questions and issues every morning, which could keep me busy until midnight. An unfortunate fact about me is that I actually like debugging and fixing bugs, and I’d rather do these things instead of developing new features in Shiny.</p> \n<p>I lost my passion, and started to step to the wrong direction, without talking to anyone. I had a few interesting projects of my own (including <strong>knitr</strong>), and I started to spend more time on them instead of my official job. In fact, these “interesting projects” included an early prototype of <strong>blogdown</strong>, but no one in the company knew I was so interested in it, because I didn’t tell them. Again, my problem of lack of communication.</p> \n<p>Joe had discovered my procrastination before he left. He didn’t blame me but tried to save me. He introduced techniques like Pomodoro to me to fight against procrastination. I didn’t really listen. I would only work a little bit when I saw he was obviously unhappy from his face. Eventually he left me alone. And I left my job behind. The mixed feeling of anxiety and excitement started to strike me again.</p> \n<p>In September 2014, Tareef (president of RStudio) talked to me about my problems, and gently reminded me that I should be more active at communication and more focused on my work. I felt very anxious when he talked to me, but again, five minutes later, I tried to forget it.</p> \n<p>Perhaps they felt I was not highly motivated by Shiny, and it happened that Joe had another project, <strong>leaflet</strong>, which he started quite a while ago but didn’t have time to turn it into a formal R package. It was handed to me. I was only moderately interested in it, but it felt better than the Shiny giant. At about the same time, I also started working on <strong>DT</strong>. I favored <strong>DT</strong> because I was more familiar with the JS library DataTables. I hadn’t used the JS library leaflet.js before, and it seemed to be complicated to me. Therefore I procrastinated on <strong>leaflet</strong> but made better progress on <strong>DT</strong>. Again, I chose to work only on things I liked.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-2015-winter-vacation\">The 2015 winter vacation</h2> \n<p>I went back to China to visit my family in Jan 2015, and flew back to the US in early March. It was a vacation of two months, which was unusual (to my knowledge, most other people would take at most one week’s vacation), so I promised I would work half-time while I was in China. I failed. I think the total amount of time I spent on my work was probably twenty hours in the two months. A number of reasons why I didn’t (actively) work:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>I went back to celebrate the Chinese new year with my family. I hadn’t had a chance in five years, because the dates for the Chinese new year are often not in the usual US winter vacation time. The Spring Festival means one thing to many Chinese: eating. I have a lot of relatives, and had to visit them one by one. Each would take a whole day. The Spring festival is much longer than Christmas in the western world (more than two weeks). I just kept eating, and felt like I was to eat all the delicious food I missed in the five years.</p></li> \n <li><p>It was freezing in winter in my hometown, thanks to whoever the genius it was to decide that the southern part of China didn’t need heating in winter a few decades ago (so we don’t have the infrastructure for heating). The temperatures outside and inside the rooms are pretty much the same. I had been spoiled by the heat in Beijing for seven years, and US for five years. I had never felt the keyboard (especially the trackpad) of my Macbook was so cold. It was like typing on a block of ice. Joe joked that I should try to build RStudio from source from time to time to keep my laptop warm. In my hometown, we typically burn wood in a special room to stay warm, but there was no Internet in that room in my parents’ house.</p></li> \n <li><p>Very limited Internet access. My parents live in the rural area, as most of my relatives do. Without Internet access, I gradually disappeared from the company, and nobody knew where I was or what/whether I was working (again, like when I did my internship).</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>After I had practically disappeared for several weeks, the company decided to change my role and cut my salary after some (presumably long) internal discussions. They thought I was not super interested in software development but teaching instead (or at least the software engineer’s role was obviously not appropriate for me). That was a misunderstanding, but completely due to my lack of communication. I love both software development and teaching. My performance as a software engineer was extremely disappointing. While I might well have the skills as a software engineer (although my skills were definitely not extraordinary), there was no sign to show that I could be accountable. I failed on <strong>shiny</strong>. I failed on <strong>leaflet</strong>. I failed on <strong>DT</strong>. The company tried really hard to save me, but they could not even find me in the first place.</p> \n<p>Even at this point, I was not fired. Someone in the company probably still had the faith that I could be changed. In retrospect, you can imagine how grateful I am to RStudio.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-failed-icsa-bulletin-editor\">The failed ICSA bulletin editor</h2> \n<p>I want to digress to one thing irrelevant to my work for a bit, because it also seriously affected me mentally in the same time period. In 2014, I accepted an invite from ICSA (International Chinese Statistical Association) and agreed to take the role of its bulletin editor, thanks to the recommendation of the previous editor. I accepted it because:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>I was bad at <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/11/on-saying-no/\">saying “No”</a>. I didn’t know how to refuse people. You can observe the same pattern in my software development: I tend to answer every single question, implement every single feature request, and fix every single bug. I don’t want to let people or users down. I didn’t know that (1) they would not necessarily be let down if I refuse to help, and (2) I had to let someone down because I had my own personal limit (I could not work 48 hours a day). Oftentimes, when I try not to disappoint one person, I’ll eventually disappoint another person, and actually disappoint that person <em>much more badly</em>. In this case, I tried not to let the previous editor down, and it turned out that I not only let him down, but also seriously let the president of ICSA down, and created an enormous amount of trouble to this association.</p></li> \n <li><p>I was actually interested in this role, and I was very ambitious. I helped the previous editor for two years, and thought the process of editing this bulletin was too inefficient. The editor had to do a lot of work in LaTeX, which could be significantly simplified via Markdown. I wanted to make it much easier to for ICSA members to contribute to this bulletin and for the editor to put together the articles in the final PDF. I saw it cost a lot of money for ICSA to print the bulletins, which didn’t make much sense to me and I thought the money collected from members was largely wasted. I was in favor of electronic distributions, and was hoping to turn the bulletins into appealing web pages, which was possible with Markdown (so was PDF).</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>It turned out I was too ambitious. I had a full-time job, on which I had already been procrastinating. I seriously underestimated the effort required to change the format of the bulletin from raw LaTeX to Markdown. What I was envisioning was essentially <strong>bookdown</strong>, which didn’t exist in 2014, but I had been thinking about it for long. How long did I actually spend on the development of <strong>bookdown</strong> later? A whole year (as my full-time job). I thought I would be able to turn the bulletin source format to Markdown in about a week. You see how ridiculously optimistic I was. Even now I still don’t think I’m ready to build a bulletin with Markdown, since there are still missing pieces in <strong>bookdown</strong> to support this type of publications.</p> \n<p>I was expected to make the bulletin ready for printing in Jan 2015. By Jan 2015, how much progress had I made? Basically zero. I tried Markdown on one article, and it didn’t seem to be straightforward. Then I left it behind. At that time, I had already got a lot of anxiety from my daily job, and I was fairly weak mentally. It was easy to give up extra challenges in this case.</p> \n<p>Then I had the aforementioned terrible vacation, in which both RStudio and ICSA were desperately looking for me. The ICSA president tried to reach me via several approaches: phone calls, voice/text messages, emails, wechat, asking other people to call me, and so on. I was too nervous to talk to him, so I ignored these messages as an ostrich.</p> \n<p>Finally he gave up, and appointed a new editor. That issue of the bulletin was delayed by four months, and note that it is a biannual bulletin. This probably had never happened before in the history of ICSA. I bet these ICSA people would never want to talk to me again. I felt extremely sorry and shameful about it. I still do, and will do.</p> \n<h2 id=\"empathy-vs-reality\">Empathy vs reality</h2> \n<p>Empathy is also both a strength and a weakness of mine. In particular, I have a strong sympathy for people who suffer from inefficient or buggy software (of mine or others). It is the most important reason why I was able to create a few user-friendly software packages. As I said several times before, I don’t have super strong skills for software development (I don’t know C, C++, Java, Python, or most languages you can imagine).</p> \n<p>It was the empathy that helped me succeed. It was also the empathy that destroyed me.</p> \n<p>When I agreed to be the ICSA bulletin editor, I had good intentions. I very much wanted to free future editors from the laborious work. I just ignored the reality that I wouldn’t be able to make it in such a short time.</p> \n<p>When you create a popular software package, you will receive a lot of praises, but at the same time, you will also receive a lot of feature requests, questions, and bug reports. My mistakes were (1) I was too satisfied and proud with the good words, and (2) I failed to realize my physical limit. I was lost in a forest of endless questions, requests, and reports.</p> \n<p>Sometimes I don’t understand how (most) other software developers manage to put these issues aside. As <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/back-to-dt/\">I mentioned in a previous post</a>, I had a ridiculous OCD that I didn’t want the number of Github issues to exceed 25 in any repository that I maintain. It was partly because of empathy, and partly because of my intolerance of imperfection. So far I have only observed one software developer who behaves like me: my colleague Kevin Ushey. He has been amazingly responsive in Github issues (I don’t know what his thoughts are, though). For most other (highly prolific) software developers that I know, I often see pages after pages of Github issues opened long time ago in their repositories. Perhaps that is the path that I should follow, too.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-inflated-ego\">The (inflated) ego</h2> \n<p>Along with my long-time “success” came my inflated ego. Ray Dalio also mentioned this problem in “Principles”: the ego and blind spots are the two deadly flaws of most people (especially “smart people”), and it is also extremely difficult to overcome them.</p> \n<p>I haven’t had many failures in my life, and have always been surrounded by praises. This may sound great, but it created a stupid ego, and made me so afraid of failures. Whatever I do, I want to be very successful. I could not accept failures or a self that didn’t sound as perfect as described (or imagined) by other people. It would be hard to imagine three years ago that I would write such a post to describe myself as once such a terrible badass.</p> \n<p>The ego also made me ignore people I shouldn’t have ignored. When Joe first reminded me that I should focus more on my job, I ignored him partly because I thought I was doing awesome work (secretly). That was arrogant. Joe was so much more knowledgeable and professional than me.</p> \n<p>Now I’m ready to kill my ego. To me, the ego will grow by itself unless I intentionally suppress it. I need to control myself and try not to seek for the mental reward from praises. Ray Dalio suggests us pay close attention to what is right or wrong in other people’s comments, instead of what makes us feel good or bad. We need to be careful enough not to be trapped by the feelings produced by our “lower-level” selves.</p> \n<p>This explains why I no longer tweet actively and frequently (now I primarily use Twitter for replying people). I don’t want to be fooled by the big number of followers or the numbers of likes or retweets of my tweets. I have quit my blog from the popular R-bloggers (for reasons including this one) and, if I remember correctly, never actively tweeted a single blog post of mine (sometimes I mention certain posts in replies due to the character limit). It also explains <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/12/so-bounties/\">why I aggressively cut my own reputation points</a> on Stack Overflow. I want to restore my sanity and evaluate myself objectively in a quiet world.</p> \n<p>To clarify, I definitely don’t mean people should not praise me (please don’t feel bad if you have ever praised me). It was all my own fault to indulge myself in the praises and reputation. I thought I was awesome even when I was essentially rotten inside.</p> \n<p>If you cannot kill yourself, don’t expect to rebuild yourself.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-direct-cure\">The direct cure</h2> \n<p>In the spring of 2016, I was invited to give a talk at a conference organized by the ASA Chicago chapter, where I met Karl Broman and a few other speakers. At the dinner, I told Karl that I had got the cure for my procrastination. He seemed to find it unbelievable (perhaps because procrastination was so common in academia, and he was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/798938827876421633\">also a person poor at saying “No”</a>).</p> \n<p>A cure for procrastination? Is there such a thing in the world?!</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/09/time-management/\">I had read a lot of articles</a> on how to stop procrastination. I had tried tools like Pomodoro. I can tell you that none worked for me. Some methods were actually harmful to me and made my situation worse, such as <a href=\"http://a.co/bTrPSTh\">The Art of Procrastination</a>.</p> \n<p>What cured me eventually was, as shameful as it sounds, my reduced salary. As I mentioned earlier, JJ offered me a great number initially. I probably had the highest (initial) salary among all PhDs in statistics in the US. After I returned from the 2015 vacation, my salary was substantially reduced. The worst feeling in this world is probably when you go from “top” to “bottom” (e.g., healthy to sick, rich to poor, famous to unknown, and lovestruck to parted, etc). The opposite way feels much better.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, I felt pretty bad at it. Fortunately, I hadn’t lost all my sanity. I thought and rethought about the whole thing, and concluded that it was completely my fault. I missed too many chances when there were helping hands in front of me. I rudely refused the help, and stubbornly went my own way, vanishing into the darkness.</p> \n<p>Now I feel the fundamental reason why I could not stop procrastination was because procrastination didn’t really hurt (enough). I procrastinated on <strong>cranvas</strong> because it didn’t hurt me. I was still able to survive and complete my PhD. Had my advisors said “I wouldn’t let you graduate unless you resume the work on <strong>cranvas</strong>”, I’d definitely give up <strong>knitr</strong> and COS (at least temporarily).</p> \n<p>Simply put, you just won’t procrastinate when you realize you are going to starve soon.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-fundamental-cure\">The fundamental cure</h2> \n<p>That was the direct cure, and it was not the best or fundamental cure. Again, I’m a self-motivated person and an introvert. Changing my personality in a short time will be hard. I do have my strengths, and the question is how to better take advantage of them.</p> \n<p>The answer turned out to be fairly simple. I just tell the company what I want to do, and they will think if the interest of the company is aligned with mine. Guess what? They have rarely said “No” to me. They value and respect my personal interests very much.</p> \n<p>Problem solved — if only I could talk to them.</p> \n<p>Before that, I was very afraid of telling them my thoughts, because I was afraid of rejections. I’d imagine them saying “Hey Yihui, you shall work on Shiny since Joe is so busy”, and “There is no point of working on R Markdown since JJ is on it.” These imaginary conversations may sound funny, but they show how poor I was at communication.</p> \n<p>My deep depression continued until I started working on <strong>bookdown</strong> in late 2015. It was a project that I wished to work on for at least two years. It was not only a project that I loved, but also a project in which Tareef patiently coached me to become a professional software engineer (that was why I thanked him in both the <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/acknowledgments.html\"><strong>bookdown</strong> book</a> and the <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/acknowledgments.html\"><strong>blogdown</strong> book</a>). The most important lesson I learned was: take some serious time to plan ahead, and try your best to stick with the plan in case of all kinds of distractions. This is drastically different with developing “selfish open-source software”. With the latter, you just do whatever you want, and whenever you like. No commitment, no responsibilities, no guarantee. While the freedom could make the developer fairly efficient sometimes (no pressure), it is harmful in the long run. You will be at best successful with a handful of things in a rather narrow field. Once you move outside of your comfort zone, your life will be utterly miserable.</p> \n<p>Another benefit of making a plan in advance is that you will be better at estimating the time to finish a project. Besides all weaknesses I mentioned above, I have yet another one: I’m bad at estimating time. More often than not, I need twice as much time as I originally imagined. For example, when I tell Tareef I’ll finish something in two weeks, it often ends up taking me four weeks or even more.</p> \n<p>To be honest, I’m still not comfortable with making plans and writing them down. I feel I’m busy enough every day, and don’t want to think what I want to do tomorrow, next week, or next year. But I’m still trying to think about it even only for one or two minutes every night before I go to bed. It is very helpful. In particular, it helps a lot with pushing away things that are not important but look urgent. You can always compare your plan with those “urgent” things, and decide the priorities.</p> \n<p>Among the many emails that Tareef sent to help me in early 2015, he once quoted Chris Hadfield (the astronaut):</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites you and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your time tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought you’d be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. Don’t let life randomly kick you into the adult you don’t want to become.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Don’t let life randomly kick you into the adult you don’t want to become.</p> \n<p>I think Tareef’s diagnostics of me were very accurate. I was basically letting life randomly kick me around. I had my strong passion (for software), and I had my life goals, but I constantly drowned in the random world.</p> \n<p>2016, <strong>bookdown</strong>, made a plan, and done. 2017, <strong>blogdown</strong>, made a plan, and done.</p> \n<p>It seems I have gained better control over my life now, but I clearly know that there is no cure that works once and for all. I still have to reflect on my failures and mistakes from time to time, because it is just so very easy and tempting to start drifting again.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-tumor\">The tumor</h2> \n<p>I’m going to digress a bit again here, to describe an incident in Oct 2015. Remember, “Yihui has always got issues.” One day I suddenly had a pain in the back neck. Initially I thought it was due to an injury when I lifted a heavy object upstairs a few days ago. In the following days, the pain became severer and severer. I had never had so much pain in my body. I went to see a doctor (for the first time in my five years in the US — I had been very healthy). A couple of weeks later, the MRI showed a tumor in my neck.</p> \n<p>Long story short, I had a surgery in December (first time in my life) and the tumor turned out to be benign. Thankfully, everything seemed to be fine. I wasn’t too scared when the tumor was first discovered, but I did think about life and death.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:It-was-also-refl\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/#fn:It-was-also-refl\">4</a></sup> It would be a shame if I died when I was still a terrible person (on my tombstone they would write “here lies a guy, irresponsible, and a failure”). Although it sounds like a cliche, you will be better at sorting out priorities today if you are going to die tomorrow. You wouldn’t care if “<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/386/\">someone is WRONG on the Internet</a>”, or someone is not convinced by your work, or someone wants a figure caption to be bold.</p> \n<p>But I still forget this from time to time. For example, why should I care about someone who didn’t buy the convenience of <strong>roxygen2</strong> a few weeks ago? I really shouldn’t have replied to that email. It was completely a mistake.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-future\">The future</h2> \n<p>I want to become a professional and responsible software engineer, and more importantly, I wish I won’t have to struggle much to work on my less favorite projects (such as <strong>DT</strong>). I’ll make fewer promises to the random world, because my past records show that I often failed to keep them, and the failures made me feel very guilty. I hate that feeling.</p> \n<p>I have been working 100% on open source packages since I joined RStudio. Although I’m definitely biased from the inside view, I have to say RStudio’s commitment to open source is amazing, considering that RStudio is a relatively small company. Both RStudio and I believe firmly in open source. I feel extremely proud of working for such a company. At RStudio, I can be rest assured that I don’t need to worry about other issues as long as I can focus on my work. There is zero bureaucracy in the company. I only need to spend about 10 minutes on a weekly meeting, and no time on traffic (since I work from home). Work hard, deliver results as planned, and I’ll be paid well. It is just that simple. Isn’t it a dream company? It is hard to imagine that I was so blind back in the early days. I need to value the opportunities.</p> \n<p>Starting an open source project is easy, but building it into a mature product is much harder. I think many people have discovered this fact, such as the very creative Romain Francois (he said this in <a href=\"https://r-podcast.org/episode/023-interviews-francois-pedersen/\">an R podcast</a>). As a matter of fact, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Zheng\">Wei Zheng</a> in the Tang dynasty of China also said it well 1500 years ago: “善始者实繁，克终者盖寡” (many people can start but few can finish).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:From-https-zh-wi\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/#fn:From-https-zh-wi\">5</a></sup> I wish I could develop a more solid habit of consistently carrying a product all the way to its destination.</p> \n<p>I want to quote Ray Dalio again to finalize this post. I went through a long period of pain and made bad mistakes, but the wise thing to do is embrace pain and mistakes:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature’s reminder that there is something important for me to learn.”</p> \n <p>“The most valuable habit I’ve acquired is using pain to trigger quality reflections.”</p> \n <p>“Everyone makes mistakes. The main difference is that successful people learn from them and unsuccessful people don’t.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Thanks, Tareef, JJ, and Joe.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><strong>Update on 2018-02-17</strong>: After I published this post, I received a lot of feedback in a short period of time, and I truly appreciate all your thoughts, encouragements, and care. I will see if I could summarize them in the future. For now, I just want to clarify it to those who were concerned about my mental health issues: I’m no longer depressed. The years 2016 and 2017 have been fantastic, and I have mostly recovered. Thanks again!</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Stephanie-was-th\">Stephanie was the happiest graduate student in the department.

Over the years, however, I have observed two things that are surprisingly hard and many people have stumbled over them, including experts in my eyes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-how-to-write-verbatim-content-especially-text-that-contains-three-backticks\">1. How to write verbatim content, especially text that contains three backticks</h2>\n\n<p>This is the thing that tortures me weekly, if not daily, because without knowing how to write verbatim text, the Markdown output will be poorly formatted. It is not rare for me to see Github issues like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/48208438-665f5e80-e338-11e8-9e9c-22e770a7e27e.png\" alt=\"Users don't know how to write verbatim content\" /></p>\n\n<p>Despite of the fact that I have explicitly mentioned in the Github issue template how to write verbatim text and I have also given an example, some users still fail to do this correctly. With dozens of other Github issues to deal with, I hope they could forgive me skipping issues like this. I don&rsquo;t mean to blame users like this one. Obviously they have read the issue template&mdash;the above user said in the Github issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hoping I have all the backticks right in this example.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is just that this Markdown syntax is too hard to understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>To write text verbatim, use three backticks to wrap the text.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```\nverbatim text here\n    \nmore verbatim text\n```\n</code></pre></li>\n\n<li><p>To write verbatim text that contains three backticks, you have to use four backticks to wrap the text.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">````\na normal paragraph\n    \n```\nverbatim text here\n    \nmore verbatim text\n```\n````\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, you need at least N+1 backticks to write N backticks verbatim. As an exercise, now you may ask yourself what you should do if your text contains four backticks, or five, or six. Note that instead of using N+1 backticks, you could also <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/05/four-backticks-github/\">indent the text</a>, but it can be tricky to determine how many spaces you need in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t fully realize how hard this &ldquo;simple&rdquo; rule was until I saw R experts like <a href=\"https://community.rstudio.com/t/13250\">JD Long failed to provide a reprex in plain text</a> a few weeks ago because it contained three backticks. He chose to post a screenshot of the text. I almost jumped off my chair and killed him <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/screenshots-vs-text/\">when I saw the screenshot</a>. At that moment, I realized I should give it up, and <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/501st-reminder/\">accept the fact</a> that this is just surprisingly hard for most Markdown users. Okay, I&rsquo;ll just bite the bullet and edit all your poorly formatted Github issues if I have time.</p>\n\n<p>Below is <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/180\">one more common example</a> of what users do when they don&rsquo;t know how to format text containing three backticks. I could give many, many <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/05/github-issue-format/\">more examples</a> like this. Again, the point is not to complain about these users, but show how hard it is for users to know the right syntax.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/48207715-dbca2f80-e336-11e8-942e-2232cf02585f.png\" alt=\"Users don't know how to write verbatim text containing three backticks and chose to comment out the text instead\" /></p>\n\n<p>BTW, I want to <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/thanks-marcel-schilling/\">thank Marcel Schilling</a> one more time for <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/help-answer-questions/\">helping me reply Github issues</a> (it is so great to have someone in an earlier timezone to help). You have made indirect yet important contributions to my other open source projects.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this issue to occur frequently in the R Markdown world is that R Markdown documents often contain three backticks (for code chunks). They also often contain three dashes intended for the YAML frontmatter, which happens to be the syntax for the second-level section headers, and you certainly don&rsquo;t want this to be displayed as a section header:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">---\noutput: powerpoint_presentation\n---\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-nest-child-elements-properly-in-a-list\">2. Nest child elements properly in a list</h2>\n\n<p>The second hard thing about Markdown doesn&rsquo;t appear frequently, but from the examples I have seen, few people really got it. That is, how to write elements other than bullets within a bullet list. In most cases, the answer is simple: you need to indent these elements. For example, if a bullet item has three paragraphs, the second and third paragraphs have to be indented, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">- One bullet.\n\n  With one more paragraph.\n  \n  And another paragraph.\n\n- Another bullet.\n\n  &gt; A quote.\n  \n  1. Or a numbered list.\n  \n  2. Number two.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The actual rules are actually fairly complicated. <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/11/thanks-tj-mahr/\">Again</a>, you have to read the Pandoc manual for <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#lists\">the precise syntax</a>. Note that I&rsquo;m talking about <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/time-for-pandoc-2-x/\">Pandoc 2.x</a> here. The rules were different in Pandoc 1.x.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, there is one lesser-known rule for numbered lists. That is, you don&rsquo;t have to use the incremental numbers <code>1.</code>, <code>2.</code>, &hellip;, <code>N.</code>. None of the numbers except the first one matter. Any numbers will work, which can be surprising. For example, the following examples all produce the same list:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">1. One\n2. Two\n3. Three\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">1. One\n3. Two\n2. Three\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">1. One\n9. Two\n5. Three\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Only the first number determines the starting number (it doesn&rsquo;t have to be <code>1</code>). The rest of numbers will be ignored. For people who care about the cleanness of their GIT history (like me), you can always use <code>1.</code> as the prefix, so your GIT history can be absolutely clean when you reorder items in a numbered list or add/delete items.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">1. One\n1. Two\n1. Three\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you have child elements in a numbered list, you also have to indent them, otherwise the output can be unexpected. As an exercise, guess what the following Markdown source produce:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">1. One\n\nMore on one.\n\n1. Two\n\nExplaining two.\n\n1. Three\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you may call me liar since I have been telling you that Markdown is simple.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u_%2819726522385%29.jpg/399px-Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u_%2819726522385%29.jpg\" alt=\"Liar Liar Pants On Fire!

After making a delayed assignment like this in advance:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">delayedAssign('command', {\n  # some R code\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can simply type <code>command</code> in the R console to actually execute the code. Of course, you could go with the normal way:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">command = function() {\n  # some R code\n}\ncommand()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that will be boring, right?</p>\n\n<p>I used this trick in my talks at <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr-talks/blob/master/useR2014/2014-knitr-ninja-Yihui-Xie.R\">useR! 2014</a> and <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/typing-fast/\">rstudio::conf 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lazy-loading-the-cache-database-in-knitr\">Lazy-loading the cache database in <strong>knitr</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The caching system in <strong>knitr</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/89b34a661/R/cache.R#L59\">uses lazy-loading</a> by default (the chunk option <code>cache.lazy = TRUE</code>). Lazy-loading means the results you cached will not be loaded in memory unless they are actually used later. This is very similar to the LazyData mentioned in Colin&rsquo;s post. To those hackers, you may make a lazy-load database using the <em>internal</em> function <code>tools:::makeLazyLoadDB()</code> (again, it is an internal function, so no guarantee in the future), and load the database using <code>lazyLoad()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t quite remember how I discovered this.

I do love questions that are quick, because the net gain can be significant: you won&rsquo;t need to spend hours on questions of which the answers are obvious to me.</p>\n\n<p>Most of time I reply to such questions within seconds after I see them, and some people have been surprised by how quickly I respond. The only problem is, those questions are not always quick. This can be particularly problematic when I&rsquo;m reading messages in IM (instant messaging) tools such as Twitter and Slack, because I usually don&rsquo;t intend to stay in IM tools for long. I often open Slack only once every morning to check messages from yesterday, and quit it for the rest of the day. I have installed a Chrome extension to limit my Twitter time to 10 minutes per day. When quick questions do not really seem to be quick, I feel I&rsquo;ll be stuck there. Should I continue to ask for more information (which can lead to several rounds of asking), or simply ignore the question? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/give-up.gif\" alt=\"Should I give up?\" /></p>\n\n<p>In general, I&rsquo;m not big fan of IM tools, although I&rsquo;m not truly against them. They are convenient indeed. For example, you can ask a friend for dinner together via a text message. That is totally cool. However, if you have something important to say, it is probably not a good idea to bury it in the endless and chaotic stream of messages. For example, I never believe it is a good idea to debate on anything on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>The possibility of your questions being unintentionally overlooked is one problem. The other problem is, by asking a quick question, you probably won&rsquo;t have a chance to think hard enough about the question or try a little bit to find the answer first. As a result, the question could be unclear, or due to a simple mistake. If you make a little bit more effort, you might just discover the answer by yourself.</p>\n\n<p>With apologies to Carl Boettiger, I want to use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cboettig/status/1014210705736851457\">a quick question he asked me on Twitter</a> today as an example to show the possibility of answering your own quick question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>@xieyihui stupid question for you: how can I put literal TeX into Rmd these days? I thought that just worked but pandoc (v2.1.1) seems to be auto-escaping stuff like <code>\\begin{tcolorbox}</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was surprised by this issue because that did not sound like what Pandoc would do. I mean Pandoc has supported raw LaTeX content in Markdown for years. I had a guess about how this could happen (special LaTeX characters that are not properly escaped in <code>tcolorbox</code>), but without seeing a reproducible example, it was hard for me to know if my guess was correct, which means I had to ask for more information. Then this wouldn&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;quick question&rdquo;. Instead of guessing and asking back and forth, I recommended him to file an issue with a reproducible example to the <strong>rmarkdown</strong> repo on Github. A Github issue would certainly be better than a tweet in this case: it is hard to provide a self-contained reproducible example in a tweet due to the arbitrary 280-character limit.</p>\n\n<p>Guess what? Then he just quickly realized what was wrong by himself. Had he tried to make a small reproducible example, he would not need to ask the question at all. Had I seen a reproducible example, I&rsquo;d probably notice the problem within seconds, too. The problem was just that the quick question contained too little information. When one has to start asking for more information or clarification, the quick question is no longer quick.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to discourage people from asking me quick questions. I just want to set your expectation correctly: when I don&rsquo;t answer a question on Twitter, it probably means it is not clear to me, and you may try to ask a slow version of the question on <a href=\"https://community.rstudio.com\">RStudio Community</a> or Stack Overflow or other places that don&rsquo;t have the length limit, providing as much information as you can. If you need convincing examples, you may take a look at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/datalorax_/status/1048199896132595713\">Daniel Anderson&rsquo;s experience</a> (he almost wanted to ask on Twitter but decided to go with Stack Overflow instead, and succeeded), or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richarddmorey/status/1202261694149472256\">Richard D. Morey&rsquo;s</a>, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsmevidhya_k/status/1206198154774761472\">Vidhya Kalaichelvan&rsquo;s</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the quick question might be like the two circles in the guide below on how to draw an owl, and the real question might be the owl on the right. Are you absolutely sure I can answer your question after seeing the two cirles?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/draw-an-owl.jpg\" alt=\"How to draw an owl\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/quick-questions/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 03 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/give-up.gif","linkMd5":"5e219675ca1cd306dd9b0df31ed3467f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-19-36-684_c9616a7195c5b12a.webp","destWidth":333,"destHeight":250,"sourceBytes":1435586,"destBytes":360140,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/give-up.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-19-36-684_c9616a7195c5b12a.webp","https://slides.yihui.org/gif/draw-an-owl.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-20-01-393_230861207ea17c1f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973460},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Impact: Depth or Breadth?","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/influence-depth-or-breadth/","description":"\n        <p>Last year someone invited me to give a talk to early career researchers at <a href=\"https://iscbasc2018.com/early-career-researchers-day/\">an ISCB conference</a> in Australia. I didn&rsquo;t go since it wouldn&rsquo;t be practical for me to travel that far in the next couple of years, but there was one thing I hoped to talk about if I were to talk to those early career researchers on choosing research topics (disclaimer: <em>I&rsquo;m not a researcher</em> so you probably shouldn&rsquo;t listen to me): whether you should pursue depth or breadth of the impact of your research.</p>\n\n<p>My principle is depth first. The broad impact may be a natural by-product.</p>\n\n<p>Actually <a href=\"https://slides.yihui.org/2017-rstudio-conf-rmarkdown-Yihui-Xie.html#34\">I briefly mentioned this</a> in an R Markdown tutorial I gave at rstudio::conf 2017. I said (as a software developer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make one person extremely happy first. Do not aim at making everybody (even mildly) happy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;d love to see people excited about my software packages, but I prefer a small number of people (could even be only one person) feeling extremely excited over a large number of people only slightly nodding. A couple of recent examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A while ago, Charles T. Gray discovered that <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> works on any Rmd documents (as I documented <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/compile.html\">in the R Markdown book</a>). And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cantabile/status/1034216497634131971\">her excitement was still not over yesterday</a> (which started <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cantabile/status/947622766857150467\">in December 2017</a>). I created the <strong>xaringan</strong> package in late 2016, but didn&rsquo;t mention the secret of <code>xaringan::inf_mr()</code> in public <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/why-xaringan-remark-js/\">until the August of 2017</a>. I knew it was a cool feature, and I use it all the time. I just want users to discover it slowly by themselves. I always feel highly motivated by the occasional ecstasy from individual users like Charles. This has been a sustainable source of power for me.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Yesterday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZKamvar/status/1034494397126197249\">Zhian N. Kamvar discovered</a> that the <strong>tinytex</strong> package can automatically install missing LaTeX packages when compiling LaTeX documents. Yeah, <a href=\"https://yihui.org/tinytex/pain/\">I feel all your pain with LaTeX</a>. Sometimes people are just comfortably numb with the pain (why do you have to waste time in installing LaTeX packages when this could largely be automated?). I love seeing the pain going away, little by little, and from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nj_tierney/status/941126710602301441\">one user</a> after <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/7\">another</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you can impact a few people deeply, they will just shout from the rooftops for you. The breadth of the impact will be a matter of time, i.e., it will come eventually. You won&rsquo;t need to invest your own precious time in marketing. &ldquo;No marketing&rdquo; has been my own marketing strategy for years (I mean I usually avoid active marketing by myself, and I thank those who have been shouting out for me). That was a deliberate choice of mine. I trust the organic growth of impact, although I know it is slow, and sometimes unbearably slow. The impact two years later is worth waiting for. Looking ahead, two years sounds long, but looking back, it is nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, impact should not be your goal. Impact itself is also a by-product. It should be based on usefulness or helpfulness, which in turn depends on the &ldquo;pain level&rdquo; of an existing problem. The more painful a problem is, the more useful the solution will be. Note that such problems are not necessarily difficult to solve. Some problems are not terribly painful on their own, but if you run into them every day, they become super annoying, and will be worth fixing. For early career researchers, problems that are not too technically challenging yet frequently and mildly annoying may be good starting points of your career. It will be even better if there is such a problem that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/1006363200277942275\">deeply annoys yourself</a>, because your product, provided that you can work it out, will deeply impact yourself (e.g., significantly improving your own efficiency).</p>\n\n<p>How many times have I mentioned that the <strong>knitr</strong> package was first created for myself to write my own homework at Iowa State more easily? And reproducible research&hellip; was not my goal back in 2011. To some extent, I was quite lucky.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t try to win the whole world in the beginning. Win one person (even yourself), and win him/her deeply. The world may follow later.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/influence-depth-or-breadth/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"15b732a4dbaecfd576a6423c97cfd694","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973446},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"One Little Thing: Touch a Source File in a blogdown Website","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/touch-file-blogdown/","description":"\n        <p>Motivated by <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/294\">a <strong>blogdown</strong> issue</a> raised by Liang Zhang, I added an RStudio addin named &ldquo;Touch File&rdquo; in <strong>blogdown</strong> last month to update the modification time of the current file in RStudio.</p>\n\n<p>Most <strong>blogdown</strong> users should already know <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/livereload.html\">the LiveReload feature</a>, which means if you edit a source file and save it, your website will be automatically rebuilt and refreshed in the RStudio viewer once you have used the &ldquo;Serve Site&rdquo; addin or the corresponding function <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This feature is great, but on some (relatively rare) occasions, you may want to force rebuilding an Rmd post. For example, when you read an external data file, and the data file has been updated, you want to rebuild the Rmd file even if you don&rsquo;t need to update the content of the Rmd file. In the past, I used to add a space in the Rmd file, delete it, and save the file, which would update the modification time of this file. This is a little awkward. Unix users know there is a <code>touch</code> command, which can update the modification time of a file. <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/commit/d1934655c\">I emulated it</a> in the RStudio addin &ldquo;Touch File&rdquo; in <strong>blogdown</strong>.

If not, do what I used to do: add a space, delete it, and save the file.</p>\n\n<p>Four keystrokes (<code>Space</code>, <code>Delete</code>, <code>Ctrl/Command + S</code>) were &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; to two mouse clicks (<code>Addins -&gt; Touch File</code>).

Last year, when I saw Steven Fazzio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/106\"><strong>blogdown</strong> feature request</a> on Github (to embed the Rmd source file in the HTML output so readers can download it), I had an idea how to implement it. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard.</p>\n\n<p>Actually two years ago, Noam Ross sent <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/pull/708\">a pull request</a> to the <strong>rmarkdown</strong> repo, which was related to Steven&rsquo;s request. I felt the implementation could be easier.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"xfun-embed-file\">xfun::embed_file()</h2>\n\n<p>While deciding the issues/features for <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/projects/1\">the next release</a> of <strong>rmarkdown</strong>, I revisited the <strong>rmarkdown</strong> PR and the <strong>blogdown</strong> issue. At one late night, I finally <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/xfun/commit/d8199f86dbf06\">typed out the two lines of code</a> to implement it in the <strong>xfun</strong> package, so now you can embed an arbitrary file, or multiple files, or a whole directory, in the HTML output of an R Markdown document. For now you need the development version of <strong>xfun</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">devtools::install_github('yihui/xfun')\n# embed_file() requires a few more packages\nxfun::pkg_load2(c('base64enc', 'htmltools', 'mime'))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, you can use one of the functions <code>xfun::embed_file()</code>, <code>xfun::embed_dir()</code>, or <code>xfun::embed_files()</code> in an R code chunk to embed one or multiple files or an entire directory in the HTML output, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r echo=FALSE}\n# a single file\nxfun::embed_file('source.Rmd')\n\n# multiple files\nxfun::embed_files(c('source.Rmd', 'data.csv'))\n\n# a directory\nxfun::embed_dir('data/', text = 'Download full data')\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also provide the list of files programmatically, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># embed all Rmd and csv files\nxfun::embed_files(list.files('.', '[.](Rmd|csv)$'))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For multiple files, they are first compressed to a zip file, and the zip file will be embedded. These functions return a link, which a reader can click on the HTML page to download the embedded file.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-trick-a-href-base64-data-download-filename\">The trick <code>&lt;a href=&quot;base64 data&quot; download=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;</code></h2>\n\n<p>Under the hood, <code>xfun::embed_file()</code> simply generates a link of the form <code>&lt;a href=&quot;base64 data&quot; download=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;</code>, where <code>&quot;base64 data&quot;</code> is the file encoded as a base64 string. If you are using a modern web browser (you are fine if it is not IE), it should be able to decode the base64 string into the file and download it when you click the link.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-these-functions\">When to use these functions?</h2>\n\n<p>If your project is public, for example, on Github, there is no need to embed files in the HTML output: just give other people the address of the repo. If you are using <strong>blogdown</strong>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/106\">it is also possible</a> to automatically generate a link on each page pointing to the corresponding source file on Github (e.g., on my website, you can click the link &ldquo;Edit this page&rdquo; to edit the source files of most pages).</p>\n\n<p>If you project is completely private, you may compress the whole directory as a zip file and send it via email. That is common and fine, but you may not want to manually compress the directory every time you update any files in it. These <code>embed_*()</code> functions can automatically read and embed files in your HTML output, so all you need to do is knit the Rmd source document again, and you will only need to email an HTML file.</p>\n\n<p>If the source project is private, but the output is expected to be public, that is when you may also consider embedding certain files on the output page, e.g., your Rmd source file, and/or data files. Readers who are interested in reproducing your results or analyzing the data differently can download the necessary files. This way, you only need to publish a single HTML file.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/embed-file/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b1c04c454d49b0bcc4000cf6a949cdcb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"One Little Thing: Quote a Poem with blogdown","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/quote-poem-blogdown/","description":"\n        <p>One of the most frequent topics on which I blog in recent years is Chinese literature (of course, only in my Chinese blog). In particular, I often quote poems in my posts. To quote a poem in Markdown, you have to add two trailing spaces after every line of the poem. Two trailing spaces means a hard line break in Markdown. A line break in the Markdown source does not mean a line break in the output (usually white spaces are not meaningful in Markdown).</p>\n\n<p>I have been tired of manually adding the trailing spaces (also <code>&gt;</code> to the beginning of every paragraph) . Finally <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/commit/ad8be3ffb5\">I wrote a tiny function <code>quote_poem()</code></a> in <strong>blogdown</strong> to do this. The function was not exported, but that should be fine, because I also provided a corresponding RStudio addin named &ldquo;Quote Poem&rdquo;. Currently this feature is only available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/\">development version of <strong>blogdown</strong></a>. The usage of the addin is simple: just select the poem in the RStudio source editor, and click the addin. For example, if you paste a poem in RStudio:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Like Barley Bending\n　by Sara Teasdale\n\nLike barley bending\n　In low fields by the sea,\nSinging in hard wind\n　Ceaselessly;\n\nLike barley bending\n　And rising again,\nSo would I, unbroken,\n　Rise from pain;\n\nSo would I softly,\n　Day long, night long,\nChange my sorrow\n　Into song.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can select it, and click the addin, which will generate the expected output below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like Barley Bending<br />\n　by Sara Teasdale</p>\n\n<p>Like barley bending<br />\n　In low fields by the sea,<br />\nSinging in hard wind<br />\n　Ceaselessly;</p>\n\n<p>Like barley bending<br />\n　And rising again,<br />\nSo would I, unbroken,<br />\n　Rise from pain;</p>\n\n<p>So would I softly,<br />\n　Day long, night long,<br />\nChange my sorrow<br />\n　Into song.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess <strong>blogdown</strong> users might be surprised by this function/addin the first time they see it.

The goal was to show that a relatively simple R Markdown document can generate a large variety of output document formats, some of which can look quite sophisticated.</p> \n<p>The idea for this talk originally came from my remote talk for the 2019 RaukR summer school in Sweden, in which I presented a series of R Markdown demos to show the versatility of R Markdown, but I used different R Markdown documents in that talk. BTW, I also met the organizers Marcin Kierczak and Sebastian Dilorenzo at rstudio::conf this time, and we “complained” together about how little kids made it so difficult for their parents to travel. They also brought a T-shirt of the summer school to me all the way from Sweden, to which I was very grateful.</p> \n<p>At JSM 2019, I gave another talk on the R Markdown ecosystem, and decided to use the same R Markdown document. I put all output formats in the YAML metadata, and clicked the <code>Knit</code> button 14 times during the talk, which was a little awkward, because I had to look closely at the output formats and think which one would be the next one to present. It was not easy to do this in front of the audience when the time for the talk is short (20 minutes).</p> \n<p>This time I decided to automate it as much as possible, so I wouldn’t have to spend time on thinking about which output format to present next. With <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/typing-fast/\">my experience at rstudio::conf(2018)</a>, I wrote an R script to automatically insert the <code>output</code> field into the R Markdown document in RStudio using <code>xfun::rstudio_type()</code>. With a <code>for</code>-loop iterating over all output formats, and a call to <code>readline()</code> at each step of the loop, I managed to present these output formats one by one. All I had to do was to keep pressing <code>Enter</code>, and the audience would see something like this being dynamically “typed” into my RStudio IDE:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/rstudio-conf-2020/#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">output:\n  html_document:\n    number_sections: true\n    theme: journal\n    toc: true\n</code></pre> \n<script> (function() { var el = document.querySelector('pre &gt; code'); el.style.height = el.offsetHeight + 'px'; var tx = el.innerText; setInterval(function() { var n = el.innerText.length; el.innerText = n &lt; tx.length ? tx.slice(0, n + 1) : ''; }, 50); })(); </script> \n<p>Again, you can find my R script at the beginning of this section. Keep in mind that it has to be executed in the RStudio IDE.</p> \n<p>In retrospect, my tone in the talk was perhaps too disparaging on LaTeX, Word, PowerPoint, and LaTeX beamer. Here I want to apologize to whomever felt hurt by my silly comments (sometimes I have no idea what I’m talking about on the podium). I always say I’m tired of beamer slides, but beamer is actually extremely powerful. The only issue is that too many people use more or less the same beamer theme. I’d be equally tired of <strong>xaringan</strong> slides if I see the same theme over and over again.</p> \n<h2 id=\"q-a-s-on-my-talk\">Q&amp;A’s on my talk</h2> \n<p>Due to the time limit, I wasn’t able to answer all questions on sli.do. Now I’ll answer them below, in case the askers are still interested.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Q: What’s the updog app?</strong></p> <p>A: I had no clue how this person noticed Updog, because I didn’t mention Updog in my talk at all. When I heard this question, I was totally confused. A whole week later, I suddenly realized that my demo files were in my Dropbox folder, and one folder name was “updog”! What sharp eyes! Later <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taraskaduk/status/1222974644833017856\">Taras Kaduk told me on Twitter</a> that I missed a great opportunity to honor the traditional “Nothing much, what’s up with you?” Anyway, <a href=\"https://updog.co\">Updog</a> used to be a great service to host static websites in Dropbox, but unfortunately it is down now (again, not my fault!).</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: How do you get the search box for a data frame in rmarkdown?</strong></p> <p>A: I used <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/DT\">the <strong>DT</strong> package</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: How did you get the pacman animation to work in PowerPoint?</strong></p> <p>A: The pacman was a GIF created <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/gifski-knitr/\">with <strong>gifski</strong></a>. GIFs work in the presentation mode of PowerPoint.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Did you lose a bet so you had to do your talk the same time as Hadley?</strong></p> <p>A: I didn’t realize that Hadley’s talk was at the same time as mine until about an hour before my talk. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharon000/status/1222983977541046273\">It was a bummer</a> to some people, but at least the two rooms <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jcheng/status/1223327608219131904\">wouldn’t be too crowded</a>. Well, I was especially grateful that my room was not empty after I knew Hadley was speaking in the next room.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Is there any way to add a footer in PowerPoint when knitting with R Markdown?</strong></p> <p>A: Not to my knowledge. I don’t use Office products myself, and whenever I get questions about Word/PowerPoint that I cannot answer, I’ll recommend looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/davidgohel/officer\"><strong>officer</strong></a>. David Gohel has far more expertise than I do.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: The direction of the pie chart changes depending on the output format?</strong></p> <p>A: Good eyes! The direction of pacman is actually random to each output format.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Do you know or are working in integrating audience interactions in xaringan?</strong> Something related to <a href=\"https://sli.do\">sli.do</a> / <a href=\"https://www.mentimeter.com\">mentimeter</a>.</p> <p>A: I have a few ideas, but I don’t know when I’ll be able to implement them. Before I do, the easiest way I could think of is to embed an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> of a web page on a slide, and all interactions occur on that web page.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: How much time do you find it takes getting the formatting to look good for HTML outputs?</strong> I find I can get the page looking OK but not great.</p> <p>A: A lot of time, if I really want the HTML pages to look good. However, I usually refrain from spending too much time on CSS. I’m a minimalist in both my daily life and my technical world. That said, I can only be a minimalist when I work for myself (e.g., design a theme for my own website). If I design products for others, I will certainly invest more time in the appearance.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: How do you integrate GIS visualization from ArcGis software into R Markdown document?</strong></p> <p>A: Sorry, but I know nothing about ArcGis. I used the <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet\"><strong>leaflet</strong></a> package in my demos to render the map.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: What is the difference between bookdown vs pagedown?</strong></p> <p>A: The goal of the <strong>pagedown</strong> package is to typeset HTML documents with CSS. HTML is its only output format. PDF is a by-product in this package (printed from HTML). The <strong>bookdown</strong> package supports a variety of output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Word, and EPUB, etc.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Have we solved the issue of overhanging code in code chunks when rendering to PDF?</strong></p> <p>A: I know verbatim content could be wrapped by the LaTeX package <strong>listings</strong>, and Pandoc supports <strong>listings</strong>, too. However, I have never tried by myself. If anyone has tried and succeeded, please let me know and I’ll be happy to share a link to your solution. Usually I just hard-wrap the lines by myself.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Have you considered calendar based release cycle?</strong></p> <p>A: I have an R Markdown document that runs every two weeks on RStudio Connect to remind me of the packages that I may need to update on CRAN. I may or may not actually update these packages after I see the reminder email. I don’t plan to switch to a strictly calendar-based release cycle. On the other hand, I think the base <strong>rmarkdown</strong> package and <strong>knitr</strong> are relatively mature now.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Is the markdown document available to download? Can we get your code for your 14 demos?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, please find the link to the R script in the beginning of the previous section in this blog post.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Is there such thing as a googleslide”down”?</strong></p> <p>A: Not to my knowledge, but I’m very interested. I know many people are interested in a product that connects R Markdown with Google Docs/Slides, or an online platform like Overleaf where multiple authors can collaborate. I cannot comment much on this at the moment, but personally I’m definitely highly interested in such products/platforms!</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"rob-s-talk-on-how-r-markdown-changed-his-life\">Rob’s talk on how R Markdown changed his life</h2> \n<p>When I first saw the title of Rob’s talk last year, I felt the pressure for my own talk. If someone highly praised R Markdown in a previous talk, what should I talk about so I wouldn’t let the audience down?</p> \n<p>I could also talk about how R Markdown changed my own life—it has made me incredibly busy day and night for years, and I could not eat or sleep. Just kidding. It did change my life. For example, it brought me a dream job at RStudio, and to some extent, its simplicity turned me to a minimalist.</p> \n<p>You can find materials of Rob’s talk at <a href=\"http://robjhyndman.com/rmd2020\">http://robjhyndman.com/rmd2020</a>. He reviewed the authoring tools that he had used since he was in kindergarten,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/rstudio-conf-2020/#fn:2\">2</a></sup> which was a lot of fun because we could hear more and more people in the audience started to recognize those tools as he moved forward in his life path. He told me the night before in the California Academy of Sciences that he was going to show an old Twitter conversation between him and me in his talk, but I had no idea which one it was. Had I not seen his slide the next day, I’d have totally forgotten <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robjhyndman/status/271112533929238529\">that tweet from 2012</a>!</p> \n<p>On his last slide, he showed a picture of me and thanked me. Of course, I felt touched. The funny fact is that the picture was from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/94181521\">my very first talk about R Markdown</a> in Seattle in 2014 (at Fred Hutch). If you search for my name with Google Images, this is the first image you get.</p> \n<p>Many thanks to Rob for this very inspiring talk! I’ll think about the “maildown” package.</p> \n<h2 id=\"book-signing\">Book signing</h2> \n<p>There was a book signing event at the reception on Tuesday evening. It was the first time I had attended such an event. There was also one at rstudio::conf(2019), but somehow I didn’t find the place (apologies to those who might have waited for me there).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxheld/status/1221985368657952769\">Max Held</a> took a picture of the event, which happened to have me on it:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPVdNgAUwAAwi17?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" alt=\"Signing books at rstudio::conf(2020)\" /></p> \n<p>Max said it was not a comic conference, yet there were so many people lined up for the books. I felt the same excitement. I really loved the conference, so much that I didn’t even care to go to see the Golden Gate Bridge during my stay in SF, although I had never really seen it.</p> \n<p>I was in a hurry to drink my beer (kidding), so I became the first one to finish signing the 100 copies of books. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_dubrow/status/1222235939537215489\">Greg Dubrow</a> was the 100th person coming to my table, and he got the last copy. Behind him was the poor <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/yue-jiang/\">Yue Jiang</a>.</p> \n<p>Sitting on my left hand side was JJ, the CEO and founder of RStudio. While I was signing the books, I overheard someone who apparently didn’t know him and asked him “Do you work for RStudio?”</p> \n<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/awesome-me.gif\" alt=\"The CEO of RStudio\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"some-people-i-met\">Some people I met</h2> \n<p>On my plane from Omaha to SFO, my neighbor glanced at my laptop screen and recognized the RStudio IDE. He told me he didn’t know much about R, but his wife was an R user. I didn’t tell him that I was going to rstudio::conf. However, two days later, my colleague said on Slack that someone asked him if there was an RStudio employee based in Omaha and met her husband on the plane. Huh! I didn’t know his wife was also attending this conference! In case any other R users in Omaha are reading this post, here is the link to <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Omaha-R-Users-Group/\">the Omaha R User Group</a>.</p> \n<p>At the entrance of the California Academy of Sciences, I ran into <a href=\"https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson\">Henrik Bengtsson</a>, whom I had never met before (hence I didn’t recognize his face). Henrik has made many valuable contributions to the R community, and is also the unsung hero behind <a href=\"https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/vignette/\">non-Sweave package vignettes</a> in my eyes. If it were not for him, there wouldn’t be thousands of package vignettes on CRAN.</p> \n<p>Inside the academy, I met many friends whom I hadn’t seen for a long while, such as Roger Peng, Hilary Parker, Jeff Leek, and Emily Robinson, etc. I didn’t know Jeff started to grow his beard! I forgot to take a picture, otherwise I’d consider adding it to the <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2019/03/yolo-karl/\"><code>yolo = TRUE</code></a> collection in <strong>xaringan</strong>. Emily was still such a kind, lovely, and <a href=\"http://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/03/conference-feelings-from-newbie-to-sponsor/\">inspiring</a> soul.</p> \n<p>When I returned to the hotel, I was caught by Theresa Henle in the lobby. She attended our R Markdown workshop, and is a very warm-hearted person. Soon we were joined by Carolina Johnson, Ellis Hughes, Jonathan Carroll, and Joshua Goldberg. Ellis was wearing his Halloween costume—a T-shirt with the default R Markdown example printed on it, which I had previously seen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes/status/1220006359292235781\">on Twitter</a>, but it was fantastic to see it for real. Jonathan just put together <a href=\"https://rweekly.org/2020-04.html\">the latest issue of R Weekly</a>, which was still open in my browser because I hadn’t had a chance to read it at that time. We chatted in the lobby for quite a while, and I started to debate to myself whether I should go back to my room to prepare my talk for the next morning, since it was fairly late in the night (past 11:30pm, meaning 1:30am central time for me). I had finished writing that R script, but I hadn’t thought about the most important part of the talk—the jokes. Finally I covered Josh’s mouth to stop him from talking further, and ran off. Sorry, Josh! BTW, last year Josh <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2019/01/rstudio-conf/#comment-4307358256\">encouraged me to write a non-technical book</a>, and I definitely still remember it. Still no promises, but I think I’ll get there someday since I’m truly interested in writing such a book.</p> \n<p>At the conference reception, I met three Japanese: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kazutan\">kazutan</a> (前田和寛), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/u_ribo\">Uryu Shinya</a>, and <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4967-3831\">Kenta Yoshida</a>. Kenta was in my R Markdown workshop. I think I have known kazutan for a number of years, but it was the first time I had met him in person. I feel Japanese are born comics. Even when they are in an English environment, they still demonstrate a sense of humor naturally through their face and gestures. I told them that sometimes I’d thumb through the slides of the Tokyo R User Group, and I felt the content was often deeply technical, which was surprising to me. For this conference, apparently they also had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kazutan/status/1222491746052915201\">problems with English</a>, just like Hiroaki Yutani did <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2019/01/rstudio-conf/\">last year</a>.</p> \n<p>Ian Lyttle told me at the reception that he discovered a bug in <strong>rmarkdown</strong> but decided not to bother me and figured it out by himself. In this case, I wouldn’t mind a quick message, since that bug was <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1756\">simple enough to fix</a>. Anyway, it was so very kind of him!</p> \n<p>I still had a few emails that I didn’t manage to reply. As a result, I greeted some people with “Hey I’m sorry I haven’t replied your email!” That was what I did to Malcolm Barrett when I met him for the first time in front of his poster. I owe the same email debt to Brooke Anderson, and our Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Alison Hill.</p> \n<p>I had struggled with <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1733\">an <strong>rmarkdown</strong> issue</a> related to LaTeX that I was unable to reproduce for a long time. Fortunately, in the week before the conference, Jared Lander reported that he had the same problem, and he would attend the conference, too. Finally I could see the problem on someone’s computer for real. <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1733#issuecomment-582165621\">It turned out</a> that we only had to update LaTeX packages in MiKTeX. Thanks, Jared, for letting me use your computer for three hours!!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:3\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/rstudio-conf-2020/#fn:3\">3</a></sup></p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, I met a couple of more conference attendees at the SFO airport on Friday morning. I could easily tell from their conference T-shirts. Actually one woman was right in front of me as we went through the security, and she recognized the “Markdown guy”. On my flight back to Omaha, I saw at least two other attendees on the same plane.</p> \n<h2 id=\"naras-and-literate-programming\">Naras and Literate Programming</h2> \n<p>I met <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~naras/\">Naras</a> on the last day of the conference. He told me R Markdown also changed his life, as well as several other interesting things. One particularly interesting thing was that he actually published <a href=\"https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v004i03\">a paper in JSS</a> in 1999(!) based on literate programming techniques. He deeply appreciated Knuth’s literate programming paradigm, and I absolutely agreed with him that (dynamically) composing a big chunk of code with smaller pieces of chunks was an undervalued idea. I also mentioned the advantages of literate programming in my article “<a href=\"https://yihui.org/rlp/\">Write An R Package Using Literate Programming Techniques</a>”. I’m sure there are other papers written with this technique, but Naras’s paper is the earliest one to my current knowledge. I haven’t met many true fans of Knuth’s literate programming. Naras and Terry (Therneau) are the only two that I know.</p> \n<h2 id=\"some-frequently-asked-questions-to-me\">Some frequently asked questions to me</h2> \n<p>In case anyone else is interested, I’m listing some FAQ’s below according to my experiences at the conference.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Where are you based?</strong></p> <p>A: I’m in Omaha. (People often continue to ask why since it seems to be unbelievable that anyone would like to live in Nebraska, and the reason is that my family is here.)</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: What’s the headquarter of RStudio?</strong></p> <p>A: I don’t think we have an official headquarter, but I’d say Boston anyway, since we have our biggest office there. Many of us work from home, like myself.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Can we invite you to give a talk in our department/company?</strong></p> <p>A: I’d love to, but it is not very practical for me to travel in recent years because my little ones are still too little. Some people have invited me multiple times, e.g., both Marcin (RaukR summer school) and Jared (New York R) told me I could go whenever I want, but I still haven’t visited them. That said, I’ll be happy to give a remote talk if that’s okay to you. This will save you the cost (no need to reimburse or pay me), and also save me the long trips. If your institution is within three hours of drive from Omaha, I can probably drive there to give the talk and return home afterwards.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Can I have you sign my books?</strong></p> <p>A: My pleasure! I can sign on anything you like (books, stickers, T-shirts, etc.), except a fake debit note that says I owe you a million dollars.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Can I take a picture with you?</strong></p> <p>A: Of course! I can also pretend to smile as hard as you want me to.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Can I sit at your table or by your side at the meal time?</strong></p> <p>A: Absolutely! Feel free to take any seat you like and chat. I may not chat too much, but I’d love to listen. Even if you see I have a friend with me, feel free to join us. Most of time I’m not having a formal meeting with someone, so please don’t worry. If I need to leave, I’ll keep looking at the watch on my wrist. BTW, I don’t have a watch on my wrist.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: Why did you stop blogging for the past half year?</strong></p> <p>A: One participant at the conference asked me what happened to my blog. I was very grateful to his attention. Yes, I was super busy last year. I planned to finish writing a book, but ended up being interrupted for a few times for software development work (e.g., when Pandoc 2.8 was released, and Bootstrap 3 was officially dead). With about two dozens of R packages on my shoulders, I have found it more and more difficult to focus on any new projects. In 2019, I released a single new package in total (<a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/rolldown\"><strong>rolldown</strong></a>). To be honest, I was not very satisfied with its quality, and I only spent less than a week’s time on developing this package. I often felt overwhelmed by the number of Github issues and Stack Overflow questions every day. Eventually I decided that I could not afford the whole R Markdown ecosystem and should hire someone to help me, although I had already got <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/help-answer-questions/\">several big faithful helpers</a>. Apologies in advance to those who are interested in this new position—it has been there for a month but I didn’t promote it because I have already had a few perfect candidates, and it is going to be really tough for me to make the decision.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Q: What’s your next project? In other words, what’s going to be “down” next?</strong></p> <p>A: I don’t have a plan yet. I need to finish writing the current book first. If you have any cool ideas, I’d always love to listen.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"final-words\">Final words</h2> \n<p>Emil Hvitfeldt has kindly put together <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/RStudioConf2020Slides\">a Github repo</a> to collect all materials related to this conference. RStudio also has an official repo to do this, but it seems we forgot to promote it: <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf\">https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf</a>.</p> \n<p>I’d like to thank the TAs of our <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rmarkdown-dashboard\">R Markdown workshop</a> for their help over the two days, including Hadrien (who also wrote <a href=\"https://medium.com/@HadrienD/f5adff36e2cc\">a useful post on customizing CSS</a> later), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-mayer-69554214a/\">Melanie</a>, <a href=\"https://adisarid.github.io\">Adi</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.jienamclellan.com\">Jiena</a>. I also want to thank my co-instructor Carl, who did most of the work at the workshop and made my (teaching) job much easier. Many thanks to my RStudio colleagues, who have made a lot of effort to make this conference a success. Every time I go to this conference, I feel very much inspired by the attendees. Thank you all for your encouragement and kind words! I’m especially glad to see that people like <a href=\"http://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/02/03/conference-feelings-from-newbie-to-sponsor/\">Leonardo Collado-Torres</a> started to follow Emily’s call to become sponsors. At the same time, I also feel proud that <a href=\"https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/01/29/rstudio-pbc/\">RStudio has become a Public Benefit Corporation</a>.</p> \n<p>Lastly, if anyone is going to the useR! conference this year, I’ll be happy to meet you in St. Louis in July!

Finally I have uploaded <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/rolldown\">the <strong>rolldown</strong> package</a> to CRAN, and can take a brief break now.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-birth-of-pagedown\">The birth of pagedown</h2>\n\n<p>Romain first came to my attention in September last year when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLesur/status/1037126641846312967\">he tweeted about Paged.js</a>. Now I don&rsquo;t remember how I noticed this tweet. Perhaps it was because Christophe Dervieux, Heather Turner, or Nicolas Roelandt liked it, and Twitter figured out I liked these people (I do), so Twitter recommended it to me. Perhaps it was because it contained the <code>#bookdown</code> hashtag by chance.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I happened to be thinking of something similar around that time, because I had always <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/\">believed in HTML and web technologies</a> in terms of typesetting. I saw <a href=\"https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed\">ReLaXed</a> earlier and was excited about it (especially the incredible examples made out of CSS and HTML). Everything looked perfect and beautiful, but there were two problems: 1) One couldn&rsquo;t write the full content in Markdown naturally (there was Markdown support, but the full document had to be HTML or Pug); 2) ReLaXed was a Node.js package. Of course, I was looking for something that could work best with R and R Markdown without an external system dependency. Then Romain&rsquo;s tweet opened a door for me just in time. Since Paged.js is a JavaScript library, we can easily integrate it into R through the HTML Widgets framework. Problems solved.</p>\n\n<p>One week later, I emailed Romain:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Thu, Sep 13, 2018 at 8:34 AM Yihui Xie &lt;???@gmail.com&gt; wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Romain,</p>\n\n<p>I have been looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/RLesur/weasydoc\">your <strong>weasydoc</strong> package</a> and thanks again for bringing Paged.js to my attention. I have been very excited, and am still learning more about it. I have to say you opened a new door through which I feel I&rsquo;ll be able to fulfill <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/\">one of my life dreams</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to devote some serious time in this, and I hope we can collaborate on it (unless you have finished all the work :).</p>\n\n<p>Regards,<br />\nYihui</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-made-romain-a-great-collaborator-of-mine\">What made Romain a great collaborator of mine</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/\">I have admitted that</a> I&rsquo;m a terrible person to collaborate with. Usually I tend to do most of the work on my own, and do not collaborate with other people substantially. I have reviewed and merged many pull requests on Github, but these projects typically have only one absolute owner (me). I think <strong>pagedown</strong> is the first project in which I have communicated with a co-author frequently and haven&rsquo;t made all the decisions only by myself. There are a few reasons why I regarded Romain as a great collaborator to me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>His skill set complements mine perfectly. I know R Markdown and HTML Widgets well, and he knows Paged.js and Pandoc Lua filters. Since he joined me in the work of <strong>pagedown</strong>, I lost the motivation to learn more about Paged.js and Pandoc filters. Besides, he read the Chrome Developer Protocol and <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/pull/30\">single-handedly wrote</a> the wonderful <code>pagedown::chrome_print()</code> function. I confess that this is still a mystery to me, and I&rsquo;m unable to reach the depth in these technologies as Romain did. He has submitted <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ARLesur\">many other pull requests</a> to <strong>pagedown</strong>, and I often merged them with awe (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/pull/16\">#16</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/pull/21\">#21</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/pull/43\">#43</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/pull/48\">#48</a>). In particular, my jaw dropped when I saw he reinvented the Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC book style and the Journal of Statistical Software style with CSS. Epic magic! That was perfect timing for <a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css\">my rstudio::conf(2019) talk</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>His debugging skills are amazing. Debugging requires extreme attention to details, which Romain has clearly manifested. I&rsquo;m often surprised by his simple and elegant fixes to bugs that looked complicated in my eyes.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>He is a very creative hacker and knows how to take advantage of existing tools to solve a hard problem in an novel way. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/50946083/559676\">This Stack Overflow question</a> asked by Colin Fay (also an excellent hacker) and answered by Romain is a great example to show what an expert of WebSockets Romain is. I, for one, also love hacking the RStudio Viewer. The fact that the RStudio IDE is essentially a web browser can bring forward many fun possibilities.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>He is exceptionally humble&mdash;so humble that I have to remind him a few times that his role is a co-author and I&rsquo;m not qualified to lead him as the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1110978126618771458\">leading author</a>&rdquo;. Anyway, in the first few months of <strong>pagedown</strong>, he had always submitted his work via pull requests instead of pushing to the master branch directly (although I had granted him write access), to make sure he wouldn&rsquo;t break anything and had respected my coding style. That was both careful and considerate.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Somehow he also established a personal connection with the Paged.js developers, which turned out to be very important for the <strong>pagedown</strong> package, because sometimes bugs came from the Paged.js library and we could talk to Paged.js developers to get them fixed quickly. Apparently, both the Paged.js developers and the Shuttleworth Foundation noticed his talent soon. Later he was awarded a grant from the foundation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"romain-s-other-contributions\">Romain&rsquo;s other contributions</h2>\n\n<p>Besides <strong>pagedown</strong>, I have seen Romain help me in several other Github repositories that I maintain, although I didn&rsquo;t ask him to. To be clear, I do need help, and always do. Below is an incomplete list of Github issues with which Romain has helped recently:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/733\">rstudio/bookdown#733</a> (Margin/div bug when rendering gitbook). Multiple users had confirmed the bug, but I was too busy and lazy to install both Pandoc 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 to test it by myself. Romain did the vast majority of the debugging work, identified the root cause, and made it trivially easy for me to fix the issue.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1577\">rstudio/rmarkdown#1577</a> (HTML tabsets don&rsquo;t work with shiny runtime). Similarly, this bug was confirmed by multiple users. I suspected it was a really bad bug, but I didn&rsquo;t have a clue off the top of my head. I didn&rsquo;t know how long it would take me to figure it out. Romain carefully examined the problem, identified the cause, and submitted a perfect pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/pull/1587\">rstudio/rmarkdown#1587</a>, in which he fixed not only the original issue but also two additional potential issues. His explanation and minimal examples were so clear.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/683\">rstudio/bookdown#683</a> (MathJax info shown in references). This was a really weird bug in my eyes. I said I was able to reproduce it but didn&rsquo;t have time to fix it. Romain saw my reply and took a stab at it. He made a minimal reproducible example <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1593\">rstudio/rmarkdown#1593</a>, and submitted a simple fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/pull/1594\">rstudio/rmarkdown#1594</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Romain&rsquo;s first pull request to packages that I maintain was <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/pull/1243\">rstudio/rmarkdown#1243</a>, created on Jan 14, 2018. I didn&rsquo;t know him back then, but the pull request showed his kindness to help and also his humbleness (&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m not a CSS expert!&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>To sum it up, Romain has exactly the skills that I don&rsquo;t have but definitely need, has a creative mind as a hacker, shares the same belief in the web, is able to sense my headache in Github issues, and often actively helps me in a way that really minimizes the work on my shoulders. I know he is <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues/120#issuecomment-511243498\">currently on vacation</a>, and probably won&rsquo;t see this post until three weeks later, but anyway, I want to thank him so much for being such a wonderful collaborator as well as all the help along the way!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/duiyou-4.gif\" alt=\"A wonderful collaborator\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2019/07/romain-lesur/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/duiyou-4.gif","linkMd5":"1e684ef14e33274c3f31ee10554b6d76","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-19-35-096_59e8f733c6826080.webp","destWidth":270,"destHeight":180,"sourceBytes":1305566,"destBytes":435734,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/duiyou-4.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-19-35-096_59e8f733c6826080.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973438},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Make the Right / Positive Things Easier to Do than Wrong / Negative Things","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/05/right-easier-than-wrong/","description":"\n        \n\n<p>Last week I saw a fantastic post written by Jay Hanlon from Stack Overflow titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/\">Stack Overflow Isn&rsquo;t Very Welcoming. It&rsquo;s Time for That to Change</a>&rdquo;. I wanted to stand up in front of my computer and applaud for five minutes after reading this post. It is great that Stack Overflow was admitting the problem publicly and showing the intention to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I should make it clear that I do love Stack Overflow, use it almost every day, and truly appreciate its value, despite of my previous rants. I ranted just because I care a lot about this site and I wish it continued success for a really long time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-two-sides\">The two sides</h2>\n\n<p>In this post, I want to share a single thought on how to make Stack Overflow more welcoming, which I feel is ignored in the current design / model of Stack Overflow. That is, so far it has been almost equally easy to make Stack Overflow welcoming and unwelcoming. I think this is problematic.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"upvoting-vs-downvoting-and-voting-to-close-questions\">Upvoting vs downvoting, and voting to close questions</h2>\n\n<p>Take voting for example. Upvoting and downvoting are equally easy, but the levels of love and hurt felt are definitely not the same. It hurts much more after your question/answer is downvoted than how much you feel encouraged after you get an upvote, probably because of the pain of losing something is more overwhelming than the joy of gaining something. A downvote on Stack Overflow is pretty much like someone gives you a thumbs-down in public. It could cause shame or anger. A downvote without an explanation is even worse. I&rsquo;d suggest that downvoting must be accompanied with explanations.</p>\n\n<p>Putting questions on hold has the same problem. It takes the equal number of people (five) to vote to close/hold and open a question. Requiring more people to vote to close a question than re-opening a question may be a better idea. If that does not sound fair, I think it definitely makes sense to at least require evidence of expertise before a user can vote to close a question. For example, if you have never answered a single question related to any of the tags of the current question, you should not be eligible to close a question. Currently anyone can vote to close any questions, which was the main reason of my previous rants (<a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/12/so-bounties/\">first one</a>, <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/closed-so-question/\">second one</a>). In these cases, I don&rsquo;t believe they really knew what they were doing when they voted to close a question (they might be really kind people trying to help Stack Overflow, but the outcome was really bad). I even believe some people just blindly follow other people to vote. To prevent this kind of blind voting, Stack Overflow should let users vote <em>independently</em>, i.e., do not show previous votes. I believe if five users independently voted to close a question, there is a much higher chance that it is a truly bad question or simply spam.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"feelings-matter\">Feelings matter</h2>\n\n<p>Building a welcoming online community without losing the quality is definitely not easy, especially for a community of the scale of Stack Overflow. I have been running a Q&amp;A web forum for more than ten years. I have seen many times how moderators unintentionally treat beginners poorly, although these moderators have contributed a lot in the past and are often helpful. Many people just forget what it feels like to be a beginner after they become experts. When they make you feel the hostility, they may not really mean it. However, as Jay wrote in his post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] Feelings have no &ldquo;technically correct.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re just what the feeler is telling you. When someone tells you how they feel,  you can pack up your magnifying glass and clue kit, cuz that&rsquo;s the answer. You&rsquo;re done. And a lot of devs feel like Stack Overflow is an intimidating, unwelcoming place. We know because they tell us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No matter what you really mean, if users have got the bad feelings, there is a problem. I don&rsquo;t think <a href=\"https://medium.com/dunder-data/10-000-stack-overflow-toxicity-challenge-75951a739993\">a $10,000 challenge to prove the Stack Overflow toxicity</a> makes much sense (but this is really another topic).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"easy-but-wrong-vs-harder-but-correct\">Easy but wrong, vs harder but correct</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to finish this post with a recent example to illustrate the point of &ldquo;people tend to avoid doing the right things if they are harder, and will do wrong things if they are easier.&rdquo; Five users have voted to close the recent post &ldquo;<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/50084663/559676\">Graphs don&rsquo;t show when Rmarkdown posted to blogdown on shiny server</a>&rdquo;. Let me show you what it looks like when it was first posted:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-no-edit.png#border\" alt=\"No one bothers to edit the post\" /></p>\n\n<p>The OP, Rain Wei, was apparently a completely beginner on Stack Overflow. His (apologies if I guessed the gender wrong) reputation point was one. What happened to this post in two hours?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Someone (not the one who first commented) downvoted it, without an explanation.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Five people voted to close it, and they succeeded. I encourage you to look at the profile pages of these five people, and will let you judge whether they are experts of Shiny Server or <strong>blogdown</strong>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Actually these are not the main problem I want to mention. The main problem is, one person downvoted the question, five people voted to close the question, but&hellip; but none of them bothered to edit the post to show the images! Why is that? My guess is <em>voting is much easier than editing a post</em>. However, the question would be much clearer, had anyone with the editing privilege edited it, because these screenshots were actually very informative!</p>\n\n<p>For those who are not familiar with Stack Overflow, users with only one reputation point cannot post images. That is why the OP could not show the images. The post had been viewed more than 20 times before I saw it, yet no one wanted to help. I edited the post (twice, because the OP, as a beginner, overrode my first revision) to show the images. How much effort it really is? Adding four exclamation marks (turn <code>[]()</code> to <code>![]()</code>).</p>\n\n<p>I think it is a valid question after the screenshots are displayed (so I upvoted it), but it will require substantial expertise about Shiny Server to answer the question. I doubt it will ever be answered, but I don&rsquo;t think it should be closed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"an-old-but-relevant-thought-about-reproducible-research\">An old but relevant thought about reproducible research</h2>\n\n<p>Well, an old thought just came to my mind, so I decided to add another section. I think everyone will agree that reproducible research is a great idea and the right thing to do, even twenty years ago. Knuth invented literate programming in 1984, which happened to be a really nice foundation for reproducible research (probably not what he expected). However, I have always believed it is not wise to tie the implementation to TeX/LaTeX when it comes to writing reproducible reports (especially for data analysis). Reproducible research is the correct thing to do, but LaTeX is relatively hard. To make reproducible research easier and more popular, we have to choose a popular authoring format, which should not be LaTeX. I&rsquo;m not saying LaTeX is bad. It can be a great tool for experts. I just don&rsquo;t think it is worth the time when your goal is sharing knowledge instead of typesetting. Obviously you all know I&rsquo;m implying Markdown is a better choice for average users. Markdown is a weak language, but it makes the right thing, reproducible research, easier (and sometimes even enjoyable) to do than the wrong thing (point-and-click and/or cut-and-paste data analysis). That&rsquo;s it.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/05/right-easier-than-wrong/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-no-edit.png#border","linkMd5":"7272b43714257310f4a1c92594de25c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-19-36-489_8e1365f7bd5c6a39.webp","destWidth":750,"destHeight":738,"sourceBytes":102783,"destBytes":79336,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://db.yihui.org/images/so-no-edit.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-19-36-489_8e1365f7bd5c6a39.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973462},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Once in a Blue Moon, I Reached \"Issue Zero\" in a Github Repo","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/issue-zero/","description":"\n        \n\n<p>&ldquo;Inbox Zero&rdquo; (no emails in the inbox) may never be possible to me again, but today I reached a goal of &ldquo;Issue Zero&rdquo; for the Github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles\">rstudio/rticles</a>. I have to say this is so rare. In fact, it is the very first time I have been able to close <em>all</em> issues in a Github repo.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/42387508-1158fcbc-8108-11e8-8e09-7fe979ac1a13.png#border\" alt=\"no more rticles issues\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"answer-all-questions-and-kill-all-bugs\">Answer all questions and kill all bugs</h2>\n\n<p>Last week <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/178\">we were reminded</a> of the fact that the <strong>rticles</strong> package had not been updated on CRAN for more than a year. Its original maintainer (JJ) asked me for help, so I spent the last week and this week on the new CRAN release. Initially I only planned to take a look at existing pull requests, which contained new article formats contributed from other users. After reviewing all pull requests, I also looked at the issues. I knew there was an annoying long-standing bug (you could not use <code>$</code> in JSS or R Journal articles), which I really hoped to fix, because it has affected multiple users (<a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/6\">#6</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/10\">#10</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/49\">#49</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/70\">#70</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/132\">#132</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/149\">#149</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/398\">rstudio/rmarkdown#398</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Once I started working on Github issues, I thought it might be good to take advantage of the inertia, which is often hard to obtain. Finally I answered all questions and fixed all bugs reported in these issues. During this process, I realized that <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/71\">we didn&rsquo;t even support bibliography</a> for The R Journal articles. That was such a shame. How could we have provided such a half-baked product? It revealed the fact that <strong>rticles</strong> maintainers at RStudio didn&rsquo;t really write journal articles with the <strong>rticles</strong> package (i.e., we don&rsquo;t eat our own <strong>rticles</strong> dog food), which means we are probably not the most appropriate people to work on these article formats. We absolutely need more contribution from real authors and LaTeX experts. On the other hand, this also means <strong>rticles</strong> users may have better luck when asking questions in other public forums such as Stack Overflow or RStudio Community instead of Github issues, because we maintainers are not experts of these article formats, and I don&rsquo;t want you to wait for four years for me to answer your question.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"no-more-looking-for-missing-latex-packages\">No more looking for missing LaTeX packages</h2>\n\n<p>The best thing I did for this release was <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/pull/130\">enabling Travis CI</a> for this repo (thanks to Zhian N. Kamvar). Yes, it was so late, and such a big shame. We should have enabled Travis CI years ago. Previously JJ was just trying to manually test everything locally on his computer when new pull requests came in.</p>\n\n<p>One nice thing about the Travis setup is that it uses (and caches) <a href=\"https://yihui.org/tinytex/\">TinyTeX</a>, so that any missing standard LaTeX packages required by the article formats can be automatically installed on Travis (and cached). No <code>sudo</code> is required.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">cache:\n  packages: true\n  directories:\n    - $HOME/.TinyTeX\nlatex: false\n\nenv:\n  global:\n    - PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nbefore_install:\n  - wget -qO- https://yihui.org/gh/tinytex/tools/download-travis-linux.sh | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this moment, the setup for R on Travis adds symlinks of TeX Live executables to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, which prevents us from installing other executables (such as <code>epstopdf</code>). That is why I disabled the default LaTeX installation <code>latex: false</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hi-journal-of-statistical-software\">Hi, Journal of Statistical Software</h2>\n\n<p>Early last year, the editor of JSS said the JSS article format in <strong>rticles</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/102\">was &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;</a>. I was sad to hear that. I&rsquo;m <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/12/formatting-papers/\">always sad to hear</a> formatting issues could be real and critical issues. Anyway, after some communication with the editor, we happily and <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/commit/65a66b51\">easily</a> resolved the main issue (bibliography should have been generated via <strong>natbib</strong>). So it was actually not too bad. After fixing the dollar sign issue mentioned before, and the issue of authors on multiple lines (<a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/100\">#100</a>), personally I feel the JSS article format in <strong>rticles</strong> is pretty good now. The new version of <strong>rticles</strong> (v0.5) has been released on CRAN. Let&rsquo;s see if we can survive the journal of the highest LaTeX standard in the world this time.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/awesome-me.gif\" alt=\"Am I awesome enough now?\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/issue-zero/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/42387508-1158fcbc-8108-11e8-8e09-7fe979ac1a13.png#border","linkMd5":"2ded77b3707c9531e07d41e3ede2cb91","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-34-846_24e4d29f009e863f.webp","destWidth":1236,"destHeight":550,"sourceBytes":67185,"destBytes":21832,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/42387508-1158fcbc-8108-11e8-8e09-7fe979ac1a13.png#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-34-846_24e4d29f009e863f.webp","https://slides.yihui.org/gif/awesome-me.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn48@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-20-01-938_197f30067dc51edf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973460},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Netlify is Hiring Its First Data Scientist","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/netlify-data-scientist/","description":"<p>Netlify was a company that I started to appreciate very much from 2017.

I have never published any posts for a commercial company before in my blog (not even for my own employer), but I don’t really care if it is commercial or not.

Now I&rsquo;m writing down some quick notes and random thoughts. The list of talks below has no particular order.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rstudio-open-source-software-for-data-science-j-j-allaire\"><strong>Open Source Software for Data Science - J.J. Allaire</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>This talk triggered some of my thoughts. I have always been pround of RStudio for its deep commitment to open source. I feel one obvious thing that people often ignore is that open source developers need to eat and live&mdash;they are also humans. Open source is free as in both speech and beer. &ldquo;Free as in beer&rdquo; can be a substantial challenge to open source developers to make a living, which is perhaps why we often see open source projects are side jobs of developers in their spare time. In 2014 (when I was still very cynical), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/449309622025740289\">I wrote on Twitter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;THOU SHALL NOT BECOME RICH&rdquo;, as if GPL had said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember whose or which tweet motivated me to say that. I guess it was a certain tweet of John Myles White (he also retweeted mine later). I said that because I felt some people were so unreasonable that they thought open source developers had to live a poor life, and were not allowed to earn money out of their work. That was unfair.</p>\n\n<p>I have been a long-time admirer of JJ. It is rare to see someone who is both a visionary entrepreneur and an excellent open source software developer. I&rsquo;m very grateful that I have been given the chance to live a decent life while doing 100% open source. I&rsquo;m excited that RStudio <a href=\"https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/01/29/rstudio-pbc/\">has become a PBC</a>, which is a much stronger guarantee for our commitment to open source in the future.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/styling-shiny-apps-with-sass-and-bootstrap-4-joe-cheng\"><strong>Styling Shiny apps with Sass and Bootstrap 4 - Joe Cheng</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>I watched this talk mainly because Joshua Goldberg said to me later that &ldquo;Some people can try to be funny, while some people are inherently funny, and Joe is inherently funny.&rdquo; Then he repeated one funny conversation in the talk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Audience: &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Joe: Oh, increase the font size?</p>\n\n<p>Audience: Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Joe: I didn&rsquo;t know if that voice was coming from inside my head. So thanks.</p>\n\n<p>[Laughter]</p>\n\n<p>Joe: Yes, mother?</p>\n\n<p>[Laughter]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Joe is very capable of making instant fun during a talk. I&rsquo;m not very good at this. I need to prepare the fun. I can often think of a much better and funnier answer after the talk, and regret not having given the better version. For example, next time if someone asks me &ldquo;What&rsquo;s UpDog?&rdquo; again after <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/rstudio-conf-2020/\">my talk</a>, I&rsquo;d answer &ldquo;Not much, what&rsquo;s up with you? And by the way, I&rsquo;m not a dog.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, transitioning from Bootstrap 3 to 4 will be the next big thing in R Markdown, too. Joe and Carson have done a huge amount of work behind it. I really appreciate it.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rebecca-barter\"><strong>Becoming an R blogger - Rebecca Barter</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>I always strongly encourage people to build their personal websites (and write blog posts if possible), and I&rsquo;d also recommend that you watch this lightning talk. I don&rsquo;t think I knew Rebecca before, but after I watched it, it suddenly occurred to me that Bin (Yu) once mentioned her to me. I dug out the email and it was her indeed.</p>\n\n<p>In her blog post &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-02-03_blogger/\">Becoming an R blogger</a>&rdquo;, she listed 4 reasons to start a blog, and a bonus reason&mdash;somone might send you a nice email. So I sent her a nice email after I read her post. Of course, she was absolutely correct.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/lightning-talk-dr-amelia-mcnamara\"><strong>Making a tidy dress - Amelia McNamara</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>This lightning talk is an unusual one but also very interesting and inspiring. I wrote the <strong>knitr</strong> package, but I have no real knitting skills. It was refreshing to see how a dress was made. The hex logos is only one obvious highlight of the dress. The other highlight is that the dress has pockets!!</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I learned the correct pronunciation of &ldquo;sew&rdquo; for the first time. It had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ma_salmon/status/1229821025342324737\">surprised Maëlle Salmon, too</a>. Then a few other people became interested in watching the talk just because they started to doubt if they knew how to pronounce &ldquo;sew&rdquo;.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/r-for-graphical-clinical-trial-reporting-frank-harrell\"><strong>R for Graphical Clinical Trial Reporting - Frank Harrell</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>I wish I&rsquo;d be as good at embracing new technologies as <a href=\"https://www.fharrell.com\">Frank</a> when I&rsquo;m his age. I know he has been almost a lifetime LaTeX user, but he also quickly adopted HTML output formats from R Markdown. I find it amazing that as the founding Chair of the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt, he still often asks technical questions on Stack Overflow (just a few days ago I saw him ask a <strong>blogdown</strong> question here). I thought people in such high positions would no longer be interested in software problems.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/we-re-hitting-r-a-million-times-a-day-so-we-made-a-talk-about-it-heather-nolis-dr-jacqueline-nolis\"><strong>We&rsquo;re hitting R a million times a day so we made a talk about it - Heather Nolis &amp; Jacqueline Nolis</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>The next time when someone says R can&rsquo;t be used in production again, I&rsquo;ll send them this video.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/flipbooks-evangeline-reynolds\"><strong>Flipbooks - Evangeline Reynolds</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Simple yet creative idea. Great implementation. The <strong>flipbookr</strong> package inspired me of another idea, and I&rsquo;ll spend more time on thinking about it. It might become another exciting and useful R package.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/using-r-to-create-reproducible-engineering-test-reports-braulio-cuandon-ana-alyeska-santos\"><strong>Using R to Create Reproducible Engineering Test Reports - Braulio Cuandon &amp; Ana Alyeska Santos</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>I watched this talk both in awe and with sympathy&mdash;in awe because they did such an incredible job to make the Word output from R Markdown compliant to their company and FDA regulatory standards (by post-processing Word as XML documents), and with sympathy because the standards sounded incredibly strict. If I heard them correctly, some &ldquo;standards&rdquo; seemed to be purely cosmetic, which reminded me of the paper by LeBlanc et. al: <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223116\">Scientific sinkhole: The pernicious price of formatting</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader-dr-tyler-morgan-wall\"><strong>3D ggplots with rayshader - Tyler Morgan-Wall</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>To me, this is the most visually appealing talk of the conference. Tyler also did <a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/3d-mapping-plotting-and-printing-with-rayshader\">an awesome job</a> at the last year&rsquo;s rstudio::conf.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/lightning-talk-colin-rundel\"><strong><code>livecode</code>: broadcast your live coding sessions from and to RStudio - Colin Rundel</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>From the technical perspective, this was the talk that I loved the best. As I mentioned <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/back-to-dt/\">in a post in 2018</a>, I think <strong>httpuv</strong> is one of the most undervalued R packages. It was created mainly because of <strong>shiny</strong>, but its possible applications can be far beyond <strong>shiny</strong>. I was only aware of two substantial applications: <strong>plumber</strong> and <strong>fiery</strong>. Colin&rsquo;s <strong>livecode</strong> package was the fourth most interesting application of <strong>httpuv</strong> that came to my attention. I believe it will be extremely useful in teaching. As I mentioned to Colin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1230161301420347394\">on Twitter</a>, I felt some <a href=\"https://github.com/rundel/livecode/blob/master/DESCRIPTION\">hard dependencies</a> could be moved to &ldquo;Suggests&rdquo; to make this package more lightweight. For example, I don&rsquo;t quite believe <strong>crayon</strong> has to be a hard dependency, and am <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/\">still not convinced</a> that <strong>glue</strong> is superior than <code>paste()</code> or <code>sprintf()</code>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan\"><strong>Object of type &lsquo;closure&rsquo; is not subsettable - Jenny Bryan</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>A clever title, apparently. This talk resonated very well with me, and I encourage all R users to watch it. It will be tremendously helpful if you learn some basic debugging skills, and more importantly, learn how to report bugs appropriately. I think it resonated well with me because I&rsquo;m a developer, and have gone through the pain of having too little information to answer a user&rsquo;s question or bug report for numerous times.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/lightning-talk-amanda-gadrow\"><strong>Lessons about R I learned from my cat - Amanda Gadrow</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Adorable, amusing, and useful. Let&rsquo;s thank Amanda&rsquo;s cat.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/cat-hands.gif\" alt=\"Thank you, kitten!\" /></p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/how-to-win-an-ai-hackathon-without-using-ai-colin-gillespie\"><strong>How to win an AI Hackathon, without using AI - Colin Gillespie</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Before you build the models and jump on AI, ask yourself again if you are solving the right problem. Do you want to predict a future leakage, or reduce the cost of repairing the leakage? They are different problems, and the latter probably doesn&rsquo;t really require AI.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/of-teacups-giraffes-and-r-markdown-desiree-de-leon\"><strong>Of Teacups, Giraffes, &amp; R Markdown - Desiree De Leon</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Sophisticated yet cute. I watched this talk together with my two-year old. He was not even able to count to 20, not to mention standard deviations or histograms, but he cheered at every giraffe in the talk.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rmarkdown-driven-development-emily-riederer\"><strong>RMarkdown Driven Development - Emily Riederer</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>If you ever work on projects of moderate sizes that involve R Markdown, I highly recommend this talk. It teaches you a range of skills to manage projects of different sizes by incorporating software development best practices.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/the-glamour-of-graphics-william-chase\"><strong>The Glamour of Graphics - William Chase</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>This title is perhaps even cleverer than Jenny&rsquo;s. It is a play on &ldquo;The Grammar of Graphics.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t have much experience in (graphics) design like me, you will learn some simple and effective principles from Will. BTW, Will also has an amazing elegantly designed <a href=\"https://www.williamrchase.com\">personal website</a> that I recommend you to check out.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are interested in other talks from this conference, you may find all of them at <a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020\">https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020</a>.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2020/02/rstudio-conf-videos/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/cat-hands.gif","linkMd5":"4b8789181ba49c2e1109d191641cae0c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-35-309_958a8b65b31bc921.webp","destWidth":360,"destHeight":203,"sourceBytes":1866004,"destBytes":323024,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/cat-hands.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-35-309_958a8b65b31bc921.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973436},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Isn't Medium an Obviously Terrible Platform for Blogging?","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/terrible-medium/","description":"<p>Last week I read an article on Medium.com <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nikitonsky/medium-is-a-poor-choice-for-blogging-bb0048d19133\">criticizing Medium.com</a> (the fact that it was published on Medium sounded quite amusing to me). I have never truly understood the huge success of Medium. When it was born, it seemed to be “yet another WordPress.com or Blogger.com or MSN Space” in my eyes, with two major differences. One is its fresh-looking style. The other is the tools for user/reader engagement.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-three-css-attributes\">The three CSS attributes</h2> \n<p>I guess the following three CSS attributes can explain half of Medium’s success:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">p {\n  font-family: medium-content-serif-font,Georgia,Cambria,\"Times New Roman\",Times,serif;\n  font-size: 21px;\n  line-height: 1.58;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>That is, Medium uses a custom typeface <code>medium-content-serif-font</code> (and will fall back to Georgia and other serif fonts), a large font size that is not too commonly seen on the web (21px), and a large line height.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>As I have said a few times in my <strong>blogdown</strong> talks, the best font is always the font you have never used or seen. Our eyes have already been deeply bored by Georgia, Cambria, Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, and all classical fonts. I’m pretty sure that in a year or two, everyone will be bored by this new <code>medium-content-serif-font</code>, too, no matter how fresh it looks right now.</p></li> \n <li><p>The font size of 21px is 30% larger than Chrome’s default (16px). A larger font size can make readers feel comfortable and easier to focus. A side-effect (not sure if it is good or bad) is that an article will look longer. In my eyes, most modern web pages are too crowded with dense information or distracting elements, and it is becoming harder to read the actual body of a page. Is a larger font size an effective antidote? I don’t know. I just feel it is kind of ironic, as if there were a silent yet furious war among different elements on web pages to get our attention.</p></li> \n <li><p>The large line height has the same effect as the large font size. I also use a larger line height myself, to make it easier for my eyes to find the next line after finishing reading the previous line. A smaller body width can also help in this regard (which is why I actually like LaTeX’s default narrow page width).</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"claps\">Claps</h2> \n<p>Claps may explain the other half of Medium’s success. Traditional social media platforms invented the thumb-ups and like buttons. Medium invented claps. I’m waiting for the next platform to invent hat-off claps, bows, hugs, or maybe even blow kisses.</p> \n<p>Think about it. Thumb-ups, likes, favorites, red hearts (Twitter, you won, at least before Medium came), claps. It seems we are making a certain kind of progress to show stronger and stronger emotions. The only problem is, they are all virtual, and require little physical effort—any fingers, fat or not, can do it.</p> \n<p>I’m not saying these reactions are useless, or authors should absolutely get rid of their vanity (I haven’t). What I want to express from my observations are:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>We might be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhenniao\">drinking poison to quench our thirst</a>. Social media has made it much easier for people to connect with each other, which is great. At the same time, it has also created the irresistible thirst for attention. Initially, the thirst was easy to quench. For example, you might feel excited when three friends liked your post, because you don’t often hear three friends literally say in real life that they like what you did. Then the bar kept raising, and ten likes might feel like nothing. Then there came the bots, and you have no idea <em>who really</em> liked you. Then there came the claps, and you have no idea <em>how much</em> they liked you—the platform has tried to give you an illusion that your audience is expressing stronger emotions, but who knows? You just sit there, and keep clearing up the blue or red dot that indicates new reactions received on the app or page. Note that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/revodavid/status/1070118237478772737\">their system might cheat</a> for the sole purpose of getting your attention by constantly sending you notifications.</p></li> \n <li><p>There is an obvious way to provide solid feedback: <em>typing</em>, instead of <em>tapping</em>. I’m not sure if it is a real trend or not, but over these years, I have seen fewer and fewer readers write comments on blogs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:The-only-excepti\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/terrible-medium/#fn:The-only-excepti\">1</a></sup> Maybe it is because social media has trained us well enough to find the like button to hit and then run off. Maybe it is because there is just too much to read and digest on the web, and we don’t have time to write comments when there are dozens of other articles waiting for us ahead.</p> <p>Coincidentally, Disqus recently launched a “Reactions”module in the comment area, which seems to encourage you to tap (the like buttons) instead of typing:</p> <p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/49538527-46687f80-f891-11e8-9733-4fe4dfb1d5a2.png#border\" alt=\"Disqus's new Reactions\" /></p> <p>Personally I don’t like Disqus, but I haven’t found good alternatives yet. This “reactions” module makes me feel even more uncomfortable. Thankfully, it can be turned off, so I immediately turned it off when I saw it on my sites.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>I don’t mean you should stop liking my posts or things I did. I do appreciate the likes, if only they were not addictive. I don’t mean you must write down comments, either, but I do appreciate those who have done so, because those comments constantly give me different perspectives and inspiration, as I mentioned <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/personal-experience.html\">in the <strong>blogdown</strong> book</a>.</p> \n<p>The general problem with the web today is that there are too many candies to engage both authors and readers, and too few carrots to protect our teeth and maintain a balance in our nutrition.</p> \n<h2 id=\"where-to-blog-then\">Where to blog, then?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@nikitonsky/medium-is-a-poor-choice-for-blogging-bb0048d19133\">The Medium post</a> didn’t give recommendations on the alternative platforms for blogging. I don’t intend to recommend <strong>blogdown</strong> here because it is not the key. The only key is that you should have enough control over your platform. For example, you should be able to decide whether to put ads or banners on your blog, which theme you want to use (if not totally satisfied, you should be able to modify its CSS freely), and how to distribute your content (RSS? Mailing list? Twitter?).</p> \n<p>Basically, I recommend hosting a website by yourself, and I believe static sites are far easier now (at least they are becoming easier). When you use a third-party service, even if it is free, there is a potential problem: they might be selling you and your content indirectly.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://db.yihui.org/images/facebook.jpg\" alt=\"You are not the customer of Facebook. You are their product being sold.\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"p-s-the-consequence-of-the-death-of-google-reader\">P.S. The Consequence of the Death of Google Reader</h2> \n<p>I cannot help missing Google Reader whenever thinking about this world of social media, in which industry leaders have always been trying to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/meet-the-tech-company-that-wants-to-make-you-even-more-addicted-to-your-phone/\">manipulate us with means</a> that human beings can never counterattack and even cannot notice. The reason I miss Google Reader is that it was a service with which we could actively choose the content we want to read. After Google Reader died, RSS almost died (I switched to Feedly). The infinite scrolling replaced RSS.</p> \n<p>Infinite, scrolling.</p> \n<p>It is bottomless. You no longer have control over what you want to read. The app or the website will keep pushing new content to you. If you don’t like the content, they are able to make you like it soon (partly because you have submitted your data of personal preferences to them <em>for free</em> by hitting the like buttons). Even when you don’t like a presidential candidate, they may be able to change your mind because they control what you see on the web.</p> \n<p>I guess Google shut down Google Reader not because “the product had a declining following”, but because it gave users full control of what they wanted to read, which means there was no way to push irrelevant content to users. Then Google went to the social media battlefield and bet on Google+. Thank goodness that Google+ eventually died. No one seemed to miss Google+ at all, whereas <a href=\"https://gcemetery.co\">tons of people still miss Google Reader</a> like me.</p> \n<p>By shutting down Google Reader, the “Don’t Be Evil” Google essentially destroyed our good online reading habit. Since then, we have been trained to embrace noise and distractions. Reading is no longer a private process primarily driven by oneself. Someone else decides what you should read, and motivates you to motivate the content generators (whom we used to call “authors”).</p> \n<p>Medium’s RSS is a mess, as indicated by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nikitonsky/medium-is-a-poor-choice-for-blogging-bb0048d19133\">the aforementioned post</a>. I guess that is because Medium just doesn’t want you to read an article quietly by yourself in your RSS reader: you ought to go to the bazaar, see what other people highlight or quote or tweet, hear what other people say, be engaged in the interactions, and clap your paws.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:The-only-excepti\">The only exception that I know is Andrew Gelman’s blog.

I, for one, don’t like this index, but not because R’s ranking dropped this month. Even if it ranks R as the most “popular” programming language, I’d still be skeptical (well, I guess everyone would).</p> \n<p>The main reason I don’t like this index is that the effort behind the index seems to be fairly cheap, because it is based on a few automated queries to search engines and the formula (with somewhat arbitrary weights) to calculate the index is very questionable when you consider what it actually indicates v.s. what this index claims to be (from their web page):</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.</p> \n <p>The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Basically it says that you should follow whatever programming languages that most other people have searched for in search engines. No wonder the current US president was elected. Speaking of media and search engine coverage, he was definitely the winner.</p> \n<p>It is not that I dislike the TIOBE Index. It is that I hate all sorts of rankings in general. Rankings are too abstract and vague. They are often relatively easy to calculate and easy to become headlines in the news. The worst of all is, people who calculated these rankings will be the ultimate winners, no matter if the specific objects being ranked become “winners” or “losers” in their definition for the ranking. For example, regardless of Python entering TIOBE’s “Hall of Fame” or R dropping out the “Top 20” or even dying, TIOBE is always the winner in terms of the attention they have gotten. This reminds me of a Chinese idiom: Behind a general’s reputation, the bones of ten thousand corpses of his soldiers have dried (一将功成万骨枯).</p> \n<p>However, my point is not about blaming TIOBE or any ranking systems. If I’m blaming anyone at all, I’m blaming ourselves for our laziness. We are too lazy to evaluate one thing carefully by ourselves, which gives a great chance to ranking systems: Forget about it, and let me just tell you that X is better than Y (be it a programming language, a university, or a restaurant, etc.). “Better” in what sense? That is the hard question, and we tend to avoid answering it.</p> \n<p>Actually I’m not sure if we should blame ourselves for our laziness or just blame this era of decision fatigue. We simply have too many, trivial or not, decisions to make every day. Practically, we don’t have the time to do the research by ourselves, so we have to blindly trust the rankings. This feels like a tragedy or curse of our times. In Daniil Granin’s book “<a href=\"https://www.litmir.me/br/?b=226757&amp;p=1\">This Strange Life</a>” (which depicted the life of Lyubishchev), he mentioned a biologist who researched worms for his whole life and said something like this:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Oddly-enough-it\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2019/06/tiobe-index/#fn:Oddly-enough-it\">1</a></sup></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Worms are so long, yet my life is so short!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I doubt if anyone is still able to focus on one thing like a worm for a whole life today. One day I mentioned on Twitter that I only read Twitter on every Wednesday afternoon, and someone joked that he only read Twitter in the first half of every minute.</p> \n<p>Programming languages are so complicated, yet the index is so simple.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/have-permit.gif\" alt=\"I can do any rankings I want.\" /></p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Oddly-enough-it\">Oddly enough, it is hard to find this book in the English world, so I don’t know the original words.

Since he said he was not sure what cache invalidation meant, and I have a tiny bit experience here, I want to write this short post to explain why cache invalidation is hard from my experience.</p> \n<h2 id=\"why-caching\">Why caching?</h2> \n<p>First of all, the main purpose of caching is speed. The basic idea is simple: if you know you are going to compute the same thing, you may just load the result saved from the previous run, and skip the computing this time. There are two keywords here: “the same thing”, and “the saved result”. The latter means you are essentially trading (more) storage space for (less) time. That is the price to pay for caching, and also an important fact to be aware of when you use caching (i.e., caching is definitely not free, and sometimes the price can be fairly high).</p> \n<p>The tricky thing is “the same thing”. How do you know that you are computing the same thing? That is all “cache invalidation” is about. When things become different, you have to invalidate the cache, and do the (presumably time-consuming) computing again.</p> \n<h2 id=\"a-toy-example\">A toy example</h2> \n<p>Implementing caching without considering the invalidation is often simple enough. Here is a simple example of turning a normal function to a function that supports caching:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">greet = function(person) {\n  switch(person,\n    Nick = {\n      # fast and smart\n      Sys.sleep(3); 'Hello!'\n    },\n    Yihui = {\n      # slow and shy\n      Sys.sleep(15); '你好！'\n    }\n  )\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>I used <code>Sys.sleep()</code> only to pretend the function was time-consuming. In the <code>greet()</code> function, Nick is fast and will say “Hello”, and Yihui is slow, speaking Chinese. If we have to call this function many times, there is no need to wait if we can save what Nick and Yihui say. We will need a database to store their words, and keys to retrieve the results.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">greet_cache = local({\n  \n  # a caching database (in-memory only; could be on disk, too)\n  database = list()\n  \n  function(person) {\n    res = database[[person]]\n    # if found in database, just return the cached result\n    if (person %in% names(database)) return(res)\n    # not found? compute and save it\n    res = greet(person)\n    database[[person]] &lt;&lt;- res  # note the double arrow here\n    res\n  }\n\n})\n</code></pre> \n<p>The first time you run this function, it will be slow, but for the second time, it will be instant.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">greet_cache('Nick')  # 3 seconds\ngreet_cache('Nick')  # immediately returns\n\ngreet_cache('Yihui')  # 15 seconds\ngreet_cache('Yihui')  # no time\n</code></pre> \n<p>The toy example shows the basic idea of implementing caching: turn your input into a key, use this key to retrieve the output in a cache database if it exists, otherwise do the computing and save the output to the database with the key.</p> \n<h2 id=\"when-to-invalidate-the-cache\">When to invalidate the cache?</h2> \n<p>Of course, toy examples often cannot represent the reality. If Nick goes to Japan, he may speak Japanese. When Yihui is in the US, he should speak English. We need to update the cache database in these cases (invalidating the previously saved results).</p> \n<p>Now let me talk about a real example in <strong>knitr</strong>’s caching, which should sound similar to the case of Nick being in Japan (or Yihui in US). For those who care about technical details, <strong>knitr</strong> caches results using <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/2b3e617a700f6d236e22873cfff6cbc3568df568/R/block.R#L60-L81\">these lines of code</a> and invalidate the cache <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/2b3e617a700f6d236e22873cfff6cbc3568df568/R/block.R#L283\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>The basic idea of <strong>knitr</strong>’s idea is that if you did not modify a code chunk (e.g., did not modify chunk options or the code), the result will be loaded from the previous run. The key of a code chunk is pretty much an MD5 hash (via <code>digest::digest()</code>) of the chunk options and the chunk content (code). Whenever you modify chunk options or the code, the hash will change, and the cache will be invalidated.</p> \n<p>That sounds about correct, right?</p> \n<p>I have heard unhappy users curse <strong>knitr</strong>’s caching. Some thought it was too sensitive, and some thought it was dumb. For example, when you add a space in an R comment in your code chunk, should <strong>knitr</strong> invalidate the cache? Modifying a comment certainly won’t affect the computing at all (but the text output may change if you show the code in the output via <code>echo = TRUE</code>), but the MD5 hash will change.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Actually-you-can\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/#fn:Actually-you-can\">1</a></sup></p> \n<p>Then an example to explain why people thought <strong>knitr</strong>’s caching was dumb: if you read an external CSV file in a code chunk, <strong>knitr</strong> does not know whether you have modified the data file. If you happen to have updated the data file, <strong>knitr</strong> won’t re-read it by default if you didn’t modify chunk options or the code. The cache key does not depend on the external file. In this case, you have to explicitly associate the cache with the external file, e.g.,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:You-could-also-u\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/#fn:You-could-also-u\">2</a></sup></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">```{r import-data, cache=TRUE, cache.extra=tools::md5sum('my-precious.csv')}\nd = read.csv('my-precious.csv')\n```\n</code></pre> \n<p>Since the chunk option <code>cache.extra</code> is associated with the CSV file, cache will be invalidated when the file is changed (because the cache key will be different).</p> \n<p>Another example is one code chunk using a variable created from a previous code chunk. When the variable is updated in the previous chunk, this chunk’s cache should be invalidated, too. This leads to the topic of the dependency structure of code chunks, which can be complicated, but there are some helper functions such as <code>knitr::dep_prev()</code> and <code>knitr::dep_auto()</code> to make it a little easier.</p> \n<p>When a code chunk is extremely time-consuming, <strong>knitr</strong> should be more conservative (not to invalidate the expensive cache unless there have been critical changes). When a code chunk is only moderately slow (e.g., 10 or 20 seconds), the caching probably should be more sensitive.</p> \n<p>The tricky thing is, it is hard to find the balance. Either direction can offend users.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-hidden-cost-that-is-often-ignored\">The hidden cost that is often ignored</h2> \n<p>I said above that the obvious price to pay for caching is storage (either in memory or on disk). However, to make caching work perfectly for you, there is a hidden cost. That is, the cost to understand caching. This is similar to a situation in our daily life: we may spend a lot of time and energy to save some money. We can only see the money we saved, but ignore the cost of time and emotion. If you don’t analyze the two costs, the money you saved may not really be worthwhile.</p> \n<p>If you don’t fully understand how caching works and the conditions for its invalidation, caching could be too sensitive or dumb, and may not serve you well. Some users may be able to quick understand it, and some may not. If you want to speed, you’d better know the traffic rules first, otherwise you may be pulled over.</p> \n<p>The full documentation of <strong>knitr</strong>’s caching is in the <strong>knitr</strong> book “<em>Dynamic Documents with R and knitr</em> (2nd ed)“. If you don’t have this book, there is <a href=\"https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/cache/\">a page on <strong>knitr</strong>’s website</a> that contains more information.</p> \n<p>I don’t know what was on Phil Karlton’s mind when he said those words, but the above is my experience about caching. The ultimate suggestion I often give to users is that if you feel <strong>knitr</strong>’s caching is too complicated, it is totally fine to use a much simpler caching mechanism like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if (file.exists('results.rds')) {\n  res = readRDS('results.rds')\n} else {\n  res = compute_it()  # a time-consuming function\n  saveRDS(res, 'results.rds')\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>In this case, you clearly understand how your caching works. The one and only way to invalidate the cache is to delete <code>results.rds</code>, which is no longer hard at all. If you prefer this mechanism, <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache-rds.html\">you may consider using <code>xfun::cache_rds()</code></a>.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Actually-you-can\">Actually you can use the chunk option <code>cache.comments = FALSE</code> to prevent cache invalidation when only comments were changed in a code chunk. This can be useful when <code>echo = FALSE</code>. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/#fnref:Actually-you-can\">↩</a></li> \n  <li id=\"fn:You-could-also-u\">You could also use <code>file.mtime()</code> instead of <code>tools::md5sum()</code> if you want the cache to depend on the modification time of the CSV file. <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/#fnref:You-could-also-u\">↩</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/';</script>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"38d9d8873c889f851f0285c5931a55a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yihui Xie","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973460},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Back from rstudio::conf 2019","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2019/01/rstudio-conf/","description":"\n        \n\n<p>There was an obvious reason for me being quiet in my blog this month: the rstudio::conf(2019) took place last week. I (co-)taught a workshop and gave a talk there, so I needed a lot of time to make the preparation. In this post, I want to share some observations and experiences. Note that this is not a summary of the conference. Many others have blogged about the conference, and you can find those links in <a href=\"https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2019Slides\">Karl&rsquo;s Github repo</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"some-people-i-met\">Some people I met</h2>\n\n<p>Usually I don&rsquo;t have much interest in meeting anyone in person because the online connection seems to be good enough for me. Sometimes I feel there is no real need to physically meet someone. For example, the total time I have literally talked to Karthik Ram should be no more than five minutes, but I feel we just know each other so well and have been paying attention to each other&rsquo;s work over the years. That said, I definitely don&rsquo;t avoid meeting people deliberately.</p>\n\n<p>At the R Markdown workshop, I met Stas Kolenikov and Josh Goldberg (for the first time, I think). I started to notice Josh since last year because of his several comments in my blog. If all students were of his level in <strong>rmarkdown</strong> and <strong>knitr</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t have much left to teach in the workshop. Stas seems to be active on Twitter, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StatStas/status/1042216743479914496\">he actually suggested</a> that I cover David Gohel&rsquo;s <strong>officer</strong> package in the R Markdown workshop. That was not on my original plan, but after Eric Nantz <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theRcast/status/1073441479257980928\">offered to help</a>, I accepted the <strong>officer</strong> tutorial without hesitation, because I thought it would be great for the students to know the alternatives to R Markdown (and R Markdown is certainly not perfect for everything).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it was great to meet my co-instructor (and now colleague) <a href=\"https://alison.rbind.io\">Alison</a> for the first time in person. She is such a great and enthusiastic instructor! I admire her capability of learning things quickly and teaching them clearly. BTW, I think she is absolutely the top expert of the hugo-academic theme now. I don&rsquo;t remember if it was also the first time I had met our TA Jennifer Thompson. <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/user-developer/\">I mentioned her</a> last year in a blog post. Apparently Alison did a great job at finding TAs for our workshop. Other awesome TAs include <a href=\"https://www.jienamclellan.com\">Jiena Gu</a>, <a href=\"https://haozhu233.github.io\">Hao Zhu</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomas_mock\">Thomas Mock</a>. I asked Jiena to be TA because she had asked me a lot of questions about R Markdown and Shiny in the past. Many people ask me questions, but she is one of the few who can dig much deeper and work out amazing solutions by themselves after I provide my hints or even guesses. Hao is famous at least for his work on the <strong>kableExtra</strong> package. At JSM 2018, someone just called him &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/haozhu233/status/1024346015774597120\">the kable guy</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>One random person I happily and surprisingly bumped into was Suthira Owlarn during a lunch. It was a few minutes into our conversation that I realized she was the person who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/S_Owla/status/1062678377528786944\">mentioned my moon cake recipe</a> two months ago! Sitting on my left-hand side at the same lunch table was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yutannihilat_en\">Hiroaki Yutani</a>. I had never met him before, but I was actively looking for him at the conference. He had a poster but his flight was late, so I didn&rsquo;t find him in front of his poster. I have discovered several cool Japanese hackers on Github in these years, including Hiroaki. Last year I decided to give him write access to the <strong>knitr</strong> repo because I felt he was careful enough and knew well enough about the source code of <strong>knitr</strong>. He was actually the first person who gained write access to the <strong>knitr</strong> repo besides me. Personally I&rsquo;m very interested in the Japanese culture, and I wish I could spend a few months living in Japan someday.</p>\n\n<p>I met <a href=\"https://github.com/cderv\">Christophe Dervieux</a> for the second time at rstudio::conf. I cannot thank him enough for his active help with my Github issues almost on a daily basis. During the 2018 rstudio::conf, I talked to him briefly about automating the generation of the bookdown.org website, and he quickly finished what I planned to do, which has saved me at least one hour every week in maintaining this website.</p>\n\n<p>At last year&rsquo;s rstudio::conf, an American lady talked to me in fluent Mandarin. I was so very impressed, but didn&rsquo;t remember her name, which had been a shame to me. Luckily, she came to this year&rsquo;s conference again. The first thing I did when I found her was to look at her badge and made sure I remembered the name, Amanda Johnson. However, I made the same mistake two days later when another lady came to me and told me she could also speak and read Chinese. It is kind of embarrassing for me to bend my neck to look at other people&rsquo;s badges while talking. Anyway, she asked me for permission to correct other people&rsquo;s pronunciation of my name. I was so touched! People were so kind and humble at this conference.</p>\n\n<p>Ian Lyttle was still carrying <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/01/ian-lyttle/\">his notebook</a> with him this year.</p>\n\n<p>The list of amazing people I met could go on and on, but I&rsquo;m just going to stop here.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-pronounce-it\">How do you pronounce it?</h2>\n\n<p>An extremely common topic I heard from all conversations was how to pronounce the name of a package or a certain term. For example, the most frequently asked question about the <strong>xaringan</strong> package is its pronunciation. Well, I have to make an official announcement that there is no official pronunciation of <strong>xaringan</strong>&mdash;just pronounce it in whatever way you like. If you are really curious about its authentic pronunciation, you can learn it from the video (at 01:04) on <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan\">the Sharingan page</a> of the Naruto wiki, or ask a Japanese friend to teach you.</p>\n\n<p>Similar examples include <strong>GGally</strong> (GG-ally or G-Galy), <strong>reprex</strong> (re-prex as in &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; or rep-rex as in &ldquo;replicate&rdquo;), and <strong>memor</strong> (like mem-er or memo-R).</p>\n\n<p>Human names can be difficult to pronounce, too (e.g., my last name). The day before I gave my talk on <strong>pagedown</strong>, I asked Christophe, a native French, to record the pronunciation of the name &ldquo;Romain Lesur&rdquo; on my phone, and practiced it quite a few times in my room, so I could hopefully make my pronunciation of my collaborator&rsquo;s name close enough in my talk (I have never met or talked to Romain in person).</p>\n\n<p>At a lunch, one person mentioned the &ldquo;sword&rdquo; sound in the <strong>beepr</strong> package, and I proudly told her that it was largely due to <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr-talks/tree/master/useR2014\">my useR! 2014 talk</a>. Then we talked about the difficulties in the pronunciation of package and human names. I suggested that we record the authentic pronunciations and send pull requests to <strong>beepr</strong>, so that, for example, <code>beepr::beep(12)</code> tells us the pronunciation of &ldquo;xaringan&rdquo;, and <code>beepr::beep(13)</code> is &ldquo;Yihui Xie&rdquo;, etc. Would that be a good idea?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"some-of-my-experience-in-doing-presentations\">Some of my experience in doing presentations</h2>\n\n<p>I asked Hiroaki if he also had a talk at the conference, and he said he was concerned about his English language. Although <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/english-is-hard/\">I also struggle with English</a>, I&rsquo;m rarely worried about my language in presentations, because I&rsquo;m sure native speakers will pretty much understand it regardless of all grammar or pronunciation problems. The requirement for English is much lower in a presentation than in a conversation, because a presentation is primarily a solo activity: you just keep talking on the stage. Given that rstudio::conf is a super friendly conference, presenters who are not native English speakers could have more confidence in themselves.</p>\n\n<p>With the observation of Hiroaki&rsquo;s concern, I feel that perhaps we should offer some help to non-native speakers with their language if they prefer. I don&rsquo;t know how many people decided not to give a talk because of language problems.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, non-native speakers have a special advantage. That is, idioms and jokes that are only familiar and popular to native speakers will sound particularly funny when said by a non-native speaker, because it is totally unexpected to them that you know such a joke or idiom. For example, someone (I believe it was an American) at the conference told me &ldquo;your packages are very 666&rdquo; (pronounced roughly as &ldquo;leo-leo-leo&rdquo; in Chinese). I guess no one knows what &ldquo;<a href=\"https://baike.baidu.com/item/666/17192634\">666</a>&rdquo; means in today&rsquo;s Chinese cyber culture (awesome/neat/slick) unless you are a young Chinese, so I had a good laugh when 666 was said from an American&rsquo;s mouth. He told me his Chinese friend taught him this, and apparently it was very effective.</p>\n\n<p>Many people feel nervous on the stage. I&rsquo;m rarely nervous there, but I do feel a little nervous in the few minutes before I walk onto the stage. My heartbeat quickens, too. That is very normal. I don&rsquo;t feel nervous while I give the talk because I&rsquo;m usually extremely focused on my talk. I wouldn&rsquo;t notice it even if you pull an elephant into the room and walk it around while I&rsquo;m giving the talk. FWIW, I failed the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo\">selective attention test</a> the first time I saw it (I completely overlooked that animal).</p>\n\n<p>At the useR! 2014 conference in LA, I told Kevin Ushey that the more people in the room, the more comfortable I would be to give my talk. He was surprised. To some degree, this is similar to &ldquo;one death is a tragedy, and a million deaths is a statistic.&rdquo; When there are only a few people listening to your talk, you may feel the stare. When there are a thousand people in the audience, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how an individual reacts to your talk, so you should just shift your focus from the audience to your talk. And your talk may not be as important as you thought&hellip;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one&rsquo;s work is terribly important.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Bertrand Russell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/renatagerecke/status/1086305574696964098\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/51764240-4c612c80-209a-11e9-9c92-ba35c4f0d802.jpg\" alt=\"The room for my pagedown talk. Photo credit: Renata Gerecke on Twitter.\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There is a special bonus of a large audience: jokes will work much better. Even mild jokes will make a fair number of people laugh. In all of my talks with a large audience, there are almost always a few people who laugh out so hard as if I paid them to laugh.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m good at creating strange and unexpected associations among seemingly unrelated things (such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1086305302964813827\">rmarkdown and the government shutdown</a>), which often creates unexpected jokes. If anyone has a presentation that needs some flavor, I&rsquo;ll be happy to help. Actually, if you think more about your best jokes coming up in the talk, it will also help you relax on the stage.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, being funny is not the goal. There are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/959856196369793024\">many excellent talks</a> that don&rsquo;t sound funny at all. It feels satisfactory when the audience laugh out loud, but we need to keep in mind that the means is not the goal. I have heard negative feedback on at least one of my talks, and that person thought the talk didn&rsquo;t have much content, despite of the loud laughter. Perhaps I overdid it. I certainly want people to laugh and remember, instead of laughing and forgetting.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, no matter how much you love the dark theme of your editor, switch to a bright theme (and increase the font size) when you show live code demos.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-do-you-get-ideas-for-your-next-r-package\">Where do you get ideas for your next R package?</h2>\n\n<p>I was asked a few times how I found ideas for my new packages. First of all, I only work on one package each year in recent years, which has made the decision a little bit easier. Once I decide what to work on, I can ignore most of the news throughout the year. The amount of work that <em>could</em> be done is always much bigger than what we <em>can</em> actually do. You may need a long-term dream (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1022873179532996609\">like mine</a>) to be able to focus.</p>\n\n<p>I read the Hacker Newsletter regularly, although I feel most of the items in each newsletter are not relevant or useful to me. I learned Gitbook, remark.js, Hugo, and ReLaXed from there, which in turn gave birth to <strong>bookdown</strong>, <strong>xaringan</strong>, <strong>blogdown</strong>, and <strong>pagedown</strong>, respectively. That means I find one thing or two in the newsletter directly relevant to my new R packages every year, which is actually enough.</p>\n\n<p>My other source of inspiration is Twitter. The <strong>pagedown</strong> package was finally born mainly because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLesur/status/1037126641846312967\">one of Romain&rsquo;s tweets about Paged.js</a>. Even though I was excited about ReLaXed, I really didn&rsquo;t want to introduce a Node package as the dependency of an R package. I saw a much brighter future from Romain&rsquo;s tweet. More importantly, I felt <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/in-html-i-trust/\">the shared belief</a> between him and me, so I reached out to him and we started to work on <strong>pagedown</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-personal-favorite-talks\">My personal favorite talks</h2>\n\n<p>There were three parallel sessions, so I only attended 1/3 of the talks. For those I attended, I especially loved these ones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Joe Cheng, Shiny in production</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Kara Woo, Box plots: A case study in debugging and perseverance</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Karl Broman, R/qtl2: Rewrite of a very old R package</p></li>\n\n<li><p>David Robinson, The unreasonable effectiveness of public work</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Kara&rsquo;s talk showed an inspiring and detailed example of how to fix a bug in a famous (if not the most famous) R package. The R community needs more contributors like her. I love Karl&rsquo;s special humor. Sometimes I cannot even tell if it is humor or he is just nervous at the podium, because he often appears to be speechless (and emotionless at the same time). I asked him later, and it seemed he was just speechless at <a href=\"https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/08/17/the-stupidest-r-code-ever/\">the ridiculous examples</a> in his talk. I thought he needed some encouragement at the podium (come on, Karl, <a href=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/you-can-do-it.gif\">you can do it</a>). Anyway, there was a lady sitting in front me who laughed so loud and often, which made Karl&rsquo;s talk even more amusing. Dave gave the closing keynote, and I agree with everything he said (definitely not because he mentioned me twice in his talk). Yes, publicize your work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"jared-lander-s-annual-feature-requests\">Jared Lander&rsquo;s annual feature requests</h2>\n\n<p>I meet Jared Lander roughly annually. Each time he would make certain requests to me. For example, the <strong>bookdown</strong> package was an response to his request in 2014 when we met at the Strata conference. This year he wanted self-contained <strong>xaringan</strong> slides. This is a tricky issue because Markdown is not processed through Pandoc, but I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. The next request was a talk at the <a href=\"https://www.rstats.nyc\">New York R conference</a>. I absolutely love this conference, but I&rsquo;m still waiting for my two little kids to grow (I cannot offer them six meals a day to let them grow twice as fast). If any R Markdown ninja volunteers to go, I&rsquo;ll be happy to help create a Yihui-style talk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-random-idea-turn-your-dropbox-folder-into-a-public-website-through-plumber-and-rdrop2\">A random idea: turn your Dropbox folder into a public website through <strong>plumber</strong> and <strong>rdrop2</strong></h2>\n\n<p>On the first day of our R Markdown workshop, Hao told me my slides were no longer accessible, which scared me. I usually serve my slides through <a href=\"https://updog.co\">Updog.co</a>. Unfortunately the service was down right before the workshop, but was recovered later that day. I came up with an idea of an alternative implementation of Updog.co after this incidence, and will leave it as an exercise to those who are interested:</p>\n\n<p>In R, we have the <a href=\"https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2\"><strong>rdrop2</strong></a> package to access a Dropbox folder. Then we also have the <a href=\"https://www.rplumber.io\"><strong>plumber</strong></a> package to build simple web APIs. With these two pieces, it is enough to turn a private Dropbox folder into a public website. What the API does is simply read static files and return their content (i.e., <a href=\"https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#static-file-handler\">a static file server</a>). If you <a href=\"https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html\">host</a> the <strong>plumber</strong> API on a public server, you will be able to enjoy a similar service as Updog.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-video-recording-of-my-talk\">The video recording of my talk</h2>\n\n<p>RStudio is currently uploading <a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019\">all conference videos</a>. If you are interested, my talk is already there:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css\"><img src=\"https://embedwistia-a.akamaihd.net/deliveries/f936ea9db9c32a27a3262d640ea1810fc319ddab.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;amp;image_crop_resized=960x540&amp;amp;image_play_button=1&amp;amp;image_play_button_color=4287c7e0\" alt=\"pagedown Creating beautiful PDFs with R Markdown and CSS - Yihui Xie\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Many other people have written blog posts about this conference (again, see <a href=\"https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2019Slides\">Karl&rsquo;s repo</a>). I have read most of them, and they are all beautifully written (I&rsquo;m particularly impressed by Brooke Watson&rsquo;s hand-drawing skills). I feel very glad and proud to learn that people found this conference super friendly, inclusive, welcoming, and helpful. Many thanks to those who made this conference such a positive experience, and looking forward to rstudio::conf(2020) in San Francisco!</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2019/01/rstudio-conf/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/51764240-4c612c80-209a-11e9-9c92-ba35c4f0d802.jpg","linkMd5":"36d5b56353cf8fd09432e2ebce473d1a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-19-33-828_0f6237576394ce14.webp","destWidth":2048,"destHeight":650,"sourceBytes":71350,"destBytes":108086,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/51764240-4c612c80-209a-11e9-9c92-ba35c4f0d802.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-19-33-828_0f6237576394ce14.webp","https://embedwistia-a.akamaihd.net/deliveries/f936ea9db9c32a27a3262d640ea1810fc319ddab.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;image_crop_resized=960x540&amp;image_play_button=1&amp;image_play_button_color=4287c7e0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-20-01-212_22a034ec2dca3830.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973440},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"On Cosmetic Changes in Pull Requests","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/cosmetic-changes/","description":"\n        <p>Programmers, including myself, make cosmetic changes in code all the time, such as adding or deleting white spaces or blank lines, or re-wrapping lines, or adding <code>{ }</code> to single-line <code>if</code> statements. That is usually fine. However, when making changes in other people&rsquo;s code and sending pull requests on Github, I suggest you refrain from introducing cosmetic changes. There are two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Such changes require unnecessary attention of the pull request reviewer. If you don&rsquo;t know if the reviewer is busy or not, always assume he/she is extremely busy, so the best strategy is to bring the really minimal set of changes, and exclude all non-essential changes (<a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/bite-sized-pull-requests/\">or save them for later</a>).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The author of the package may not really like the style of the cosmetic changes. This is worse. People can argue to death on style. Such changes are often red herrings and can quickly lead to <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding\">bikeshedding</a>. Unless you are going to take over the maintainership of a package, I recommend that you follow the style of the main author(s). Even if they use <code>=</code> for assignments, which makes absolutely no sense to you, you just use <code>=</code> (you can complain about it by yourself in your own room if that makes you feel better). FWIW, <a href=\"https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/319\">I use <code>&lt;-</code> when I contribute to a package</a> if its author uses <code>&lt;-</code>. I don&rsquo;t think there is any need to argue about it, and I wish people could be more tolerant with each other&rsquo;s styles.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In summary, the whole point is &ldquo;recognize the priorities&rdquo;. Getting the pull request merged is more important, so you want to save the reviewer time. It is more important for the package maintainers to be happy so they can carry on (bear in mind that they will also have to maintain the code you contributed <em>after you have left</em>), so you follow their own styles.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/drag-cat.gif\" alt=\"I love pull requests, but usually you won't stay in my bathtub for long\" /></p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/cosmetic-changes/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/drag-cat.gif","linkMd5":"67f501ec24468aafa4f06f500fe3a598","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-36-886_dad90d4bcefee63d.webp","destWidth":317,"destHeight":198,"sourceBytes":1046813,"destBytes":824792,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://slides.yihui.org/gif/drag-cat.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-36-886_dad90d4bcefee63d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973440},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"On Marketing (on Social Media)","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/12/social-media-marketing/","description":"<p>Both Mara and Hadley disagreed with me <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/\">when I talked about my concerns on marketing</a> last month. Marketing was not the main topic of that post, and I want to clarify my thoughts in this post.</p> \n<h2 id=\"the-medium-is-the-message\">The medium is the message</h2> \n<p>I’m not against marketing. I do it myself, too. I definitely agree with Mara’s comment that meritocracy is a fantasy:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I think there’s a tendency to imagine a platonic ideal of meritocracy in the absence of something we call “marketing,” which (in reality) doesn’t really exist.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>My actual problem is more with the social media than with marketing. When I said “the room” was loud enough, I meant the social media:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[…] marketing more or less depends on how loud you can shout out and whether you are able to keep raising your voice in a room that has already been fairly loud (or using more emojis).</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There is too much to see on the social media. Too much “breaking” news. Too many pictures of dogs and cats. Too much Trump. To market your software package, you are forced to “raise your voice” or use all sorts of bells and whistles (e.g., attach images or GIFs) unless you have a fairly big number of followers.</p> \n<p>I’d be very interested in a service that can help us filter the content on social media. I don’t think social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook care about whether we are able to read what we really want to read. On the contrary, I believe they want to train us to be buried in, and addicted by, chaos.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message\">McLuhan described</a> the “content” of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. I feel social media platforms are exactly such burglars. To clarify, I’m not saying that users who generated the content are burglars. Users are simply victims.</p> \n<h2 id=\"two-great-examples-of-marketing-on-social-media\">Two great examples of marketing on social media</h2> \n<p>If I were to follow only one person on Twitter, I’d follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dataandme\">Mara @dataandme</a>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:If-I-were-to-sub\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/12/social-media-marketing/#fn:If-I-were-to-sub\">1</a></sup> She is a great curator, promoting an extremely wide range of interesting resources about R every day. If I were still relatively new to R, and had enough free time to look for things to learn, I’m sure I’d benefit a lot from her tweets. The great thing about Mara is that she actively markets for people with low voices, so they don’t have to scream by themselves. <del>My last wish for Mara is to completely drop the (already very occasional) use of “ICYMI” :) In case you missed it, just miss it. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out\">FOMO</a> is rather unhealthy in my opinion.</del> (Update 24 hours later: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1078850366492561409\">She did it! “ICYMI” was replaced by #repeatTweet.</a> Yeah! Thanks, Mara!)</p> \n<p>Another great example of marketing on Twitter is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wearerladies\">@WeAreRLadies</a>. I don’t know who came up with this idea of “Rotating Curators”. It must be a genius. This is the best marketing idea I have ever seen: people (R ladies) take turns to use the same Twitter handle to promote their own or other people’s interesting work.</p> \n<h2 id=\"deep-marketing\">Deep marketing</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/dependency-winner/#comment-4192835297\">As Hadley pointed out</a>, I do a lot of marketing myself, but I often do it differently. In particular, I deliberately avoid using Twitter myself. It is only my personal choice, and I don’t mean you should do it, too. In fact, I believe most people would actually benefit more from marketing on social media than through other ways.</p> \n<p>After I finished the <strong>bookdown</strong> project and the corresponding book in 2016, I started to think about this question:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>If I were to tweet (announce) only once or twice a year about my work, what would I post?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This partially explains my decreasing number of tweets per year—if I don’t have anything of importance to say, I just keep quiet. To me, the marginal utility of marketing on social media has been diminishing. I feel more and more people are engaged in social media. It has become a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy\">red ocean</a>. I don’t want to spend time on thinking about how to do marketing more effectively there as the bar keeps raising, and I’d rather save the effort to do the one thing (or two) well every year. On the other hand, thanks to many friends like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliasilge/status/1062575146404274176\">Julia Silge</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpsievert/status/950416948634021893\">Carson Sievert</a>, I only need to focus on writing blog posts, and they will pick some to spread. The crafty Yihui clearly knows that marketing through one’s own mouth is not the best idea. Therefore staying (relatively) quiet on Twitter is the rational choice for me. I guess most other people don’t have my luxury, hence should not follow my marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>My so-called deep marketing strategy is “deep work + passive marketing”. This has an important prerequisite: I have been famous enough. I can invest most of my time into the work itself, and people will surely discover it sooner or later. Even if I’m excited about the work, I’d hold the desire to share it myself, because I want it to pass someone else’s independent test first. <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/influence-depth-or-breadth/\">I strongly prefer depth over breadth</a> in terms of making an impact. I’d be much happier if only a single user finds my work useful and uses it for a decade than when ten thousand users are excited for ten seconds.</p> \n<h2 id=\"slow-marketing\">Slow marketing</h2> \n<p>After we build a cool product, we often feel the urge to tell people in the next minute. I usually hold this desire, too. Instead, I slowly collect cool use cases of this product in the coming years. Hadley described the <strong>bookdown</strong> website <a href=\"https://bookdown.org\">bookdown.org</a> as one of my marketing initiatives. He was absolutely correct. I keep collecting books written in <strong>bookdown</strong> for marketing both my own package and other people’s books. However, I won’t share the individual books every time I find one (usually I find them on Twitter but won’t tweet or retweet). I want to take a single chance to impress <strong>bookdown</strong> users. That is, when they open the website and see the long list of free books.</p> \n<p>Blogging is also a slow way of marketing. It is slow in two senses: posts are often slow to write and also slow to read. By writing slowly, you (as the author) have a better chance to speculate. A possible by-product is that you may do a better job of marketing. By reading slowly, your readers know more deeply about your work and you. Of course, there will be readers who don’t prefer reading blog posts because of their length. Personally I don’t consider them my target audience.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:But-I-admit-my-p\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/12/social-media-marketing/#fn:But-I-admit-my-p\">2</a></sup> The audience who are easy to get may also be easy to lose.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinjhnhadley/status/1074961327414743042\">As I mentioned to Martin John Hadley</a> a few days ago, I don’t often announce new releases of packages I maintain (the main exception is the initial CRAN releases). New releases typically contain bug fixes and new features. I feel not many people are interested in knowing the bug fixes, and I often don’t have many groundbreaking new features in these releases, so I’d just let those who really care about the new releases dig out the new stuff slowly by themselves. Sometimes it is worth leaving small exercises to users (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53820938#comment94526023_53820938\">Dason is an expert</a>).

I feel very grateful to them. Honestly, I haven’t done much in return, and I definitely owe the community some marketing effort. Occasionally I write about some cool hackers in my blog, and try to help people find jobs. As a master of marketing, sometimes I use <a href=\"https://pagedown.rbind.io/html-resume\">very subtle ways</a> to market for <a href=\"https://pagedown.rbind.io/html-letter\">other people</a>.</p> \n<p>As I was writing <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/code-appendix/\">the post</a> about Alex and Lucy’s methods of putting code in the appendix in September, I came up with a book idea. I was hoping to put together a book about those cool hackers, to show how one could be moderately successful as an ordinary human, because I don’t believe the chicken soup that all people can be wildly and unconditionally successful. I hope the community would benefit from these examples. That said, I have already had two other books lined up for 2019, so I really have no idea when I’ll be able to work on this one.</p> \n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Is marketing necessary? Absolutely. Do you have to use social media? It depends. The take-home message? Do good work first.

Full disclosure: I am not an ISU alumnus, but Di Cook granted me that privilege for the night. During the dinner, I wanted to mention something from the 2016 useR! Conference at Stanford, and I asked Yihui Xie if he was there. My intended benign conversation starter raised a sore point that Yihui explained in his post <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/\">My Early Career Crisis (2014 - 2015)</a>. Yes, I am that guy, that &ldquo;Someone at the table recalled that I missed the useR! 2016 conference at Stanford due to visa issues.&rdquo; The next day, Yihui emailed me to ask me to think about posting my anecdotes on famous statisticians. And now, more than six months later, I&rsquo;m finally able to put some of my thoughts on paper. Maybe there will be others posts someday too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"david-donoho\">David Donoho</h2>\n\n<p>The anecdotal story I wanted to tell at the dinner was meeting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Donoho\">David Donoho</a> at the 2016 useR! Conference Welcome Reception on Tuesday, June 28, 2016. I was trying to overcome my INTJ Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and &ldquo;work the room&rdquo; as best as possible for a math-stats geek with the aid of wine, when I crossed paths with what appeared to be a younger wavy blond-haired, tanned skin California surfer dude-type - not quite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Times_at_Ridgemont_High\">Jeff Spicoli</a>, but maybe one of the guys in the van - wearing a blue suit and glasses, and I was struck by the apparent dichotomy. Then I looked at his name tag and saw &ldquo;David Donoho&rdquo; and immediately made the connection to the paper &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science&rdquo; (2015-09-15 version), which I devoured the moment I found it posted online. I had no idea who David Donoho was, but I <a href=\"http://paperswelove.org/\">loved the paper</a>, mainly because it referenced landmark data science papers by four of my statistical heroes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>John Tukey: &ldquo;The Future of Data Analysis&rdquo; (1962)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>John Chambers: &ldquo;Greater or Lesser Statistics: A Choice for Future Research&rdquo; (1993)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Leo Breiman: &ldquo;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures&rdquo; (2001)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>William S. Cleveland: &ldquo;Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics&rdquo; (2001)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, I just had to corner Donoho, tell him how much I liked his paper, and try to play a game of 20 Questions. As I recall, my opening question was: did you talk to Tukey, Chambers, Breiman, and Cleveland before writing the paper to get their input or perspective? Donoho&rsquo;s reply was something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them for years and worked with them.&rdquo; This dumbfounded me - how could a guy who looked so much younger than me possibly work with that generation of statisticians, whose work I studied in grad school nearly 30 years earlier? I just had to pry and asked him how that was even possible [as soon as I could check Wikipedia, I learned that Donoho is 7 years OLDER than me - Palo Alto water must spring forth from the Fountain of Youth]. The details are fuzzy at this point, but Donoho explained that he went to Princeton for his undergraduate degree and worked as a statistical programmer for John Tukey and so was able to work with John Chambers and Bill Cleveland at Bell Labs. I tried to articulate my fan-boy admiration of the Princeton-Bell Labs-Institute for Advanced Study <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1998/11/clusters-and-the-new-economics-of-competition\">innovation cluster</a>, but I&rsquo;m afraid the wine and warm, dry air were too good. Then I asked how he knew Leo Breiman, and Donoho told me he worked at the University of California at Berkeley while Breiman was there. And then he told me an anecdote that blew my mind: he was sitting in a Berkeley wine bar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka\">Ross Ihaka</a> and said to him something like: &ldquo;You know what you should do - rewrite S using a Lisp dialect, like Scheme.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dang! Not only did Donoho personally know and work with the statisticians whose papers, books, and methods I&rsquo;ve read and utilized for nearly 30 years, he put in motion thoughts that led to the creation of R, which I use almost every day! While I certainly didn&rsquo;t know Tukey, Chambers, Breiman, and Cleveland personally like Donoho did, they were key inspirations over my 25+ years of &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"john-tukey\">John Tukey</h2>\n\n<p>From what I can determine, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey\">John Tukey</a> spent his entire career simultaneously at Princeton and Bell Labs, and, as his Wiki page attests, his influence on both world-class institutions and the rest of the world was amazing. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am that a very young David Donoho was able to work for John Tukey while attending Princeton in the mid-1970s - was that due to happenstance or planned? I never even heard of Tukey until his name kept popping up in my grad school classes, especially in my Design Of Experiments (DOE) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) classes. My EDA course was based on two books:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>Applications, Basics, and Computing of Exploratory Data Analysis</em> (ABCs of EDA) by Paul F. Velleman and David C. Hoaglin</p></li>\n\n<li><p><em>Graphical Methods for Data Analysis</em> (GMDA) by John M. Chambers, William S. Cleveland, Beat Kleiner, and Paul A. Tukey (all Bell Labs staff)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The ABCs of EDA was dedicated to John W. Tukey, and both Velleman and Hoaglin were PhD students of Tukey&rsquo;s at Princeton. To implement Tukey&rsquo;s techniques, the book was filled with Basic code and Fortran code, which I knew fairly well at the time - along with Pascal - from my undergraduate studies; however, for the sake of expedience we were able to use Minitab and Minitab macros to do the examples and exercises.</p>\n\n<p>GMDA was dedicated to &ldquo;To our parents,&rdquo; while its Preface stated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Without the influence of John Tukey on statistics, this book would probably never have been written. His many contributions to graphical methods, his insights into the role good plots can play in statistics and his general philosophy of data analysis have shaped much of the approach presented here. Directly and indirectly, he is responsible for much of the richness of graphical methods available today.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the name Tukey was ubiquitous for me during that period of my life, and I kept asking myself, &ldquo;Who is this guy?&rdquo; It was only later that I learned that the creator, head, and adviser for my statistics program was one of Tukey&rsquo;s PhD students at Princeton, so maybe that explains some of it. Somewhere along the way, I acquired copies of two of Tukey&rsquo;s books <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em> (1977) and <em>Exploring Data Tables, Trends and Shapes</em> (1985) edited by David Hoaglin, Frederick Mosteller, and John Tukey, which I use as references from time to time. I even made attempts to reproduce examples using S-PLUS and R, but those attempts kept getting derailed. But I hope someday, maybe in retirement, I can work through those two books cover-to-cover.</p>\n\n<p>Donoho marks the birth of Data Science with the publication of Tukey&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Future of Data Analysis&rdquo; paper in 1962, I assume because Tukey implored statisticians to reduce their focus on statistical theory and engage with the entire data analysis process. True confession: this was similar to my thinking when I decided to attend a relatively unknown applied statistics graduate program that offered an industrial co-op position instead of well-known theoretical graduate programs (and likely a Research Assistant or Teaching Assistant position), after being demotivated by theory without application as an undergraduate. Then Tukey reviewed three tools that I don&rsquo;t recall encountering in books or classes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Full Normal Rejection (FUNOR)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Full Normal Modification (FUNOM)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Freeing Interaction Line from the Error Term (FILLET)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Are there R packages for these?</p>\n\n<p>I think the best part of the 67 page paper is near the end, which I believe is worth repeating for today&rsquo;s Data Scientists, so they can be confident they have the right attitudes, unlike when I was initially learning and practicing statistics:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We need to face up to more realistic problems</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to face up to the necessarily approximate nature of useful results in data analysis</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to face up to the need for collecting the results of actual experience with specific data-analytic techniques</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to face up to the need for iterative procedures in data analysis</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to face up to the need for both indication and conclusion in the same analysis</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to face up to the need for a free use of ad hoc and informal procedures in seeking indications</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to face up to the face that, as we enter into new fields or study new kinds of procedures, it is natural for indication procedures to grow up before the corresponding conclusion procedures do so</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We must face up to the need for a double standard in dealing with error rates, whether significance levels or lacks of confidence</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We must face up to the fact that, in any experimental science, our certainty about what will happen in a particular situation does not usually come from directly applicable experiments or theory, but rather comes mainly through analogy between situations which are not know to behave similarly</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We need to give up the vain hope that data analysis can be founded upon a logico-deductive system like Euclidean plan geometry (or some form of the propositional calculus) and to face up to the fact that data analysis is intrinsically an empirical science</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"john-chambers\">John Chambers</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_(statistician)\">John Chambers</a> worked at Bell Labs, was one of the original authors of S, and later moved to Stanford. As mentioned in the previous section, I first encountered the name John Chambers from <em>Graphical Methods for Data Analysis</em> (GMDA) in my EDA class. GMDA showcased the S language&rsquo;s graphical methods, and our class used Minitab and S on a Unix server to work through the examples and exercises, so this was my first exposure to the S language. This book turned me on to solving problems by visualizing the data. For example, years later I taught a basic statistics class for my employer, and I encouraged students to bring their own data for live problem-solving sessions (I called it &ldquo;Stump the Chump, er, Statistician,&rdquo; daring them to challenge me in front of the class). One student had a vexing factory problem, and I recommended a simple normal probability plot, which exhibited several vertical lines of data points, indicating the same values to 6+ decimal places were occurring, a statistical impossibility. I asked him to check if they were successive values, and sure enough they were, suggesting the same value was stuck in the buffer and subsequent values were ignored. This simple graph solved the problem in a few minutes that no one else had solved after collecting data for a long period of time. This was just one of many examples of solving problems by organizing and visualizing the data, without requiring any statistical modeling or Design Of Experiments (often after I was really hoping to take the next step and design and analyze a complex DOE).</p>\n\n<p>GMDA became one of those &ldquo;go to&rdquo; books where the pages are marked up with pencil scribblings and highlighting, the spine is broken, and pages are about to fall out if I&rsquo;m not careful. Its methods were especially useful when encountering &ldquo;real world&rdquo; data - some from Bell Labs and others used for S, S-PLUS and R examples - that never seemed to follow the normal distribution, unlike the data sets in most other statistics textbooks. Concurrent with my studies, I was lucky to have a co-op assignment that gave me access to an AT&amp;T 3B2 Unix box, so I took advantage of it and wrote some programs with S and Ratfor (Rational Fortran - Fortran with curly braces).</p>\n\n<p>After I graduated I joined a SAS shop for two years. Unlike the wide variety of statistical tools and computing systems available at grad school and my co-op job, we only had two ways to do statistics: mainframe SAS and PC SAS. Still, it had a role in my S journey. My supervisor had budget money left over near the the end of the fiscal year and asked me for ideas on how to spend it, explaining that if he didn&rsquo;t spend it, his budget might get cut. I told him that as a co-op, I used software called STAR (Statistical Reliability Analysis), developed at Bell Labs by Bill Meeker, a professor at Iowa State University and world-renowned reliability statistics expert. Based on Meeker&rsquo;s reputation and desperate to spend money fast, my boss told me to order it. Because I put in the order, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories sent me a complimentary copy of <em>The New S Language: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics</em> by Becker, Chambers, and Wilks (1988) with a thank you letter dated 06/19/1990 and a tape drive containing the software. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t install software from a tape; this required IT support. I put in a request. Nothing. No response, not even an estimate of when they might get to it. But we met the objective: spend our entire budget before the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n\n<p>After two years of being a frustrated SAS programmer and mastering the SAS macro language - purely to reduce the amount of SAS code for trivial, repetitive tasks and hand it off to administrative staff - and never getting STAR installed, I left to join a much smaller firm. We didn&rsquo;t have much data, and when we did, I had no statistical software to analyze it and struggled writing statistical programs in C. I heard that S was ported from Unix to Windows and renamed S-PLUS, so I purchased a copy. With the purchase of S-PLUS, I received a second copy of <em>The New S Language</em> (now softcover) and a copy of <em>Statistical Methods with S</em>, edited by Chambers and Trevor Hastie. Chambers also wrote or co-wrote chapters 1-5 and appendix A. Later I attended a 1-week training course at StatSci, the creator of S-PLUS, in Seattle, WA in 1993. And I have been using S-PLUS and R ever since, but not as continuously as I hoped. I&rsquo;m still using <em>Statistical Methods with S</em> as a reference, and I also purchased Chamber&rsquo;s <em>Programming with Data: a Guide to the S Language</em> (1998) and <em>Software for Data Analysis: Programming with R</em> (2008). I briefly met Chambers at the 2014 useR! Conference at UCLA and asked about how to obtain data sets from <em>Statistical Methods with S</em>, but he told me they are now property of TIBCO, the current owners of S-PLUS - blocked again! [Strangely, at least to me, while cleaning up files on my PC, I found artifacts from the 2001 S-PLUS conference I attended in Philadelphia, PA, and I discovered that John Chambers was an invited speaker, but I have no recollection of that.]</p>\n\n<p>Many years later, finding and reading &ldquo;Greater or Lesser Statistics: A Choice for Future Research&rdquo; (1993) based on Donoho&rsquo;s inclusion in &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science,&rdquo; a theme emerged of dividing statistics into two groups:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Greater Statistics: everything related to <em>learning from data</em>, from the first planning or collection to the last presentation or report</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Lesser Statistics: the body of specifically statistical methodology that has evolved with the profession - roughly, statistics as defined by texts, journals, and doctoral dissertations</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This puts a name on Tukey&rsquo;s 1962 recommendation to reduce focus on theory - Lesser Statistics - and increase focus on the entire data analysis process - Greater Statistics. Chambers cautioned, &ldquo;If statisticians remain aloof, others will act. Statistics will lose.&rdquo; This is happening now.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"leo-breiman\">Leo Breiman</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman\">Leo Breiman</a> was referenced in &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science&rdquo; for his 2001 paper &ldquo;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.&rdquo; This paper has been continually referenced in Internet posts since it was published. Breiman was a professor at UCLA, then a consultant, then a professor again at UC Berkeley, where he worked with Donoho. As I recall, I first heard his name in 1988, when I was a co-op statistician and assigned to a cube that had the 1984 book <em>Classification and Regression Trees</em> (CART) by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone sitting on its shelf. I scanned the book and was fascinated by its potential to use the data itself to discover relationships hidden in multivariate data. So I asked around and learned that the company received the book when they purchased the CART software. I investigated how to run it on a time share computer, tried to recreate an example with available data, but nothing happened - I received no output or feedback on errors or file location. So I called IT support, explained the situation, and was mentally crushed after being told they didn&rsquo;t support the software and could not help me. I was beginning to spot a trend: whenever statistical software was involved, there was rarely support from IT. So I had to learn to figure out how to install statistical software myself or give up if I didn&rsquo;t have system administration rights. I needed a Statistician&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer\">Serenity Prayer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Around ten years after discovering CART and being blocked from using it, a former professor of mine recommended <em>Modern Applied Statistics with S</em> (MASS) by Bill Venables and Brian Ripley. I immediately bought it (Second Edition at that time), and it quickly become my &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; and I bought the Third and Fourth Editions as soon as they were published. Because of MASS, I learned about the <code>tree</code> method and cross-validation to do something similar to CART. I started using <code>tree</code> whenever I could to see if it would identify explanatory variables or interactions. I also learned about Alternating Conditional Expectations (ACE) by Breiman from MASS, and I often applied it, along with the Additivity And Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method, to messy data sets to find transformations that provide a better fit to the data. Due to a great deal of luck, involving the reputation of Bill Meeker at Iowa State University being one of the keynote speakers, I was able to attend the 2001 S-PLUS conference in Philadelphia, PA. As soon as I received authorization to register, I signed up for Brian Ripley&rsquo;s Data Mining tutorial, and took advantage of the opportunity to pick his brain about topics in MASS. When I started to ask about <code>tree</code>, he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that - it&rsquo;s flawed. Use <code>rpart</code> instead.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The very next day, I attended a tutorial by Frank Harrell and met Beth Atkinson, the co-developer of <code>rpart</code> with Terry Therneau. Even today, the CRAN page for <code>rpart</code> states it is, &ldquo;An implementation of most of the functionality of the 1984 book by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone.&rdquo; Based on Ripley&rsquo;s advice, I have used <code>rpart</code> ever since, and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say I&rsquo;ve used CART for the last 17 years, but I wish it was longer.</p>\n\n<p>When &ldquo;Statistical Modeling: the Two Cultures&rdquo; was published in 2001 and kept popping up in Internet posts, I knew I had to read it. I learned that Breiman was involved in the development of several other techniques, like Bagging and Boosting. But I assume Donoho included this paper in &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science&rdquo; because Bremen recommend statisticians focus less on theory and more on data, like Tukey did 40 years earlier. But Breimen was far more explicit than Turkey when he stated &ldquo;98% of all statisticians&rdquo; belong to the Data Modeling Culture (similar to Chamber&rsquo;s Lesser Statistics) and &ldquo;2% of statisticians, many in other fields&rdquo; belong to The Algorithmic Modeling Culture (similar to Chamber&rsquo;s Greater Statistics), and that imbalance resulted in three major opportunity costs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Led to irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Kept statisticians from using more suitable algorithmic models</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Prevented statisticians from working on exciting new problems</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726\">&ldquo;A Conversation with Leo Breiman&rdquo;</a>, and he was even more explicit when asked to give advice to students studying statistics:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I&rsquo;m torn in a way because what I might even tell them is, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go into statistics,&rdquo; My feeling is, to some extent, that academic statistics may have lost its way&hellip; but probably in the end, I would say, &ldquo;Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting and important real world problems.&rdquo;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure sounds like Data Science to me.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-cleveland\">Bill Cleveland</h2>\n\n<p>Like John Chambers, I was introduced to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Cleveland\">Bill Cleveland</a> from <em>Graphical Methods for Data Analysis</em> (GMDA) and <em>Statistical Models with S</em>, where he co-wrote Chapter 8: Local Regression Models. And his papers were often referenced in Edward Tufte&rsquo;s visualization books with respect to pie charts and small multiples. I emailed him sometime after 2001 to ask about data sets to reproduce examples in GMDA. He didn&rsquo;t have the data sets available but recommended his other books <em>Visualizing Data</em> (1993) and <em>The Elements of Graphing Data</em> (1994), where the data sets were available on his web page. So I purchased them both and read <em>The Elements of Graphing Data</em> cover-to-cover, thanks to Andrew Gelman making his <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/communication_course_outline.pdf\">Communicating Data and Statistics course syllabus</a> available online. And as a S-PLUS user since 1993, I used Trellis graphics whenever base graphics were insufficient and then used the <strong>lattice</strong> version after switching to R (but I use <code>ggplot2</code> for most graphics now). And I use loess/lowess all the time, especially now with <strong>ggplot2</strong> <code>geom_smooth()</code> making it so easy.</p>\n\n<p>Cleveland worked at Bell Labs with Tukey, Chambers and Donoho (as an undergrad student at Princeton), then he moved to Purdue University, which I only discovered when I was wandering the halls of their statistics department circa 2012, and found him in his office. I made it a point to check if he was available every time I visited Purdue for a project I managed there and had a few face-to-face conversations. Around the same time I attended the 2012 useR! Conference at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, and attended the RHIPE tutorial. Cleveland was gracious with his time and offered support to help me use RHIPE on a Linux cluster, but once again, I was blocked by IT.</p>\n\n<p>Cleveland&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics&rdquo; was published in 2001, like Breiman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Statistical Modeling&rdquo; paper. The title alone qualifies it as landmark paper in the evolution of the term &ldquo;Data Science.&rdquo; I must have read it around the time it was published, because I found it in a folder of my 2001 S-PLUS conference artifacts while cleaning up file cabinets around 2010. But since I had no recollection, the term must not have resonated with me at that time; however, I had already re-read it several times before &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science&rdquo; was published. More than helping to establish the term <em>Data Science</em>, the paper&rsquo;s six technical areas and recommended time allocations define the discipline better than other sources, which mostly list skills, not tasks:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Multidisciplinary Investigations: data analysis collaborations in a collection of subject matter areas (25%)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Models and Methods for Data: statistical models; methods of model building; methods of estimation and distribution based on probabilistic inference (20%)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Computing with Data: hardware systems; software systems; computational algorithms (15%)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Pedagogy: curriculum planning and approaches to teaching for elementary school, secondary school, college, graduate school, continuing education, and corporate training (15%)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Tool Evaluation: surveys of tools in use in practice, surveys of perceived needs for new tools, and studies of the processes for developing new tools (5%)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Theory: foundations of data science; general approaches to models and methods, to computing with data, to teaching, and to tool evaluation; mathematical investigations of models and methods, of computing with data, of teaching, and of evaluation (20%)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of my Data Scientist job responsibilities can be mapped into those six areas, and I have used them to define my goals and time allocations whenever possible (still a work in progress). So in that respect, it has greatly influenced my life, surely more than any other paper, book, class, conference, tutorial, or workshop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"closing-comments\">Closing Comments</h2>\n\n<p>Data Science - I could not put my finger on it until I read &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science.&rdquo; In retrospect, it was my reasoning for studying math and statistics instead of &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; sciences, hypothesizing that solving future, complex problems would require analysis of large, multivariate data sets, not just theory and logic; however, I could never fully articulate my thoughts to myself, let alone others. And &ldquo;50 Years of Data Science&rdquo; helped me realize that my Data Science journey parallels my statistical programming journey from S to S-PLUS to R over the last 30 years - with excursions for Pascal, Fortran, Ratfor, SAS, C, VBA for Excel, Minitab, and Statistica. For me, Data Science and S/S-PLUS/R are intertwined, inseparable.</p>\n\n<p>Around 20 years ago, I attended a seminar by a well-known industrial statistician whose main message was that to be a better statistician, one should learn more about other fields. I took that advice to heart - maybe too much - and spent years and years learning more about engineering, business, and finance, hoping that would help me &ldquo;get my foot in the door&rdquo; and apply statistics to a wider variety of problems, or, as Tukey put it, get <a href=\"http://ww2.amstat.org/about/statisticiansinhistory/index.cfm?fuseaction=biosinfo&amp;BioID=14\">to play in everyone&rsquo;s backyard</a>. But that never happened (a topic for another post?). And given my limited time and attention span, I neglected continuing to learn what I really enjoyed: math, statistics, and programming. In retrospect, this was bad advice, at least for me. I now realize I should have learned MORE math, statistics, and programming, and that would have enabled me to contribute more to other fields by applying advanced statistical techniques to solve problems, rather than knowing more about other fields and applying generic, basic statistical techniques. I now wish I had learned that about myself much, much sooner.</p>\n\n<p>Data Science is not a fad; it is a long evolution of statistical practice, what statistics should have been if &ldquo;we&rdquo; listened to Tukey 50 years ago. It took 50 years for Tukey&rsquo;s ideas to become mainstream. And because the statistics community did not lead, as Chambers warned in 1993, others have assumed control. I saw this coming based on my experiences with Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma, and I hoped Data Science would be different, but it seems to be too late. Personally, however, it has been a huge benefit. When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse of the future out of the corner of my eye. With so many distractions, bad advice, and being blocked by Information Technology, I often just gave up and coasted along. Thanks to Data Science, I have new motivation and renewed energy to purse what I enjoy - and avoided becoming comfortably numb.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/25-years-of-data-science/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c83632c20eb8643c82f4018f75b540db","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Anonymous","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973509},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Don't Use Spaces or Underscores in File Paths; Use Dashes Instead","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/space-pain/","description":"\n        <p>Recently I received a few bug reports about the PDF generation in R Markdown. Eventually I figured out one of the reasons: spaces in filenames. For example, in <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1285\">rstudio/rmarkdown#1285</a>, <code>xelatex</code> failed to compile the <code>.tex</code> file because there was a space in a folder name (but <code>pdflatex</code> succeeded). From this issue, you can also see how many replies it takes to get <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/09/the-minimal-reprex-paradox/\">a reproducible example</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I had been bothered by spaces for long enough before (not only in LaTeX), so I had developed a habit of not using spaces in any of my filenames. When I need to separate words, I always use dashes (<code>-</code>) instead of other characters such as underscores (<code>_</code>) or dots (<code>.</code>). I have no idea why spaces are bad in file paths in LaTeX. In HTML, spaces in file paths are often encoded to <code>%20</code>. In command line, when a path contains spaces, it has to be quoted (e.g., <code>rm &quot;abc def.txt&quot;</code>). For underscores, they are special characters in LaTeX (e.g., in the math mode, an underscore indicates a subscript). By comparison, dashes are much safer everywhere, and they are not special characters in HTML or LaTeX.</p>\n\n<p>For the same reason, I always recommend <strong>knitr</strong> and R Markdown users to use dashes in chunk labels instead of spaces or underscores, e.g., this is good:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">```{r, hello-world, fig.width=8}\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These could be bad chunk labels:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">```{r, hello world, fig.width=8}\n```\n\n```{r, hello_world, fig.width=8}\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Chunk labels will be used to name figure files (if any plots are generated in the code chunk), so you have to use more portable characters in the labels. Usually I only use letters a-z, A-Z, numbers 0-9, and dashes. If your code chunk won&rsquo;t generate any plots, it should not matter which characters you used in the label, and <strong>knitr</strong> itself puts no restrictions on that.</p>\n\n<p>Sigh.

I still don&rsquo;t know much about them today, but I have had enough pain. At RStudio, I have become the (self-nominated) &ldquo;Character Encoding Ambassador&rdquo;, mainly because I&rsquo;m the only native Chinese in the company, and Chinese characters are multibyte. It is common that problems related to character encodings are reported by Chinese users. If we can fix these problems, chances are problems for other languages will disappear at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>The default <code>knitr::knit(..., encoding = getOption(&quot;encoding&quot;))</code> was the biggest mistake in <strong>knitr</strong> in retrospect. Now I regret and hate it day and night. I used this default encoding because it is what all base R functions do when reading or writing files. For example, take a look at the help page <code>?file</code>. The default means the system native encoding (<code>native.enc</code>), which is <em>a total mess</em> on Windows. Different languages have different default character encodings (e.g., Simplified Chinese uses <code>GBK</code>). On *nix, the default encoding is often UTF-8.</p>\n\n<p>If Windows didn&rsquo;t introduce all these different encodings, I think half of programmers in the world could spend three months on the beach enjoying the sunshine every year. FWIW, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matarillo/status/931050504779526145\">I have heard rumors</a> about the UTF-8 support in a certain future version of Windows. Even with that, I guess it will take several more years to clean up the mess.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://utf8everywhere.org\">UTF-8 works everywhere</a>, but it takes courage for software developers to force Windows users to use UTF-8. Over the years, I have been admiring the decision of Pandoc&rsquo;s author, John MacFarlane: UTF-8 in, and UTF-8 out. Most other software packages chose to compromise to the system native encoding by default. The compromise brings endless headache to developers, but the gain for users is at most marginal, if not nil. If users are forced to use UTF-8 consistently, the life of developers will be much easier, and the hassle for users is actually minimal: users only need to choose the UTF-8 encoding when reading or saving a file. Actually if the file editor gives users an option to set the encoding globally, the hassle will be none. For example, in RStudio, you can set the default text encoding to UTF-8:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/48278362-e3f79d00-e412-11e8-8d53-be409861928f.png\" alt=\"Set UTF-8 as the default encoding in RStudio\" /></p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, if you haven&rsquo;t set this option on Windows, I won&rsquo;t be your friend.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t use a language with multibyte characters, you probably won&rsquo;t feel the pain. This issue has wasted us so much time, as <a href=\"https://shrektan.com/post/2018/05/07/cant-bear-with-encoding-any-longer/\">Xianying Tan wrote</a> earlier this year (in Chinese). He has been trying to fix these encoding problems in various R packages like myself in the past, e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/trestletech/plumber/pull/312\">in <strong>plumber</strong></a>, <strong>roxygen2</strong>, <strong>devtools</strong>, <strong>data.table</strong>, <strong>odbc</strong>, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Both <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>rmarkdown</strong> default to the native encoding due to my initial blind decision, but since <strong>bookdown</strong>, I have started enforcing UTF-8. All of <strong>bookdown</strong>, <strong>blogdown</strong>, <strong>xaringan</strong>, <strong>tinytex</strong>,and my packages since 2016 only support UTF-8 based on two simple helper functions in the <strong>xfun</strong> package: <code>xfun::read_utf8()</code> and <code>xfun::write_utf8()</code>. Before then, I was a little worried if this would offend any users. The fact is, I haven&rsquo;t received any complaints about UTF-8 in these packages.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to write a package that involves file input/output, I&rsquo;d strongly recommend that you support, and only support UTF-8. The UTF-8 assumption can save you a lot of time guessing and debugging.</p>\n\n<p>Someday I&rsquo;ll force <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>rmarkdown</strong> into the UTF-8 world, too (perhaps in <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>rmarkdown</strong> v2.0), but this will certainly take a long time to happen.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/biggest-regret-knitr/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/48278362-e3f79d00-e412-11e8-8d53-be409861928f.png","linkMd5":"58bde1f466eced05645b6db6b3340f91","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-33-686_62a9d17b710a38d6.webp","destWidth":596,"destHeight":589,"sourceBytes":43070,"destBytes":22998,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/48278362-e3f79d00-e412-11e8-8d53-be409861928f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-19-33-686_62a9d17b710a38d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973443},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Down?

It was a great read to me (I&rsquo;d rate it as the best post so far in Simply Statistics this year). In particular, the &ldquo;user-developer&rdquo; spectrum struck me. It didn&rsquo;t surprise me, but I had never consciously thought about this notion. Clearly, the R ecosystem has been moving to the user&rsquo;s end on the spectrum, and Tidyverse is an outstanding example. To understand <code>tapply()</code>, you have to wear a programmer&rsquo;s shoes. To understand <code>group_by()</code>, you pretty much only need to understand English.</p>\n\n<p>This reminds me of LaTeX v.s. Markdown (I wish I had more time to update <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2013/10/markdown-or-latex/\">an old post I wrote in 2013</a>). An analogy to the &ldquo;user-developer spectrum&rdquo; is the &ldquo;<em>author-typesetter spectrum</em>&ldquo;: Markdown tends to make you an author, and LaTeX tends to turn you into a typesetter. Although I have been preaching Markdown, I found a couple of months ago that I had never been able to explain the philosophy better than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jent103/status/998440668484722688\">Jennifer Thompson</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdssM0XV0AIR0C5.jpg#border\" alt=\"A tweet by Jennifer Thompson on the Markdown philosophy\" /></p>\n\n<p>Markdown is for 90% of the results from 10% of the effort. Very well said.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mean a certain end on the spectrum is wrong. There is nothing wrong with a programming or authoring language being designed for developers or typesetters. There is nothing wrong if you want more control, as long as you think it is worth your time. Different people have different priorities. I just happen to prefer the user/author&rsquo;s end on the spectrum, based on the belief that the number of users is almost surely much larger than that of developers. I enjoy my own life as a developer, but I don&rsquo;t think most other users want to do the same thing as I do every day.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite/status/1017773947360874497\">John Myles White was skeptical</a> about a few points in Roger&rsquo;s post. One of his doubts was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also find this odd: &ldquo;If R seems a bit confusing, disorganized, and perhaps incoherent at times, in some ways that&rsquo;s because so is data analysis.&rdquo; If anything, the reason tidyverse succeeded was precisely because it wasn&rsquo;t incoherent, but that didn&rsquo;t make it worse for analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I tend to agree with John that R was incoherent not because data analysis was so. My theory is that R does not have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life\">BDFL</a>, and perhaps features/changes in base R are not implemented as pull requests (I&rsquo;m not really sure; maybe they have something similar in SVN). Besides, I guess most active R core developers are more on the developer&rsquo;s end of the spectrum. The Tidyverse does not have a nominal BDFL, either, but we all know &ldquo;one of these developers is not like others&rdquo;. He cares deeply, deeply about data analysis, and has simple yet sound frameworks for data analysis (e.g., Tidy Data). I think that should explain the much better coherence.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, Python&rsquo;s BDFL <a href=\"https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html\">just chose to step down yesterday</a> after an exhausting fight over <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/\">a proposal</a>. I wonder what this will mean to the development of Python.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/user-developer/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdssM0XV0AIR0C5.jpg#border","linkMd5":"298582bd41947b7b253f1e61f86aca02","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-35-226_274c2a64ca4e5687.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":899,"sourceBytes":106259,"destBytes":69100,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdssM0XV0AIR0C5.jpg#border":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-19-35-226_274c2a64ca4e5687.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973459},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Things are Getting Better and Better","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/getting-better/","description":"<p>Last month <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_R_Foundation/status/1050791571514413057\">I suddently learned</a> that the R Core Team started a blog earlier this year.

That was so open-minded. If I were not so satisfied with my current job, I would…</p></li> \n <li><p>I have talked about Stack Overflow a few times in my blog. I still see users who are reluctant or afraid to ask questions there, but I believe it is becoming a lot better than before. When <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/08/07/get-to-know-our-new-code-of-conduct/\">their new Code of Conduct was published</a> in August, I stood up and applauded for ten minutes in front of my computer. Is it a perfect place for Q&amp;A now? Of course not, but there is no point of pursuing perfectionism, and it is not possible for a site with so many users, either. All I need to see is the desire to keep improving, which I have already seen. There are still people who downvote without explanations or vote to close an appropriate question, but now I can feel the positive energy from other people when I complain:</p> <p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/53064555/559676\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/48227387-d33e1d00-e367-11e8-857f-dfdc0620acce.png#border\" alt=\"People upvoting my comment on a post that was downvoted inappropriately\" /></a></p></li> \n <li><p>One of my life dreams has been (more or less) fulfilled: making it easier for students to write dissertations with R Markdown and <strong>bookdown</strong>. As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://community.rstudio.com/t/16394\">the announcement of the <strong>bookdown</strong> contest winners</a>, I was excited to see <a href=\"https://github.com/ryanpeek/aggiedown/network/members\">a network graph</a> like this on Github:</p> <p><img src=\"https://community.rstudio.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fe99e9903e1c7ffc1c0b2c85518fc45fd8b13013.png\" alt=\"The network graph of the thesisdown package\" /></p> <p>At the same time, publishers seem to be more and more willing to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StatGarrett/status/1052642829745496064\">allow authors to host free versions of their books online</a>. As I said in an earlier post, I believe <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/bookdown-crc/\">we could tear down the paywall</a>. Just like any other revolutions in history, it takes time and requires patience.</p></li> \n <li><p>This is really old news, but I still want to mention it. I <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/commit/b5ef66b7a\">started experimenting</a> with other languages in <strong>knitr</strong> in 2012, and added a TODO item for the Python support. Five years later, thanks to my genius colleague Kevin Ushey,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:If-only-I-had-mo\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/getting-better/#fn:If-only-I-had-mo\">2</a></sup>\n   <!-- --> <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/knitr/commit/b2d892974\">the dream had finally become true</a> and I was able to remove the five-year-old TODO. I’d say that the pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/pull/107\">rstudio/reticulate#107</a> was one of the most important PRs for <strong>knitr</strong> in its history, not to mention how awesome the <strong>reticulate</strong> package itself is.</p></li> \n <li><p>I feel the “tyranny of email” eventually started to go away from my inbox. This year I have received multiple emails telling me that they knew <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/\">I wanted them to</a> ask questions on public forums such as Stack Overflow or RStudio Community, so they did so before emailing me with the links to their questions in the public. I really appreciate it. Even prestigious and busy professors like Dr. Frank Harrell <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/48208457/559676\">would ask questions on Stack Overflow</a> instead of emailing me. How cool is that?</p></li> \n <li><p>As I mentioned recently, Rmd files will no longer be rendered as normal Markdown to HTML on Github. Github will display Rmd files in their source format (i.e., plain text). I had been waiting for this for a couple of years. It seemed that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yutannihilat_en/status/1053877401606742018\">I didn’t</a> annoy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/datavisitor/status/1054800395019513856\">too many users</a>. Or perhaps people who hated it didn’t want to speak up… BTW, when Github was acquired by Microsoft a few months ago, I felt an earthquake in the world of programmers. I don’t want to comment on this, but at least it turned out that I was able to contact Github through <code>support@github.com</code> and they were stilling listening. The world probably didn’t become worse.</p></li> \n <li><p>The list could go on and on, but I want to stop here by mentioning the most inspiring post of the year in my eyes: <a href=\"http://hookedondata.org/The-Importance-of-Sponsorship/\"><em>The Importance of Sponsorship</em></a>, written by Emily Robinson nine months ago. If everyone (senior or not) in the community (tech or not) could read this post and follow its suggestions, I believe the world will become better much more quickly, with people of all levels growing more quickly.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>In summary, all the worlds of the academia, Stack Overflow, Github, college students, book authors/readers, R users who also use Python, and myself<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Recently-my-olde\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/getting-better/#fn:Recently-my-olde\">3</a></sup> are becoming better. Of course, there are always challenging problems to be solved ahead. We shall calm down and carry on.</p> \n<div class=\"footnotes\"> \n <hr /> \n <ol> \n  <li id=\"fn:Unfortunately-th\">Unfortunately they chose to host a GIT server by themselves.

I don&rsquo;t think so. Compared with the endless and huge trouble caused by timezones, the benefit of the sun reaching its zenith at 12pm is just nothing. Australians don&rsquo;t change the months (otherwise it would lead to &ldquo;month-zones&rdquo;) to make sure the summer always starts in June. Why do different areas of the world have to change their time to match the position of the sun? I&rsquo;d be totally fine if the noon is at 3am in my place. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be so much nicer if when we say a time, it is the same time across the globe? No more calculating &ldquo;local&rdquo; times or adjusting clocks.

I want to share some of my relatively simple JS tricks to fill the gaps. Please note that I&rsquo;m only talking about the HTML output, and the Markdown flavor can be arbitrary (it doesn&rsquo;t have to be Pandoc&rsquo;s Markdown). In fact, all tricks below are general-purpose and will work on any web pages, no matter if the pages are generated from Markdown or not.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-work-with-mathjax\">How to work with MathJax</h2>\n\n<p>The MathJax support in most Markdown flavors is missing. The only exception is Pandoc&rsquo;s Markdown. If you use R Markdown (which is based on Pandoc), you can ignore this trick. I have explained my trick of making MathJax work with any flavors of Markdown in detail <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/latex-math-markdown/\">in a previous post</a>. The relevant JS code is in <a href=\"https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/static/js/math-code.js\">math-code.js</a> on my website. This is the most complicated trick in this post, although it is only 20 lines of code.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-links-open-in-new-tabs-i-e-target-blank\">How to make links open in new tabs (i.e., <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code>)</h2>\n\n<p>Most Markdown renderers translate <code>[text](url)</code> to <code>&lt;a href=&quot;url&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;</code>, which means links will be opened in the current tab or window. I have explained my trick of <a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/target-blank/\">making links open in new tabs</a> in a previous post, too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-add-anchor-links-to-section-headings\">How to add anchor links to section headings</h2>\n\n<p>When a page has mutiple sections, it can be very helpful to generate an anchor link for each section heading, because we can send other people the links to specific sections. Basically, we just need to add an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag inside a heading with the attribute <code>href</code> pointing to the ID of the heading:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">(function() {\n  var h, hs = document.querySelectorAll('h1, h2, h3');\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; hs.length; i++) {\n    h = hs[i];\n    if (h.id === '') continue;\n    h.innerHTML += ' &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#' + h.id +\n      '&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;';\n  }\n})();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can hide the anchor links by default, and show them only when the mouse is over a heading:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.anchor {\n  display: none;\n}\n:hover &gt; .anchor {\n  display: inline;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-generate-tooltips-for-images\">How to generate tooltips for images</h2>\n\n<p>Images on the web often have an <code>alt</code> attribute, which stands for &ldquo;alternate text&rdquo;. This is often invisible to readers <em>without</em> vision problems, but important for users who have to use screen readers (such as blind people). Without the <code>alt</code> text, they will have no idea what an image means. The text is also displayed with the image cannot be loaded.</p>\n\n<p>Since this attribute is invisible to users with the normal vision, it actually also has a problem. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t know what exactly the author tries to express just by looking at an image. You may have a better idea by reading the text. You could right click on the image, &ldquo;Inspect Element&rdquo;, and look at the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in the source, but that&rsquo;s a bit hassle and not everyone knows how the use the Developer Tools of modern web browsers.</p>\n\n<p>My trick is to add the <code>title</code> attribute to <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> (if not already specified), whose value is identical to the <code>alt</code> text. The <code>title</code> attribute will give you a tooltip, which you can read as you mouseover the image. XKCD is a typical example. The code <a href=\"https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/static/js/alt-title.js\">alt-title.js</a> is simple enough:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">(function() {\n  var img, imgs = document.getElementsByTagName('img');\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; imgs.length; i++) {\n    img = imgs[i];\n    if (!img.title) img.title = img.alt;\n  }\n})();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An example:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://db.yihui.org/images/thick-book.jpg\" alt=\"Trying to figure out the possible reasons why my girlfriend is angry\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note that with Pandoc&rsquo;s Markdown, you can generate figure captions, so the tooltips may not be necessary. With other Markdown flavors, <code>![text](url)</code> is often translated to <code>&lt;img src=&quot;url&quot; alt=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-center-images-in-paragraphs\">How to center images in paragraphs</h2>\n\n<p>When an image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) is the only child element of a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>), chances are you want to center it. Except with Pandoc&rsquo;s Markdown, you cannot really align images with Markdown syntax. I have written a JS script <a href=\"https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/static/js/center-img.js\">center-img.js</a> to automatically center images on web pages. It is slightly tricky because I considered both of these cases:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!-- Markdown: ![](...) --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Markdown: [![](...)](...) --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also considered centering <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, although these elements are rarer in Markdown&rsquo;s output (no native Markdown syntax for them).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-right-align-quote-footers\">How to right-align quote footers</h2>\n\n<p>If you need to use quotes in Markdown, everything will be left-aligned by default, but you may want the footer (the source of the quote or the person who said the words) to be right-aligned.</p>\n\n<p>My trick, <a href=\"https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/static/js/right-quote.js\">right-quote.js</a>, is to check the last paragraph of a quote. If it starts with the em-dash (&mdash;), I&rsquo;ll apply the CSS style <code>text-aligh: right;</code> to it. Here  is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">&gt; UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things,\n&gt; as that would also stop them from doing clever things.\n\n&gt; --- Doug Gwyn\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things,\nas that would also stop them from doing clever things.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Doug Gwyn</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a JavaScript expert. My code above may be naive and inefficient. I have found JavaScript a lot of fun to play with, even only with selectors like <code>document.getElementsByTagName()</code> or <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> and simple for-loops. I used to think I couldn&rsquo;t live without fancy libraries like jQuery, but later realized vanilla JavaScript could actually do a lot of things. I hope these tricks could be useful to web amateurs like me.</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.org/en/2018/11/md-js-tricks/';</script>\n        \n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":13021,"bgimg":"https://db.yihui.org/images/thick-book.jpg","linkMd5":"e676309a101719fac86642b691fda333","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-19-34-016_2602a368fe52315c.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":634,"sourceBytes":44594,"destBytes":33992,"author":"Yihui Xie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://db.yihui.org/images/thick-book.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-19-34-016_2602a368fe52315c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321973457},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:19:33","title":"Naming Software Packages with Common Words","link":"https://yihui.org/en/2019/04/naming-common-words/","description":"\n        <p>Andrew Gelman <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/04/29/we-shouldntve-called-it-stan-i-shouldve-listened-to-bob-and-hadley/\">regretted the name &ldquo;Stan&rdquo;</a>, because it is a common word, which makes it hard to find relevant results on Google. Actually I was taught the same lesson by Hadley when I first created the <strong>knitr</strong> package in 2011. Fortunately I listened. In the very beginning, I simply named it &ldquo;knit&rdquo;, which is certainly not very &ldquo;Googleable&rdquo;. Appending &ldquo;R&rdquo; after it made it much easier and &ldquo;neater&rdquo; to search through Google. In the early years, I had a couple of other packages named after common words, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/animation\"><strong>animation</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/yihui/fun\"><strong>fun</strong></a>. These packages were obviously difficult to find via Google, although on the other hand, I guess they are not really important packages, so users won&rsquo;t think of finding them.</p>\n\n<p>In the following years, I tried to stick to this rule of using unique words when naming packages, e.g., <strong>bookdown</strong>, <strong>blogdown</strong>, <strong>xaringan</strong>, and <strong>tinytex</strong>. There is no ambiguity for these packages in Google results now. When I started working on <strong>pagedown</strong> last year, I spent some time on searching for different names on Google, and initially decided to use the name <strong>leafdown</strong>, because it seemed to be unique enough, and &ldquo;leaf&rdquo; also has the meaning of &ldquo;page&rdquo;. The first name that came to my mind was actually <strong>pagedown</strong>, because it was such an obvious choice (an R Markdown package for paged documents). I didn&rsquo;t want to use this name for the obvious reason. However, JJ suggested that I go with the name <strong>pagedown</strong>. His defense was from the experience of &ldquo;Shiny&rdquo;. Shiny is such a common word, yet after a couple of years, Google started to put our Shiny <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=shiny\">on the first page of search results</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before I made <strong>pagedown</strong> public on Github, there was another <strong>pagedown</strong> project from StackExchange on Github. I though I&rsquo;d never be able to compete with StackExchange in the Google search. To my great surprise, our <strong>pagedown</strong> became the first item in the Google search results within three months!</p>\n\n<p>A much more extreme example is the <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/DT\"><strong>DT</strong></a> package. The name is only two letters. I&rsquo;d never imagine it could be found via Google. However, even with the two letters, <strong>DT</strong> has made its way to the first page of Google search results.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the new lesson learned here is that a common word as a software package name is probably fine, but you&rsquo;d better avoid words related to the pop culture or the entertainment industry. If you search for a word on Google and Google shows you YouTube videos or images, it is likely to be a bad idea.</p>\n\n        \n
