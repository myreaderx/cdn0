Seven of the top 10 highest-grossing films released in the United States last year were distributed by the House of Mouse, and hundreds of millions of people went to see them on thousands of screens. Some weeks it felt like the entire film industry <em>was</em> Disney: <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/captain-marvel-review-the-hero-we-and-marvel-studios-need-right-now/\">Captain Marvel</a></em> and the rest of the Avengers (<em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/\">Endgame</a></em>) competed for your attention for a while, as <em>Aladdin</em>, <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/lion-king-remake-review-roaring-visuals-but-the-execution-is-a-hairball/\">The Lion King</a></em>, and <em>Toy Story 4</em> kept up a steady drumbeat of animation until Elsa dropped back onto hapless households in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/review-frozen-ii-is-fun-family-fare-with-stunning-visuals-and-so-so-soundtrack/\">Frozen II</a></em>. In amongst that morass, though, there were still other movies shown, many of them popular with audiences and critics alike.</p>\n<p>But now, the rule that prevented a studio from buying up a major theater chain is gone—opening up the possibility that your local cinema could go whole hog and become a true Disneyplex before you know it.</p>\n<p>On Friday, a federal judge agreed to the Department of Justice's petition to vacate the Paramount Consent Decrees, a landmark 1948 ruling that forbade vertical integration in the film sector and ended the Hollywood <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/The-Hollywood-studio-system\">studio system</a>. In isolation, the decision could raise some concerns. In a world where theaters are decimated thanks to a pandemic and consolidation among media firms is already rampant, the future for independent theaters looks grim.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697598#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697598&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 10:30:01 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/disney-theater-popcorn-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"f313b34a67d39c8343044c95d21dd7d2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-42-58-748_6f3c4fb2b6341e7f.webp","author":"Kate Cox","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/disney-theater-popcorn-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-42-58-748_6f3c4fb2b6341e7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn48@2020_4/2020/08/11/15-43-43-594_41da09a91f52636f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/11/15-43-30-274_440dc582bcc5c3c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-43-09-990_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/11/15-43-28-357_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 23:42:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 23:42:58","title":"McDonald’s CEO sent nude photos of employees over work email, lawsuit says","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698135","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getty-mcdonalds-800x496.jpg\" alt=\"The McDonald's logo on the window of a store.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getty-mcdonalds.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1084\" data-width=\"1750\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The McDonald's logo at a restaurant on November 4, 2019 in New York City.

While several features for uploaded content aren't currently working in the free YouTube Music experience, we’re working hard to address these feature gaps and bring additional functionality to our free tier user. We look forward to sharing more updates soon.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While this is a bit vague, the shoutout for users of uploaded content is a change of tone from what the company was saying in June. Our YouTube Music article was mainly about the free-versus-premium feature changes in YouTube Music and Google Music, including the requirement of a monthly fee in order to play purchased and uploaded music on Google Home speakers. Before publishing that article, we double-checked with Google to ask if charging to use a Google Home from YouTube music was <em>really</em> what it was planning, and all the company would do is reaffirm the current restrictions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697652#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697652&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 10:45:46 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-800x394.jpg","linkMd5":"092443826ecfd7b5757cdfc910b22638","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/11/15-42-58-584_15ba1393810580df.webp","author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-800x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/11/15-42-58-584_15ba1393810580df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_4/2020/08/11/15-43-10-063_20a4ce2cf5f04099.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-43-10-059_eda6c00c90d3e908.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-43-09-990_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/11/15-43-28-357_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 23:42:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 23:42:58","title":"Independent testing confirms the Lucid Air has a range of 517 miles","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698132","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lucid-Air_Production_Driving_release-800x466.jpg\" alt=\"A Lucid Air prototype\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lucid-Air_Production_Driving_release.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1749\" data-width=\"3000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The Air looks superficially the same as when we saw it in 2017, but almost every body panel has changed.

The accelerometers in your phone make a passable-enough seismometer, and together with location data and enough users, you could detect earthquakes and warn users as the shocks roll across the landscape. The University of California-Berkeley, along with funding from the state of California, built an app called \"MyShake\" and a cheap, effective earthquake detection network was born, at least, it was born for people who installed the app.</p>\n<p>What if you didn't need to install the app? What if earthquake detection was just built in to the operating system? That's the question Google is going to answer, with today's announcement of the \"<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/earthquake-detection-and-alerts\">Android Earthquake Alerts System</a>.\" Google is going to build what it calls \"the world’s largest earthquake detection network\" by rolling earthquake detection out to nearly every Google Play Android phone. Here's the meat of the announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All smartphones come with tiny accelerometers that can sense earthquakes. They’re even sensitive enough to detect the P-wave, which is the first wave that comes out of an earthquake and is typically much less damaging than the S-wave which comes afterward. If the phone detects something that it thinks may be an earthquake, it sends a signal to our earthquake detection server, along with a coarse location of where the shaking occurred. The server then combines information from many phones to figure out if an earthquake is happening. We’re essentially racing the speed of light (which is roughly the speed at which signals from a phone travel) against the speed of an earthquake. And lucky for us, the speed of light is much faster!</p></blockquote>\n<p>That \"race\" often works out to only a minute or so of warning, but that's usually enough to duck and cover if you catch the notification.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698029#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698029&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 13:00:07 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-980x940.jpg","linkMd5":"41268a84e6c3945cfad506e76997494a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/11/15-42-58-950_5ad964491d8c83f9.webp","author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-980x940.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/11/15-42-58-950_5ad964491d8c83f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/11/15-43-10-081_7793635ba24e8d19.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/11/1597160590057_d217fb8df51f4646.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-43-09-990_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/11/15-43-28-357_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 23:42:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 23:42:58","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:42:58 +0000","fetchMs":123,"handleMs":1637,"totalMs":58638,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.72.204.18","hostName":"fierce-sierra-10390.herokuapp.com","requestId":"0164290b6e17459785f79f073a6afb50_2","bgimgsTotal":7,"bgimgsGithubTotal":7,"articlesImgsTotal":23,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":23},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 02:41:22","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn59@2020_1/2020/08/11/15-42-57-319_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
