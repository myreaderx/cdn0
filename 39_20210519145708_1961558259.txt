The late 1960s audio system still looks refreshingly contemporary today, representing an explorative era when consumer audiophiles hunger for space age designs touched almost every category of consumer goods. The newly unveiled <a href=\"https://syngspace.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Syng Cell Alpha</a> audio speaker immediately caught our eyes as a descendent of that iconic design era, one updated with the latest in audio technology and mobile connectivity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=448981\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-448981\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-448981\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_1_OfficeShotWithProduct-000350-RL-Edit_Final-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_1_OfficeShotWithProduct-000350-RL-Edit_Final-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_1_OfficeShotWithProduct-000350-RL-Edit_Final-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_1_OfficeShotWithProduct-000350-RL-Edit_Final-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_1_OfficeShotWithProduct-000350-RL-Edit_Final.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Cell Alpha is the brainchild of former Apple lead designer, Christopher Stringer, one of the creative minds who toiled from Cupertino to help develop many of the most iconic Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, MacBook and Apple Watch. Partnering with another ex-Apple audio engineer, Afrooz Family, alongside DC Shoes co-founder Damon Way, the trio&#8217;s ambitions were to design an &#8220;accessible&#8221; audio speaker capable of aurally and spatially inhabiting a room in ways no small wireless speaker could. Of course, &#8220;accessible&#8221; is a subjective adjective here, noting a pair of Cell Alpha speakers starts at $3,600 – not extraordinarily high within the realm of audiophile gear, but still a handsome sum for an equally handsome design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=448993\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-448993\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-448993\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Cell_Alpha_anatonmy-810x878.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Cell_Alpha_anatonmy-810x878.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Cell_Alpha_anatonmy-800x867.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Cell_Alpha_anatonmy-768x832.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Cell_Alpha_anatonmy.jpg 1215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Syng underlines their speaker benefits from the development of their own Triphonic driver technology, one engineered to produce a &#8220;clear, detailed&#8230;and fully immersive experience&#8221; using a trio of tweeters and mid-frequency drivers paired together and arranged in a ring for 360º output. Additionally two woofers are positioned both facing upward and toward the floor to serve lower frequencies, with three microphones perpetually monitoring spatial acoustics to automatically adapt output to the environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=448982\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-448982\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-448982\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_3_ProductShots-000931-RL_Final-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_3_ProductShots-000931-RL_Final-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_3_ProductShots-000931-RL_Final-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_3_ProductShots-000931-RL_Final-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_3_ProductShots-000931-RL_Final.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s obvious Syng&#8217;s ambitions here are not to compete with the numerous affordable standalone wireless speakers already available, even one as laudable as the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/homepod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">HomePod</a> which Syng&#8217;s Afrooz Family worked on, but realize a sound as immersive as a 7.1 setup using a three-element, two-way beamforming array.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=448980\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-448980\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-448980\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_11_LivingRoomProductShot-003234-RL_Final-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_11_LivingRoomProductShot-003234-RL_Final-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_11_LivingRoomProductShot-003234-RL_Final-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_11_LivingRoomProductShot-003234-RL_Final-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/011321_Syng_PL_11_LivingRoomProductShot-003234-RL_Final.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>A &#8220;Syng Space&#8221; iOS or Android app pairs speakers over 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, with Bluetooth used to set up each speaker.

/></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Instead of bringing over baked goods, bringing over plant cuttings has become the new norm. Cuttings are just that – cuttings from a plant that will grow new stems and/or roots, eventually turning into full-sized versions. They’re a great, cost-effective way to grow your collection of plants, or help someone else grow theirs. All you have to do is stick your plant cuttings in water and watch the roots or stems start to grow. Instead of a regular vase that might not properly hold your cutting, or a spaghetti jar that won’t look as good on your countertop, show off your cutting edge (pun intended) with a vessel designed specifically for propagating plants, like this <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/house-raccoon/products/lily-propagation-station\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">June Propagation Station</a> (short rounded version) or <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/house-raccoon/products/lily-propagation-station\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">Lily Propagation Station</a> (tall cylinder version) designed by Clémence van den Haute for <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/house-raccoon\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">House Raccoon</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/house-raccoon/products/june-propagation-station\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449058 noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-449058 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-6-810x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-6-810x1080.jpeg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-6-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-6-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-6-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-6.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_449068\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=449068\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449068\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-449068\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/plant-cuttings-propagation-810x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/plant-cuttings-propagation-810x1080.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/plant-cuttings-propagation-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/plant-cuttings-propagation-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/plant-cuttings-propagation-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/plant-cuttings-propagation.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A rainbow of fresh succulent cuttings gifted by a friend \\\\\\ Photo: Vy Yang</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/house-raccoon/products/june-propagation-station\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449063 noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-449063 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-11-810x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-11-810x1080.jpeg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-11-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-11-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-11-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/house-raccoon-june-propagation-station-design-milk-shop-11.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Both the June and Lily vessels can be used as propagation stations or as vases. The narrow opening ensures that your cutting can stand up right and the glass allows you to see the roots grow until you need to transfer your plant into a proper pot. Each one is made by hand in small batches at the House Racoon atelier in the heart of Antwerp in Belgium. Additionally, for every House Raccoon object you purchase, the brand partners will plant a tree to help restoration efforts all over the world through <a href=\"https://trees.org/\"

to Principal of Commune Design, Roman Alonso, who grew up in Caracas Venezuela, often traveling around in a motorhome with his family to escape to nature, before moving to Miami as a teenager. He attended Boston University, with the underlying fantasy of getting to New York. After college, he got a job at Barney’s in New York, wrote for the style section of The New York Times, and started a publishing company, Greybull Press. Commune was founded in 2004 in Los Angeles and since then Roman and partner Steven Johanknecht have grown it into a vibrant community of creatives, a Commune Shop, and impressive international hospitality projects, including many Ace Hotels, that have the adventurous, warm spirit Roman brings to everything he does.

I find these really help to give some ambiance to the office and create a vibe. Sometimes it’s chill house, sometimes it’s 90’s R&#38;B but there is always something on the playlist.</p>\n<p>I have gone to great lengths in ensure there is a residential vibe in our space. I did not want the office to feel too commercial, so the space is very warm and inviting.

Where did you work before that? </strong></p>\n<p>We just celebrated a year of being in our space, however, 6 months of this was for renovating the space and during a pandemic that was no small feat. Before being in this space I had a small 1200-square-foot office space just on the outskirts of downtown Calgary. We had outgrown that space for a quite a few years, but finding the right space proved to be quite challenging.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/where-i-work-aly-velji-of-alykhan-velji-design/where-i-work-alykhan-velji-11/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449457\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-449457\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11-810x1100.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1100\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11-810x1100.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11-800x1087.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11-768x1043.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11-1131x1536.jpg 1131w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>If you could change something about your workspace, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>One small change would be that we did not put outlets on the island! A simple and silly error which we would never do on a project, but for some reason, we missed it. It’s not the end of the world, but it happened, and it is a little funny when we look back at it. Nothing a little extension cord can’t fix!</p>\n<p><strong>Have you had to make any adjustments to how you work because of the pandemic?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, we couldn’t even work out of our office for the first while as we were on lockdown. When things started to open up again, we all could work but couldn’t have anyone in our office space, but now, clients are allowed to come in, wearing masks of course. The biggest adjustment would be that we have hand sanitizing areas around the office.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/where-i-work-aly-velji-of-alykhan-velji-design/where-i-work-alykhan-velji-15/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449461\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-449461\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15-810x1214.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1214\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15-810x1214.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15-800x1199.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>How do you see things changing in your workplace moving forward with COVID-19 now a part of our reality?</strong></p>\n<p>We are lucky in the fact that we haven’t had to make many big changes.

Sometimes I come in to work super early and sometimes I leave later than everyone else. It really depends on my mood and how much sleep I had the night before. I find it always helps when I am in the office working as sometimes I can get a little lazy working from home. I love being in my office space early in the morning before anyone else as I can have that moment of being grateful to be able to work in such an inspiring space.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your creative process and/or creative workflow like? Does it change every project or do you keep it the same?</strong></p>\n<p>I always like to have a creative brief for each project, no matter how big or small.

Once we do this, I think it helps the project flow in the right direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/where-i-work-aly-velji-of-alykhan-velji-design/where-i-work-alykhan-velji-12/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449458\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-449458\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-12-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-12-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-12-800x534.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-12.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What kind of art/design/objects might you have scattered about the space?</strong></p>\n<p>I have a mix of everything from items that I have found in my travels, vintage items, handmade items and art pieces from artists across Canada, photographs and prints.

I loved the organic forms and textures that are found with the use of concrete but added in natural inspired color palettes with terracottas, shades of blue, burnt yellows to give the collection some softness. We used the mural in our meeting room to give that space some life and it worked out very well!

The collection was made up of side tables, consoles, coffee tables, credenzas and some lighting and used brass, white-washed wood and incredible marbles as the materials. These pieces are scattered through my home and office. I was extremely proud of this collection.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/B-2FIH5C44E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 13:00:37 +0000","feedId":39,"bgimg":"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-0-810x540.jpg","linkMd5":"d2938854a3ddabed50c08bdea199a335","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-721_e83e515c287baec0.webp","destWidth":810,"destHeight":540,"sourceBytes":80679,"destBytes":58978,"author":"Caroline Williamson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-0-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-721_e83e515c287baec0.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-1-810x1190.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn20@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-34-717_c0fa47cf09c370a1.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-2-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn9@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-35-626_1d9c3e8032dace00.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-3-810x1214.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-264_f9e1cd0ade6a0e50.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-4-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn64@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-35-024_40e38a844fb333a6.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-5-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-35-441_85039718aea85421.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-6-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn6@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-35-553_97b21d6dd17c6004.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-11-810x1100.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn96@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-35-247_97acc87607f4d3c0.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-15-810x1214.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn87@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-34-853_0e7c6206c08d1647.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-14-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-35-415_f19808d6c46c2986.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-13-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-57-07-877_954ccc707b0fb45f.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-12-810x540.jpg":null,"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-10-810x1102.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-35-368_062bff3c22764d71.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-9-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-35-319_5c034f50adbf1e04.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-8-st-andrews-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-57-07-627_ef00ecacc0562c87.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Where-I-Work-Alykhan-Velji-7-810x540.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-35-379_850285b25be37fef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/B-2FIH5C44E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn80@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-34-234_20466efed86921d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161431},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"ULTRALEGGERA 1660 Is the World’s Lightest Chair","link":"https://design-milk.com/?p=449087","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/ultraleggera-1660-is-the-worlds-lightest-chair/ultraleggera-chair-photo-ada-gruszka-featured-image/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-Photo-Ada-Gruszka-Featured-Image-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"ULTRALEGGERA 1660 Is the World&#8217;s Lightest Chair\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It&#8217;s true, weighing in at a little over 1660 grams, <a href=\"https://www.zieta.pl/ultraleggera/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ULTRALEGGERA 1660</a> is currently the world’s lightest chair.

Its durable frame is made using FiDU technology and a laser-cut seat plus backrest. FiDU technology, uses air to force the metal to expand and deform according to its natural characteristics. Specially designed shapes are cut and welded together, then “inflated” with compressed air. Innovative FiDU is a material and energy-saving technology, helping to optimize material and energy consumption while minimizing waste.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=449092\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449092\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-449092\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-4-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"chairs and coffee table in living space\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-4-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-4.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=449094\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-449094\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-449094\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-7-810x1215.png\" alt=\"tables and chair in front of curtain\" width=\"810\" height=\"1215\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-7-810x1215.png 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-7-800x1200.png 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-7-768x1152.png 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-7-1024x1536.png 1024w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/05/Ultraleggera-Chair-7.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Zięta proved ULTRALEGGERA&#8217;s strength through two tests. The first was performed on a free-standing chair with a load of 500 kg., the second one immobilized the chair as it endured a load of 1208 kg.</p>\n<p>With stability, durability and simplicity as its main components, ULTRALEGGERA is timeless.
