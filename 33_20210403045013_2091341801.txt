And silent video is boring. But on the other hand, just making up sounds that spiders don’t actually make — I don’t know. I’ve posted about this before, regarding <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/02/how-the-bbc-made-planet-earth-ii\">a video series about how Planet Earth II was made</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I hope the third program is on sound, which has been bugging me while watching Planet Earth II. I could be wrong, but they seem to be using extensive foley effects for the sounds the animals make — not their cries necessarily, but the sounds they make as they move. Once you notice, it feels deceptive.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>See also <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/04/how-fake-are-nature-documentaries\">How Fake Are Nature Documentaries?</a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Is it manipulation?

It’s available in the UK <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p093wp6h\">on BBC’s iPlayer</a> and, unofficially as a fan upload, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtPP_-rkrT3CAPe8OmDnlZBDvaQ7baH7B\">on YouTube</a>; I’ve embedded the trailer and the first part above.</p> \n<p><em>But what exactly is it about</em> you might wonder, even after watching the trailer. Reading <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-uk/adam-curtis-explains-it-all\">Sam Knight’s January 2021 profile of Curtis in the New Yorker</a> might help you there:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>For more than thirty years, Curtis has made hallucinatory, daring attempts to explain modern mass predicaments, such as the origins of postwar individualism, wars in the Middle East, and our relationship to reality itself. He describes his films as a combination of two sometimes contradictory elements: a stream of unusual, evocative images from the past, richly scored with pop music, that are overlaid with his own, plainly delivered, often unverifiable analysis. He seeks to summon “the complexity of the world.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/feb/11/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head-review-adam-curtis-bbc\">Lucy Mangan’s review for The Guardian</a> was overwhelmingly positive:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The power dynamic, how it shifts, how it hides and how it is used to shape our world — the world in which we ordinary people must live — is Curtis’s great interest. He ranges from the literal rewriting of history by Chairman Mao’s formidable fourth wife, Jiang Qing, during the Cultural Revolution to the psychologists plumbing the depths of “the self” and trying to impose behaviours on drugged and electro-shocked subjects. He moves from the infiltration of the Black Panthers by undercover officers inciting and facilitating more violence than the movement had ever planned or been able to carry out alone, to the death of paternalism in industry and its replacement by official legislation drafted by those with hidden and vested interests. The idea that we are indeed living, as posited by various figures in the author’s landscape and (we infer from the whole) the author himself, in a world made up of strata of artifice laid down by those more or less malevolently in charge becomes increasingly persuasive.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Other reviews, particularly from those on the right, call his work incoherent and Curtis himself something of a propagandist. Admission: I haven’t seen any of Curtis’s work, save for the occasional clip here and there. I know some of you out there are big fans — should I start with this one, HyperNormalisation, Century of the Self, or….?</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Adam%20Curtis\">Adam Curtis</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Can%27t%20Get%20You%20Out%20of%20My%20Head\">Can’t Get You Out of My Head</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Lucy%20Mangan\">Lucy Mangan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sam%20Knight\">Sam Knight</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:25:20 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"267d04755a9eb0d023770cdfa353687a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425344056},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:04","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:04","title":"“Climate Anxiety Is an Overwhelmingly White Phenomenon”","link":"https://kottke.org/21/03/climate-anxiety-is-an-overwhelmingly-white-phenomenon","description":"<p>In <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-unbearable-whiteness-of-climate-anxiety/\">an opinion piece for Scientific American</a>, <a href=\"https://envcomm.humboldt.edu/people/sarah-ray\">Sarah Jaquette Ray</a> argues that our response to the climate emergency must be equitable, or as she puts it: “We can’t fight climate change with more racism.”</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>One year ago, I published a book called A Field Guide to Climate Anxiety. Since its publication, I have been struck by the fact that those responding to the concept of climate anxiety are overwhelmingly white. Indeed, these climate anxiety circles are even whiter than the environmental circles I’ve been in for decades. Today, a year into the pandemic, after the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed, and the attack on the U.S. Capitol, I am deeply concerned about the racial implications of climate anxiety. If people of color are more concerned about climate change than white people, why is the interest in climate anxiety so white? Is climate anxiety a form of white fragility or even racial anxiety? Put another way, is climate anxiety just code for white people wishing to hold onto their way of life or get “back to normal,” to the comforts of their privilege?</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This is one of those articles where I want to quote the whole thing, so I’ll just do one more paragraph, leave <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780520343306\">a link to her book</a>, and then just let you read it.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The prospect of an unlivable future has always shaped the emotional terrain for Black and brown people, whether that terrain is racism or climate change. Climate change compounds existing structures of injustice, and those structures exacerbate climate change. Exhaustion, anger, hope-the effects of oppression and resistance are not unique to this climate moment. What is unique is that people who had been insulated from oppression are now waking up to the prospect of their own unlivable future.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/global%20warming\">global warming</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/racism\">racism</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sarah%20Jaquette%20Ray\">Sarah Jaquette Ray</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:03:46 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"43aeb50a84e38b4d57b15a930ef05546","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425344056},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:04","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:04","title":"Walking 56 Miles to Work","link":"https://kottke.org/21/03/walking-56-miles-to-work","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-Zyud8xh2c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>A few years ago, Beau Miles walked 56 miles to work on a college campus, leaving home with just the clothes on his back and a hat.

Friendship not only helps us see ourselves through another’s eyes, but can be sustained over the years only with someone who has repeatedly forgiven us for our trespasses as we must find it in ourselves to forgive them in turn. A friend knows our difficulties and shadows and remains in sight, a companion to our vulnerabilities more than our triumphs, when we are under the strange illusion we do not need them. An undercurrent of real friendship is a blessing exactly because its elemental form is rediscovered again and again through understanding and mercy. All friendships of any length are based on a continued, mutual forgiveness. Without tolerance and mercy all friendships die.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I heard Whyte read this essay <a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcasts/240-boundaries-self/\">on the Making Sense podcast</a> a few weeks ago and I’ve been thinking about it ever since — it’s a wonderful read but it’s even better to hear a practiced poet recite it aloud. If you’re interested in hearing more, Consolations, which is composed of similarly short essays on topics like anger, beauty, shyness, and gratitude, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B088JFF8YJ/ref=nosim/0sil8\">is available as an audiobook read by Whyte</a>.

I was working at Guadalupe Mountains National Park and along its edge there was a major highway. I would walk along it and find a lot of car parts, just a lot of scrap things that fall off as the cars are whizzing past. I found half of a hubcap, and I took a closer look at it and realized it had cracked perfectly to form the silhouette of the mountain range I was standing in front of. I had a vision that I would just paint the land onto it and use the shape of the object to inform the piece. That’s when I started getting more into photography, too.

Hampton set out to share his vision of what he called “the remarkable human drama that was the Civil Rights Movement” through the experiences and challenges of those fighting for justice. Produced by Blackside Inc, Eyes on the Prize tells the definitive story of the civil rights era from the point of view of the ordinary men and women whose extraordinary actions launched a movement that changed the fabric of American life and embodied a struggle whose reverberations continue to be felt today.</p> \n <p>With contemporary interviews and historical footage, the Academy Award-nominated documentary traces the civil rights movement from the Montgomery bus boycott to the Voting Rights Act; from early acts of individual courage through the flowering of a mass movement and its eventual split into factions. The late Julian Bond, political leader and civil rights activist, narrates.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>If you’ve never seen Eyes on the Prize, you should definitely take this opportunity to check it out.

The conversation ranged widely — I enjoyed his thoughts on superheroes — but his comments on capitalism and technology seem particularly relevant right now. From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-ted-chiang-transcript.html\">the transcript</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I tend to think that most fears about A.I. are best understood as fears about capitalism. And I think that this is actually true of most fears of technology, too. Most of our fears or anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us. And technology and capitalism have been so closely intertwined that it’s hard to distinguish the two.</p> \n <p>Let’s think about it this way. How much would we fear any technology, whether A.I. or some other technology, how much would you fear it if we lived in a world that was a lot like Denmark or if the entire world was run sort of on the principles of one of the Scandinavian countries? There’s universal health care. Everyone has child care, free college maybe. And maybe there’s some version of universal basic income there.</p> \n <p>Now if the entire world operates according to — is run on those principles, how much do you worry about a new technology then? I think much, much less than we do now. Most of the things that we worry about under the mode of capitalism that the U.S practices, that is going to put people out of work, that is going to make people’s lives harder, because corporations will see it as a way to increase their profits and reduce their costs. It’s not intrinsic to that technology. It’s not that technology fundamentally is about putting people out of work.</p> \n <p>It’s capitalism that wants to reduce costs and reduce costs by laying people off. It’s not that like all technology suddenly becomes benign in this world. But it’s like, in a world where we have really strong social safety nets, then you could maybe actually evaluate sort of the pros and cons of technology as a technology, as opposed to seeing it through how capitalism is going to use it against us. How are giant corporations going to use this to increase their profits at our expense?</p> \n <p>And so, I feel like that is kind of the unexamined assumption in a lot of discussions about the inevitability of technological change and technologically-induced unemployment. Those are fundamentally about capitalism and the fact that we are sort of unable to question capitalism. We take it as an assumption that it will always exist and that we will never escape it. And that’s sort of the background radiation that we are all having to live with. But yeah, I’d like us to be able to separate an evaluation of the merits and drawbacks of technology from the framework of capitalism.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Echoing some of his other thoughts during the podcast, Chiang also wrote <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/why-computers-wont-make-themselves-smarter\">a piece for the New Yorker</a> the other day about how the singularity will probably never come.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/artificial%20intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a
