Her goal: attain ready-made African clothing for her Canadian in-laws.</p><p>She browsed the closet-sized shops spilling out with jewelry and gems, furniture and tribal masks, woven baskets and wax print bags. Paintings stacked on paintings stacked on paintings. As she peeked into stores, shopkeepers called out, &#34;Come, mama. I have it. I have what you&#39;re looking for.&#34;</p><p>She was comparing prices at multiple shops when she spotted a dress she loved. The shopkeeper asked for 2000 naira (about $4.87). Normally, no matter the price asked, Ogunkoya-Futi shoots shopkeepers a look of utter shock and then offers to pay something &#34;ridiculous,&#34; she told me. If something is 100 naira, she offers 5.</p><p>But the dress was good quality; 2000 naira was already a great price. She offered 1000 naira.</p><p>Ogunkoya-Futi performed masterful schmoozing, talking the seller up and calling herself his daughter. She offered to make multiple purchases and refer him to her friends. Twenty minutes of back and forth later, she secured the deal.</p><p>Then, Ogunkoya-Futi asked him to throw in three headbands.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f6177b09e80018e59559?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A women displays a West African fabric with piles of other options behind her.\" height=\"2832\" width=\"4256\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Adenike Akinlosose, an African textiles dealer, shows her fabrics at Balogun market in Lagos in 2011.\n<p class=\"copyright\">PIUS UTOMI EKPEI/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;This&#39;ll cost you nothing to make,&#34; Ogunkoya-Futi said, holding the headbands aloft.</p><p>He gave them to her for free.</p><p>Ogunkoya-Futi beams when sharing the story with me during an interview over Zoom, claiming it was her best haggling experience because she and the shopkeeper sparked a connection, both had a pleasant experience, and she brought three friends back that week to support his shop. Ogunkoya-Futi had scored a great deal - and helped a kind businessman. </p><p>&#34;I love the interaction,&#34; she told me. &#34;I wanna talk with them. I wanna gist with them. I wanna have a certain vibe, and they enjoy that, they get that.&#34;</p><p>There&#39;s also the rush of adrenaline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXsQlHGuoWqukC9vz-uonrg\">Collin Abroadcast</a>, a YouTuber who gets millions of views when he posts his shopping exploits, defines haggling as &#34;really rapid negotiation. Where you think on your feet. It&#39;s a game, and the more you play, the more you gain speed and learn to read people&#39;s body language.&#34;</p><h2><strong>A good deal between friends</strong></h2><p>I also love a good haggle. I haggled for my wife&#39;s engagement ring, and before our wedding, I haggled for catering, a DJ, and a photographer. Soon after, I haggled for our house, and when we started our family, I haggled for a minivan. </p><p>I honed my skills during my time living in Jerusalem for nine months in the mid-aughts when I was 27. I was interning at a Jewish-Arab equality NGO and making little money.</p><p>In Israel, haggling is hardcore. Sellers go from telling you that you look like a celebrity to cursing you out. I perfected the interest-indifference ratio, always walking out of a store with a salesperson trailing me, hollering deals. I would get into cabs, then immediately back out, if they didn&#39;t knock the price down. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f92ab414c100186323df?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A man sits in a stall selling a variety of jewelry\" height=\"3648\" width=\"5472\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Italian craftsman Antonio Ignomeriello in his shop at Las Dalias night market in San Carlos, on Ibiza Island in 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">JAIME REINA/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>My grandfather was a haggler. He escaped the antisemitism and pogroms of Poland for America in 1917 and desperately drove his roots into upstate New York&#39;s soil, peddling scrap metal, haggling over prices, and eventually saving enough to start a tailored suit shop/dry cleaners, which soon became a suit shop/paint store, and finally Deitcher&#39;s Wallpaper and Design Center in Cohoes, New York, established in 1926.</p><p>Born in 1937, my father was heir to the business. Over lunches at Smith&#39;s Tavern, he haggled deals with distributors, loading up on stock in exchange for a bigger discount. In return, customers asked for discounts, too, and if they purchased enough, of course he hooked them up.</p><p>When my father grew up it was easier for independent businesses to thrive. Store owners were from the community. Customers trusted them because they were neighbors and family. Clerks could make deals, usually cutting into their commission. Shop owners haggled with other shop owners who then haggled deals back. Supporting each other was supporting friends. </p><p>Today, the only things you can haggle for in the United States are cars, houses, fine jewelry, large appliances, home repairs, event services, and graphic novels at Comic Con. There&#39;s little hope for small businesses cutting deals with distributors when Walmart goes directly to manufacturers to demand the lowest wholesale rates.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155fef8b414c10018632666?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A pile of tugs outside a market stall.\" height=\"2678\" width=\"4012\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rugs for sale at the Jaffa Flea Market in Tel Aviv in 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Michael Jacobs/Art in All of Us/Corbis via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In the 80s, Deitcher&#39;s Wallpaper grew to the point that my father couldn&#39;t order wallpaper fast enough, so he bought a warehouse. In the 90s, he moved the family into his custom-built dream house: 5,600 square feet in Slingerlands, New York-the country-where we were one of a handful of Jewish families in the school district and barely knew our neighbors. Then the business faltered. For years, my father tried running new promotions, but the store bled money and most of his income was from investments. In the early aughts, he held a final sale, donated his stock to Habitat for Humanity, and became an appointment-only interior decorator.</p><p>Even my father shops on Amazon now.</p><h2><strong>&#34;Never, never, take it personally. Never get angry.&#34;</strong></h2><p>But while America becomes less able to negotiate, people fiend to watch the art of haggling. Abroadcast, the haggling YouTuber, has 1.42 million followers on the platform. His comments sections are filled with fans peeping into a world they will never experience.</p><p>Born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Abroadcast started his channel making &#34;typical travel Vlog type stuff,&#34; he told me via Zoom. &#34;Here I am as a foreigner living in China.&#34; He had never haggled in his life before he visited the fake markets in Shanghai five years ago. He envisioned back-alley hustlers, but found a five-story mall in the middle of the city. He caught on immediately, bargaining over a pair of Nikes he knew were bootleg. He felt the rush of adrenaline. The connection with sellers.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aoq9hat-kZs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p> </p><p>His schtick became hopping from country to country-India, Morocco, Kenya, 20 countries overall-rocking two days of stubble, a t-shirt or a hoodie, and a backpack. His videos run 20 minutes to over an hour, with scene after scene of him haggling and chatting with sellers. Sometimes the haggles get tense, frustration sparking between both the seller and Abroadcast. To some viewers, I&#39;m sure he can come off as a white American trying to acquire goods for peanuts, but often you see him taking his time to learn about a seller&#39;s art and family. He can be genuine, both calling out fake goods and complimenting what he likes.</p><p>&#34;I know straight off the bat, especially me being a foreigner in these markets, they expect me to have money because I&#39;m on vacation,&#34; he said. &#34;So obviously, they&#39;re going to take their chance and try to overcharge me.&#34;</p><p>His favorite story, he told me, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgvfKvl7zWA\">took place in Beijing&#39;s Silk Market</a>, a massive modern mall known as a destination for buying knock-offs.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgvfKvl7zWA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p> </p><p>In a shop lined with shoes, a seller rejected his offer of 200 yuan (about $32) for a pair of Jordans. He told her, &#34;I&#39;m good, I&#39;m good,&#34; and headed for the exit. The seller reeled him back in, reminding him he was being unreasonable because she was selling him Jordans, &#34;not lady shoes, not baby shoes, not socks.&#34; She fed him tons of snark, which he met with laughter. She finally lowered her price to 250 because he was &#34;very handsome,&#34; but he left empty handed, holding firm at his offer of 200.</p><p>&#34;My best haggling situation isn&#39;t where I get the best price, it&#39;s where I have the most fun. And the seller has the most fun as well,&#34; he said. &#34;Those are always the best times because it&#39;s like, &#39;Alright, let&#39;s put my skills to the test.&#39; The worst ones are when the sellers don&#39;t really care to sell to you.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Never, never, take it personally. Never get angry,&#34; Abroadcast said. &#34;As humans, we all want the same thing. Everybody just wants to have good health. They want to be loved and be able to support their family at the end of the day.&#34;</p><h2><strong>&#34;Just pay the dollar and go&#34;</strong></h2><p>My mom-in-law, who grew up in Jamaica in the &#39;60s, didn&#39;t feel a connection with the buyers she haggled with. She did it because that&#39;s how her family got by.</p><p>Once a week, she, her mom, and her sisters went shopping in the bend-down markets of Saint Elizabeth, a parish in the south of Jamaica, known for having the reddest dirt and the Appleton rum estate. Sellers spread their goods on blankets, and often, my mom-in-law and her family came with their own crop to sell-thyme, scallions, and coffee beans from their farm-while their mom used profits to haggle for soup meat, liver, and kidney.</p><p>Many of my mom-in-law&#39;s family members loved chatting with buyers, but she hated it. &#34;It kind of made me feel a little…&#34; her voice trailed off while she told me about it from across the kitchen table. She remembered feeling ashamed as she watched school friends wandering by, purchasing things, while she fought over small sums of money. &#34;You know how children are. They would say, &#39;hey, I saw her in the market selling.&#39; It was down-grading.&#34;</p><p>Once her secondary school finished, she left the farm and eventually made her way to America, where she attained her dream job at New York City&#39;s Waldorf Astoria, a stark contrast to the markets. To this day, she is one of the worst hagglers I&#39;ve seen. &#34;She gets embarrassed. Has too much pride,&#34; my wife told me. &#34;She worries haggling makes her seem less-than.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155fdaeb414c100186325d6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A woman stands near a stall selling handmade baskets.\" height=\"2440\" width=\"3719\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A basket seller in Jamaica.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Emmanuel VALENTIN/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;I can&#39;t do it,&#34; my mom-in-law said, stirring her tea. &#34;If they say this thing is for a dollar, I just pay the dollar and go. It&#39;s up to them and their conscience. I don&#39;t lose.&#34;</p><p>She loves chatting with the sales people, whether it be in Macy&#39;s or a market in Ocho Rios. She will even leave sellers tips. &#34;I remember my days when I didn&#39;t have it,&#34; she said. &#34;I know how it&#39;s hard.&#34;</p><h2><strong>&#34;You don&#39;t leave money on the table.&#34;</strong></h2><p>Last February, my wife and I took my mom-in-law and my son to visit Jerusalem, and we strolled through the shuk, my mom-in-law paying what she pleased while I went to work.</p><p>I was in my element.</p><p>Roni Peled, senior tour guide and Director of Guide Activities at the Israel Museum, told me that since the Crusades, the streets of Jerusalem&#39;s Old City have been named for different goods and services. &#34;If I open a shop of spices, right away, on my right side and my left side, there would be open another shop of spices,&#34; he said. The Ottoman Empire divided the wide, slippery limestone streets into alleys, a half or quarter their original size, creating the maze of vibrant markets of today. Growing up refugees in the 50s, Peled&#39;s family couldn&#39;t afford plays and movies, so going to the markets was how they entertained themselves. Everyone met in the markets.</p><p>Arabs shopped from Jewish shops and Jews frequented Arab shops, but Peled worries the bonds created in Jerusalem&#39;s markets are becoming a thing of the past. In 2008, right before I left Jerusalem, the Mamilla Mall opened, just outside the Old City, leading to Jaffa Gate. It&#39;s a massive open-air shopping center featuring haggle-free high-end international chain stores built around and into historical buildings. I enjoy shopping there the same way I love my local mall, but the experience feels very impersonal.</p><p>Haggling is changing in Nigeria, too, at least for more financially comfortable Nigerians in cities like Lagos.</p><p>Back when Ogunkoya-Futi was growing up in the 90s, going to a proper grocery store was a trip, but it&#39;s becoming more the norm. &#34;They&#39;re becoming formal entities,&#34; she told me, &#34;with a PNL, with projections.&#34; Nigerians can get most anything delivered through Jumia, known as the Amazon of Africa. There are hundreds of dispatch services-delivering food, clothing, and TVs.</p><p>She sees merchants struggling and understands why many Nigerian businesses are becoming more formal. &#34;I can take a random vendor in the market that people haggle with on a day-to-day basis. He sells his products one day for 15. The next day, 100. The fundamental issue is that he can&#39;t plan. The fundamental issue is that he has constant bills that are fixed or even growing that he might not be able to live up to.&#34; Yet because other vendors are haggling, he can&#39;t afford to stop.</p><p>&#34;I love the haggling culture,&#34; Ogunkoya-Futi said. &#34;But I think it&#39;s unpredictability of revenue is a big issue in the market.&#34; It&#39;s one of the reasons, she told me, many Nigerians are dependent on diaspora money to survive.</p><p>Stelios Michalopoulos, an economics professor at Brown University, tells me that societies where haggling is a big part of commercial interactions often share a way of valuing time. &#34;If time is expensive, then you would not do it,&#34; he said. &#34;When labor cost is low, then your time is cheap.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155fc4d7b09e80018e597ba?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A customer hands over money to sellers at a flea market.\" height=\"2396\" width=\"3500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A stall selling antiques, at El Rastro, Madrid&#39;s iconic flea market, in 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Gustavo Valiente/Europa Press via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It&#39;s also more common where a higher value is placed on social interactions, there is a joy in haggling. &#34;Both the buyer and the seller want the other to be happy,&#34; so they can &#34;invite for further interactions,&#34; Michalopoulos said. Of course, that makes less sense when it comes to tourists, who are unlikely to return consistently.</p><p>He told me that he believes haggling and formalized trade systems can work together. He used donation-based alumni organizations as a parallel example. Donors set the value of being involved with organizations-giving $50 or $100 or whatever they want based on their interest-and the organizations run fine.</p><p>He called haggling &#34;the optimal way to sell&#34; because the buyer pays &#34;according to his marginal willingness to pay, which will be higher than the cost to the supplier.&#34; The possibility for price differentiation leaves no unexploited opportunities for trade.</p><p>&#34;If you have one single price economy,&#34; he said, and something costs the seller $8 and the market price goes for $10, &#34;there are actually trades that could have taken place at eight-and-a-half bucks, nine bucks, nine-and-a-half bucks.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The single price law kills those possibilities,&#34; he said.</p><p>If a buyer is willing to pay anything above the seller&#39;s cost, &#34;You don&#39;t lose. You don&#39;t leave money on the table.&#34;</p><p>Today, Ogunkoya-Futi travels the world, documenting her journey to over 35 countries, but she often finds herself haggling with favorite food sellers back home over 10 naira (about $.024).</p><p>And she says bringing the haggling mentality into other aspects of your life &#34;can open doors that you don&#39;t even know.&#34; It&#39;s about ingenuity. &#34;Don&#39;t be discouraged by the hard print,&#34; she said. If a job says you need to apply by the first of the month but it&#39;s the second, &#34;find the right person in that company. They&#39;ll put your application through.&#34; If a job can&#39;t meet your salary demands, ask if they can bundle it with other benefits, stock options, or travel credits. &#34;Don&#39;t be so fixed on one point, look for other creative ways to make a deal better for you.&#34;</p><p>&#34;If you&#39;re personable,&#34; Ogunkoya-Futi said, &#34;you just never know.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-i-learned-studying-the-fine-art-of-haggling-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Zh9QqD5z2PE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:38:57 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6155f66c7b09e80018e59598?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"bc740e86b3b8fce263a34a15a80db0eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn79@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-30-279_3d7bd2b44c7409a7.webp","destWidth":4614,"destHeight":3460,"sourceBytes":1222408,"destBytes":1222408,"author":"insider@insider.com (Jay Deitcher)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6155f2cc7b09e80018e59435?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-35-871_1ba8a8730bbd5fd6.webp","https://i.insider.com/6155f6177b09e80018e59559?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn52@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-34-411_3d584a33ed3e39db.webp","https://i.insider.com/6155f92ab414c100186323df?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn63@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-35-898_8729482cf3f00540.webp","https://i.insider.com/6155fef8b414c10018632666?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn15@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-36-334_a3e134265ef58eb4.webp","https://i.insider.com/6155fdaeb414c100186325d6?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-36-242_8ba082653fdad75b.webp","https://i.insider.com/6155fc4d7b09e80018e597ba?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-31-236_e501901e8f4888e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn8@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-36-033_4162f7c15e8b993d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn28@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-32-839_7fb3788873fba514.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zh9QqD5z2PE:VspbrG3Q8lk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn71@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-31-147_76af3df28ead92f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Zh9QqD5z2PE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-34-030_854035dd6ad00f9d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085766},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"Joe Manchin, who is holding up crucial climate change initiatives in Biden's reconciliation bill, collects $500,000 a year from coal stocks dividends: report","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/senator-joe-manchin-half-million-year-coal-stocks-climate-crisis-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f698b414c100186322c1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Democratic Sen.

The vast majority of them give me two answers: their chef&#39;s knife and cast iron skillet. Executive chef at the <a href=\"https://www.escoffier.edu/about/chef-instructors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts</a> in Austin, Texas, Chef Robyn McArthur said of her cast iron skillet, &#34;I keep mine on my stove at all times and use it every day. It is versatile, easy to maintain, and cooks everything beautifully.&#34; </p><p>One of the best features of cast iron skillets, especially those we recommend below, is how you can cook anything in any way on them. Cast iron actually improves with age as seasoning builds up on the surface, said Atara Bernstein, co-founder of <a href=\"https://pineapplecollaborative.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pineapple Collaborative</a>. These pans often become legacy pieces, passed down from one generation of cooks to the next. However, cast iron can be an investment -- if not in price, then in the maintenance of the seasoning and difficulty maneuvering the heavy pan. It&#39;s important to get the best one for you and your style of cooking.</p><p>In support of my testing, I spoke with Chef Robyn McArthur, Atara Berstein, and Ariel Pasternak, the other co-founder of <a href=\"https://pineapplecollaborative.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pineapple Collaborative</a>, about their experiences with cast iron and why it is a chef favorite. I then cooked six steaks, six cornbreads, and six sunny side-up eggs to determine the best cast iron skillets of 2021.</p><h2>Here are the best cast iron skillets of 2021</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong>Best cast iron skillet overall: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffieldcompany.com%2Fproducts%2Ffield-cast-iron-skillet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Field 10.25&#34; Cast Iron Skillet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Best budget cast iron skillet: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-Ready-Stove/dp/B00006JSUA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored\"><strong>Lodge 10.25&#34; Classic Cast Iron Skillet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Best cast iron skillet for searing: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Creuset-Signature-Handle-Skillet-4-Inch/dp/B009ZML3UK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored\"><strong>Le Creuset 10&#34; Signature Skillet</strong></a></li></ul>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe best cast iron skillet overall\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6154894cb414c1001862ea7e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cornbread baked in the best overall cast iron skillet, the Field 10.25” Cast Iron Skillet.\" height=\"808\" width=\"1078\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lily Alig/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffieldcompany.com%2Fproducts%2Ffield-cast-iron-skillet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Field 10.25\" Cast Iron Skillet</a> is the ideal cast iron skillet to have in your kitchen; it sears as well as it bakes, and develops a smooth, nonstick surface after just a few uses.</strong></p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Even heat retention, great sear on the steak, quick to develop seasoning</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Helper handle is not very helpful, no pour spouts</p><p>Any new piece of cookware takes some getting used to -- how fast and evenly it heats, or how much fat it needs to prevent sticking.

In our first test, the cornbread did not turn out when flipped, but it was easy to remove individual pieces without any crust sticking to the bottom. The seasoning, and therefore nonstick quality, became even better throughout our testing. After searing the steak and cleaning the skillet, I could feel the surface become smoother. When I later cooked the egg, it slid right off the surface without a trace stuck to the pan.&#160;</p><p>The steak cooked evenly and seared quickly in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffieldcompany.com%2Fproducts%2Ffield-cast-iron-skillet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Field</a> pan, allowing a great crust to develop without overcooking.

The cornbread turned out perfectly, without a crumb left on the bottom, and the eggs slid off the surface without breaking. In part because it turned out unblemished, the bottom of the Lodge cornbread was the most even golden-brown of those we made.</p><p>The shallow pour spouts were very helpful when pouring out grease and oil from cooking the steak. The handle is shorter than that of our top pick, but both got hot to the touch quickly.&#160;</p><p>It was a close call for the best overall skillet between this pan and Field. Lodge fell out of the top spot because of the searing test: a crust did develop on the Lodge steak, but it took longer to achieve a darker brown. This could lead to overcooking in an effort to get a better crust. The Le Creuset and Field skillets produced thicker crusts in a shorter amount of time.</p>\n\tBest cast iron skillet for searing\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61548c332fb46b0019be9912?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Our best cast iron skillet for searing, the Le Creuset 10” Signature Skillet.\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lily Alig/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Creuset-Signature-Handle-Skillet-4-Inch/dp/B009ZML3UK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Le Creuset 10\" Signature Skillet</a> is a must-have for meat-eaters, searing steak to perfection quicker than any other pans we tested.</strong></p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Heats up quickly and stays hot for as long as you're cooking, even heat distribution&#160;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not good for baking, heavy</p><p>If you can't cook outdoors, searing on a good cast iron pan can be a substitute for grilling, said Pasternak.

However, a thin layer of the cornbread stuck to the bottom of the pan, and the eggs were difficult to remove as well. The stickiness of the nonstick interior kept this pan out of a top spot.</p>\n\tOur testing methodology\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61548e062fb46b0019be9979?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Measuring the height of cornbread cooked in our best overall cast iron skillet, the Field 10.25” Cast Iron Skillet.\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lily Alig/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>For consistency, we only tested 10 to 10.5-inch skillets. We conducted three cooking tests to evaluate the different aspects of performance.</p><p>All cast iron pans are heavier than aluminum or even stainless steel. We compared the weight of these skillets to each other and found minimal differences. All of the skillets had one extended handle and one helper handle. However, we preferred pans with helper handles that you could fit your fingers in, as opposed to just extended grips.&#160;</p><p><strong>Cornbread:</strong> We used <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9375-cornbread\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Mark Bittman's NYTCooking Cornbread Recip</a>e to evaluate the heat retention and distribution of each pan. We measured the height (and therefore the rise) of the cornbread at the edge and middle. We looked at the browning and crust on the edges and underside of each cornbread.</p><p><strong>Steak:</strong> We based our steak testing on <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-pan-seared-steaks-recipe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">this recipe</a> from Serious Eats. We seared New York strip steak by heating canola oil until smoking, placing the steak in the center of the plan, and flipping repeatedly for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steak. The best seared steaks have a deep brown crust that is visible from the side of the steak when you cut into it.&#160;</p><p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Our last test was to make a sunny side-up egg in the middle of the pan with less than half a teaspoon of butter. We did this last to give the skillets a chance to develop a bit of seasoning. We looked for the egg to slide off the pan without breaking or sticking.</p><p><strong>Maintenance:&#160;</strong>Before and after each cooking test, we cleaned the skillets according to the manufacturers' instructions. We noted if it was difficult to remove stuck food and if the texture of the surface changed after scrubbing. Seasoned cast iron is smooth and semi-glossy; after all three tests, we evaluated each pan for these qualities to indicate a well-seasoned surface.</p>\n\tWhat we look forward to testing\n\t\n\t<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Ffinex-fry-pan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Finex 10\" Fry Pan:</a> </strong>This pan has two unique features compared to the others we tested.

Most importantly, do not soak your cast iron and make sure it is completely dry when you store it. McArthur says she will heat the pan up over a low light to make sure there is no moisture before putting it away. This is a popular way to prevent rust, shared by Bernstein, Pasternak, and multiple manufacturers of the pans we tested.</p><p class=\"faq-answer\">All the pans we tested came with specific cleaning instructions, so we recommend consulting that information before using your skillet.&#160;</p><hr /><h3 class=\"faq-question\">How do you season cast iron?</h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">The easiest way to season a cast iron pan is to use it, initially with a fair amount of cooking oil. The layer of seasoning is actually oil cooked onto the cast iron surface, a process called polymerization, McArthur said. So, the more you cook on the pan, the more oil is absorbed by the surface, and the more nonstick your pan becomes.&#160;</p><p class=\"faq-answer\">Even if the pan is pre-seasoned, we found most will still take a few cooking sessions to become truly nonstick. After you wash the pan, McArthur, Pasternak, and Bernstein all recommend coating your completely dry skillet with cooking oil. This helps preserve the seasoning.</p><hr /><h3 class=\"faq-question\">Is cast iron compatible with an induction stovetop?</h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">One of the beauties of cast iron cookware is that it can be used almost anywhere. You can place your skillet on the grill, in the oven, or on an induction stovetop. Always consult the manufacturer's instructions before using your cookware, especially regarding oven safe temperatures.</p>\n\tRead our stories on how to properly care for cast iron

which has grossed nearly $200 million domestically and become <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-shang-chi-became-biggest-movie-at-us-box-office-2021-9\">the highest-grossing movie this year in the US</a> since debuting on September 3. </p><p>Hollywood is about to find out whether domestic movie theaters can sustain multiple tentpole releases in a row. It will also find out if audiences in China, which passed the US last year as the world&#39;s biggest cinema market, are craving foreign blockbusters at a pivotal moment for Hollywood and China&#39;s relationship.</p><p>Some of October&#39;s most high-profile releases include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-undervalues-sony-hollywood-powerhouse-spider-man-venom-2021-9\">Sony</a>&#39;s &#34;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&#34; - in US theaters October 1</li><li>MGM&#39;s &#34;No Time to Die&#34; - in US theaters October 8/in China October 29</li><li>Universal&#39;s &#34;Halloween Kills&#34; - in US theaters and on Peacock October 15</li><li>Warner Bros.&#39; &#34;Dune&#34; - in US/China theaters and on HBO Max October 22</li></ul><p>The month will also see the release of The &#34;Sopranos&#34; prequel &#34;The Many Saints of Newark&#34; in theaters and on Max this weekend and Ridley Scott&#39;s &#34;The Last Duel&#34; on October 15.</p><p>Needless to say, it will be a big month for movies - maybe. It all depends on whether audience turnout prevails over lingering concerns about the coronavirus and day-and-date streaming strategies.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/613745f6eedea900193d4e72?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A picture of Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson in &#34;Dune.&#34;\" height=\"675\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson in &#34;Dune.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Warner Bros.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Theaters are inching toward recovery</h2><p>&#34;Shang-Chi&#34; proved there is still an appetite for going to movie theaters. But the movie has faced little competition since opening earlier this month. Even some of the summer&#39;s best performing films at the domestic box office - from &#34;A Quiet Place Part II&#34; to &#34;F9&#34; to &#34;Black Widow&#34; - were spread out.</p><p>Theater owners believe the secret to success is twofold: actually releasing films, and then making them exclusive to theaters.</p><p>&#34;Studios&#39; choices are: get a decent return on your movies now, take them straight to streaming and sacrifice all of the box office, or keep delaying until the industry dies,&#34; the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) chief John Fithian <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/theater-association-chief-movie-delays-could-kill-industry-2021-8\">told Insider in a recent interview</a>.</p><p>Fithian predicted that &#34;Shang-Chi&#34; would have stronger legs at the box office than &#34;Black Widow,&#34; which Disney released simultaneously to theaters and Disney+. The numbers suggest he was right. </p><p>But what happens in October will tell Hollywood whether all of those aforementioned films - even those exclusive to theaters like &#34;Let There Be Carnage&#34; and &#34;No Time to Die&#34; - can thrive when packed into one month, in a market where even some of the most successful big-budget tentpoles have failed to reach pre-pandemic levels of success.</p><p>If they are successful, Hollywood may feel more confident about releasing its remaining scheduled films this year. If not, movie-studio execs may go back to the drawing board and either consider delaying films again, such as Paramount did with &#34;Top Gun: Maverick,&#34; or releasing them simultaneously to streaming and theaters.</p><p>Here&#39;s how those movies&#39; predecessors fared at the box office:</p><ul><li>&#34;Spectre&#34; (2015) - $880 million globally/$200 million domestically/$70 million opening weekend</li><li>&#34;Venom&#34; (2018) - $856 million globally/$215 million domestically/$80 million opening weekend</li><li>&#34;Halloween&#34; (2018) - $255 million globally/$159 million domestically/$76 million opening weekend</li></ul><p>While movie studios have tempered their expectations during the pandemic, those numbers still put a lot of pressure on these movies to perform at a respectable level - especially &#34;No Time to Die,&#34; with its massive $250 million budget. Foreign markets can pick up the slack, as they did before the pandemic, but the biggest foreign market may not be as reliable for Hollywood as it once was.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e57d0c1fee23d37c7514919?format=jpeg\" alt=\"no time to die\" height=\"858\" width=\"1246\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Daniel Craig as James Bond in &#34;No Time to Die&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">MGM</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>China is a big question mark </h2><p>Before the pandemic, Hollywood relied on China - then the No. 2 theatrical market - to boost its blockbusters on the global scale. But the comeback story in the region has been more about China&#39;s own film industry.</p><p>So far this year, only two Hollywood releases are currently in the top 10 at China&#39;s box office: &#34;F9&#34; and &#34;Godzilla vs. Kong.&#34; Since the pandemic, which China&#39;s theater industry has recovered from more quickly than in the US, local Chinese films have performed exceptionally well, at levels Hollywood film studios can only dream of right now.</p><p>And &#34;No Time to Die&#34; and &#34;Dune&#34; could leave Hollywood still holding its breath.</p><p>The films could face issues at the China box office, according to Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Chinese politics and cinema.</p><p>&#34;No Time to Die&#34; will get released in North America and other international markets before China (and the James Bond franchise isn&#39;t a staple in the region; &#34;Spectre&#34; earned $83 million there). And &#34;Dune&#34; will stream simultaneously on HBO Max.

That mentality is now especially strong among Republicans with Democrats holding the White House and both chambers of Congress.</p><p>Even if some or all of the following potential catastrophes are averted, the uncertainty and confusion surrounding the negotiations could send global markets teetering in a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-us-stocks-debt-ceiling-evergrande-infrastructure-2021-9\">ripple effect that may already be under way</a>.</p><p>Here are five ways this Congressional brinksmanship could play out:</p><h2>1. Armageddon: Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling and the US defaults on its debts.</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f057b414c10018632058?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Wall street traders panic\" height=\"1800\" width=\"3600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange August 9, 2007. \n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Lucas Jackson</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The debt limit or debt ceiling is often a misunderstood term, since it pertains to money the US government has already spent, not future payments.</p><p>The Senate and House <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-approves-government-funding-extension-hours-before-shutdown-deadline-2021-9\">have passed</a> a continuing resolution to fund the government and stave off shutdown, averting a double whammy worst-case scenario - but the debt ceiling issue has yet to be resolved.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-CBS News  (@CBSNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1443586087415283712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p> </p><p>If Congress doesn&#39;t lift it, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/economy/debt-ceiling-deadline-yellen/index.html\">the government could run out of funding by mid-October</a>, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. </p><p>Democrats in the House <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/debt-ceiling-pelosi-says-house-will-vote-to-prevent-us-default.html\">passed a bill suspending the debt ceiling, but it was dead on arrival</a> as soon as it reached Senate Republicans. A default - or a near-default - stands to negatively impact markets, and services that millions of Americans reply upon. </p><p>Democrats are sick of dealing with the debt ceiling and the need to regularly stave off economic catastrophe, finding themselves the target of GOP efforts to make them pay a political price via a mechanism that isn&#39;t even used by most developed democracies, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-democrats-consider-eliminating-limit-government-borrowing-default-recession-2021-9\">Insider&#39;s Ben Winck, Joseph Zeballos-Roig, and Andy Kiersz reported</a> last week.</p><p>Even if there is no default, prolonging the process could still cause a financial drag: The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#_Hlk431978571\">finds</a> that even the threat of default can have &#34;serious negative economic implications.&#34;</p><p>In 2011, a similar showdown resulted in a last-minute increase to the debt ceiling - but not before roiling financial markets as the country&#39;s credit rating was <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2011/08/05/news/economy/downgrade_rumors/index.htm\">downgraded</a>. For instance, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-12-701\">report</a> estimated that the prolonged debt ceiling process in 2011 made Treasury&#39;s borrowing costs go up by $1.3 billion.</p><p>There could be a huge hit to employment and stocks if the debt limit doesn&#39;t get lifted by mid-October, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-cost-americans-trillions-borrowing-limit-democrats-republicans-moodys-2021-9\">Moody&#39;s Analytics predicts</a>. Economists led by Mark Zandi found that 6 million jobs could be shed, with unemployment soaring up to 9%. Stocks crashing could wipe out $15 trillion in household wealth.</p><p>Yellen said in a <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Yellen%20Testimony%209-28-21.pdf\">statement</a> to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Banking that &#34;the full faith and credit of the United States would be impaired, and our country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession&#34; if the country goes into default.  </p><p>If the debt ceiling isn&#39;t lifted, Americans receiving support from government programs may feel the impact acutely. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-raise-debt-limit-ceiling-yellen-treasury-brinkmanship-federal-budget-11632069056\">Wall Street Journal</a> opinion piece that families could see their monthly child tax credits delayed.</p><p>Also potentially impacted: Military troops, senior citizens, children receiving free or subsidized school lunches, and Americans relying on Medicaid. Yellen wrote that almost 50 million senior citizens may not receive their Social Security checks, and that troops may not receive their paychecks. </p><p>In a memo sent out to the state and local governments, the White House <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-warning-medicaid-free-school-lunch-cuts-debt-ceiling-2021-9\">warned</a> that federally subsidized Medicaid and free school lunches could face reductions in the case of a default.</p><h2>2. Both crises are avoided and the HIP and BIF live happily ever after.</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a6a33fe25d05001880cb9d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ilhan omar nancy pelosi\" height=\"1823\" width=\"3647\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) (L) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Because Democrats hold the narrowest majority possible in the Senate, with just 50 members plus Vice President Kamala Harris as the deciding vote, passing Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan has been a high wire act from the start.</p><p>It&#39;s an especially precarious position because it&#39;s so far from the 60 votes needed for most legislation to clear a filibuster from Republicans.</p><p>Given the inevitability of a filibuster on several key Democratic priorities, the bill was split in two: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, or &#34;BIF,&#34; and the more wide-reaching Human Infrastructure Plan, or &#34;HIP.&#34; The ostensible goal was to have enough Republicans vote for the BIF, since it includes more traditional infrastructure components such as roads, bridges, and ports, while the HIP would pass with just the 50 Senate Democrats and VP Harris before going over to the House.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are essentially playing a game of infrastructure chicken as Republicans stand by and watch. From the start, progressives have said that the BIF needs to move in tandem with the larger social spending plan, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-progressives-wont-support-bipartisan-infrastructure-without-reconciliation-2021-7\">have warned</a> they&#39;ll shut down any standalone bipartisan bill. It&#39;s a position that both <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/progressives-bipartisan-infrastructure-reconciliation-bill-together-pelosi-wyden-biden-2021-6\">Biden and Pelosi</a> originally echoed.</p><p>But moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin have indicated that they&#39;re not on board with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-manchin-chuck-schumer-reconciliation-agreement-july-trillion-entitlement-society-2021-9\">size</a> or <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/25/democrats-bill-joe-manchin-514152\">timeline</a> of that $3.5 trillion reconciliation package. </p><p>Now, Pelosi is pushing for a vote on just BIF, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pelosi-gamble-biden-infrastructure-bill-progressives-bernie-sanders-reconciliation-2021-9\">a risky gamble</a> to get one part of the agenda across the finish line. As promised, House progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-threatens-to-vote-against-moderates-infrastructure-deal-2021-9\">have said</a> they&#39;ll vote against the bipartisan bill, with prominent Senate progressive Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-infrastructure-house-progressives-tank-bill-nancy-pelosi-2021-9\">backing</a> them. </p><p>However, there is a chance both the moderate and progressive wings were bluffing after the deal fell apart, and both will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fight-over-infrastructure-bills-is-a-prisoners-dilemma-2021-9\">escape the prisoner&#39;s dilemma of Game Theory</a> to arrive at a compromise.</p><h2>3. Most of the public blames Republicans for the debt ceiling brinksmanship - just like before</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f19d7b09e80018e593c2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Kevin McCarthy down\" height=\"671\" width=\"1342\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Over the past 25 years, standoffs like this one have become increasingly routine in Congress.</p><p>When it comes to the threat of a government shutdown - particularly the nation&#39;s longest, under former President Donald Trump, and both shutdowns during the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s - <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/22/republicans-usually-lose-shutdown-fights-so-why-are-they-going-there-again/\">most Americans blame the GOP</a>, without fail.</p><p>Yet despite Republicans always being blamed more for shutdowns and bringing the nation closer to defaulting on its debts, they keep doing it. </p><p>A Washington Post/ABC poll following the Clinton-era shutdowns, the first of which lasted five days and the second clocked in at 21, found 50% of Americans blaming Republicans to just 27% blaming Clinton. The clashes ultimately ended former House Speaker Newt Gingrich&#39;s reign in Congress, and emboldened Clinton going into his second term.</p><p>Whether a similar dynamic plays out with Biden depends on how bad things get and how much more polarized the public is now compared to the &#39;90s, but the polling history is not on the GOP&#39;s side.</p><h2>4. Both a shutdown and default are avoided, but Biden&#39;s infrastructure bill continues to suffer.</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f0777b09e80018e59364?format=jpeg\" alt=\"US President Joe Biden convenes a virtual Covid-19 Summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, on September 22, 2021, in the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC.\" height=\"1249\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Joe Biden.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>With Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-infrastructure-house-progressives-tank-bill-nancy-pelosi-2021-9\">already on the ropes</a> as intra-Democratic divisions have boiled over regarding how the bill was split in two, a protracted fight over the debt ceiling does nothing to help move the roughly $3.5 trillion package along.</p><p>Similar to the way narrowly avoiding a default would still have negative impacts on the economy, a languishing infrastructure bill would factor into how Wall Street analysts assess the state of the economy and which sectors are worth investing in.</p><p>With the midterms just over a year away, Biden and Democrats would like to campaign on the infrastructure bill as a major legislative accomplishment beyond the administration&#39;s pandemic response and the March stimulus bill known as the American Rescue Plan.</p><h2>5. All of this bogs down Biden&#39;s agenda through the fall, and Democrats get blamed by voters who associate government spending directly with inflation.</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f235b414c100186320fe?format=jpeg\" alt=\"joe biden\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Joe Biden.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pete Marovich-Pool/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The notion of &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-rebound-goods-commodities-services-more-expensive-inflation-stimulus-2021-2\">overheating the economy</a>&#34; has already become a theme in the Biden presidency, and has been explicitly mentioned by notable holdouts such as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia as a reason to be wary of the infrastructure bill&#39;s $3.5 trillion price tag.</p><p>On top of the $5 trillion in stimulus spending during the pandemic between the Trump and Biden administrations, those ranging from partisan critics to apolitical observers tend to tie government spending directly with inflation. </p><p>Although it&#39;s much more complicated than that, and pandemic-related supply chain issues have led to many of the most dramatic price hikes, Democrats risk losing the messaging battle on what could become one of the key issues in the 2022 midterms. </p><p>Swing voters - or at least anyone showing up to a midterm election who isn&#39;t planning on backing their party all the way down the ticket - are far more likely to have the rising price of goods sitting top of mind than squabbles over the debt ceiling that took place over a year ago.</p><p>Former President Jimmy Carter faced a similar issue, and despite <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-approval-rating-new-low-midterms-timing-afghanistan-infrastructure-2021-9\">breaking with the historical trend of an incumbent president&#39;s party losing seats in Congress in the first election since taking office</a>, Carter ended up failing in his reelection bid as Ronald Reagan ran on reigning in government spending and tamping down on inflation.</p><p>While this outcome is less empirical and more closely related to campaign messaging, it may be the one with the longest staying power.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

But since Wednesday&#39;s announcement, the number of employees without proof of inoculation dropped to 320, declining by nearly half.</p><p>According to United, the reduction is driven mainly by employees uploading their vaccination cards late, and management expects the number to decrease more after individual meetings with employees find they are actually vaccinated.</p><p>&#34;Our vaccine policy continues to prove requirements work - in less than 48 hours, the number of unvaccinated employees who began the process of being separated from the company has been cut almost in half, dropping from 593 to 320. That means 99.5 percent of United&#39;s U.S. employees have now chosen to get vaccinated, excluding those who sought an exemption,&#34; United said in a statement.</p><p>Other US airlines have yet to mandate vaccinations for employees, though some are trying to incentivize the shot through reward or punishment. Delta Air Lines announced in August that unvaccinated employees would be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-workers-need-vaccine-or-pay-200-extra-for-healthcare-2021-8\">forced to pay an extra $200</a> for the company health-insurance plan, while Southwest is offering 16 hours of extra pay for inoculated workers. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said he did not believe in the company mandating vaccinations but added that the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-vaccine-mandate-businesses-employers-osha-good-should-go-further-2021-9\">federal government may implement requirements</a>.</p><p>&#34;So we at Southwest Airlines may be compelled by federal law to require employees to be vaccinated, and we will be prepared for that,&#34; Kelly told staff, according to CNBC.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/uniteds-number-of-unvaccinated-employees-drops-from-593-to-320-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/0qahzHheuxU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:56:09 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/615601237b09e80018e599cb?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f34ac8c93620b66c7c4b61692eb93765","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-18-731_4f9fa6c134de265e.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":768,"sourceBytes":99194,"destBytes":99194,"author":"trains@insider.com (Taylor Rains)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/615601237b09e80018e599cb?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-18-731_4f9fa6c134de265e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-36-135_0a3b4215f77cad86.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn3@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-31-002_c9e45ce4297551d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0qahzHheuxU:7mj4hbMWVnE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-34-456_979d3371e781eeca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/0qahzHheuxU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn31@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-30-318_955748fc658d921d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085741},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"Blue Origin employees say they wouldn't feel safe riding the company's rockets, and it's 'lucky' nothing has happened","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-origin-employees-letter-new-shepard-rockets-not-safe-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60f21f457b0ec5001800a9f5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"jeff bezos hands together praying gesture composite image with rocket launching\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jeff Bezos (left) launched aboard Blue Origin&#39;s New Shepard rocket (right) in July.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters; Blue Origin</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-origin-employee-accuse-company-sacrificing-safety-2021-9\">Twenty-one Blue Origin employees</a> published a whistle-blowing <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-origin-employee-accuse-company-sacrificing-safety-2021-9\">open letter</a> on Thursday.</li>\n<li>Some employees said they wouldn&#39;t ride a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-elon-musk-spacex-just-as-litigious-as-jeff-bezos-2021-9\">Blue Origin</a> rocket due to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-risk-blue-origin-rocket-2021-6\">safety</a> concerns.

That&#39;s compared to a 92% approval rating for SpaceX&#39;s Elon Musk and 77% for United Launch Alliance&#39;s Tory Bruno.</p><p>Blue Origin&#39;s statement also said: &#34;We stand by our safety record and believe that New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built.&#34;</p><p>But the open letter said that safety was &#34;the driving force&#34; behind the decision to publish it for many of its co-authors. It also said that in 2018, when someone new took over one particular team, the manager discovered that the team had documented &#34;more than 1,000 problem reports&#34; related to the company&#39;s rocket engines. None of those reports had been addressed, the letter said.</p><p>What&#39;s more, the letter added that Blue Origin has frequently denied requests &#34;for additional engineers, staff, or spending,&#34; while adding more responsibilities to teams that are too small to handle them.</p><p>&#34;Employees are often told to &#39;be careful with Jeff&#39;s money,&#39; to &#39;not ask for more,&#39; and to &#39;be grateful,&#39;&#34; the letter said.</p><h2>Commercial rocket passengers fly at their own risk</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60c10b58b50ed500185e3e69?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The New Shepard crew capsule parachutes to a landing at Blue Origin&#39;s Launch Site One in Texas on January 14.\" height=\"2159\" width=\"2879\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The New Shepard crew capsule parachutes to a landing at Blue Origin&#39;s Launch Site One in Texas, January 14, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Blue Origin</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Spaceflight is always risky. About 1% of US human spaceflights have resulted in a fatal accident, according to an <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2020-11/Koller-Nield_HumanSpaceflight_20201112.pdf\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"3976cee0dc682fdb12b0901fcea4fef1\">analysis</a> published earlier this year.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s pretty high. It&#39;s about 10,000 times more dangerous than flying on a commercial airliner,&#34; George Nield, a co-author of that report, previously told Insider. Nield formerly served as the Federal Aviation Administration&#39;s associate administrator and led its Office of Commercial Space Transportation.</p><p>&#34;In order to learn how to do this safer, more reliably, and more cost effectively, many people believe we need to keep gaining experience by having more and more of these flights,&#34; he added.</p><p>Currently, no federal agency regulates the safety of passengers on private commercial spaceflights. For now, the Federal Aviation Administration&#39;s job is only to ensure that rocket launches are safe for people on the ground and don&#39;t pose a threat to other aircraft.</p><p>But in a statement emailed to Insider, the FAA said that it was &#34;reviewing&#34; the open letter.</p><p>&#34;The FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information,&#34; the

hashtag on Twitter Thursday amid renewed outrage from retail traders over allegations regarding the January 28 meme-stock trading halt.</p><p>The hashtags #ApesNotLeaving and #VladTenevLied were also trending, continuing a Twitter fight between retail traders and Citadel Securities following a class-action lawsuit that was filed in federal court in Miami on September 22. </p><p>In response to the trending hashtags, Citadel Securities <a href=\"https://twitter.com/citsecurities/status/1443660583862161417\">tweeted</a> it &#34;FIRST learned of Robinhood&#39;s trading restrictions from posts on Twitter - as evidenced by real-time communications.&#34;</p><p>The class-action lawsuit alleges that market maker Citadel Securities conspired with Robinhood to drive down the price of meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC on January 28 when buying was halted on the trading app.</p><p>&#34;On January 27, 2021, the day before the restrictions were implemented, high level employees of Citadel Securities and Robinhood had numerous communications with each other that indicate that Citadel applied pressure on Robinhood,&#34; the lawsuit states.</p><p>In response, retail traders on Twitter began tweeting about the Citadel Securities founder, promoting the hashtag #KenGriffinLied on Tuesday.</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/citadel-ken-griffin-robinhood-gamestop-meme-stocks-conspiracy-theorists-2021-9\">Citadel Securities fired back</a> in a series of tweets, saying it &#34;never requested, intimated, agreed or otherwise sought to limit or to restrict the trading&#34; of meme stocks.</p><p>&#34;It must frustrate the conspiracy theorists to no end that Vlad and I have never texted, called or met each other,&#34; he said in an emailed statement to Insider.</p><p>Robinhood&#39;s decision to halt buying of meme stocks such as GameStop prompted a <a

During the hearing, lawmakers asked Griffin if anyone in his organization pressured Robinhood to restrict trading, to which he responded, &#34;absolutely not.&#34;</p><p>In a previous statement to Insider, Robinhood said Citadel Securities and other market makers didn&#39;t pressure the trading app to restrict trading. </p><p>&#34;These complaints attempt to create a false narrative of collusion,&#34; the company said. </p><p>Robinhood&#39;s business model relies on payment for order flow, wherein users&#39; trades are routed to market makers such as Citadel Securities, which then execute the transaction and collect on the difference between the bid and ask price. The practice has come under increased scrutiny since the meme-stock saga, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering tighter regulation. </p><p>Robinhood&#39;s CEO <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-vlad-tenev-critics-target-retail-traders-gamestop-2021-9?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">hit back</a> at critics of the app and of commission-free trading this week in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/citadel-scandal-hashtag-twitter-retail-traders-meme-stocks-gamestop-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/CTeBCqks-E8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:05:34 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6155e2b67b09e80018e58e90?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"85c082701c058c24ed78f26b3d4b6568","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn55@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-30-396_1d3d6a4ed16a825a.webp","destWidth":678,"destHeight":508,"sourceBytes":16866,"destBytes":16866,"author":"ndailey@insider.com (Natasha Dailey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6155e295b414c10018631aad?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-32-758_3b65965f2ed8318b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn71@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-35-601_ab9d76fa27956e50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-31-892_55888931e604e8cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CTeBCqks-E8:mHquP9Cfeg4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-34-358_e4935ad9dccd9a30.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/CTeBCqks-E8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn59@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-35-121_8d26dae41e0495af.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085744},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"A man developed 'restless anal syndrome' weeks after recovering from a mild case of COVID-19","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/restless-anal-syndrome-man-developed-symptoms-after-covid-19-recovery-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e8fb0ee92e8ba086f4a7715?format=jpeg\" alt=\"medical coronavirus flu virus covid19 hospital doctor nurse tools stethoscope blood pressure pills vitamins medicine pharmacy pharmaceutical lab vaccine cox 28\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A 77-year-old man developed a pain deep in his anus weeks after having COVID-19.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">He had never experienced the restless discomfort before, and it didn&#39;t improve after bowel movements.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Doctors told him it was an anal variant of restless leg syndrome, which has been linked to COVID-19.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>A man in Japan developed &#34;deep anal discomfort&#34;

If you choose to transfer your holdings via ACATS, there is a $75 fee.</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\">How do I transfer assets to another brokerage?</h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">You&#39;ll need to initiate an ACATS transfer through your new brokerage. They will need your account number, which you can find under &#34;Account Information&#34; in the main menu. A quick note: Crypto holdings cannot be transferred to other brokerages. They will be liquidated, and your cash proceeds can then be transferred to your new account.</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\">What happens to my account records?</h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">For regulatory purposes, Robinhood will hold onto records of your account - including statements, trade confirmations, and tax documents - even after you&#39;ve closed it. You can continue to access them through the app. (Don&#39;t worry, re-downloading the app will not reactive your closed account.)</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\">How long does it take to close a Robinhood account?</h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">Once you&#39;ve liquidated or transferred your holdings, zeroed out your account balance, and requested the deactivation, Robinhood estimates it takes anywhere from three to five business days.</p><h2><strong>The financial takeaway</strong></h2><p>There may come a time when you&#39;re ready to delete your Robinhood account. Before doing so, you&#39;ll need to sell your holdings or transfer them to another brokerage. You should take into account possible capital gains taxes, as well as Robinhood&#39;s $75 fee for transfers, before deciding which route to take.</p><p>If you have questions about closing your account, reach out to Robinhood customer support directly.

It&#39;s time to unlearn everything you knew about car buying.</p><p>&#34;Whether or not this is your second car or your 10th car, all that stuff has to go out the window because the dynamics have become so bizarre,&#34; Ivan Drury, senior manager of insights at Edmunds, told Insider. &#34;If you go in with that same mindset, you&#39;re going to be severely disappointed.&#34;</p><p>What are those &#34;dynamics&#34; exactly? In a nutshell, the supply of used and new cars has plummeted to extreme lows, while prices have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/used-cars-shortage-prices-inflation-explained-in-three-charts-2021-7\">soared to ridiculous highs</a>. The main culprit is a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-used-cars-so-expensive-now-shortages-pandemic-rentals-2021-7\">computer chip shortage</a> that&#39;s constrained vehicle production for months, but other factors have contributed too. </p><p>It all means that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-car-prices-go-down-used-vehicles-chip-shortage-2021-9\">navigating a car purchase</a> has become much more of a headache than before. Faced with dwindling options and eye-watering price tags, shoppers&#39; central decision of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lease-or-buy-car\">whether to buy new, lease a car, or buy used</a> has gotten substantially more challenging.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking to buy new, prepare to pay sticker price - or higher - don&#39;t expect to have your pick of all the options, colors, and models you&#39;re used to at the dealership, Drury said. Dealer incentives are hard to come by and haggling for a big discount isn&#39;t going to work these days, since vehicles are flying off lots in record time. </p><p>&#34;Expect to concede defeat in one way or another,&#34; Drury said. </p><p>But buying new is still your best bet for getting the latest technology and safety features.</p><p>To make the most of a new-car purchase, consider targeting less sought-after models, says Benjamin Preston, an automotive reporter at Consumer Reports. Pickups and all-wheel-drive SUVs are in high demand, but you may find better availability and prices if you search for sedans, hatchbacks, and small, front-wheel-drive SUVs, he said. </p><p>Leasing, as in the past, is good for people looking to manage monthly payments on a larger or more expensive new vehicle they can&#39;t afford to buy outright, Preston said. Lease payments are typically cheaper than loan payments. But the downside is you&#39;re paying to rent rather than working toward paying off a vehicle you&#39;ll eventually own. </p><p>Leasing has another appeal nowadays: as a stopgap measure to avoid the chaotic car market. Those reluctant to hunt frantically for a vehicle or who can&#39;t afford to pay today&#39;s absurd markups may be better off leasing temporarily until the market settles down, Drury said. </p><p>Shoppers traditionally found the most value on the secondhand market, but that&#39;s less clear as of late. Used-car values have shot up roughly 30% over the course of the pandemic, according to Edmunds, meaning that some lightly used vehicles cost as much or more as their new counterparts. Before deciding to stomach the inflated prices, Drury recommends that buyers do plenty of research and make sure they plan to keep their vehicle for an extended period.</p><p>Shoppers may be able to get a better deal if they look at older models, according to Preston. Fortunately, in 2021, even a seven- or nine-year-old vehicle has some advanced safety features and modern tech. </p><p>Coming out satisfied in this bizarre market boils down to how much you&#39;re willing to budge on factors like price, brand, options, and how you&#39;re obtaining a vehicle, Autotrader&#39;s executive editor, Brian Moody, told Insider. </p><p>&#34;The person who&#39;s probably going to do the worst in terms of finding what they want is the person who&#39;s very rigid,&#34; he said. &#34;The person who&#39;s going to do the best is the person who&#39;s going to be the most flexible on pretty much everything.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/buy-new-car-vs-used-leasing-chip-shortage-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KoO7Pt37UKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:38:11 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6155f6b6b414c100186322cb?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"706df5fb74ded7453ccf1f98deec1e78","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn64@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-29-920_7c5493c455f861b8.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":178704,"destBytes":178704,"author":"tlevin@insider.com (Tim Levin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6102d5d8aedf2100190ef278?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn20@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-31-215_4f743943e42fb17c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn61@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-36-161_5f153fdf89d7db65.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn95@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-32-219_2b24ad1fda75a399.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KoO7Pt37UKE:F3q5EtZj-1U:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-522_1dd2e904f5a4f368.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KoO7Pt37UKE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-34-722_e84a10e278ea349a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085791},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"Marco Rubio called the $3.5 trillion Democratic spending bill 'Marxism,' the latest example of the GOP baselessly linking things they oppose to communism","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/rubio-baselessly-calls-35-trillion-democratic-spending-bill-marxism-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6155f906b414c100186323be?format=jpeg\" alt=\"marco rubio ufo report\" height=\"1249\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sen.

Polling continues to show that most Americans have <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/axios-capitalism-update/\">a negative view</a> of socialism, though there&#39;s an evident generational divide in this regard.</p><p>&#34;&#39;Socialism&#39; itself has lost some of its edge for many Americans, since they might associate it with European welfare states that aren&#39;t all that threatening,&#34; Schwartz said, adding that Rubio throwing in Marxism &#34;does add a great sinister element&#34; given the term is &#34;closely associated with the Soviet Union and all of its horrific history.&#34;</p><p>Republicans have played off of these sentiments by routinely labeling Democrats as socialists, Marxists, and communists.</p><p>During the 2020 campaign season, President Donald Trump and his allies <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-socialism-focus-line-of-attack-against-2020-democrats-2019-2\">repeatedly sought to tie Democrats to socialism.</a> This was partly linked to the fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who ran as a Democrat in 2016 and 2020, is a self-declared democratic socialist (there&#39;s a difference <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6\">between democratic socialists and socialists</a>).</p><p>The rising influence of younger, left-leaning politicians like Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York - who like Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist - has also contributed to the GOP&#39;s ongoing, misleading use of &#34;socialist&#34; as a line of attack. </p><p>But even after Joe Biden - a moderate - became the Democratic presidential nominee, Republicans did not cease the &#34;socialist&#34; attacks and fearmongering. While delivering the final speech at the 2020 Republican National Convention, for example, GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said that Biden wanted to turn the country into a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/first-night-of-rnc-was-dark-all-about-spreading-fear-2020-8\">&#34;socialist utopia.&#34;</a></p><p>Biden, who has a long, well-documented record of working with Republicans over his many years in Washington, is a centrist who often butts heads on policy with progressives and those who identify as democratic socialists. There&#39;s really no basis for calling Biden a socialist, but that&#39;s not stopping Republicans and their allies in conservative media.</p><p>&#34;The $3.5 TRILLION Biden-Bernie budget is an effort by Democrats to double-down on their plans to make America a socialist nation,&#34; Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToddYoungIN/status/1440731478216695812?s=20\">said on</a> Twitter last week. </p><p>&#34;Biden needs to realize Americans cannot afford his rapidly increasing socialist agenda,&#34; GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said in a tweet on Wednesday. </p><p>Meanwhile, Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren on Tuesday said that the spending proposed by Democrats amount to a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/tomi-lahren-biden-spending-socialist-starter-pack-debt-bomb\">&#34;socialist starter pack.&#34; </a></p><h2>Experts define Marxism, socialism, and communism</h2><p>At this point, Republicans have used &#34;socialist&#34; as an attack so often that the word has seemingly begun to lose any meaning. </p><p>&#34;This is actually a really interesting tweet,&#34; Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HC_Richardson/status/1443604415815032849?s=20\">said on Twitter</a> in response to Rubio. &#34;It is entirely meaningless, but clearly the scare word &#39;socialism&#39; no longer packs enough of a punch, so he&#39;s going for the even scarier &#39;marxism.&#39; First real tell of GOP fear I&#39;ve seen today.&#34;</p><p>Marxism, socialism, and communism are often - and incorrectly - employed interchangeably. The three are related, but also have distinctions.</p><p>&#34;Marxism is just an adjective designed to highlight Karl Marx&#39;s concept of class warfare and to give the patina of intellectual respectability to such theories,&#34; Schwartz said. </p><p>Communism, in Marx&#39;s view, was &#34;the rule by the working class over a society of political, economic, and social equality,&#34; Schwartz added. &#34;That idealist image seems never to have existed in any society that called itself communist. In fact, what you got was the oppressive rule by a small minority of privileged party bosses over a cowed and submissive population - a.k.a., the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, etc.&#34;</p><p>Socialism in the simplest terms refers to &#34;the state taking a leading role in the economy, essentially creating a welfare state that provides care for people from the cradle to the grave,&#34; Schwartz said, going on to say that there&#39;s &#34;enormous variation in states that have socialist characteristics, from the benign socialism of a Norway or Sweden to the corrupt socialism of a Venezuela.&#34;</p><p>Rubio has &#34;hurled himself into an academic debate that has been raging for decades,&#34; Lawrence Quill, professor of political science at San Jose State University, told Insider.</p><p>&#34;Socialism and Marxism both stand in contrast to capitalism and are critical of it. They share a commitment to common ownership rather than the private ownership of the &#39;means of production&#39; common to capitalist societies,&#34; Quill said. &#34;As far as I can tell, the spending bill does not advocate the abolition of the private ownership of the means of production. Sen. Rubio may therefore rest easy.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It is worth saying that Socialism is sometimes regarded as distinct from Communism, which is supposed to be the full blown realization of [Karl] Marx&#39;s goals,&#34; Quill added. &#34;We may further speculate that what Sen. Rubio was suggesting was that the Democratic spending bill was an example of Communism rather than Socialism.&#34;</p><p>Quill said if Rubio is being &#34;critical of state spending then he is in good company,&#34; and this appears to be &#34;what is really going on in that little Tweet of his.&#34;</p><p>Republicans have consistently portrayed themselves as the anti-Big Government party, and have pushed against some government spending for decades while continuing to support massive increases in defense spending. There was a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/14/trump-legacy-national-debt-increasee/\">historic rise</a> in the national debt under Trump, so they don&#39;t always practice what they preach. </p><p>As Quill put it, &#34;The utterances of politicians ought to be taken with a pinch of salt.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/rubio-baselessly-calls-35-trillion-democratic-spending-bill-marxism-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/tjzRwmeuaVY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:36:11 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6155f8797b09e80018e59661?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"18e494c2bb2534ca3b724717db3b6dcc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-30-034_fce72d9863ff1a18.webp","destWidth":2223,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":134800,"destBytes":134800,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6155f906b414c100186323be?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-31-907_a516f779377ed26b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn15@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-214_d963958d74893181.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-31-608_ed02340273d6e6b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tjzRwmeuaVY:qK427CdCzR8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn80@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-042_ac57344bb659c044.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/tjzRwmeuaVY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-30-401_b43c3f27462be20b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085841},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"Biden signs measure to keep the government funded only hours before shutdown deadline","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-approves-government-funding-extension-hours-before-shutdown-deadline-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ab2588a7708e958a7360868?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mcconnell schumer\" height=\"695\" width=\"1390\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">J.

If you want to switch from Robinhood to one of Insider&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-the-best-investment-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top-ranked</a> investment apps, you can either directly transfer securities out of Robinhood into your new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-brokerage-account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brokerage account</a>, or you can sell your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-stock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stocks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crypto</a> and transfer the money into your bank account.  </p><p>It&#39;s easy to withdraw money from Robinhood on your iOS or Android mobile device - or by using their website. If you can, it&#39;s best to withdraw your cash into the same bank account you used to fund your account. Otherwise, Robinhood may ask you for extra documents to prove that you own the bank accounts in question.  </p><h2><strong>Before you withdraw your funds</strong></h2><p>Robinhood users should look out for a few rules that limit how and when they can withdraw their cash from their accounts. </p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You may be required to wait up to five business days after depositing funds. </strong>Robinhood has an &#34;Instant Deposits&#34; policy, which means some customers can  start trading as soon as they&#39;ve moved cash into their Robinhood account from their checking or savings account. But there&#39;s a catch: even though you might be able to buy and sell stock with your &#34;instant deposits,&#34; you won&#39;t be able to transfer your cash back <em>out</em> of Robinhood right away. Once you&#39;ve moved money into your Robinhood account, you&#39;re typically required to wait up to five business days before you can move that money out. </li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>After selling stock, you must wait for the trade to settle. </strong>When you buy or sell stocks, ETFs, or options in the United States, it takes three business days for those trades to &#34;settle,&#34; which means the trade is officially complete. If you&#39;re a Robinhood Gold or a Robinhood Instant user, you may be eligible for instant settlement, which means you can withdraw any proceeds right after you sell stocks, ETFs, or, options.  </li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You can make only five withdrawals per business day. </strong>If you&#39;ve already hit that limit, you&#39;ll have to wait until the next business day to make any additional transfers.</li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You can withdraw only $50,000 per business day. </strong>If you have a large balance that exceeds that amount, you will have to withdraw money in lump sums.</li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You have to wait 30 days to withdraw funds from selling free stock. </strong>You know that <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-free-stock-sec-finra-regulation-nyse-proxy-statements-hood-2021-08\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free stock</a> you received from Robinhood&#39;s Referral program? Robinhood will let you sell that stock right away if you want, but you have to keep the cash value of that stock in your account for 30 days before you can withdraw it.  </li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>You&#39;ll face special rules if you&#39;re switching bank accounts. </strong>Watch out if you funded your Robinhood account with one bank account, and want to move your money into a <em>different</em> bank account. That can look suspicious, and Robinhood has some special rules that apply in that situation. They may ask you to send some documents to prove you&#39;re really the owner of both bank accounts, like sending pictures of your photo ID or bank statements. To avoid the hassle, it&#39;s best if you can withdraw your cash into the same bank account that funded your Robinhood account.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">You may not be able to withdraw money while your account is restricted. </strong>Robinhood sometimes restricts users&#39; accounts. That can happen if the user has a negative balance, had a bank account transaction reversed, if the user is suspected of fraud, or for a few other reasons. If your account is restricted, you may not be able to withdraw any money until you&#39;ve contacted Robinhood to clear things up.</li></ul><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>How to withdraw money from Robinhood on iOS </strong></h2><ol><li>Tap the account icon in the bottom-right corner.<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6156310300371000184303a1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A screenshot of Robinhood on iOS with a circle around the account icon, which looks like the head and torso of a person.\" height=\"219\" width=\"500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The account icon can be found at the bottom of your home screen.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Elena Botella</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li><li>Click on the three lines located in the top right corner (often called a &#34;hamburger&#34;).<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6156314500371000184303b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A screenshot of an account on Robinhood iOS with a box around the Setting menu icon, which looks like three horizontal bars stacked on each other.\" height=\"252\" width=\"410\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tap this icon to open the account&#39;s Menu.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Elena Botella</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li><li>Select <strong>Transfers</strong>.<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6156316700371000184303bb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Settings Menu on Robinhood iOS with a box around the &#34;Transfers&#34; option.\" height=\"479\" width=\"572\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Find Transfers near the top of the Menu.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Elena Botella</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li><li>Tap <strong>Transfer Money</strong>.<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/615631a0b414c10018633c3f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Transfer Money option on the Transfers screen of Robinhood iOS.\" height=\"304\" width=\"589\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;Transfer Money&#34; is the first option in the Transfers menu.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Elena Botella</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li><li>Enter the dollar amount and hit <strong>Continue</strong>.

several federal agencies, including the SEC and FBI, over $100 million in assets allegedly laundered by a former Venezuelan oil minister, according to a new report in the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-and-interactive-brokers-face-federal-scrutiny-in-venezuela-probe-11633020321\">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>The report, citing government documents and people familiar with the matter, says the federal inquiry dates back almost a decade and was accelerated by a whistleblower complaint in 2019. Neither Morgan Stanley nor IAB, the largest online brokerage, is currently accused of wrongdoing.</p><p>The probe centers around two Venezuelan men who are cousins: businessman Luis Mariano Rodriguez Cabello and former oil minister Rafael Ramírez.</p><p>Rodriguez allegedly helped launder $2 billion in illicit funds on behalf of Ramírez, who is accused of stealing the money from Venezuela&#39;s state-owned oil company using inflated contracts.</p><p>Investigators want to know why Morgan Stanley and IAB were involved in handling Rodriguez&#39;s possibly dirty money, despite the US having designated Venezuela a high-risk money laundering country over a decade ago.</p><p>According to the Journal, Rodriguez wired $108 million to his Morgan Stanley account between 2014 and 2015. A Treasury Department report found that Morgan Stanley suspected the funds were part of a money-laundering scheme, but Rodriguez was still able to move the funds to a different bank in 2017.</p><p>Then, in 2018, an associate of Rodriguez moved the money to an IAB account, despite what investigators think were obvious red flags.</p><p>Morgan Stanley declined to comment to the Journal.

During the embarkation process, rapid antigen tests were administered and <a href=\"https://www.ncl.com/sail-safe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">paid for by the cruise line</a>.

But considering a few thousand people were getting tested on the same day, the experience was quite efficient and the test itself only took a minute.</p><p>I waited for my results in a crowded room of eager cruisers, but everyone wore masks so I wasn't too worried about the large group.&#160;</p><p>Test results take anywhere between 15 minutes to two hours, depending on how many were being conducted at a given time.

There was some crowding in ports, but mostly due to a shuttle system that could use improvements.&#160;</p><p>Mostly, though, I loved sailing on a 100% vaccinated cruise. I felt confident in <a href=\"https://www.ncl.com/sail-safe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">NCL's health protocols</a>, and safe knowing that everyone around me was vaccinated and tested negative prior to boarding.

Norwegian Cruise Line first <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/norwegian-cruise-line-restarts-sailing-pandemic-covid-greek-isles-jade-2021-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to sailing in the Greek Isles</a> this summer, while their first cruise from a U.S. port in over 500 days started in Seattle in August 2021 to relaunch the Alaska cruise season. The first sailings to relaunch from Los Angeles will take place in October 2021 aboard the Norwegian Bliss.&#160;</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\"><strong>Will Norwegian Cruise Lines require a COVID vaccine?</strong></h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">Yes, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cruisedirect.com%2Fcruise-line%2Fnorwegian-cruise-line\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Norwegian Cruise Line</a> is sailing with a <a href=\"https://www.ncl.com/sail-safe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">100% vaccination requirement</a> for crew and guests, no exceptions. While that means younger kids who don't yet qualify for vaccination aren't able to sail quite yet, it does mean guests are assured that all fellow passengers are completely vaccinated.&#160;</p><p class=\"faq-answer\">Ships have also been fitted with medical-grade air filtration systems and are constantly cleaned and sanitized. A dedicated Public Health Officer oversees each sailing to ensure no suspicious sniffle goes undiagnosed.&#160;&#160;</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\"><strong>I'm vaccinated. Do I still have to take a COVID test before sailing on Norwegian Cruise Line?&#160;</strong></h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">Yes, in addition to the 100% vaccination policy, all NCL guests must currently take a pre-cruise COVID test on the day of embarkation. This test is administered and paid for by the cruise line, so passengers won't have to make their own arrangements or spend extra money. Rapid tests are conducted at the port, prior to boarding.&#160;</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\"><strong>My kids aren't vaccinated. Can they cruise with me?</strong></h3><p class=\"faq-answer\">Since the policy prohibits minors who aren't yet eligible for vaccines to sail, only vaccinated children can cruise right now.

The vaccination and testing requirement combined means guests can enjoy all parts of the ship without social distancing or wearing a mask.</p><p class=\"faq-answer\">However, when visiting ports of call, passengers will need to follow local health guidelines, including mask mandates where applicable.&#160;</p><h3 class=\"faq-question\"><strong>How else is NCL ensuring guest safety aboard their cruises?</strong></h3><p class=\"faq-answer\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cruisedirect.com%2Fcruise-line%2Fnorwegian-cruise-line\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Norwegian Cruise Line</a> has a new, staggered embarkation process to streamline check-in and get passengers on their way to vacation fun faster than ever.

affecting millions of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-phones\">Android</a> users.</p><p>The scam took place via more than 200 apps run by attackers to scam money from its downloaders, security firm <a href=\"https://blog.zimperium.com/grifthorse-android-trojan-steals-millions-from-over-10-million-victims-globally/\">Zimperium</a> reported.</p><p>Zimperium, a member of the Google App Defense Alliance which scans applications before publishing in the Google Play Store, estimates that 10 million Android users globally were affected by this <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-phishing\">scam</a>.</p><p>The applications posed as seemingly normal downloads, hiding under facades like &#34;Photo Effect Pro,&#34; &#34;Daily Horoscope &#38; Life Palmestry,&#34; and &#34;Free Coupons 2021.&#34; The apps would notify downloaders that they won a prize and would redirect them to enter their phone number on a specific webpage.</p><p>However, by entering their information, users were actually submitting their <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-spam-robocalls-how-to-stop-them-2021-3\">phone number</a> to an SMS service that would start charging their phone bill about $42 per month. </p><p>&#34;Forensic evidence of this active Android Trojan attack, which we have named GriftHorse, suggests that the threat group has been running this campaign since November 2020,&#34; Zimperium stated in their findings. &#34;These malicious applications were initially distributed through both Google Play and third-party application stores.&#34;</p><p>Scams like GriftHorse take advantage of small screens, local trust, and misinformation to trick users into falling for their scams and <a

Elizabeth Warren - one of the biggest advocates for student-loan borrowers in Congress - joined President Joe Biden&#39;s ranks on Thursday.</p><p>Before leaving for recess, the Senate confirmed Rohit Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the government&#39;s consumer protection and oversight agency. Chopra previously served in the CFPB as its first student-loan ombudsman, and he was with Warren when she created the agency in 2011 to ensure people across the country are being financially protected. Now, he joins CFPB as student-loan companies face more stringent regulations leading up to February&#39;s payment restart after more than a year&#39;s pause. In recent weeks, three servicers have said they&#39;ll be shutting down, leaving 16 million borrowers to transition to new companies.</p><p>After Chopra&#39;s nomination was announced in January, Warren wrote on Twitter that she worked closely with him &#34;to set up the CFPB and fight for America&#39;s children.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s terrific that President-elect Biden picked Rohit to run the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFPB\">@CFPB</a>,&#34; Warren wrote. &#34;He&#39;s been a fearless champion for consumers at the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) and will be a fearless champion leading the consumer agency.&#34;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Elizabeth Warren  (@SenWarren) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1351168329071915008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 18, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Chopra left the CFPB in 2015 and was sworn in as a Federal Trade Commissioner in 2018, during which he worked to protect consumers from unfair business practices. But his work at the agency suggests the student-loan industry will be facing much stricter oversight from here on out.</p><p>As the agency&#39;s first student-loan watchdog, he primarily focused on unearthing problems with student-loan companies and ensuring the millions of borrowers across the country were not being mistreated. Chopra helped President Barack Obama establish the Student Aid Bill of Rights, which improves how the companies interact with borrowers, and in 2013, he led the bureau in discovering that more than 7 million borrowers were in default on their debt.</p><p>Since then, the CFPB has revealed a number of findings of student-loan abuses, and in some cases, has taken legal action against the companies. For example, the agency <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/\">sued</a> Navient, one of the biggest student-loan servicing companies in the US, in 2017 for &#34;illegally failing borrowers at every stage of repayment,&#34; including causing borrowers to take on more debt than they could pay off. </p><p>Now that Chopra is confirmed to lead the agency, he will likely continue enforcing fair student lending. During his March confirmation hearing, Chopra said he will focus on protecting Americans with debt and he acknowledged the challenges that will come in February when the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-debt-cancellation-payment-pause-borrowers-disabilities-defrauded-2021-6\">student-loan payment pause</a> lifts.</p><p>&#34;We are at a critical moment when so many borrowers are going to have to restart their payments,&#34; Chopra said during the hearing. He added that he will ensure the restart is &#34;happening lawfully so we can avoid an avalanche of defaults when any moratorium might end.&#34;</p><p><a

at the end of this year, bringing additional administrative hurdles to the already substantial burden the Education Department has with resuming payment collections for 43 million borrowers. </p><p>And Richard Cordray, the head of the Federal Student Aid office and <a

The <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/scotus-texas-enforce-6-week-abortion-ban-5-4-ruling-2021-9\">narrow 5-4 decision was handed</a> down on its emergency docket without a full briefing and oral arguments, a process that some experts have called the &#34;shadow docket.&#34;</p><p>Alito criticized the &#34;shadow docket&#34; term and said members of the media and politicians who&#39;ve used the phrase are painting Supreme Court procedure as &#34;sneaky and dangerous&#34; and &#34;sinister.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The truth is there was nothing new or shadowy about the procedures we followed,&#34; the associate justice told an audience at the University of Notre Dame.</p><p>He added that &#34;this portrayal feeds unprecedented efforts to intimidate the court or damage it as an independent institution.&#34;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Mark Joseph Stern  (@mjs_DC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1443655119086755852?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Alito&#39;s remarks come a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine the court&#39;s use of the &#34;shadow docket&#34; and the Texas abortion decision. Democrats attacked the court&#39;s conduct, whereas Republicans came to its defense.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups, Democratic leaders, and other critics have slammed the court&#39;s Texas decision, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-texas-6-week-abortion-law-violates-roe-v-wade-2021-9\">saying it violated</a> the 1973 landmark ruling Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion until about 24 weeks of pregnancy. </p><p>During his hour-long lecture on Thursday, Alito rejected such criticisms as &#34;false and inflammatory.&#34;</p><p>&#34;We did no such thing and we said that expressly in our order,&#34; he said.</p><p>In an unsigned opinion, the court&#39;s majority said the Texas decision was technical and not based on the substance of the law, which could still be legally challenged. The court in December will hear a major abortion case concerning a Mississippi law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. </p><p>Alito&#39;s comments echo recent remarks made by his fellow justices Stephen Breyer, Amy Coney Barrett, and Clarence Thomas, who have all<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-dangerous-branch-government-abortion-barrett-breyer-2021-9\"> defended</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/barrett-breyer-say-scotus-isnt-political-but-ignore-realities-experts-say-2021-9\">the court against negative perceptions.</a> The court currently faces low public approval ratings, according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-court-approval-all-time-low-abortion-37-quinnipiac-poll-2021-9\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx\">polls</a>.</p><p>In a question-and-answer portion at the end of his remarks, Alito pushed back on views that the court behaves like a &#34;policy-making body,&#34; saying that justices have different &#34;judicial philosophies&#34; and don&#39;t make decisions based on &#34;what we personally would favor.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/justice-samuel-alito-defends-supreme-courts-texas-abortion-decision-2021-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8YEs_CyuOMI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:59:56 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/61560d5a7b09e80018e59e4b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9a17506ab0ad3e2655ae25395ccaf44b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-29-937_c516a08aeb727756.webp","destWidth":3356,"destHeight":2517,"sourceBytes":677544,"destBytes":677544,"author":"oseddiq@insider.com (Oma Seddiq)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/61560d5fb414c10018632cad?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-36-042_20bdca270be2e629.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn23@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-33-762_29e65d0237dc32f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-34-782_f7d2671a1f64d3de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8YEs_CyuOMI:1ZG2Mf0xL7U:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn35@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-646_b6d0d744f550a88a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8YEs_CyuOMI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-30-233_b1d41ef227d4f19c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085588},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"The Fab 5 of 'Queer Eye' gets a makeover as Lego bricks - get this awesome recreation of their stylish loft","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/lego-queer-eye-fab-five-loft-2021-9","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-reviews-expertise-in-product-reviews\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6154d5a42fb46b0019beab71?format=jpeg\" alt=\"An overview shot of the Lego Queer Eye Fab Five Loft set inside a home.\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lego</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Lego gives The Fab Five from Netflix&#39;s &#34;Queer Eye&#34;

And with people in some parts of the world back on the move, marketers are once again thinking about the applications of mobility data in their ad campaigns.</p><p>Top marketers from companies including Chipotle, Walmart, Turo, and ad agency Essence joined Insider for a virtual roundtable event, &#34;The Future of Mobility: Data Driving Innovation,&#34; presented by Arity, on Tuesday, September 28. They discussed how mobility data can transform future consumer experiences.</p><p>They discussed how to use mobility data to make ad campaigns more useful for people, how to sift through the data to find the most relevant nuggets, and how to best measure the success of mobility ads.</p><h2><strong>Mobility data can help make ads more useful for consumers</strong></h2><p>The ubiquity of mobile phones can unlock new insights for marketers when it comes to targeting potential customers. </p><p>But people can get annoyed - or worse, spooked - if the ads they&#39;re served aren&#39;t relevant, Saleel Sathe, Walmart&#39;s VP of performance marketing, said.</p><p>When Uber pushes an <a href=\"https://www.ubereats.com/\">UberEats</a> discount code on someone&#39;s Uber app while they are on their way back home from the airport, or Walmart Plus alerts members to discounts when they are in the vicinity of a store, they are using mobility data in the right context, he said.</p><p>Jason Harrison, North America CEO of Essence, agreed that there&#39;s a fine line between being useful and being creepy.</p><h2><strong>Loyalty programs and mobility data can go hand-in-hand</strong></h2><p>Brands have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pg-nfl-using-games-and-quizzes-gather-first-party-data-2021-2\">accelerated their first-party data-collection efforts</a> as privacy regulation gains steam and platforms clamp down on ad targeting. One way of doing that is through loyalty programs, which can enhance their ads when coupled with mobility data, Chris Brand, chief marketing officer at Chipotle, said.</p><p>Chipotle, for example, makes sure that it offers people something valuable whenever it uses mobility data, like informing its app users that might be coming into a restaurant that mobile pickup might be faster, he said.</p><p>Relevant offers are key to engagement, he added.</p><p>And doing this right can also lead to better returns in the long run. Chipotle&#39;s loyalty program has helped the restaurant chain swiftly grow its digital sales, which have now surpassed $2 billion. Chipotle has been able to drive more incremental transactions from loyalty members compared to non-loyalty members, he said.</p><h2><strong>Testing and targeting using mobility data</strong></h2><p>The precision that mobility data offers in terms of targeting may be enticing, but it&#39;s important to not get carried away and test different creative with different audiences, Kelly McGee, director of digital marketing at Jersey Mike&#39;s Subs, said. </p><p>Marketers shouldn&#39;t shy away from testing out smaller <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/micromarketing.asp#:~:text=Micromarketing%20is%20an%20advertising%20strategy,geared%20toward%20that%20specific%20group.\">micro-campaigns</a> and seeing what sticks, Fred Bucher, CMO of the Weather Channel, said .</p><p>But Chipotle&#39;s Brandt warned against the temptation to get too targeted, saying that the audience segments should remain broad.

Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law on Thursday that aims to increase the accountability of law enforcement in the state of California.</p><p>&#34;I am here as governor mindful that we are in the juxtaposition of being a leader on police reform, and being a laggard on police reform,&#34; said Newsom during a ceremony where he signed the bill. </p><p>Newsom had until October 10 to sign or veto the bill, which passed the final concurrence vote in Senate on Wednesday (28-9). It was previously passed in the state Senate on May 26 with a vote of 26 to 9 and the state Assembly with a vote of 46 to 18 on September 3.</p><p>The law adjusts qualified immunity - the defense that protects state and local government officials, including law enforcement, from individual liability unless there is a clear violation of constitutional rights - for law enforcement.</p><p>It will set up a process by which law enforcement officers charged with wrongdoing - including sexual assault, excessive use of force, and perjury - are stripped of their badges.</p><p>Newsom also signed Assembly Bill 89, raising the legal age for police officers from 18-years-old to 21-years-old.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#34;This is a major victory for advocates of public safety,&#34; said Senator Bradford in <a href=\"https://sd35.senate.ca.gov/news/2021-09-08-sb-2-kenneth-ross-jr-police-decertification-act-2021-approved-legislature\">a press release</a>. &#34;California and the nation as a whole has experienced tragedy after tragedy where consequences for egregious abuses of power went unpunished and cries for accountability went unanswered- eroding public trust in law enforcement.&#34;</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#34;This bill is about coming together to root out and remove systemic racism that lurks within our institutions, preventing more violence against people of color, and increasing safety and equality for all who call California home - that work continues,&#34; said Senate President pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins in the same statement. &#34;Our work will not end with this bill&#39;s passage - and we won&#39;t rest until the system changes.&#34; </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill, which failed in the California legislature last year, reemerged as a result of the George Floyd protests.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California was one of only four states - Hawaii, New Jersey, and Rhode Island are the others - without a decertification process for police officers which meant officers that engage in misconduct could still get jobs in different departments.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><biembeddedobject id=\"01c06da5-792d-48ea-bc72-c2fbbd9f31bb\" class=\"raw mceNonEditable\"> </biembeddedobject></div><p> </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California bill, co-authored by state Sen. Toni Atkins, is similar to the decertification process in Massachusetts, which just <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2021/01/09/new-massachusetts-law-will-decertify-rogue-cops-revoke-their-immunity/?sh=401fca2b5297\">became law in January 2021</a>.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#34;California is able to revoke the certification or licenses of bad doctors, lawyers, and even barbers and cosmetologists, but is unable to decertify police officers who have broken the law and violated the public trust,&#34; said Sen. Steven Bradford, also a co-author of the bill, pointed out to Insider in August.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officers accused of misconduct would undergo a fair review process, per the bill, and those convicted of a crime would be registered into the National Decertification Index. This would prohibit them from working in law enforcement in states that have a decertification process. </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Bradford, who represents Gardena, California, the implications of the law hit close to home. <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB2\">California Senate Bill 2</a>, or Kenneth Ross Jr. Decertification Act, is named after a 25-year-old Black man who was killed by Gardena Police Officer Michael Robbins on April 11, 2018.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#34;No mother should have to live with the kind of pain that I live with every day. This Act gives us the ability to decertify cops who kill and abuse our people. With this Act, my son&#39;s spirit lives on and protects our communities from police who bring harm,&#34; Fouzia Almarou, Ross Jr.&#39;s mother, said in a written statement.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The killing of Kenneth Ross Jr.</strong></h2><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police received calls on a Wednesday afternoon in 2018 about a shooting in front of a building on Van Ness Ave. in Gardena, according to a report from then-<a href=\"https://da.lacounty.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/JSID-OIS-05-2019-Ross.pdf\">District Attorney Jackie Lacey</a>. One caller estimated that 20 shots were fired. According to the report, the suspect was described as a Black man with locs near El Segundo Blvd and Van Ness Ave.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several officers responded, including Sergeant Michael Robbins. Ross Jr. was running away when officers shouted commands at him. Robbins, using a department-issued AR-15 rifle, fired two shots as Ross Jr. was running away.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video footage from officer body cameras and dash cameras was released nearly two years later. His mother describes the video of the incident at multiple rallies. She said that after Robbins shot and killed him, they still handcuffed and searched his body.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gardena Police Department said in a <a href=\"http://www.gardenapd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Statement-on-Kenneth-Ross-Shooting-Dec-2018-FINAL.pdf\">press release</a> that a gun was found on the scene and that he&#39;d fired a gun earlier.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ross family attorney disputes this claim, however. &#34;They said he had a gun. We have the video of when he fell,&#34; Haytham Faraj told <a href=\"https://abc7.com/kenneth-ross-jr-gardena-police-shooting-ois-michael-robbins/5872326/\">local news station KABC</a>. &#34;They then handcuff him to search him.

bureaucratic roadblock along the way.</p><p>The group of US citizens, green card holders, and special immigrant visa holders departed the Kabul airport on Tuesday after receiving clearance from the Taliban, according to Jen Wilson, a volunteer with the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/project-dynamo-and-human-first-coalition-bring-americans-home-from-afghanistan-1030829092\">civilian rescue organization Project Dynamo.</a></p><p>The organization believes theirs is the first private rescue mission to escape Afghanistan since the <a

shortly after departing the country earlier this week, the mission encountered another hurdle: the Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/afganistan-evacuation-plane-us-citizens-homeland-security-refused-entry-report-2021-9\">would not allow the charter flight to land in the US.</a></p><p>As soon as the plane took off, Wilson said the crew&#39;s flight clearance for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was revoked. When the plane rerouted to Dulles International Airport in Virginia, the same thing happened.</p><p>&#34;And then we went to Philly and Philly did the same, and then suddenly it was all ports of entry,&#34; Wilson said. </p><p>&#34;It was heartbreaking. It was infuriating,&#34; she said. &#34;Because we had just caught the high after we got them out and saved them. We were all crying the minute they went wheels up from Kabul and were so relieved.&#34;</p><p>A spokesperson from the State Department acknowledged the situation on Tuesday, telling <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/department-of-homeland-security/574417-dhs-not-allowing-charter-flight\">The Hill</a> that the agency was working to vet the travelers after they were stranded in the United Arab Emirates. Among the evacuated passengers were 59 children younger than 18 and 16 kids under the age of 3, according to <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/project-dynamo-and-human-first-coalition-bring-americans-home-from-afghanistan-301387183.html\">Project Dynamo</a>.</p><p>Wilson said their organization was initially told private charters weren&#39;t allowed into the US. After pushing back, the State Department reportedly cited a measles outbreak as cause for concern. But Wilson said all passengers on board had been vaccinated against the measles, mumps, and rubella. They were also tested and vaccinated against COVID-19.</p><p>Despite the setback, Wilson said the passengers were just grateful to be free of the Taliban.</p><p>&#34;They were trapped for the moment and it sucked, but they were at least safe,&#34; she said. </p><p>The State Department eventually granted the group entry into the US, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-bars-flight-landing-with-americans-kabul-activists-2021-09-29/\">saying</a> US Embassy staff in the United Arab Emirates worked around the clock to verify passenger information and coordinate with officials on the ground to ensure everyone was vetted before arriving in the US.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); data.width~540;\">\n\t<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n\t\t<div style=\"background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div style=\"background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p style=\"margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUbuQt2sRkq\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by PROJECT DYNAMO (@projectdynamo)<time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"\"></time>\n\t\t</p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" defer=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script><p> </p><p>The group&#39;s plane landed in Chicago on Thursday afternoon.

It uses an online Palate Profile and your own ratings to recommend and ship the best wines for your tastes, so you don&#39;t spend an inordinate amount of time in the wine aisle deciphering labels and ultimately just choosing the one that looks the prettiest. There&#39;s no fee or commitment to join, and you can skip the month&#39;s shipment any time you want. If you don&#39;t like the idea of a monthly subscription, the brand also offers an a la carte shop for members, with discounted pricing on wines.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa076dc69331a0011bc6d5c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Winc intro image\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Winc/Instagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Though I wouldn&#39;t call myself a complete amateur and I know generally what types of wine I like, I am also eons away from becoming that person at the party who casually swishes her glass and rattles off tasting notes. Instead, I am more often the person who gushes over the cheese and charcuterie paired with the wine.</p><p>But I do enjoy popping a bottle open for special and casual occasions alike, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winc.com%2Ftry%2Flp1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Winc</a> is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wine-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of the services I use</a> to get me those bottles.</p><h2>How to use your Winc membership</h2><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Subscription frequency:</strong> Every month</li><li><strong>Shipping fee: </strong>$9 for orders of three bottles or fewer; free for orders of four bottles or more</li><li><strong>A la carte shop: </strong>Yes</li></ul></aside><p>New members will fill out a short questionnaire called the Palate Profile, which asks things like how you like your coffee, and how much you like flavors such as citrus and mushrooms. </p><p>Then, Winc offers a selection of wine bottles it thinks you should try. Winc works with vineyards and winemakers all over the world to make these varietals. Since its launch, Winc has produced more than 664 wines from 78 grape varieties and 97 regions across 12 different countries. You may see some of these wines also sold at Whole Foods, Vons, and Kroger stores. Winc uses subscriber data and ratings to decide what to produce next, so you&#39;ll see a lot of bottles that line up with emerging wine trends. </p><p>You can read up on the details of each bottle - its tasting notes, ratings from other Winc members, and its body and sweetness levels - before deciding whether to add it to your shipment. </p><p>Your monthly box includes three bottles, and you can add as many additional bottles as you&#39;d like. Shipping is $9 for orders of three bottles and free for any order larger than that. There are also regular discounts to take advantage of. </p><p>Anyone can order wines to be delivered at any time, but you&#39;ll get special discounted pricing if you become a member. On the 16th of every month, you&#39;ll be charged $59.95 and receive credits to buy four bottles of wine. Any unused credits can be rolled over, and you can always skip a month. </p><p>If you prefer even more flexibility, we recommend skipping the membership and buying wine from Winc whenever you want. You&#39;ll still be able to take and update your Palate Profile in order to receive recommendations. </p><h2>Review of Winc</h2><p>My bottles have always arrived securely packed in a box that also has a carry handle for convenient transport. In the past, shipments have come with a fun A-Z guide of important wine and Winc terms, but you can now find all this info, along with your specific bottles&#39; tasting notes, on the website.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa0777769331a0011bc6d61?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Winc 3 image\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I don&#39;t usually love heavy, full-bodied wines, so I generally opt for lighter, medium-bodied bottles and a diverse variety of tasting notes. On your Winc profile, you can revisit the details of each wine and also figure out what types of food to pair it with. </p><p>In my most recent test of the service, I enjoyed the 2019 Pacificana Cabernet Sauvignon (currently unavailable), which was surprising because it&#39;s full-bodied. In the past, the 2018 Cape Route Chenin Blanc (no longer available) helped pave the way for my current love of the varietal. </p><p>If you really love a specific wine in your shipment, I recommend re-ordering it sooner rather than later. Winc is constantly updating its stock and product turnover is high, so there&#39;s no guarantee your favorite bottle will be there in a few weeks. </p><p>I haven&#39;t loved everything I&#39;ve tried through Winc, including a Touriga Nacional and a Valdiguié, but I ultimately appreciated that the site even offered so many varietals for me to try. With Winc, I&#39;ve been able to learn more about what wines to avoid and what wines to explore more. Anyway, I&#39;m able to rate all my bottles on my Winc profile so I could get better recommendations for my next box. In addition to a star rating, you can enter notes to refer back to later.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa16dcf69331a0011bc6eda?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Winc ratings image\" height=\"600\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Winc</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The next time you visit the Wines page, your recommended bottles will float right to the top, making it easy to add them to your box. Other than the provided recommendations, feel free to browse the rest of Winc&#39;s wines, which include categories like Sparkling, Vegan, and California. The site is easy to navigate and neatly organized so you can find exactly what you want, while also providing enough discovery opportunities to help you stumble upon something new and interesting. </p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>There&#39;s no need to be stuffy about or intimidated by wine - Winc&#39;s easy-to-use platform lets you get past your limited wine experience to fully enjoy a glass (or two, or three).</p><p>Its wine is also pretty affordable, starting at just $13 and maxing out around $32 per bottle. If you want to discover your next favorite wine without spending a lot of money or pulling your hair out over its complexities, there&#39;s no better place than Winc.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"medium\" data-pid=\"5db1b98ddee0190ff2107184\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Monthly Wine Subscription (3 bottles) (medium)</bi-shortcode><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/winc-wine-review'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8vPxqCEpxwI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 19:12:22 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fa075d791178a0019b3dc8c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5b78deb674952075a031871ea0c04b6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-22-328_06a0437a665d79de.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":36048,"destBytes":36048,"author":"cchen@insider.com (Connie Chen)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fa075d791178a0019b3dc8c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-22-328_06a0437a665d79de.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fa076dc69331a0011bc6d5c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn95@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-35-739_e93bfabcd77b9e2a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fa0777769331a0011bc6d61?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-33-213_3beb4ab802c107dc.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fa16dcf69331a0011bc6eda?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn35@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-34-327_0d8c2ec769231a49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-34-915_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-31-598_b95548b26cbdb0a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn75@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-36-353_0a3fb0780f029889.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-33-043_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8vPxqCEpxwI:IWx4EX5Dmgk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn80@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-33-556_30d27114fdceae96.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8vPxqCEpxwI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn43@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-35-762_a533a3b28f23e544.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054085847},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:05","title":"SEC's Gary Gensler warns a lot of people are 'likely to get hurt' without crypto rules like those for bank deposits, insurance","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/gary-gensler-sec-chair-cryptocurrency-rules-regulation-people-hurt-2021-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6108ff5dc31de7001849e93e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gary Gensler SEC Chair Securities and Exchange Commission\" height=\"1500\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Gary Gensler became chair of the SEC in April.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alex Wong/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Gary Gensler warned that crypto investors are &#34;likely to get hurt&#34;

We respect your choice.</p><p>But the kindest thing our reporters, Jen Gushue and James Brains, who <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-air-fryer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have tested dozens of the things</a>, have to say about air fryers is this: &#34;The results are more like oven roasting at a high heat - still a delicious end result, but you won&#39;t fool anyone into thinking you just pulled those chicken wings out of a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-deep-fryer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deep fryer</a>.&#34;</p><p>Essentially, an air fryer is a convection toaster that doesn&#39;t toast, which is absurd in my book.</p><h3>The term &#34;air fryer&#34; is just a marketing ploy for technology that has existed for decades</h3><p>This is a plea, not in condescension, not out of derision or scorn, but for the sake of all things honest and decent in the worldwide web of consumerism. Don&#39;t fall for marketing ploys that clutter your kitchen.</p><p>Convection cooking (the technology behind air fryers) has been around since the early 1900s, and in home kitchens since at least 1945 in the form of your trusty ol&#39; toaster oven. </p><p>With the addition of a wire tray and a metal sheet pan, any decent convection toaster oven will achieve what an air &#34;fryer&#34; can and more. It can bake, roast, and broil, and it can even <em>toast</em>! Oh, the novelty! Further, thanks to the internal fan that prevents hot and cold spots, a convection toaster oven arguably works better than the regular oven.</p><h3>Most air fryers are awkwardly shaped and sized</h3><p>Consider how many batches it would take to cook for even just two, let alone four, in an air fryer. And while the footprint might be a little smaller, it won&#39;t fit as neatly into a corner or beneath a cabinet in the way that a boxier, prettier, and usually stainless-steel convection toaster oven would.</p><h3>The bottom line: skip the air fryer, buy the toaster oven</h3><p>But for goodness sake, I implore you one more time to save your wallet, your precious counter space - and its aesthetic - and stay away from the bulbous, plastic, hard-to-clean, single-serve pod air fryers that everyone seems to be buying and hawking. Do yourself one better and just stick with the classic toaster oven you probably already have, and if you want to use it to air fry, a roasting pan and wire rack is all you need.</p><p>Below are convection toasters recommended by our expert home appliance tester and reviewer, James Brains, <a

The company has more than <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/storythreads/2021-09-21/why-is-everyone-talking-about-evergrande?cmpid=BBD092321_BIZ&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=210923&utm_campaign=bloombergdaily&sref=BLKWHazcly&#38;sref=BLKWHazc\">$300 billion in debt</a>, making it the most indebted company in the world.

According to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the total value of the market hit $52 trillion in 2019 - twice the size of the US residential housing market, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fchina-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported. The sector accounts for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea1b79bf-cbe3-41d9-91da-0a1ba692309f?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20210924&utm_term=5794355&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=5959001&orgid=330&utm_att1=nprnewsgid=330&#38;utm_att1=nprnews\">29%</a> of China&#39;s gross domestic product (GDP). And its cities are growing rapidly: In 2019, China recorded a 60% <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1144ffe-30f9-41d3-b033-bb82eca258b4?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20210924&utm_term=5794355&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=5959001&orgid=330&utm_att1=nprnewsgid=330&#38;utm_att1=nprnews\">urbanization</a> rate.</p><p>But a lot of that real estate is empty. An estimated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-27/vacant-apartments-strain-china-s-housing-market?sref=BLKWHazc&utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20210924&utm_term=5794355&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=5959001&orgid=330&utm_att1=nprnewsp;orgid=330&#38;utm_att1=nprnews\">65 million homes</a> - 20% of the total supply - in China are unoccupied. Not only is this high by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fchina-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517\">international standards</a>, it means there are enough empty houses in China to house the entire <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/\">population</a> of France.</p><p>Homeownership rates in the country are also high. More than 90% of households in China are homeowners, according to a January research <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546956/\">paper</a> on homeownership in China from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The US, for comparison, has a 65% <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf\">homeownership</a> rate.</p><p>&#34;Over the past two or three decades, the price of Chinese real estate has gone up,&#34; Sun said. &#34;This has generated a popular belief in China that real estate is always safe to invest in.&#34;</p><h2>How much do homes in China cost relative to income?</h2><p>The average cost of a home varies vastly depending on the region and city.</p><p>In China&#39;s tier-one cities - like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen - housing costs around 14 times as much as the average salary, a 2020 report from the <a href=\"https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/working-papers/housing-affordability-in-chinese-cities\">Lincoln Institute of Land Policy</a> found. In tier-two cities, homes cost roughly seven times the average salary, the report shows. And in tier three, four, and five cities, home prices are about five times as high as the average salary.</p><p>In some tier one cities, home prices per square meter are on par with what you would find in some of the world&#39;s most expensive cities, per a WSJ <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fchina-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517\">report</a> that compared prices in China&#39;s Tianjin and London. </p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61541af0b414c1001862d9cd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Aerial view of an Evergrande housing development in Wuhan, China\" height=\"1998\" width=\"2669\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>In 2015, Evergrande real estate acquired four super large projects in Haikou, Wuhan and Huizhou, with a total construction area of nearly 4 million square meters and a total amount of 13.5 billion yuan. Evergrande, China&#39;s largest property developer, is facing a liquidity crisis with total debts of around $300 billion. The problems faced by the company could impact China’s economy, and the global economy at large.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty Images / Stringer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><h2>How much debt does an average borrower in China get exposed to in order to buy a home?</h2><p>Household exposure to debt is lower in China than in many other developed countries, but it still forms a significant part of their portfolio. </p><p>&#34;The debt level is lower in China than what you would see in other countries, for example, Thailand or Malaysia,&#34; Bernard Aw, an economist overseeing Asia Pacific for Coface, told Insider. &#34;Chinese citizens have high savings rates - about 40% of their money goes into savings.&#34;</p><p>They also tend to employ personal lending networks in order to purchase homes. At least 40% of China&#39;s millennial homeowners received money from their families to help pay for their houses, a <a href=\"https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/media/media-release/2017/170227-hsbc-beyond-the-bricks-press-release-generation-buy.pdf\">2017 HSBC survey</a> on millennials found. </p><p>That said, the majority of debt in Chinese households is property-based, Aw said, and household debt has been on the rise since the financial crisis. In 2020, household debt rose to 128% of income, according to a <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/china-household-debt/\">report</a> from China-focused researcher Rhodium Group. At the end of 2018, housing-related debt accounted for nearly two-thirds of the average household&#39;s total debt, according to a 2019 report from the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Individual wealth in China is also heavily tied to real estate.</p><p>According to Moody&#39;s estimates, 70-80% of Chinese household assets are tied to real estate, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/chinese-regulators-meet-with-developer-evergrande-as-scrutiny-on-real-estate-grows.html\">CNBC</a> reported in August.</p><p>That&#39;s more individual wealth tied to real estate than in just about any other developed country, Sun said: &#34;In the west, people diversify their investments and the majority goes to capital markets.&#34; But in China, where the capital markets are less developed and highly volatile, people keep much more of their money invested in real estate.</p><p>Household spending on real estate is also high, Aw said: &#34;Some 30-40% of household spending is going into the real estate sector, be that rental payment or mortgages, for example.&#34; This percentage is similar to how much Americans spend on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-save-more-money-2017-8\">housing</a>. </p><h2>How is China planning to deal with its real estate debt?</h2><p>Beijing is already pressuring government-affiliated developers to buy up Evergrande&#39;s assets, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-asking-state-backed-firms-pick-up-evergrande-assets-sources-2021-09-28/\">Reuters</a> reported.

And at a time when practically every car company is transitioning away from fossil fuels and battery-powered trucks are becoming the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-pickup-truck-comparison-tesla-cybertruck-rivian-r1t-2020-2#top-speed-tesla-cybertruck-4\">new rage</a>, Rivian has somehow beaten everyone else to the punch. </p><p>Not only is Rivian&#39;s truck the first of its kind - it&#39;s good. Really good.</p><p>I know this because Rivian invited me out to Colorado earlier in September to spend a few days getting to know the R1T inside and out. I scrambled up mountain passes, cruised sweeping highways, and got up close to the myriad of thoughtful features the truck has to offer. </p><p>More on all of that soon. But first, some background. </p><h2><strong>The 2022 Rivian R1T: A groundbreaking electric pickup</strong></h2><p>For the uninitiated, the R1T is the debut vehicle from Rivian, a California startup, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-creating-fleet-of-electric-delivery-vehicles-rivian-2020-2\">backed by Amazon</a>, that&#39;s been working toward its first street-ready model since 2009. No US upstart since Tesla has succeeded in selling consumer electric vehicles at any sort of scale, making the R1T a big deal for Rivian and the global movement toward greener cars. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61521c56b414c10018629ac6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"[EMBARGO 9/28 DNP] Rivian R1T\" height=\"1875\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Rivian R1T.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The R1T is medium-sized as far as pickups go. It&#39;s a little bigger than a Toyota Tacoma or Ford Ranger but a good deal smaller than full-size models like the Tundra or F-150. It&#39;s more luxe than any of those trucks, though, and carries a starting price of $67,500. </p><p>Those basic R1Ts will be available in January 2022. The first trucks getting shipped to customers this month are Launch Edition versions of the fancier Adventure trim, which starts at $73,000. Opt for accessories like a roof rack, a bed-mounted tent, a slide-out camping kitchen, and a swankier interior, and you&#39;re looking at a price tag closer to $100,000. </p><h2><strong>It crawls and cruises like a champ</strong></h2><p>The bulk of my experience in the R1T happened off-road, so let&#39;s start there. Rivian bills its vehicles as being for outdoorsy people who like skiing, camping, and the like, so the ability to confidently venture off the beaten path is central to Rivian&#39;s entire ethos. </p><p>Powered by four torquey motors - one driving each wheel - the R1T made light work of any obstacle and steep grade I threw at it during a day of off-roading (on trails Rivian hand-picked to showcase the model&#39;s strengths). The R1T promises to put out more than 800 horsepower and over 900 pound-feet of torque between the front and rear wheels.</p><p>But the truck offers a lot more than just four-wheel drive and a ton of power. </p><p>Since its motors operate independently, the R1T can instantly deliver more or less power to any wheel at any moment, a huge asset for tackling uneven terrain. Plus, you can toggle between drive modes that change the R1T&#39;s ride height, suspension settings, and throttle response for different types of off-roading. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61521c56b414c10018629ac4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"[EMBARGO 9/28 DNP] Rivian R1T\" height=\"1875\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Rivian R1T.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The truck&#39;s air suspension allows for 14.9 inches of ground clearance in its highest setting, plenty enough to straddle sizable boulders without getting beached. Like many EVs, the R1T has a regenerative braking system that lets you speed up and slow down using just one pedal.</p><p>The instant you start letting off the accelerator, the motors start braking and feeding energy back to the battery pack. This is especially helpful for off-roading, which requires lots of careful stopping and starting. </p><p>All of this made the Rivian perform spectacularly well over all sorts of terrain, even in the hands of a novice off-roader like myself. All I had to do was select the suitable drive mode, keep steady pressure on the accelerator, and aim the truck at what I planned to go through or over. Simple as that. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61521c57b414c10018629ac9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"[EMBARGO 9/28 DNP] Rivian R1T\" height=\"1875\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Rivian R1T.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Transitioning to paved roads was as easy as tapping into All-Purpose mode in the central touchscreen and airing up the tires using the R1T&#39;s onboard compressor. </p><p>On the highway, the R1T drives unlike any other pickup. First off, it&#39;s ridiculously quick for its size, especially in Sport mode. The R1T takes off from a stop with epic force, effortlessly makes passes at highway speeds, and always seems to have more power on tap. Rivian quotes a blistering 0-to-60-mph time of three seconds. </p><p>Carving around sharp bends, the R1T feels remarkably planted and doesn&#39;t experience any of the body roll you&#39;d expect from a high-riding truck. That&#39;s mainly thanks to the gigantic battery pack underneath its floor, which lowers the pickup&#39;s center of gravity and helps with handling while promising 314 miles of range for base models. </p><p>All in all, the R1T is so agile that it&#39;s easy to forget you&#39;re driving something bigger than an Escalade. </p><h2><strong>It&#39;s brimming with smart features</strong></h2><p>The R1T offers a dazzling variety of thoughtful touches that have nothing to do with how it drives. </p><p>There&#39;s a big front trunk under the hood and a cavernous Gear Tunnel that runs the width of the truck behind its rear seats. The 65-inch vestibule provides a ton of clever storage space and can be optioned with a $5,000 slide-out camping kitchen. Rivian says it&#39;s working on a bunch of other slide-out accessories, too. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/61521c572fb46b0019be4bdc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"[EMBARGO 9/28 DNP] Rivian R1T\" height=\"1875\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Rivian R1T&#39;s Gear Tunnel.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The Gear Guard system keeps an eye on the truck&#39;s surroundings using several external cameras and records when it thinks someone is messing with your truck or your stuff. There&#39;s an included cable for securing bikes and other gear in the bed. Plus, the truck includes a bluetooth speaker and an LED flashlight that both have their own little homes in the center console and door, respectively, where they&#39;re always charging. </p><p>The whole idea of a pickup is utility, and plenty of other trucks have that. But many of the features in the R1T can&#39;t be found anywhere else, partly because it&#39;s the first EV pickup on the American market and partly because to make a splash in a space with longtime heavyweights like Ford and General Motors, you have to go all-out. </p><p>And even though the R1T models are primarily aimed at sporty people, their utility can easily expand beyond camping and kayaking. </p><h2><strong>A great sign for our electric future</strong></h2><p>The 2022 Rivian R1T redefines what a truck can be. It offers a glimpse at the new-age features and capabilities coming our way as electricity sweeps the pickup segment and the auto market at large. </p><p>All Rivian has to do is build a ton of them, handle service and repairs, and not run out of money. As Tesla has demonstrated through its periods of production hell and its multiple brushes with financial calamity, that&#39;s no easy feat. </p><p>But for now, we know one thing: If there&#39;s an electric pickup that can unite buyers from across the spectrum - from truck fans, to early EV adopters, to nature-loving Subaru owners - the R1T could be it. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

He will stay on until September 2022, at which point Chief Operating Officer Jason Buechel will take on the role of chief executive.</p><p>In a letter sent out to Whole Foods employees, Mackey wrote that he &#34;thought long and hard&#34; about the decision.</p><p>&#34;Honestly, it&#39;s very hard to retire from a company that I have helped to create, nourish and grow for 44 years when I leave.&#34; Mackey wrote. &#34;As a co-founder of Whole Foods, I&#39;ve often explained my relationship to the company with a parent-child metaphor. As a parent, I have always loved Whole Foods with all my heart.&#34;</p><p>&#34;All parents reach a time when they must let go and trust that the values imparted will live on within their children.  That time has nearly come for me and for Whole Foods,&#34; Mackey added.</p><p>Mackey co-founded Whole Foods Market in 1980 in Austin, Texas. Whole Foods expanded throughout the United States, often through acquiring other local and regional chains. The chain championed organic foods and products free of preservatives and artificial flavors and coloring. In 2017, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-buys-whole-foods-changes-2017-8#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20officially%20buying%20Whole,that%20will%20change%20for%20customers&text=Amazon's%20%2413.7%20billion%20purchase%20of,with%20many%20changes%20for%20customers.stomers.\">acquired</a> the popular grocery chain for $13.7 billion.</p><p>The outgoing CEO said he will continue to visit stores and meet with employees before his departure.  Mackey wrote that he was proud of the company&#39;s role in helping &#34;tens of millions of people live healthier lives and it is not an exaggeration to say that Whole Foods has impacted very positively the way many people in America and around the world eat.&#34;</p><p>Mackey wrote that he was &#34;pleased&#34; that Amazon executives agreed with his top choice for a successor. Buechel joined Whole Foods in 2013 and became chief operating officer in 2019.</p><p>&#34;Not only is he extraordinarily intelligent with unusually high integrity, he is also a servant leader who lives and embodies Whole Foods Core Values and Leadership Principles and is fundamentally just a good and loving person,&#34; Mackey wrote.</p><p>Mackey also included a message for Whole Foods employees in his farewell letter.</p><p>&#34;Words cannot begin to express how deeply grateful I am for your partnership on this incredible journey and how much I love the company and all of you,&#34; he wrote. &#34;I may be retiring from Whole Foods a year from now, but so long as I am still alive, I will remain connected to Whole Foods and will do all that I possibly can to help us all continue to flourish.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-foods-co-founder-ceo-john-mackey-retired-2021-9'>Business
