We’ll use <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing\">YouTube</a> to demonstrate these disadvantages, but they can apply to other free hosting sites as well.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Reduced website engagement</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>First, it’s important to remember that like any other company, YouTube’s primary objective is to facilitate a <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">constant flow of visitors to its own website</a>. Even if its code were to be manipulated, a YouTube player will still likely prove to be a ‘trapdoor’ of sorts for website visitors who engage with it. All visitors have to do is click on the YouTube icon or share button and they’re off of your website. And they haven’t even gotten to the recommended feed at the bottom of their player...</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Leads falling through the cracks</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Related content next to your video and below it will not only keep your would-be website visitors on YouTube, but it’s likely that it will also recommend videos featuring or even directly promoting<em> </em>your competitors.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9f4527b9-270c-4d8a-a475-ad68015551c7\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\"><article><div>  <img src=\"https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/simple_image/public/images/media/images/reasons%20for%20B2B%20marketers%20to%20invest%20in%20a%20video%20hosting%20platform-monday.com%20vs%20asana.png?VpTkrJrkeQaUECBPnm6tU0vxMV6_mxd8&itok=dDl26T3K\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" alt=\"reasons for B2B marketers to invest in a video hosting platform-monday.com vs asana\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n      \n  </article></div>\n<p><em><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>This YouTube video appearing on monday.com’s homepage </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>will encounter a recommended video featuring its primary competitor, Asana.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>B2B marketers know that getting prospects to land on a website is already a task in and of itself.

However, B2B companies require data pertaining to <em>individual </em>viewer patterns.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>For B2B marketers to leverage videos towards lead generation, they need to be able to see <em>exactly</em> how each viewer engaged with a given video. Which leads us to the need for a quality video hosting platform.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span><span><span>B2B companies require data pertaining to <em>individual </em>viewer patterns.</span></span></span></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><span><span><span><span>The benefits of a paid video hosting platform</span></span></span></span></h2>\n\n<p><span><span><span>For B2B marketers looking to maintain <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness\">brand consistency </a>and drive bottom-line goals with video, a paid and higher-quality video hosting platform is often the best investment. These </span></span></span><span><span><span>video hosting platforms are designed not just to share videos, but to help marketers get the absolute most out of them. Let’s go over some of the advantages a quality video hosting platform can offer.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Customization and control</span></span></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Offering extensive yet easily-implementable customization features, video hosting platforms can have your videos appearing completely synonymously with your website’s overall design and feel. Incredibly user friendly, video hosting software will let you choose your video players’ color, size, controls and positioning within your web page—with no coding required.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3d2676ba-ce0a-42cb-b5fe-c50aff0ccdb8\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\"><article><div>  <img src=\"https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/simple_image/public/images/media/images/reasons%20for%20b2b%20marketers%20to%20invest%20in%20video%20hosting%20platform-customizability.png?Xs_TtqNgp.vx7_KYcyx.29aM8gAm3yfw&itok=qXV4AUBL\" width=\"793\" height=\"580\" alt=\"reasons for b2b marketers to invest in video hosting platform-customizability\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n      \n  </article></div>\n<h3><span><span><span>Enhanced security</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Video hosting platforms come with robust security features that allow <em>you</em> to decide whether or not you want your video shared. They help companies unwilling to relinquish control over their intellectual property see to it that no one can copy their video’s embed code.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Maximal viewership</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Unlike with YouTube, there is no danger of viewers slipping through the cracks with a video hosting platform. <em>You </em>decide what recommended content your viewers are presented with while watching a video. No more recommended <em>competitor </em>content, and no more ways to easily bounce out of your site. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Audience insights</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Finally, video hosting platforms will provide you with all the data you’ll need regarding individual video viewership. Information pertaining to each video viewer is registered and made immediately available on the video hosting solution’s analytical dashboard.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The guessing game is over. You can see exactly who watched a given video, the type of device that was used to watch the video, where in the world the video was watched, and, of course, how much of the video your viewer watched.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bc986960-4747-4714-8e05-6dc754983874\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\"><article><div>  <img src=\"https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/simple_image/public/images/media/images/reasons%20for%20b2b%20marketers%20to%20invest%20in%20video%20hosting%20platform-cincopa%20analytic%20dashboard.png?jFZbUX6ETkFSS6.7gGZ966LjVIM3Sfzi&itok=-7Q4H5ln\" width=\"800\" height=\"357\" alt=\"reasons for b2b marketers to invest in video hosting platform-cincopa analytic dashboard\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n      \n  </article></div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Here’s what </span></span><span><span><span>Cincopa</span></span></span><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>’s analytical dashboard looks like.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>You can break it down further, if you’d like. The exact moment each viewer stopped watching a video and the exact moment he or she returned (or moments, if there are a few additional views) are made immediately apparent.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Other features, such as video-heatmaps, provide data regarding the performance of a given video within a designated time frame. All the information pertaining to the viewing of a specific video will be aggregated, after which you will be presented with a visual graph detailing your viewers’ interaction with it.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Based on this data, you can learn <em>a lot </em>about <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/28/facebook-video-marketing\">what makes a good video for your audience</a>.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>For example, if viewership plummets at key moments during a video, you might want to recalibrate. The <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition</a> showcased right before the big drop may require some tweaking. Otherwise, you may want to think about removing it from your video entirely.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h2><span><span><span><span>Incorporating video engagement into your marketing automation workflows</span></span></span></span></h2>\n\n<p><span><span><span>To be carried out professionally <em>and </em>at scale, B2B marketing initiatives require sophisticated platforms; the kind designed<em> specifically </em>for each <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/01/ecommerce-sales-funnel\">stage of the marketing funnel</a>. <span>Most B2B marketers use marketing automation platforms</span> to carry out, measure, and improve their outbound activities.
