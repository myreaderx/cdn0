I’m interested in upgrading both as I have time; but for a first boot, I want to change as few variables as possible. That means leaving the firmware that’s on the CupCake and matching a legacy version of ReplicatorG to what’s on it. And I had no idea what was on it.</p> \n<p>Fortunately I have a <i>blog</i> and on that blog I write some things.</p> \n<p>I went to my own blog’s <a href=\"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?cat=24\">MakerBot CupCake blog category</a> and quickly found the <a href=\"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1465\">January 2012 post on rebuilding the heater</a> in which I had written:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>… I upgraded ReplicatorG from 0024 to 0029r2, and let it upgrade my firmware from v2.4 (I think) to v3.0, and lo! lost communication between ReplicatorG and the CupCake…</p> \n <p>This is apparently a known problem …</p> \n <p>Anyway, downgrading ReplicatorG to 0026 restored my connectivity …</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>So there you have it: I need ReplicatorG version 0026 to connect to the 3.0 firmware currently on my CupCake.</p> \n<p>Happily, the <a href=\"http://replicat.org/\">ReplicatorG web site</a> is still online in spite of MakerBot’s acquisition by Stratasys (though I note there have been no code updates since the acquisition). The <a href=\"http://replicat.org/download\">download page</a> has dowload links for only the last version (0040) but also has links to the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/replicatorg/downloads\">Google Code archive</a>, which on <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/replicatorg/downloads?page=3\">p3</a> has that 0026 for the Mac that I’m looking for.</p> \n<h3>Running ReplicatorG</h3> \n<p>I downloaded ReplicatorG 0026 and tried running it from the disk image before actually installing it on my laptop. I got the standard security warning:</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-mac-security-warning.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-mac-security-warning.png\" alt=\"OS X security warning about ReplicatorG\" /></a></p> \n<p>and had to look up to right-click and Open rather than double-click and change security preferences. After much playing around yesterday, I see that OS X Sierra does <i>not</i> remember approval I’ve given to run software on a disk image but <i>does</i> remember approval I’ve given to run software once it’s installed.</p> \n<p>Once I got past that, I got a Java version error:</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/04/20180704-ReplicatorG-needs-Java-SE6.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/04/20180704-ReplicatorG-needs-Java-SE6.png\" alt=\"ReplicatorG 0026 needs Java SE6\" /></a></p> \n<p>Shockingly, clicking <code>More Info...</code> in that dialog does something useful — it takes me to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US\">Apple’s JRE download page for that version</a>. After regaining consciousness, I installed that software and ReplicatorG starts up like a champ.</p> \n<h3>Can’t Connect to the CupCake (Because I Installed ReplicatorG Wrong)</h3> \n<p>It doesn’t appear to see the CupCake, though,</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-no-machinenode.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-no-machinenode_mid.png\" alt=\"ReplicatorG no machineNode found\" /></a></p> \n<p>giving the error:</p> \n<p><code>Could not load machine 'null' no machineNode found<br /> could not load machine 'null' please check Driver-&gt; &lt;Machine Name&gt;<br /> </code></p> \n<p>It <i>does</i> see my FTDI USB-serial cable under Machine / Serial Port. It does <i>not</i> have anything listed under Machine / Driver and it does not bring up anything when I select Machine / Machine Information…</p> \n<p>I don’t find much online about this. A <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084/comments\">Thingiverse Sailfish firmware comment</a> sounds as though I simply have the wrong machine type selected, but I can’t even select a machine type. The tail end of a <a href=\"https://github.com/jetty840/ReplicatorG/issues/63\">ReplicatorG comment thread</a> sounds as though it can’t see USB-serial ports on current OS X versions, but it does see it. A much older <a href=\"http://makerbot.wikidot.com/forum/t-295389/null-version-reported-unable-to-connect-to-firmware\">MakerBot forum post</a> mentions success after reseating the FTDI cable; but I don’t even know whether that’s the same issue and reseating mine didn’t help.</p> \n<h3>Installing ReplicatorG Correctly</h3> \n<p>It seemed obviously wrong that I couldn’t bring up the Machine Information… dialog, and I hunched that something was wrong there. Researching about the machine type, I saw that the <a href=\"http://replicat.org/machine-configuration\">ReplicatorG machine configuration page</a> mentions a <code>machines.xml</code> file, which I didn’t have. But that sparked a memory — the ReplicatorG disk image had a <code>machines</code> folder in it and … oh, yeah.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://replicat.org/installation-mac\">ReplicatorG Mac installation page</a> clearly says to <em>create a <code>ReplicatorG</code> folder under <code>Applications</code></em> and <em>drag the entire contents of the ReplicatorG disk image into it</em>. Which I hadn’t. I’d just dragged the app because in spite of remembering and knowing better, I’d just dragged the app.</p> \n<p>I deleted the app from <code>Applications</code>, created the folder, dragged the contents, started ReplicatorG by right-clicking and choosing Open, and boom. Connected to the CupCake.</p> \n<h3>First Extrusion</h3> \n<p>I went back to <a href=\"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1465\">my same blog post</a> and found the nozzle temperature that works well for my CupCake, then set that and ran the extruder:</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-extruder-control-panel.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-extruder-control-panel_mid.png\" alt=\"ReplicatorG 0026 extruder control panel\" /></a></p> \n<p>I don’t have any of <i>my</i> CupCake’s calibration settings loaded in yet, in particular my thermistor coefficients, so this temperature is only an estimate; but it worked well enough.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/IMG_20180706_233448_DSC00057.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/IMG_20180706_233448_DSC00057_mid.jpg\" alt=\"MakerBot CupCake test extrusion\" /></a></p> \n<p>First squeeze! Software installed; connected to and controlling the machine.</p> \n<h3>A Brief Aside About the FTDI USB-Serial Driver</h3> \n<p>When first I ran the ReplicatorG software, I wondered whether I had the FTDI USB-Serial driver already loaded on my MacBook from working with Arduino or whether the driver was missing and was the cause of the problem. ReplicatorG <em>did</em> find a USB-Serial under the Serial Port list, but I still questioned.</p> \n<p>A bit of research shows that the driver’s presence or absence can be seen by running System Information and looking under Software / Installations. I didn’t see it there and I found that it can also be checked by running <code>pkgutil --pkgs | grep -i ftdi</code> . Didn’t see it there either.</p> \n<p>The FTDI driver version supplied with ReplicatorG was of course quite old and I didn’t know how well it’d work on a newer OS X release. I went to <a href=\"http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm\">FTDI’s Virtual Com Port (VCP) driver page</a>, downloaded and installed version 2.4.2, and found that it made no changes to what I was experiencing. I’m wondering whether the FTDI driver is by now supplied as part of OS X or whether it silently installed when I installed the Arduino software on this MacBook.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 07 Jul 2018 15:18:46 +0000","feedId":12572,"bgimg":"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg_mid.png","linkMd5":"3eb399c227adb7cdebbc47356c9bacdb","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Keith Neufeld","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg_mid.png":null,"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-mac-security-warning.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn74@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-04-37-521_a48f67767d046192.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/04/20180704-ReplicatorG-needs-Java-SE6.png":null,"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-no-machinenode_mid.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn98@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-04-21-249_c6617ea15a4447c8.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/replicatorg-extruder-control-panel_mid.png":null,"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/IMG_20180706_233448_DSC00057_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-05-39-931_9fbb26590af0fb61.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321026099},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","title":"Inserting Weights Into a Print","link":"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1763","description":"<p>While designing a (different) small box, I knew I wanted it to have a heavy base to keep it from being tippy.

The ability to design them now is one of two observations in the last week that have really driven my interest in OpenScad&#8217;s 2D subsystem.  If you&#8217;re not interested in OpenSCAD, you&#8217;ll probably want to stop reading now.  (Who am I kidding &#8212; I&#8217;m sure that the two of you still reading are interested in OpenSCAD.)</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1730\"></span></p>\n<h2>History of Fillets in OpenSCAD</h2>\n<p>Fillets are ubiquitous in professionally-designed and professionally-manufactured products.  A fillet is a rounded-over edge, and the term applies to slightly different effects on exterior and interior edges.  A fillet on an exterior edge removes some material to round it over, as though you used a file to smooth the edge, and makes it feel nice instead of scratchy-scrapey.  A fillet on an interior edge, like at the bottom of a recess, adds material to round it over, as though you applied caulk to an inside corner and smoothed it out with your finger, and removes or reduces the tendency of material to crack and break at that sharp edge.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, OpenSCAD doesn&#8217;t appear to have a native fillet operation.  Techniques used to accomplish fillets in OpenSCAD in the past include (in my order of awareness of availability of the features as the software developed):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Construct filleted <em>boxes (exterior fillets)</em> <strong>out of 3D primitives</strong>, with spheres at the corners, cylinders for edges, and rectangular prisms for faces.  This was &#8230; tedious.</li>\n<li>Construct <em>filleted boxes (exterior fillets)</em> by <strong>applying a <code>hull()</code> operation around a sphere in each corner of the box</strong>.  This gives good results with good performance but it still requires quite a bit more code than what one would rather be able to write as concisely as <code>fillet(r = 3) cube(size = 10)</code> .</li>\n<li><em>Fillet the edges of boxes (exterior fillets)</em> by <strong>using <code>minkowski()</code> to &#8220;puff out&#8221; the exterior of a box by the 3D footprint of a sphere</strong> (or other shape of choice).  This tends to take <em>quite</em> a lot of computation and requires drafting each edge of the box smaller by the radius of the sphere used in the Minkowski operation.</li>\n<li>Construct <em>filleted recesses</em> by <strong>using <code>difference()</code> to carve a shape</strong> created with any of the above techniques <strong>out of a larger object</strong>.</li>\n<li>Learn to use any of a variety of <strong>user-contributed modules and algorithms</strong>, with varying strengths and weaknesses in effect and performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>offset() Operator in 2D</h2>\n<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been using the <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations#offset\"><code>offset()</code> operation in the 2D subsystem</a>.  I wish I could find where I first ran across using this for fillets, because I&#8217;d like to give credit for the idea that predates the nice diagram you&#8217;ll now find in the manual.</p>\n<p>The idea is simple &#8212; to round over an exterior corner, offset the perimeter inward by the fillet radius (shrinking the part) and then back outward by the fillet radius (restoring it to original size).  When it&#8217;s expanded back out, the radius won&#8217;t &#8220;reach&#8221; all the way to the original sharp corners, so they&#8217;re smoothed out.</p>\n<p>Rounding over interior edges uses the opposite order of operations from rounding over exterior ones, and is what I used in my battery holder:</p>\n<p><code>offset(r = -fillet) offset(r = +fillet) {<br />\n&#160;&#160; union() {<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; posts_2d_with_hull();<br />\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; flange_2d();<br />\n&#160;&#160; }<br />\n}</code></p>\n<p>This creates the nice curves where the mounting bosses join the perimeter wall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/12/20190612-LiPo-battery-holder-screenshot.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/12/20190612-LiPo-battery-holder-screenshot_mid.png\" alt=\"OpenSCAD model of Makeblock mBot LiPo battery holder\" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very happy with this approach for the things I&#8217;ve been designing lately.</p>\n<p>The astute reader will have noticed that the availability of <code>offset()</code> only in the 2D subsystem means we can only fillet in the X-Y plane.  Which is true, <em>but</em> <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2443544\">Thingiverse item 2443544</a>, nominally a simple clip customizer, demonstrates intersecting the extrusion of a filleted shape in the X-Y plane with the extrusion of a filleted shape in the X-Z plane to yield a 3D shape filleted in multiple planes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2443544\"><img src=\"https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/54/78/fd/54/b4/61a2e63249ab88e70428674af70f3eb6_preview_featured.jpg\" alt=\"preview of Thingiverse item 2443544\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>This image is copyright 2017 by Thingiverse user Torleif and is embedded here under the Creative Commons &#8211; Attribution license.</em></p>\n<p>The blue extrusion is drawn (and filleted) in the X-Y plane; the pink in the X-Z (in fact, just <em>drawn</em>, then extruded, then rotated as though it had been extruded from the X-Z plane).

I took a bit of time today to learn how to calibrate that; and one of the same tutorials gave a nice reference for nozzle temperature calibration, so I did that, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171725_DSC00826.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171725_DSC00826_mid.jpg\" alt=\"3D printer extrusion multiplier calibration cubes\" /></a></p>\n<p>These notes are as much for me as for thee, as I expect to run through this again with more filaments in the future.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1750\"></span></p>\n<h3>Nozzle Temperature Calibration</h3>\n<p>I went with the temperature calibration first, as I figured there was at least a chance that the extrusion temperature would impact the amount of die swell as the filament exits the nozzle.</p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;m using PrusaSlicer (because it&#8217;s preset with Prusa&#8217;s recommendations for my MK3S), I followed the instructions on <a href=\"https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/wiki/Calibration-of-Slic3r\">Slic3r&#8217;s very well-written calibration page</a>.  I downloaded <code>heattower.stl</code> from Thingiverse, followed the instructions to temporarily override the amount of infill and number of solid layers, and printed it.  During the print, I reduced the temperature 5&#176;C every 5 mm, or thereabouts, by hitting the control panel button, selecting <code>Tune</code> / <code>Nozzle:</code>, and dialing it down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171636_DSC00822_crop.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171636_DSC00822_crop_mid.jpg\" alt=\"3D printer temperature calibration towers\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first pass produced the lovely squishy-based tower on the left, suggesting that top end of the filament&#8217;s recommended range of 230-260&#176;C is too hot and the best printing happens in the lower region of the range.  But most of the way through, I realized the part cooling fan wasn&#8217;t running because Prusa + ABS; so I changed the PrusaSlicer settings to turn on the fan and repeated the print, giving the clean and tidy tower on the right.  With the fan on, I got perfect results throughout the recommended temperature range and a bit of delamination just below the recommended range.</p>\n<p>I picked 250&#176;C as a nice value likely to give good laminations and entered it into PrusaSlicers <code>Filament Settings</code> <code>First Layer</code> and <code>Other Layers</code> extruder temperature settings.</p>\n<p>I later turned off the part cooling fan because without an enclosure (that I haven&#8217;t built yet), it does increase the propensity of the part lifting off the build platform.  But I stand by my temperature as a good choice for strong layer adhesion, with or without the fan.</p>\n<h3>Extrusion Multiplier</h3>\n<p>I had to read up on the extrusion multiplier.  It&#8217;s the name given to the amount to scale up or down the rate of filament flow to get the nominal extrusion size.  In addition to the <a href=\"https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/wiki/Calibration-of-Slic3r\">Slic3r&#8217;s calibration page</a>, it&#8217;s also covered in a <a href=\"https://help.prusa3d.com/article/d9j1xdg7vj-extrusion-multiplier-calibration\">Prusa article</a>.</p>\n<p>Before setting the extrusion multiplier, I checked my filament diameter, as that will impact the rate of flow.  I don&#8217;t have a two-decimal-point metric caliper, so I measured my filament as 0.070&#8243; diameter at several points along a meter of length.  Converting to metric, I got 1.778 mm, which I plugged into PrusaSlicer&#8217;s <code>Filament Settings</code> / <code>Diameter</code> value.</p>\n<p>Thinking about whether this was a real difference in diameter or the limits of my caliper&#8217;s precision, I note that 0.001&#8243; = 0.0254 mm and conclude that this filament really does seem to be measurably thicker than nominal, by about +1.6%.  Not a lot, but that would account for some extra filament and crowding in my prints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171802_DSC00829.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171802_DSC00829_mid.jpg\" alt=\"3D printer extrusion multiplier calibration cubes\" /></a></p>\n<p>I then printed the first hollow calibration cube, on the left (shown upside-down for convenience of penmanship), and measured its wall thickness at 0.017&#8243; &approx; 0.4318 mm.  According to Prusa, this was supposed to come out to 0.45 mm, so I set the <code>Filament Settings</code> / <code>Extrusion Multiplier</code> to 0.45 mm / 0.4318 mm &approx; 1.04.  I printed the second calibration cube and measured <em>its</em> wall thickness at 0.018&#8243; (paying attention to how close the pointer was to the marks on my caliper dial) &approx; 0.4521 mm.  That was just larger than it should have been, so I reduced the <code>Extrusion Multiplier</code> to 0.45 mm / 0.4521 mm * 1.04 &approx; 1.035 and called it done.</p>\n<h3>Net Change</h3>\n<p>I note that increasing the reported filament diameter by 1.6% reduced the flow rate by about 1.5% and then the new extrusion multiplier increased it 3.5% for a net effect of increasing my flow by about 1.9%.  That was not the outcome I expected, but I&#8217;m sticking with it until I can credibly demonstrate why those changes were incorrect.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 23:18:32 +0000","feedId":12572,"bgimg":"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171725_DSC00826_mid.jpg","linkMd5":"42bd31ad1e0fb1275c201a127acd6415","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-04-05-686_3f425ce424e61469.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":480,"sourceBytes":71773,"destBytes":22356,"author":"Keith Neufeld","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171725_DSC00826_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-04-05-686_3f425ce424e61469.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171636_DSC00822_crop_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn33@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-05-41-954_9ea37a0f8830e828.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/10/27/IMG_20191027_171802_DSC00829_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn77@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-05-33-932_6126b73becd6c4e9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321026098},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","title":"Booting the MakerBot CupCake after Five Years Part 1: Powering Up","link":"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1673","description":"<p>I devoted Wednesday, my Independence Day holiday, to getting my CupCake 3D printer running again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/IMG_20180706_215334_DSC00055-crop.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/06/IMG_20180706_215334_DSC00055-crop_mid.jpg\" alt=\"MakerBot CupCake\" /></a></p>\n<p>Foreshadowing:  It turned out as a pessimist might suspect rather than as an optimist might plan.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1673\"></span></p>\n<p>The first step in getting the CupCake running was powering it up and connecting it to a computer.

Saturday I focused on the heated build platform.</p> \n<p>I’ve always had astoundingly good luck with kapton tape since <a href=\"http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2010/01/hot-metal-and-serendipity.html\">nophead’s serendipitous discovery</a>, probably because I (still) prefer to print in ABS. When the build platform is warm, my prints stick to it absolutely with no raft or mouse ears and once it has cooled, they release easily. That’s a pretty compelling combination.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_121633_DSC00061-rotated.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_121633_DSC00061-rotated_mid.jpg\" alt=\"kapton tape for MakerBot CupCake heated build platform\" /></a></p> \n<p>So my first step was replacing the scraped-up kapton that I gouged the last time the printer was on. I bought a 4″ roll way back when and I keep a strip of unsticky tucked under the end so I don’t have to peel it up with fingernails and get fingerprints on the stickum.</p> \n<p>In the past I’ve always replaced the tape by sticking down the end and using a credit card to “squeegee” it onto the surface, and it can be tough to avoid getting bubbles. Yesterday I unrolled enough tape to cover the platform and when I had it stretched out, it was easy to align the front edge of the tape with the front edge of the platform, at which point I squeegeed it down with my thumb with no bubbles at all. Huh, well, I guess I’ll remember that.</p> \n<p><span id=\"more-1691\"></span></p> \n<p>I heat my build platform with the rackmount laboratory-grade power supply the CupCake is sitting on. From <a href=\"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=862\">my 2010 blog post about making the heated build platform</a> (gosh, this blog thing is handy), I see that I ran the power supply around 24V to heat the build platform to the neighborhood of 180-200C, then backed it off to 12V. This is a definite opportunity to control via software in the future; but for now, I’ll keep doing it with a manual control the way the pilgrims did.</p> \n<h3>Setting Nozzle Height by Extruding Onto the Platform</h3> \n<p>I’ve never got the Z-axis endstops integrated into my build process — if someone knows how to implement that (some G-code preface), I’d love to hear about it — and getting the right nozzle height has always been one of my biggest recurring challenges with this machine. So I decided to take a different approach and set the extruder to run while jogging the build platform under numerical control and lowering the nozzle until the extrusions stuck well but didn’t flatten badly.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_122910_DSC00062-crop.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_122910_DSC00062-crop_mid.jpg\" alt=\"freehand extrusion on MakerBot CupCake heated build platform\" /></a></p> \n<p>I got a blob every time it stopped between jog steps, but the process worked pretty well — I got the height tuned to stick the extrusion down to the build platform without squishing it badly out of shape.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_123205_DSC00065-color.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_123205_DSC00065-color_mid.jpg\" alt=\"freehand extrusion from 3D printer heated build platform\" /></a></p> \n<p>Removed from the printer, you can see that the ABS was starting to scorch. I’d been running the nozzle at 228C based on my <a href=\"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1465\">2012 post</a>; but somewhere I found that I’d backed down to 220C, and that does seem to work better.</p> \n<h3>First Print (from Saved Gcode)</h3> \n<p>I don’t have my machine’s calibration parameters loaded into Skeinforge yet, in part because I can’t find Skeinforge (which is supposed to be integrated into ReplicatorG, but I don’t find that to be the case); so I can’t slice and print an STL file. But I have G-code files that I’d generated <em>for this printer</em>, and it should work to print those.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_130430_DSC00073-color.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/07/IMG_20180707_130430_DSC00073-color_mid.jpg\" alt=\"plastic clip made on 3D printer\" /></a></p> \n<p>This clip didn’t turn out so well. The G-code was generated to print at 228C and the printer stopped extruding partway through, I think because the ABS was overheated. I could update the G-code to run at 220C instead; but I’m going to want to get Skeinforge running to slice new models anyway. So this was a fine proof of concept.</p> \n<h3>Thermistor <em>Is</em> Calibrated</h3> \n<p>I found (and subsequently remembered) that a few settings are saved in the printer’s NVRAM, including the thermistor coefficients. They’re accessible in the <code>Machine</code> / <code>Toolhead Onboard Preferences...</code> dialog:</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/08/ReplicatorG-extruder-thermistor-parameters.png\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/07/08/ReplicatorG-extruder-thermistor-parameters.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p> \n<p>So it really <em>was</em> running at 228C when it said it was.</p> \n<h3>Remaining Issues</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>After positioning the nozzle at the build platform’s origin, I raised it high out of the way. When I told it to return to home, the Z action paused about once a second on the way down and stopped about 13 mm above the build platform instead of running smoothly back to its original position. For goodness sake, you should be able to get the basics right.<br /><br /> I haven’t checked whether the motherboard was signaling the stepper driver and it was skipping steps (doubt it) or whether the motherboard was malfunctioning, so I should do that yet.<br /><br /> I’ll never be able to automate nozzle positioning if the CupCake can’t reliably move the nozzle into position.</li> \n <li>Skeinforge doesn’t seem to be integrated.

They come with a 4xAA battery holder, but I&#8217;m not a fan of single-use batteries and Makeblock&#8217;s LiPo is only <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KPVH8H3/\">$10 on Amazon</a> [no affiliation and not an affiliate link, just a happy customer], so I ordered a couple.</p>\n<p>The LiPo batteries came in clear plastic cases with tabs that looked like they should latch into the slots on the robot chassis, but the spacing was off.  The robot kit came with hook-and-loop tape to fasten down the battery holder, but yuck.  So I designed this holder, which is good enough to use after a single pass of dimensional refinement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202346_DSC00625.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202346_DSC00625_mid.jpg\" alt=\"Makeblock mBot robot with 3D-printed LiPo battery holder\" /></a></p>\n<p>Many thanks to my student employee Kip for printing the battery holder on his Prusa I3 MK2s.  The quality is outstanding.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll upload the design to Thingiverse after a bit of code cleanup.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1715\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_200642_DSC00612_brightness.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_200642_DSC00612_brightness_mid.jpg\" alt=\"3D-printed holder for Makeblock mBot robot LiPo battery\" /></a></p>\n<p>The battery holder is a fairly simple box with a notch at each corner for the wires to exit and a mounting boss in each corner to screw it to the chassis.  I designed 3.8-mm holes in PLA to thread in M4 screws without tapping; and at least for a single installation, it&#8217;s a nice snug fit without feeling like it&#8217;s going to crack the plastic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202014_DSC00624.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202014_DSC00624_mid.jpg\" alt=\"Underside of Makeblock mBot robot\" /></a></p>\n<p>The motors were in the way of tightening the screws from below, so I had to almost entirely disassemble the mBot to install the battery holder.  But the mBot purportedly has LiPo charge management on its motherboard, so this should never have to be removed again until the LiPo is used up and needs to be replaced.</p>\n<p>With all that unused space underneath, one (I) might think that the battery should be mounted below the chassis, and one (I) might be inclined to agree.  But I didn&#8217;t spot a good way to mount it securely without either modifying the chassis (nope, at least not yet) or adding long rails to the holder to get to existing mounting holes.  So up on top it is.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:10:26 +0000","feedId":12572,"bgimg":"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202346_DSC00625_mid.jpg","linkMd5":"c6dcf551162c64e9482857d077e8d62b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-04-08-781_279603f6fc4162b0.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":480,"sourceBytes":96299,"destBytes":32432,"author":"Keith Neufeld","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202346_DSC00625_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-04-08-781_279603f6fc4162b0.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_200642_DSC00612_brightness_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn42@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-04-10-507_50b4cfa707b7a452.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/06/11/IMG_20190611_202014_DSC00624_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn29@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-05-32-652_838443e539334b09.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321026098},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","title":"Chewing ABS to Make New Filament","link":"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1705","description":"<p>Like many other 3D printer owners, I&#8217;ve long dreamed of processing post-consumer plastic into new filament for printing.  I&#8217;ve now taken a couple of steps in that direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/16/IMG_20180816_0720358-brightness.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/16/IMG_20180816_0720358-brightness_mid.jpg\" alt=\"ABS plastic pelletized with sheet-metal nibbler tool\" /></a></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1705\"></span></p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that at times I&#8217;ve had a surplus of CRT monitors (surplus of CRTs is redundant, I guess?), many not working.  I pulled their PCBs and salvaged their components, put out the metal for recycling, and &#8230; cut up the ABS cases into flat chunks and stored them.  Did the same with dead inkjet printers people kept giving me &#8212; I think they must come in the bottom of cereal boxes.</p>\n<p>In tangentially-related news, I&#8217;m doing some OpenSCAD design work and a friend is printing the parts for me, as my CupCake has not rehabilitated itself yet.  The parts are supposed to friction fit and he has only PLA and I think it&#8217;s too brittle for a good fit &#8212; if the parts fit at all, they slide too easily.  I think they need a little give to slide together, stick in place, and slide apart, so I want to try ABS.  I have 3-mm ABS filament but his printer of course uses 1.75-mm filament.  I could buy some 1.75-mm ABS filament, but I have all this bulk ABS sitting around &#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/15/IMG_20180815_1926500.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/15/IMG_20180815_1926500_mid.jpg\" alt=\"kitty litter bins of post-consumer ABS plastic\" /></a></p>\n<p>So last night I dug out my bins and color-matched my project to the medium grey ABS and scrubbed it in the kitchen sink with soapy water and let it dry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/15/IMG_20180815_2005019-brightness.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/15/IMG_20180815_2005019-brightness_mid.jpg\" alt=\"washing post-consumer plastic in the kitchen sink\" /></a></p>\n<p>Still hadn&#8217;t figured out how I was going to chew it up into pellets.  There are plastic shredders, even DIY ones, but they seem frightfully expensive especially once you include the motive power.</p>\n<p>I pondered misusing all my different power tools, bearing in mind that my goal was to get pellets somewhere in the size range of rice to peas.  ABS dust would probably be fine for re-forming into filament &#8212; but much more difficult to capture/collect without impurities like wood dust from other use of the power tools.  Tablesaw, sander &#8212; dust.  Bandsaw, rotary rasp &#8212; coarse dust.  Drill press &#8212; interesting idea but would probably produce spirals that would have to be re-cut; plus any type of bit would be prone to grabbing the plastic and having to clamp it down in each position would take time.</p>\n<p>Router table with router set to lowest speed and taking shallow passes &#8212; very promising, and very finger-scary.  Jointer &#8212; definitely the right size chips, and more finger-scary.  Lathe &#8212; hilarious!</p>\n<p>And remembered my hand-operated sheet-metal nibbler.</p>\n<p>This morning I produced a good tablespoon of pellets (shown at top) in ten minutes of hand-work as a proof of concept and today I ordered a <a href=\"https://www.filastruder.com/products/filastruder-kit\">Filastruder</a>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still pondering &#8230; but I do have a pneumatic nibbler somewhere and I&#8217;m thinking about a table design whereby I could feed the plastic to the nibbler.  That should be pretty safe, as the nibbler&#8217;s up/down action won&#8217;t be nearly as prone to grabbing the workpiece and sucking in my fingers.</p>\n<p>Although I <em>am</em> going to want some red ABS for this project &#8230;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 01:38:41 +0000","feedId":12572,"bgimg":"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/16/IMG_20180816_0720358-brightness_mid.jpg","linkMd5":"8a087732ee832835be82257050ce8ea7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-04-15-532_44bd66051c1fa90a.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":427,"sourceBytes":133227,"destBytes":42574,"author":"Keith Neufeld","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/16/IMG_20180816_0720358-brightness_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-04-15-532_44bd66051c1fa90a.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/15/IMG_20180815_1926500_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn5@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-05-37-862_763064ffc94401db.webp","http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2018/08/15/IMG_20180815_2005019-brightness_mid.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn70@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-05-45-645_646951f89585cc6f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321026099},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:03:46","title":"PLA Shrinks Too","link":"http://www.neufeld.newton.ks.us/electronics/?p=1757","description":"<p>Everybody all, &#8220;ABS bad, it shrink when you print it,&#8221; and I&#8217;m, &#8220;Yo, dog, PLA shrink too.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/08/18/IMG_20190818_201920_DSC00775.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www2.neufeld.newton.ks.us/images/electronics/2019/08/18/IMG_20190818_201920_DSC00775_mid.jpg\" alt=\"3D-printed PLA box\" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a box with 2-mm walls and a 2-mm base.
