Throw a car out of a plane? Did that! Jump a car across skyscrapers? Did that too! It&#8217;s almost too ridiculous to imagine what they could think up next, though we already got a glimpse of a car catching another car in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/f9-trailer-2/\">previous trailers</a>.

This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they&#8217;ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, the upcoming The Suicide Squad).</p>\n<p>F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tbilisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>F9</em> finally drives into theaters on <strong>June 25</strong>,<strong> 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/f9-trailer-3/\">&#8216;F9&#8217; Trailer: Still Fast, Still Furious, Still Family</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DKnZmXzbwR0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:02:03 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/f9-e1618403492823-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"e2ae183c464250f9a255c87b9a999a21","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn17@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-19-236_6c9e7c8f4f7ca941.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":32703,"destBytes":19536,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/f9-e1618403492823-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn17@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-19-236_6c9e7c8f4f7ca941.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-43-338_87da6be71e68fd5e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DKnZmXzbwR0:lrukVZiNxEw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-43-377_686590eea5ea42e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DKnZmXzbwR0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn67@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-503_7dc0ca9cdb90161c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"Showtime’s ‘Cinema Toast’ Series Will Put a New Narrative Twist on Old Public Domain Film Footage","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666430","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666442 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinematoast-logo-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Showtime Cinema Toast Series\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinematoast-logo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinematoast-logo-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>There are a lot of new movies and TV shows inspired by the coronavirus pandemic coming down the pipeline. Thankfully, there are still plenty of ideas being generated as a result of the pandemic without shining more of a light on COVID-19, and Showtime has picked one of them up in the form of a new anthology series called <em><strong>Cinema Toast</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>Created by <strong>Jeff Baena</strong> (<em>Horse Girl</em>, <em>The Little Hours</em>) and produced by <strong>Mark &#38; Jay Duplass</strong> (<em>Room 104</em>, <em>The Overnight</em>), <em>Cinema Toast</em> will take footage from old movies in the public domain and re-contextualize them into new stories through editing and voice dubbing, including the voices of <strong>Alison Brie</strong>, <strong>Nick Offerman</strong>, <strong>Fred Armisen</strong>, <strong>John Early</strong>, <strong>Christina Ricci</strong>, <strong>Megan Mullally</strong>, <strong>Chloe Fineman</strong> and <strong>Christopher Meloni</strong>.<span id=\"more-666430\"></span></p>\n<p>Showtime sent out a press release announcing that <em>Cinema Toast</em> will debut all 10 episodes on Showtime&#8217;s on-demand streaming and partner platforms starting on <strong>April 20, 2021</strong>. Though the series will use old film footage and voice dubbing, don&#8217;t expect this to be a retread of what <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> has been doing for decades now. This is something entirely different. Jeff Baena explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the pandemic first hit and all paths to traditional production seemed unlikely at best, I racked my brain to find a way to still create. That’s when the idea hit me to re-dub and re-shape old material into something transcendent that extends beyond just a comedic curio.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So <em>Cinema Toast</em> won&#8217;t just be delivering comedy with this recut and redubbed footage. Instead, directors <strong>Jay Duplass</strong>, <strong>Mel Eslyn</strong>, <strong>Alex Ross Perry</strong>, <strong>Marta Cunningham</strong>, <strong>Aubrey Plaza</strong>, <strong>Numa Perrier</strong>, <strong>Jordan Firstman</strong>, <strong>Kris Rey</strong>, <strong>David Lowery</strong>, and Jeff Baena himself will deliver a variety of stories that sound rather experimental and compelling.</p>\n<p>Aubrey Plaza&#8217;s episode &#8220;Quiet Illness&#8221; creates a portrait of an emotionally tortured modern woman using footage of Loretta Young. Marta Cunningham delivers a <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>-inspired story called &#8220;Attack of the Karens,&#8221; which takes clear inspiration from a certain kind of American woman who has become all to prominent in recent years. Mel Eslyn digs into mumblecore laughs and monsters with &#8220;Beast From Haunted Cave.&#8221; And finally, Alex Ross Perry gets weird with Soviet footage in &#8220;Report on the Canine Auto-Mechanical Soviet Threat,&#8221; which will tell the story of a young boy immersed in a new reality inhabited by talking cars and telepathic dogs.</p>\n<p>This all sounds like a makeshift <em>Twilight Zone</em> and has the potential to be really interesting. It&#8217;s great that these filmmakers were able to spend their time during the pandemic doing something experimental and intriguing. As unfortunate as it is that this was forced upon them due to a pandemic, I think that this dire situation may also yield some inspiring creative results. We&#8217;ll find out when the series arrives later this month.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/showtime-cinema-toast-series/\">Showtime&#8217;s &#8216;Cinema Toast&#8217; Series Will Put a New Narrative Twist on Old Public Domain Film Footage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nQpBdMzKPVE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 22:30:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinematoast-logo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"3156145a33302cbcd7dcf40250c6dfc7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-19-305_d7a1ecc6d208250b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":14789,"destBytes":9544,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinematoast-logo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-19-305_d7a1ecc6d208250b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn9@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-42-926_2789b17de9d84859.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nQpBdMzKPVE:JBwLqb_e6-s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn91@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-42-886_59c14b8de7025d7a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nQpBdMzKPVE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn75@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-42-874_943bea1c41488cbe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106895},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"Cool Stuff: Marvel Legends Finally Gives Fans the Beefy Thor from ‘Avengers: Endgame’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666550","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666551 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengersendgame-thor-final-marvellegends-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers: Endgame Thor Action Figure\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengersendgame-thor-final-marvellegends-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengersendgame-thor-final-marvellegends-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Hasbro is typically pretty quick about getting action figures from Marvel Studios movies into shelves.

of the Rings</em> trilogy, <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>) is set to star in <em><strong>TAR</strong></em>, the latest movie from the acclaimed writer/producer/director of <em>In the Bedroom</em> and <em>Little Children</em>.<span id=\"more-666484\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Blanchett will lead the cast of <em>TAR</em>, a drama that Field is writing and directing for Focus Features. Details about the movie are scarce at the moment – we have no idea who Blanchett will be playing, and the plot is still shrouded in mystery, though we know it will be set in Berlin – but I expect the news that Field is this far along in the process of making a new movie may itself be enough to excite a certain corner of film fandom.</p>\n<p>When Field was a kid, he helped invent Big League Chew bubblegum during his time a batboy for Kurt Russell&#8217;s dad&#8217;s minor league baseball team. None of that has literally anything to do with anything in this story, but I just learned about it while researching him for this piece and thought it absolutely deserved to be passed along to you.</p>\n<p>Back to the relevant stuff: Field acted for directors like Stanley Kubrick, Carl Franklin, Dyan Cannon, Penelope Spheeris, Nicole Holofcener, and Jan de Bont before breaking into writing and directing feature films himself with 2001&#8217;s <em>In the Bedroom</em>, which immediately launched him into the upper echelon of the up-and-coming independent filmmakers of that era. The movie earned five Oscar nominations, including two for Field: Best Picture (he was a producer) and Best Adapted Screenplay (he was a co-writer). Five years later, Field followed that movie up with <em>Little Children</em>, a devastating drama starring Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson that earned three more Oscar nominations, including one for Field (again as a co-writer).</p>\n<p><em>TAR</em> appears to be the first feature that Field will write himself. And Blanchett is obviously one of the most exciting performers of her generation and very much an awards darling in her own right (she&#8217;s won two Oscars so far), so this collaboration sounds like the type of pairing that will result in exactly the type of adult-centric drama that we often lament Hollywood does not make very often anymore. Blanchett will soon appear in Eli Roth&#8217;s <em>Borderlands</em>, Adam McKay&#8217;s <em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em>, James Gray&#8217;s <em>Armageddon Time</em>, and Guillermo del Toro&#8217;s <em>Nightmare Alley</em>.</p>\n<p>Production is expected to begin on <em>TAR</em> this September.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tar-cate-blanchett-film/\">&#8216;TAR&#8217;: Cate Blanchett to Star in &#8216;Little Children&#8217; Director Todd Field&#8217;s Next Film</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/n2O_2LLsBSk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cate-Blanchett-film-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"8089ecbb4c63df31e0b143472626ecd2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-19-841_8e79e12849324ffd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":49087,"destBytes":36714,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cate-Blanchett-film-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-19-841_8e79e12849324ffd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-43-346_83d8be267eddc454.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=n2O_2LLsBSk:tAAzrMZ46FU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn71@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-43-338_aca0356674ac622a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/n2O_2LLsBSk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn89@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-42-782_f7cbf477eccf4975.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"‘Cells at Work: CODE BLACK’ is an Anime That Will Scare You Into Taking Better Care of Yourself","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666263","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666265 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cells-at-Work-CODE-BLACK-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Cells at Work CODE BLACK\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cells-at-Work-CODE-BLACK.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cells-at-Work-CODE-BLACK-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><i>(Welcome to </i><b><i>Ani-time Ani-where</i></b><i>, a regular column dedicated to helping the uninitiated understand and appreciate the world of anime.)</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Last year, right before the world entered into lockdown, I wrote about the fun and violent <a href=\"http://o\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Cells at Work!</i></span></a>, an anime with tons of monster-killing and also some important biology lessons about the wonderful things your body does to keep you alive. Now, the show&#8217;s first spin-off, <b><i>Cells at Work: CODE BLACK</i></b>, takes a different approach by scaring the shit out of you for not taking care of your body.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The basic plot remains the same, taking us inside the human body with anthropomorphized body cells carrying out the tasks that keep you alive and fighting with onslaught of bacteria and other creatures that are constantly trying to invade. What&#8217;s different this time is that the host body is incredibly unhealthy and constantly on the verge of collapse, making this more of a disaster movie where something threatens the world every 20 minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">More than just a show about unhealthy habits, <i>Code Black</i> is a poignant exploration of &#8220;black companies&#8221; overworking their employees, and how that affects your mental health and then your physical health, making this arguably the timeliest anime to come out of 2021</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666263\"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>What Makes It Great</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Right out of the bat, <i>Code Black</i> shows off a much darker and serious tone compared to its predecessor. While the original was very optimistic about its portrayal of body overcoming almost any obstacle, this takes the opposite approach. Our main character, a red blood cell, starts out the show during orientation day, where he watches an introductory video explaining his tasks and the various colorful cells he will encounter along the way. The video is very upbeat and everyone is shown enjoying their job, but the reality is bleaker. The red blood cell encounters nothing but pessimistic and bitter old people who hate their job and just can&#8217;t wait to die so they can stop working. There&#8217;s no better indication of the difference in tone compared to the main series than the cute platelets now being portrayed as mean teenagers. Indeed, <i>Code Black</i> has huge horror vibes, with a bigger emphasis given to the way the cells die horrible deaths and are mutilated by bacteria or other substances. The first episode introduces the idea of carbon monoxide from smoking transforming blood cells into zombies, and the score for the show resembles something out of a John Carpenter movie.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Code Black</i> also features a more serialized format that escalates the kind of problems the host body faces in the show, building up the idea that these are not just isolated incidents that happen all the time, but direct results of an unhealthy lifestyle that brings about increasingly deadly problems. In one episode, the entire body is put into double duty to counter the host body suffering from erectile dysfunction, which then leads into an invasion by gonorrhea in the next episode, which then causes a bunch of cells to die, leading to an overactive immune response that causes hair loss in the episode after that, all building up to a season finale that rivals <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/dinosaurs-tvs-saddest-sitcom-finale.html\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Dinosaurs</i></span></a> as one of the grimmest and most devastating conclusions in television.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>What It Brings to the Conversation</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">What makes <i>Code Black </i>stand out is how its subtitle doesn&#8217;t just indicate a darker and more adult tone, but how it&#8217;s directly referring to the Japanese concept of a &#8220;Black Company&#8221; — basically a sweatshop-style working environment that exploits its workers and overworks them to the extreme.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>The show constantly juxtaposes the working conditions that lead the host body to be this unhealthy and the incredibly dangerous working conditions the cells face day-to-day.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Every episode, and nearly every scene, has a character hammering a &#8220;work until you die&#8221; mantra, with everyone just agreeing that&#8217;s the way things work around here. The Glomeruli — kidney cells — are portrayed as women who are expected to work in absolute silence, no matter what they see. Any sort of complaint is seen as shameful, and older cells are constantly encouraging the younger ones to just give up on their emotions and work until they die, with many a character&#8217;s last words being just &#8220;keep on working.&#8221; When a character is stricken with grief and is unable to do his job, he gets yelled at because he&#8217;s physically fine and can&#8217;t take a break.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">More-so than the main series, <i>Code Black</i> deals with mental health issues and how they affect your physical health, like the aforementioned grief-stricken cell being unable to function as he struggles to cope with a heavy loss. This is a welcome addition to the show, especially during a time when it&#8217;s safe to say most people&#8217;s mental health is taking a hue toll due to&#8230;well, <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Make no mistake: this show has no sense of optimism. At most, it argues that you can maybe find small joys in your suffering, and the finale teases an incredibly cruel potential season 2. Is this necessary? Maybe not, but it&#8217;s definitely an effective wake-up call.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Why Non-Anime Fans Should Check It Out</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Very few anime have managed to capture the horror of the work-life under late-stage capitalism as well as <i>Code Black </i>does. Not only is this an entertaining horror show with compelling characters you care about (but shouldn&#8217;t get attached to), it shines a light on both the horrifying effects an unhealthy lifestyle has on your body, and also on the real horrors of being overworked in a gig-economy that doesn&#8217;t give a single damn about your or your health. As we start to see a light at the end of this pandemic tunnel, it&#8217;s important to remember we are not completely out yet, and as some workers start returning to an office after working from home for the past year, remember to take care of yourselves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Watch This If You Like: </b><i>Osmosis Jones, Devilman Crybaby, Neon Genesis Evangelion, feeling bad about your health</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Cells at Work: CODE BLACK </i>is streaming on Funimation.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cells-at-work-code-black/\">&#8216;Cells at Work: CODE BLACK&#8217; is an Anime That Will Scare You Into Taking Better Care of Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/GM7_y3fYToE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:00:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cells-at-Work-CODE-BLACK-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"fd1dbb2393993bc7e77722c3ccb713f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-19-440_48fad67bf3bf3f6b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":55968,"destBytes":42612,"author":"Rafael Motamayor","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cells-at-Work-CODE-BLACK-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-19-440_48fad67bf3bf3f6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn2@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-42-886_ae043edcb9b5e1a1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GM7_y3fYToE:vCPNjjhyE9o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-384_226f21a763cb9c71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/GM7_y3fYToE":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘Powerpuff’ First Look Photo, Ray Fisher Still Wants to Appear in ‘The Flash’ & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666472","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666535 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/powerpuff-liveaction-firstlook-trio-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Powerpuff Girls Live-Action First Look\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/powerpuff-liveaction-firstlook-trio-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/powerpuff-liveaction-firstlook-trio-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Who the hell is <strong>Party Thor</strong> and what is he doing in <strong><em>Marvel&#8217;s What If&#8230;?</em></strong> animated series?

Now Mammoth Screen, BBC Studios, and BritBox in North America are teaming up for another Agatha Christie mystery with a limited series adaptation of the novel <strong><em>Why Didn’t They Ask Evans?</em></strong>, which will be written, directed, and executive produced by <em>House</em> star <strong>Hugh Laurie</strong>.<span id=\"more-666296\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline broke the news of the <em>Why Didn&#8217;t They Ask Evans?</em> TV series in the works from Mammoth Screen, who also produced <em>And Then There Were None</em> and <em>The ABC Murders</em>. If you&#8217;ve never encountered the mystery novel that was first published in 1934, here&#8217;s the official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While playing an erratic round of golf, Bobby Jones slices his ball over the edge of a cliff. His ball is lost, but on the rocks below he finds the crumpled body of a dying man. With his final breath the man opens his eyes and says, &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t they ask Evans?&#8217; Haunted by these words, Bobby and his vivacious companion, Frankie, set out to solve a mystery that will bring them into mortal danger!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Left with only that mysterious question and a photo of a beautiful young woman in the dead man&#8217;s pocket, Bobby Jones and his socialite friend Lady Frances &#8220;Frankie&#8221; Derwent try to figure out who is responsible for this man&#8217;s death and what these cryptic clues actually mean. Though the novel is filled with plenty of danger, there&#8217;s also plenty of levity that the main characters bring to the equation, which makes a comedically-inclined talent like Hugh Laurie the right man to adapt the book into a three-part limited series.</p>\n<p>As of now, Hugh Laurie is also working as writer, director and executive producer of the series, but it&#8217;s hoped that he will also have some kind of role in the series. For Laurie&#8217;s part, he&#8217;s just happy to have a chance to adapt the book that he first read as a child. The actor said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The hairs on the back of my neck haven’t properly settled down from the first time I grasped the beauty of the essential mystery. Since then, I have fallen deeper and deeper in love with the characters, and feel immensely honored to have been given the chance to retell their story in this form. I will wear a tie on set, and give it everything I have.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Laurie has appeared in front of the camera more often than he&#8217;s gotten behind it, but he&#8217;s directed a couple episodes of <em>House</em> and has plenty of writing experience thanks to the beloved sketch comedy series <em>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</em>. He&#8217;s also coming off executive producing <em>The Night Manager</em>, which earned several Emmy and Golden Globes nominations, as well as a few wins.</p>\n<p>Mammoth Screen is certainly thrilled to have Laurie on board with their director of television and executive producer Helen Ziegler saying, &#8220;His dazzling scripts take the mischief and cleverness of the original novel to a new level, and with Hugh sitting in the director’s chair, this really is going to be an authored treat for Christie fans everywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brit Box&#8217;s Emily Powers, head of BritBox North America, added, &#8220;Hugh Laurie’s writing pays homage to the brilliance of the original Agatha Christie mystery while adding fresh wit, humor, and creativity that will appeal to all audiences.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Why Didn&#8217;t They Ask Evans?</em> doesn&#8217;t currently have a release date.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/why-didnt-they-ask-evans-tv-series-by-hugh-laurie/\">&#8216;Why Didn&#8217;t They Ask Evans?&#8217; Limited Series Will Be Written, Directed, and Executive Produced by Hugh Laurie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/u8rkP4dsX1U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 22:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughlaurie-whydidnttheyaskevans-combo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"af0f698eabcdbb7181627bd18b3742c3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-19-553_74a9b41d45941158.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":40679,"destBytes":29476,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughlaurie-whydidnttheyaskevans-combo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-19-553_74a9b41d45941158.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn53@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-42-892_2044dd80d0dcabfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8rkP4dsX1U:F4WHC7VhLSI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-42-909_37d610f661ceaaee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/u8rkP4dsX1U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-42-879_d23b1210c8d2a283.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"How ‘Invader Zim’ Taught an Entire Generation to Prepare For Our Bleak Reality","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666273","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666277 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Invader-Zim-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Invader-Zim.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Invader-Zim-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nickelodeon revolutionized cartoons in the early &#8217;90s with shows like <i>Rugrats</i> and <i>Ren and Stimpy</i>, but by the turn of the millenium, the network was in need of some fresh voices with something new to offer that didn&#8217;t come from Klasky or Csupó. While <i>SpongeBob SquarePants </i>was making headlines and exploding in popularity, it was indie comics creator Jhonenh Vasquez who presented one of the most unique, creepy, nihilistic, and hilarious shows Nickelodeon ever saw. Even 20 years later, <b><i>Invader Zim</i></b> continues to prepare kids for their bleak and doomed futures.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666273\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In case you&#8217;re not familiar, <i>Invader Zim </i>revolves around its titular evil alien named Zim, who gets tasked with infiltrating Earth in order to take over the world. Of course, things aren&#8217;t ever that easy, and Zim is so inept at his job that he ends up barely surviving a terrestrial elementary school and the horrors of human reality. It doesn&#8217;t help that his classmate Dib is a paranormal investigator and 100% onto Zim, and he would stop at nothing to get rid of his pesky alien classmate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the more obvious ways the show stood out among other Nickelodeon cartoons of the time was the way it followed a villainous protagonist, and it was clearly inspired by horror. Vasquez, who had already made a career out of horror-inspired comic books like <i>Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</i> (you can guess what it&#8217;s about), excelled at playing with the small separation between horror and comedy. Vazquez told us in an e-mail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Most horror scenarios, when simply related note for note, come off as so ridiculous and outlandish that they could be considered comical. But when you put yourself in those scenarios as reality, suddenly that joke is your living nightmare. Filtering those moments through a kid’s imagination without limits creates a world as phantasmagorical and hellish as it is wonderful.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">That is the space in which <i>Invader Zim </i>thrived, turning the hellish reality Vasquez and other adults were already experiencing in the early &#8217;00s, and translating it as nightmares that kids would find too ridiculous to be afraid of, even as they subconsciously were preparing for that nightmare to become their future reality.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Take the show&#8217;s constant reliance on body horror, for instance. For a cartoon aimed at kids, a majority of <i>Invader Zim</i> episodes revolved around how grotesque and fragile our bodies really are. For one, humans are constantly referred to as meat sacks that house our consciousnesses, and they are constantly decaying. There is an episode about a lice infection that quickly takes over the entire school and drives the kids mad trying to scratch their disgusting heads; another episode deals with Zim getting a pimple that has psychic abilities and grows exponentially before exploding in a massive wave of pus; one time Zim literally fuses Dib&#8217;s DNA with bologna, which starts rotting away throughout the day. Watching <i>Invader Zim </i>as a kid was hilarious because of its broad and gross humor, and because this was a show airing on the same network as <i>SpongeBob,</i> it was bold to have its protagonist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbL2vhGQqGI&#38;ab_channel=invaderzimmoments232\"><span class=\"s1\">gouge a kid&#8217;s eyes out</span></a> in order to implant the idea that he is a squirrel in his brain. As an adult, however, the show is just a grim reminder of what the rest of my life will be like — slowly seeing your meat sack rot and break away. Vazquez said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;It’s just part of being alive. What’s more horrifying than being a fragile bubble of blood and organs threatening to fail or be popped at any given moment? The show was influenced by my childhood interpretations of horror movies and books, as well as my innate horror at simply being alive. What’s funnier than that?&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, finding the fact that one day your organs will fail and you&#8217;ll suffer a painful death to be hilarious is certainly a take, but there&#8217;s no denying the way the show so effectively mocks our reality by showing us a somehow even worse one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The horror also extends beyond just knowing your body will fail and disappear with time. <i>Invader Zim </i>is also a generally nihilistic look at the pointlessness of life, how everything just sucks, and that we live in a failed society run by idiots. Schools are basically meaningless prisons, and the teacher is so disinterested in anything going on that when Dib goes to her asking for advice in dealing with horrible nightmares, she replies, &#8220;It’s called life, Dib, sit down.&#8221; Fast food chains like MacMeatie&#8217;s make their food out of recycled napkins, advertisements are rotting kids&#8217; brains away, selling them video game consoles called &#8220;Game Slave.&#8221; Yet, we run and fight each other for the opportunity to be first in line to play the latest game while eating a disgusting napkin burger. Even Santa Claus is a total scam.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Invader Zim</i> was never subtle about its anti-consumption, anti-corporate themes, but it found a morbid comedic tone about portraying a world where no one ever learns any moral lessons. Everyone in charge of anything is just too stupid and apathetic to care. Many cartoons and kids&#8217; movies portray adults as dumber than the kids in order to make them appear more heroic or reflect how kids feel about the parents who just don&#8217;t understand them. But <i>Invader Zim</i> takes a different approach to prepare its audience to enter a world where everything is broken and it&#8217;s pointless to fight it because everyone is too dumb to listen. As Vazquez said, it&#8217;s &#8220;an awful world where people have gotten so disconnected and focused on the worst, most petty things.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is no saving the day in <i>Invader Zim</i>, there&#8217;s just delaying the inevitable — and after living through 2020, this has never been more relatable. As Vasquez described the uniquely nihilistic humor of the show, &#8220;maybe it has something to do with that very human quality of finding amusement in watching other people be more tormented than yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is certainly something about <i>Invader Zim</i> being so incredibly, unapologetically, horrendously awful that makes it even funnier as an adult because you can laugh at finding other characters being more miserable than you. While <i>SpongeBob</i> and <i>The Fairly OddParents</i> were dominating the ratings over at Nickelodeon in 2001, and the original <i>Justice League</i> cartoon was introducing a generation to the superhero team, <i>Invader Zim </i>was preparing some of us for our impending doom with gross jokes, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJh7j3INmw&#38;ab_channel=JuanLechuga\"><span class=\"s1\">lots of tacos</span></a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/invader-zim-revisited/\">How &#8216;Invader Zim&#8217; Taught an Entire Generation to Prepare For Our Bleak Reality</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/WrWPPthTp3w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 18:00:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Invader-Zim-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"b3f8566c9812abb622f87bc526dd4e40","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-21-401_39af556ccd230db7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33778,"destBytes":22370,"author":"Rafael Motamayor","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Invader-Zim-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-21-401_39af556ccd230db7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn86@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-42-911_d2bd1d42f1d64558.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WrWPPthTp3w:yc1iC8bEIbc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn73@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-42-907_3b5825f7a52bb2b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/WrWPPthTp3w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn66@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-42-879_237cf8ee731488aa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"Hugh Jackman and Laura Dern Will Star in ‘The Son’ from ‘The Father’ Director Florian Zeller","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666581","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666589 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughjackman-lauradern-combo-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Son Movie Cast - Hugh Jackman and Laura Dern\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughjackman-lauradern-combo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughjackman-lauradern-combo-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Florian Zeller</strong>&#8216;s drama <em>The Father</em> had a surprising presence in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2021-oscar-nominations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the 2021 Oscar nominations</a>, and the film also just walked away <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2021-bafta-awards-winners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with a couple BAFTAs</a> across the pond.

Just like <em>The Father</em>, the screenplay will be adapted from the stage play that Florian Zeller wrote with <strong>Christopher Hampton</strong>, the Oscar-winning writer behind <em>Dangerous Liasons</em> and <em>Atonement</em>. Both will team to adapt the script just as they did for <em>The Father</em>, but despite the relationship implied in the titles, <em>The Son</em> is not a sequel or a prequel. Here&#8217;s a synopsis from the play&#8217;s production at the <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/the-son-west-end/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">West End in London</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nicolas is going through a difficult phase after his parents&#8217; divorce. He&#8217;s listless, skipping school, lying and thinks that moving in with his father and his new family may help. A fresh start. When he doesn&#8217;t settle there either, he decides that going back to his mother&#8217;s may be the answer. When change feels like the only way to survive, what will he do when the options begin to run out?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hugh Jackman will play Peter, Nicholas&#8217; father, who is busy settling into a life with his new partner Emma and their baby. Laura Dern will play Nicholas&#8217; mother, Kate, who brings the teen to Peter in a desperate bid for help dealing with his depression. Peter strives to be a better father, searching to help his son with those intimate and instinctive moments of family happiness – to solve, with understanding, what Nicholas is going through. But the weight of Nicholas&#8217; condition sets the family on a dangerous course. They must do everything they can to maintain the bonds that hold them together.</p>\n<p>Florian Zeller said in a statement, &#8220;Both Hugh and Laura naturally convey great warmth, compassion, and vulnerability…inviting our audience to embrace and feel every moment. The story is set in a vibrant and very much alive New York, an important character. The movie should make us call family and friends to tell them that they are wholly loved and not alone.&#8221; While I can do without referring to New York as a character, the story does sound harrowing and the play has been acclaimed for its piercing portrayal of teenage depression.</p>\n<p>Zeller also has another play called <em>The Mother</em> that completes a sort of thematic trilogy. It follows the story of a mother whose children have grown up and moved on, leaving her alone and unsure of her place in life, questioning her own existence. If <em>The Son</em> ends up being as successful as <em>The Father</em>, perhaps we&#8217;ll get to see <em>The Mother</em> on the big screen too, and then there will be some kind of Criterion Collection box set with all three films.</p>\n<p><em>The Son</em> will be produced by <strong>Iain Canning</strong> and <strong>Emile Sherman</strong> (<em>Lion</em>, <em>The King&#8217;s Speech</em>) along with <strong>Joanna Laurie</strong> of See-Saw Films and <em>The Father</em> producers <strong>Christophe Spadone</strong> and Florian Zeller himself. Film4 is co-financing the production.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-son-movie-cast-hugh-jackman-laura-dern/\">Hugh Jackman and Laura Dern Will Star in &#8216;The Son&#8217; from &#8216;The Father&#8217; Director Florian Zeller</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ohTBO_0oTpQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughjackman-lauradern-combo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"3d109c2d05b0f2768fd3a286dd8e9b48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn24@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-21-244_ab6b0476e09752b9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":29697,"destBytes":16768,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hughjackman-lauradern-combo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn24@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-21-244_ab6b0476e09752b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn90@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-42-905_6085390cab6ca380.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ohTBO_0oTpQ:gBh0XuM_OZQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn87@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-42-917_9015143ec85c67e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ohTBO_0oTpQ":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"‘Cliff Walkers’ Trailer: Zhang Yimou’s Snowy Spy Thriller Hits Chinese and U.S. Theaters on the Same Date","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666492","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666503\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cliff-walkers-e1618339409543-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"cliff walkers trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cliff-walkers-e1618339409543-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cliff-walkers-e1618339409543-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cliff-walkers-e1618339409543-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cliff-walkers-e1618339409543.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The master of wuxia is taking on the spy genre. <strong>Zhang Yimou</strong>, whose wuxia masterworks <em>House of Flying Daggers</em> and <em>Hero</em> helped catapult the Chinese martial arts film to the global stage, is back with his first film since 2018&#8217;s <em>Shadow</em>, and his first-ever espionage movie. <strong><em>Cliff Walkers</em></strong> is a snowy spy thriller set in the puppet state of Manchukuo in the 1930s and follows four Communist party special agents on a secret mission.

It&#8217;s almost as if the Chinese auteur was a practiced hand with this genre, but it&#8217;s all new to him — Zhang has almost exclusively made wuxia films throughout his illustrious three-decade career, and more frequently, his films have been replete with color. But as of late, Zhang has begun to experiment with different styles — turning to Hollywood with the ill-advised <em>Great Wall </em>(not good), and making the monochromatic wuxia film <em>Shadow</em> (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/best-foreign-movies-and-tv-streaming-december-12/\">much better</a>). And he&#8217;s making an even bigger leap, to the spy genre, with <em>Cliff Walkers</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Cliff Walkers</em> is his first film since 2018&#8217;s <em>Shadow</em>, though that wasn&#8217;t always meant to be. Zhang was working on his magnum opus <em>One Second</em> for years, a deeply personal film based on his experiences during the Cultural Revolution. But despite plans to premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/one-second-is-movie-good-get-cannes-1208507\">China&#8217;s censorship boards got to <em>One Second</em></a>, and it might just be lost to the world forever. At least Zhang appears to have bounced back with with the intriguing, beautifully shot <em>Cliff Walkers</em>, which will be the rare film to be released in both Chinese and U.S. theaters on the same date.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Cliff Walkers</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Based on the script by Quan Yongxian, CLIFF WALKERS is director Zhang Yimou&#8217;s first foray into the spy genre. Set the puppet state of Manchukuo in the 1930s, the film follows four Communist party special agents who return to China after receiving training in the Soviet Union. Together, they embark on a secret mission code-named &#8220;Utrennya.&#8221; After being sold out by a traitor, the team find themselves surrounded by threats on all sides from the moment they parachute into the mission. Will the agents break the impasse and complete their mission? On the snowy grounds of Manchukuo, the team will be tested to their limit.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Cliff Walkers</em> premieres in both Chinese and U.S. theaters on <strong>April 30, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666504\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/CliffWalkersPoster-700x1074.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1074\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/CliffWalkersPoster-700x1074.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/CliffWalkersPoster-326x500.jpeg 326w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/CliffWalkersPoster-768x1178.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/CliffWalkersPoster.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cliff-walkers-trailer/\">&#8216;Cliff Walkers&#8217;

It rules.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666392\"></span></p>\n<p>You might not remember this at this point – so much other crazy shit has happened since –  but as the year 2012 approached, there was a lot of talk about an ancient Mayan prophecy that suggested the world would end on December 21, 2012. Of course, that didn&#8217;t happen, and like the fears of Y2k, the fears of 2012 seem silly and quaint in retrospect. Of course, most people weren&#8217;t really afraid of the so-called Mayan prophecy to begin with, but still – it was fun to speculate. And since Roland Emmerich never misses an excuse to kill billions of people for the sake of entertainment, he jumped at the chance to make <em>2012</em>, a truly epic disaster pic in which the Mayan prophecy turns out to be true.</p>\n<p>You see, the Earth&#8217;s crust has become unstable due to solar flares, or some such thing. There&#8217;s no reason to get too hung up about the science here since the film&#8217;s script, by Emmerich and <strong>Harald Kloser</strong>, isn&#8217;t really interested in that. Instead, it just wants to destroy everything – and it does, with a series of truly spectacular set pieces in which one landmark-heavy city after the next is obliterated with impressive special effects. Los Angeles is swallowed up by an earthquake, a tsunami takes out Washington D.C., Yellowstone National Park becomes a volcano, chaos reigns. Emmerich&#8217;s disaster pics tend to lose sight of the loss of life associated with all this destruction – the human casualties are almost always an afterthought. But <em>2012</em> changes things up a bit by introducing us to several characters who are just flat-out doomed. It hammers home the staggering death toll – although it doesn&#8217;t hammer it home <em>too much</em>, since this is still a big dumb popcorn movie, not an existential drama.</p>\n<p>Emmerich also leans into some dark humor here – Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Governor of California at the time the film was made, and the director goes so far as to have an actor impersonate Governor Schwarzenegger on TV, telling everyone that California is safe and sound mere seconds before a massive earthquake hits and kills pretty much everyone. Later, two old women are driving home from the grocery store in the midst of that same earthquake. &#8220;Keep an eye on those eggs!&#8221; one woman sternly says to the other – right before their car slams into a piece of the street that suddenly rises up before them. It&#8217;s mean-spirited, but you can&#8217;t help but chuckle at the absurdity.</p>\n<p>In the midst of all this mayhem is John Cusack, who plays a failed author turned limo driver. He&#8217;s estranged from his wife (<strong>Amanda Peet</strong>) and kids, but that&#8217;s nothing the impending apocalypse can&#8217;t solve. Also caught up in the story is <strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor</strong>, playing a geologist who tries to warn everybody; <strong>Danny Glover</strong> as the President of the United States; and <strong>Woody Harrelson</strong>, who is having a ball playing a conspiracy theorist who – of course – turns out to be correct. It&#8217;s all so spectacularly mindless and wickedly entertaining that you can&#8217;t help but get caught up in it all. In truth, Emmerich should&#8217;ve probably made this his last diaster epic, since it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll ever top it. But who am I kidding – I&#8217;ll be first in line for <em>Moonfall</em>, because no one blows up the planet and kills us all in the process quite like Roland Emmerich.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-2012/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;2012&#8217; is the Disaster Movie to End All Disaster Movies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/8loVWYRucPE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:00:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-quarantine-stream-2012-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"11064f84bf3a5c954603c901f3542007","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn41@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-19-301_5e570579217b8a1f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":31447,"destBytes":18768,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-quarantine-stream-2012-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn41@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-19-301_5e570579217b8a1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn95@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-43-358_2b4960760f56198a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8loVWYRucPE:FYeLv_YzKR4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-42-928_dbdaf74d56fc45e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/8loVWYRucPE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-43-235_8305b851b4a2ea20.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"‘Infinity Train’ Season 4 Review: This Imaginative Locomotive Trip Ended Far Too Soon","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666615","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666619 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/infinitytrain-season4-twomain-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Infinity Train Season 4 Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/infinitytrain-season4-twomain.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/infinitytrain-season4-twomain-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>From the mind of creator <strong>Owen Dennis</strong>, the animated series <strong><i>Infinity Train</i></strong> sent its viewers on a rollicking soul-searching sci-fi ride in its star locomotive. Propelled into popularity by its 2016 pilot, the anthology animated series sent different sets of characters with their own arcs for each season — or “Book,” as the series calls them – with story credits for <strong>Lindsay Katai</strong>, <strong>Alex Horab</strong>, <strong>Madeline Queripel</strong>, and <strong>Justin Michael</strong>. And while Book Four will serve as the show&#8217;s finale with the final season arriving on HBO Max on <strong>April 15</strong>, it doesn&#8217;t quite feel like a fitting conclusion to the imaginative series.<span id=\"more-666615\"></span></p>\n<p>Book One introduced the bizarre realm of train cars with puzzles, kooky residents, wild adventures, and the hand number tattoos that correspond with emotional growth—or slippage. Human passengers must get their number down to zero to earn their exit door back to the real world. Each car contains its own themed world populated with eccentric train “denizens,” sentient anthropomorphic animals, or talking inanimate objects, just to name a few. Humans might get their number down by interacting with denizens and puzzles to pass through the cars. The stepping stones and the slippages matter as much as the destination.</p>\n<p>The main human passenger of each season must confront their traumas and fears: Tulip dealt with her parent’s divorce, Jesse accepts responsibility for giving into peer pressure (although he’s a supporting player in Lake’s quest for self-actualization), and Grace and Simon face truths that shatter their eco- and cult-forged perspective.</p>\n<p>When observing the shifting of the locomotive’s natural order across seasons, there’s a budding interrogation of the nature of a train, led by a robot conductor who enthusiastically applies algorithms to track moral progress, that steals passengers, young children included, and drops them into potential life-or-death situations.</p>\n<p>Book Two challenged the established formula, indicating that subverting and bending the rules outside of the train’s mandates can be one’s salvation, as we witness Lake rage against a system that has erased and neglected her. But Book Three — boy, a tough act to follow — tracked a disintegrating found family who oscillated in grudges and affection before they metastasized into resentment, distrust, terror, and dogmatic callousness. It’s a tough ride, spending time with toxic protagonists, pitying them because they lacked guidance in their train environment, as well as rooting for their healing while simultaneously being appalled at their smash-and-grab transgressions. Compared to how the heavier Book Three dropped in weekly chunks to breathe between bone-chillingly rising stakes, Book Four benefits from a binge-drop of all 10 episodes on HBO Max.</p>\n<p>Like the others, Book Four (&#8220;Duet&#8221;) does welcome questions about the train’s ethics through moments of introspection. Whereas human backstories were previously saved as reveals, &#8220;Duet&#8221; spends its first episode exploring the real-world lives of its passengers and shows their baggage from the get go. Meet Min-Gi (<strong>Johnny Young</strong>) and Ryan (<strong>Sekai Murashige</strong>), two aspiring Asian-Canadian musicians who grew up together since infancy. Both nourished a love of music, and Ryan dreams up a plan for greatness and tours. But a fallout occurs and their paths diverge, their disparate existence, pining, and constant life disappointments unraveling adeptly through the split-screen. Min-Gi has his sights set on college, although secretly he yearns to play his trusty portable synthesizer with Ryan once again. Meanwhile, the electric guitar-strumming Ryan hits the road and finds setbacks. The two young men reunite and become among the human souls spirited away into the <i>Infinity Train</i> to sort out their fallen friendship and individual selves.</p>\n<p>Deposited into an unfamiliar pocket dimension, the two young men become acquainted with an impish floating sentient concierge bell Kez (<i>Regular Show</i> alum <strong>Minty Lewis</strong>), who chatters as chill as an <i>Adventure Time</i> side character and she has some baggage as well. The more train cars the two men and Kez traverse—and happen upon train cars that Kez has previously wreaked havoc on—the more they’re constantly looking over their shoulders for vengeful denizens after their blood.</p>\n<p>Compared to the imagination of previous seasons to the point of high-octane nightmares, Book Four is more subdued. This season was not intended to be a finale season and feels more at place if it was in the middle. It serves as a cleanser palette to the audacious emotional and physical violence that boiled between Grace and Simon. It maintains its sensitivity for the simple and the nuances of healing rifts (even when they finally seem to recover and communicate, downward emotional plunges are also too easy). Talking things out can be messy and it takes tears. Min-Gi and Ryan communicate, joke, and argue on their own wavelengths as real people do, struggling to achieve emotional synchronization. It’s a formula that <i>Infinity Train</i> has entrusted in but its validation of the (seemingly) simple has always been the charm.</p>\n<p>Midway, one of the young men contemplates their future and the frankness of the discussion is timely and speaks to the long-existing issues of Asian representation and existence in western media and how it shapes the insecurities of an aspiring Asian artist. (Sit on that certain conversation and replay the first episode, and the rewatch is richer for it.)</p>\n<p>For longtime viewers coming in for lore, it drops in at a come-and-go tantalizing rate without upstaging the arc of its main subjects. Without spoiling when it comes, it’s evident there’s behind-the-scenes drama, though it matters less than the character development. Alas, longevity for the locomotive was cut short due to the cancelation of the series, which was reportedly planned for more seasons. The show’s unfortunate cancelation would mean the audience is left hanging over other questions about wayward characters, the few aboard the train with stray story threads, from the previous seasons. (#RenewInfinityTrain and #SaveInfinityTrain might be worth a shot.) But at the very least, you don’t have to sweat the worldbuilding mysteries and curiosities as long as characters grow to find better tomorrows. Ryan and Min-Gi are blessed with one of the tidier endings. And as the final line reminds us, life pulses on after people leave the freight.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/infinity-train-season-4-review/\">&#8216;Infinity Train&#8217; Season 4 Review: This Imaginative Locomotive Trip Ended Far Too Soon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ajSi32acoow\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/infinitytrain-season4-twomain-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"af1fe0467951efc82fd0c4ab63461bcc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-19-366_051ac16ec5ed5d6f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31334,"destBytes":20840,"author":"Caroline Cao","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/infinitytrain-season4-twomain-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-19-366_051ac16ec5ed5d6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-43-288_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-42-918_68726e185f96eab8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-43-426_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ajSi32acoow:_7tMN0c1DeM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn58@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-42-911_6255445bc2efc6a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ajSi32acoow":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-43-403_85a6d474a807a1a0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424106894},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:06","title":"‘Without Remorse’ Featurette Tries to Appeal to All the Dads Who Love Tom Clancy Books","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666449","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666470 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/withoutremorse-michaelbjordan-plane-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Clancy's Without Remorse Featurette\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/withoutremorse-michaelbjordan-plane.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/withoutremorse-michaelbjordan-plane-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tom Clancy</strong>&#8216;s tales of espionage stretch from the pages of his many novels to the light of the silver screen, not to mention a franchise of video games and a TV series.

M. Renfield, a character introduced in Bram Stoker&#8217;s original novel <em>Dracula</em> as a patient at a lunatic asylum with a connection to the bloodsucking count. But it appears that Fletcher has departed the project (focusing instead on Paramount&#8217;s <em>The Saint</em> reboot). McKay&#8217;s star is rising since co-directing <em>The Lego Movie</em> and making his solo directorial debut with <i>The Lego Batman Movie, </i>which was met with commercial and critical acclaim. McKay makes his live-action directorial debut with the upcoming <em>The Tomorrow War</em>, a sci-fi action movie starring Chris Pratt which will receive a July premiere on Amazon Prime Video due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>\n<p>Deadline also reports that McKay won out over a number of directors due to his &#8220;ultimate pitch as his ability to balance those [humor and action] in his past projects.&#8221; This was a mix that the studio is reportedly looking for, setting it apart from Universal&#8217;s other high-profile monster movies like <em>Wolfman</em> starring Ryan Gosling and a James Wan-produced <em>Van Helsing</em> movie.</p>\n<p>McKay is joining Skybound Entertainment&#8217;s film team, which includes Kirkman, David Alpert, Bryan Furst, and Sean Furst, as producer on the project. McKay&#8217; producing partner Samantha Nisenboim will also be joining the project as executive producer.</p>\n<p>Other than that, details remain scarce on <em>Renfield</em>. Here&#8217;s what Universal had to say of the project when it was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/renfield-movie/\">first announced in 2019</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Similar to what’s being done with Blumhouse and Leigh Whannell’s upcoming <i>Invisible Man </i>film inspired by Universal’s classic Monster character, instead of pushing forward with the initial notion of an interconnected universe, the studio halted and reassessed and were reminded that what has led to these characters’ endurance over generations is passion and relevance.  Universal remains committed to creating compelling filmmaker-driven projects based on characters from the studios vast monsters legacy.</p>\n<p>Instead of prescribing a mandated updating of these monster stories and making them all part of a larger scheme, the studio loosened these restrictions and open-sourced to filmmakers who were inspired to create their own unique stories.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/renfield-director-chris-mckay/\">&#8216;Renfield&#8217;: Universal&#8217;s &#8216;Dracula&#8217;

But everyone&#8217;s favorite gearhead family is actually going to space in the upcoming, long-delayed <strong><em>F9</em></strong>. So really, where else can the franchise go? That&#8217;s what director <strong>Justin Lin</strong> is deciding as he brings <em>The Fast Saga</em> to an end, with the action franchise reportedly ending with <em>Fast and Furious 11</em>. But while it&#8217;s been reported that this is only the case because <em>Fast and Furious 10</em> is being split into two, Lin reveals in a new interview that he actually sees <em>F9</em> as the &#8220;first chapter&#8221; in a trilogy that will end the franchise.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666620\"></span></p>\n<p>Last year, <em>F9</em> was one of the first tentpole movies to be delayed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. And pushed back again. And again. But amid all those delays, director Justin Lin got the chance to contemplate the future of the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise, which was due to end with the 10th movie. However, in October 2020, Universal announced that <em>The Fast Saga</em> would end with an 11th film also directed by Lin, which he describes to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/f9-filmmaker-justin-lin-breaks-down-trailer-and-explains-trip-to-space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> as the final part in a trilogy of films, starting with <em>F9</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was thinking of it as one chapter. It became very clear to me that if we were going to do that, we were going to need some real estate. To the studio&#8217;s credit, it was like, &#8216;Yeah, let&#8217;s do it.&#8217; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing since I&#8217;ve been back&#8230;processing it as almost like a trilogy as a final chapter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This means that <em>F9</em> is most certainly leading straight into the events of the untitled <em>Fast and Furious 10</em>, though Lin kept mum on the plot of the next two films. He&#8217;s currently in the process of writing the final two installments, telling <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/f9-the-fast-saga-trailer-justin-lin-paul-walker-1234950998/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a>, &#8220;It&#8217;s constantly writing and talking. It&#8217;s what I love. Every time I do one of these, it&#8217;s always a new challenge, and this one, it wasn&#8217;t just one film. I know we&#8217;ve been talking about the final chapter for about 10 years, and now that we&#8217;re starting to see it come to life, it&#8217;s very gratifying. We&#8217;ve been talking about it for so long. So far, so good. It&#8217;s feeling like it&#8217;s the right feel, it&#8217;s the right move, it&#8217;s the right track.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, he also nixed the prospect of finishing the script in time to shoot <em>Fast and Furious 10</em> and <em>11</em> by this year. &#8220;Probably not this year,&#8221; Lin said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure when. You can never have enough time in development with these films. Even though I think there&#8217;s some ideas, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to be shooting this year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what can we expect from the final two films in the franchise? Lin teased to Deadline that &#8220;Any character, in any situation, is up for discussion,&#8221; including the stars of the spin-off films <em>Hobbs and Shaw</em>, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham.

Both films balance on precarious and dangerous conflicts, and Karl’s prints seek to portray the overwhelming situations our protagonists find themselves in,&#8221; the Bottleneck Gallery release teases.</p>\n<p>The art print for <em>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</em> — by far one of the underrepresented Miyazaki film in the art world — is a sight to behold. Rather than depict an actual scene from the 1985 movie, Fitzgerald takes some liberties: showing Nausicaa flying on her glider as she approaches the huge remains of a God Warrior, one of the fearsome creations (and metaphor for nuclear annihilation) that had destroyed the world and left it a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>\n<p>In <em>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</em>, we only see the skulls of the God Warriors, with moss and grass growing on it, in passing — until one is later revived for the climactic battle of the movie in a breathtaking sequence famously animated by a young Hideaki Anno, prior to creating <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. Fitzgerald also takes some liberties with that skull we see of the God Warrior, making his horned helmet look more like an extension of the skeleton in a more high fantasy-oriented version of the fearsome figure. But the effect is haunting, and a must-get for fans of the 1985 animated classic.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nausicaa</em> print, and its slightly more expensive variant, is only in limited availability: only 115 editions of the original are available, while there are only 40 of the variant. See the two prints below.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666603\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-1-700x1054.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1054\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-1-700x1054.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-1-332x500.jpg 332w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-1-768x1156.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Nausicaä</strong> by <em>Karl Fitzgerald</em><br />\nScreen print<br />\n24 x 36 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 115<br />\n$50</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666602\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-2-700x1053.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1053\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-2-700x1053.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-2-332x500.jpg 332w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-2-768x1155.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nausicaa-2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Nausicaä &#8211; Variant</strong> by<em> Karl Fitzgerald</em><br />\nScreen print<br />\n24 x 36 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 40<br />\n$60</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can see Fitzgerald&#8217;s <em>Odachi</em> prints below.

Industry insiders, directors, and general audiences grieved the loss of these Southern California institutions by sharing their favorite moviegoing memories, but the future of the Dome remains murky. Thanks to a couple of recent reports, though, we&#8217;ve learned about two ways the Cinerama Dome could be saved – and why it seems unlikely that the iconic building will be converted into a high-end restaurant.<span id=\"more-666586\"></span></p>\n<p>In the late 1990s, a proposal was put forward to convert the Cinerama Dome into a restaurant. It did not go well. According to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-04-13/arclight-cinerama-dome-closing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The L.A. Times</a>, the Dome was designated L.A. Historic-Cultural Monument No. 659, which gave it a number of significant protections from developers looking to change things up. Those protections still stand, and the city would have to approve any major alterations; the city council and the cultural heritage commission also have the power to delay a permit for demolition for up to a year, should a company swoop in to buy the theater with the intention of razing it to the ground.</p>\n<p>With that seeming like an unlikely outcome in the current scenario, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/arclight-pacific-theatres-cinerama-dome-future-1234950561/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> published an article suggesting some options that could end up saving the Cinerama Dome (although the fate of the nearby theater which currently houses ArcLight Cinemas Hollywood remains unclear). One option is that the current owners could decide to keep the Dome in place and continue using it for screenings and special events. &#8220;There are some rumblings that Christopher Forman, president of the Decurion, the theaters&#8217; parent company, might continue to operate that venue,&#8221; the outlet reports. &#8220;In that scenario, he might enlist other investors or reposition it to be even more of a Hollywood-centric institution than it already is. The cinema currently hosts many filmmaker Q&#38;A’s and special screenings for Oscars and awards voters, and the thought is that could continue to be a viable business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t happen, there&#8217;s always the chance that another buyer swoops in to earn a bunch of goodwill and capitalize on the opportunity to own a thriving hotspot of Hollywood&#8217;s cinematic landscape. Fans have called for companies like Netflix to purchase the theater, but since the streamer recently bought the Egyptian Theater a few blocks away, that doesn&#8217;t seem like the most probable outcome to me. Instead, Variety says Alamo Drafthouse &#8220;could make a play for the venue when it reemerges from bankruptcy.&#8221; The company recently moved into the downtown L.A. area, and after declaring bankruptcy, has gotten a new equity investment and has expressed interest in continuing to expand its footprint. Despite its behind-the-scenes problems, the company clearly puts love and care into movie exhibition, so I could envision a world in which they&#8217;d want to be the saviors of this location that means so much to so many.
