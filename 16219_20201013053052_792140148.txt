This is the latest work by New York/LA based artist <a href=\"https://www.kathleen-ryan.com/\">Kathleen Ryan</a>. I wrote about her oversized &#8216;rotting&#8217; pears, peaches and lemons <a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2019/10/28/kathleen-ryan/\">last year</a>, but these beauties are from a show she had in early 2020 <em>{pre-pandemic}</em> at <a href=\"http://ghebaly.com/work/kathleen-ryan-bad-fruit/\">Francois Ghebaly Gallery</a> in Los Angeles. I am absolutely in awe of Kathleen&#8217;s work, for two reasons&#8230; 1. the meaning behind them, &#8220;a comment on the excessive consumption and a culture of excess that exists all over our world&#8221;; and 2. the insane detail and absolutely exquisite bits and pieces she uses to create this work. The materials list for the grapes looks like this: Amethyst, aventurine, agate, garnet, pyrite, ruby in zoisite, tektite, tigereye, turquoise, serpentine, obsidian, blackstone, Indian unakite, labradorite, Sierra agate, red agate, black agate, serpentine, quartz, marble, amazonite, rhyolite, calcite, dalmation jasper, glass, steel and stainless steel pins, copper tube and copper fittings, polystyrene. And the list for the melon chunks&#8230; cherry quartz, rose quartz, agate, smoky quartz, rhodenite, rhotochrocite, labradorite, quartz, citrine, calcite, horn, stone looking beads, silver lace agate, magnacite, rhyolite, Botswana agate, carnelian, acrylic, glass, cast iron and brass flies, steel and stainless steel pins, polystyrene, aluminum Airstream trailer. <strong><em>Airstream trailer!?</em></strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 08:00:06 +0000","feedId":16219,"bgimg":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kathleenryan3.jpg","linkMd5":"f4ec2f649c7fd056958c7ce25d4bdf19","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn34@2020_3/2020/10/13/05-30-50-411_41dd5395c2b5aa7d.webp","destWidth":584,"destHeight":9939,"sourceBytes":3352330,"destBytes":1004374,"author":"the jealous curator","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kathleenryan3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn34@2020_3/2020/10/13/05-30-50-411_41dd5395c2b5aa7d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602566982091}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 13:29:42","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:29:42","feedId":16219,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 05:29:42 +0000","fetchMs":559,"handleMs":1199,"totalMs":72127,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"a673d2967a041fd98f60051496a85ec7","hostName":"us-011*","requestId":"758976660a29475db144d12cdc9a5819_16219","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":1004374,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:12:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:12:21","id":16219,"name":"The Jealous Curator","url":"http://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/feed/","subscriber":206,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":1004374,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602566980316,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":576,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":1199,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kathleenryan3.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":584,"destHeight":9939,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn34@2020_3/2020/10/13/05-30-50-411_41dd5395c2b5aa7d.webp","sourceBytes":3352330,"destBytes":1004374,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":16219,"totalSpendMs":8770,"convertSpendMs":396,"createdTime":"2020-10-13 13:30:43","host":"europe70*","referer":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/?p=36859","linkMd5ListStr":"f4ec2f649c7fd056958c7ce25d4bdf19,f4ec2f649c7fd056958c7ce25d4bdf19","githubUser":"myreaderx8","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"destSize":"980.8 KB","compressRate":"30%","sourceSize":"3.2 MB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
