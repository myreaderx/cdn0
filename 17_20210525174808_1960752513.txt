something he shared with the Transcendentalists of his generation, and particularly with his best friend: the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/15/emerson-divinity-school-address/\">naturalistic transcendence-shaman</a> Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>\n<p>In 1856, while living next door to <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/07/05/elizabeth-peabody-figuring/\">the visionary Elizabeth Peabody</a> in Boston &#8212; the seedbed of Transcendentalism, a term Peabody herself had coined &#8212; Alcott borrowed and devoured Emerson&#8217;s copy of a book sent to him by an obscure young Brooklyn poet as a token of gratitude <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/08/emerson-whitman-letter/\">for having inspired it</a>: Walt Whitman&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/11/leaves-of-grass-margaret-cook/\"><em>Leaves of Grass</em></a>, published months earlier.</p>\n<p>Whitman&#8217;s unexampled verse &#8212; so free from the Puritanical conventions of poetry, so lush with a love of life, so unabashedly reverent of nature as the only divinity &#8212; stirred a deep resonance with Bronson&#8217;s own worldview and inspired him to try his hand at the portable poetics of nature: gardening. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69844\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tomato-by-elizabeth-blackwell-from-a-curious-herbal-1737-benefiting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?resize=680%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1001\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69844\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?w=1411&#38;ssl=1 1411w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?resize=240%2C353&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?resize=320%2C471&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?resize=768%2C1131&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?resize=600%2C884&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_tomato.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tomato, or Love-Apple, from Elizabeth Blackwell&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/29/elizabeth-blackwell-curious-herbal/\">pioneering 1737 encyclopedia of edible plants</a>.

Breath, bread, health, a hearthstone, a fountain, fruits, a few garden seeds and room to plant them in, a wife and children, a friend or two of either sex, conversation, neighbours, and a task life-long given from within &#8212; these are contentment and a great estate.

We witness our boundaries dissolved, in turn dissolving that most limited and damaging foundational falsehood upon which the whole of the consumerist-extractionist complex is built: that the rest of the living world is a parallel world, a place to visit and mine for experiences and resources with which to adorn and enrich our separate human world. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73310\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/praise-song-for-dawn-proceeds-benefiting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C851&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"851\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73310\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1535&#38;ssl=1 1535w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C401&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C751&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C301&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C962&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=1227%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1227w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PraiseSongForDawn_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Praise Song for Dawn</em> by Maria Popova. (Available <a href=\"https://society6.com/product/praise-song-for-dawn-proceeds-benefiting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as a print</a>, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It is naïve and impracticable to insist that course-correcting our presently catastrophic trajectory of nature-destruction &#8212; that is, of self-destruction &#8212; requires reverting to the rugged naturalistic self-reliance that even Thoreau himself could not sustain beyond his short-lived experiment at Walden Pond, a life without consumption or companionship. Whatever it does require must begin with the elemental recognition that these are not separate worlds existing in parallel, that there is no &#8220;environment&#8221; surrounding the centrality of the human animal in nature, that there is nothing that can be bad for nature yet good for us &#8212; an elemental fact rendered achingly countercultural every time I walk into my local grocery store and see the organic produce, the good-for-us stuff, plastic-wrapped over styrofoam trays that will take tens of thousands of years to decompose in the landfill, leeching unfathomable toxicity in the process. It is a small act of resistance to contact store management with an appeal for change &#8212; small but not negligible, and certainly not naïve. As Thoreau himself put it in the conclusion of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Walden-Yale-Nota-Henry-Thoreau/dp/0300110081/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Walden</em></strong></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Robert Macfarlane and Jackie Morris&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/11/21/the-lost-spells-macfarlane-morris/\">lyrical illustrated rewilding of our relationship to nature</a>, ornithologist and wildlife ecologist J. Drew Lanham on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/04/21/j-drew-lanham-nature/\">the spirituality of science</a>, and poet Diane Ackerman&#8217;s lovely notion of the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/23/diane-ackerman-earth-ecstatic/\">&#8220;Earth ecstatic,&#8221;</a> then revisit Thoreau on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/20/thoreau-trees/\">the true value of a tree</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/02/20/thoreau-social-change/\">the long cycles of social change</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/12/thoreau-civil-disobedience/\">how to use civil disobedience as an instrument of change</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.
