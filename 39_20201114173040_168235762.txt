Traditional carpentry and artisanal concrete terrazzo added their own friendly touches to the project as well. The three pieces – Cantilever, Radial and Raíz – are each very different from the other two, allowing you to create new groupings depending upon the space you&#8217;re in. One element that ties the three together nicely is their fused base.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_434098\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434098\"

is architect and educator Germane Barnes, principal of Studio Barnes LLC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;‘Hope’ is a tough word,” says Barnes, when asked what he hopes 2021 will bring to the design world. An assistant professor at the University of Miami School of Architecture, the Chicago-born architect has a big year on tap: In February, his work will appear in MoMA’s first-ever all-Black exhibition, Reconstructions: Architecture and Blackness in America. Still, he’s trepidatious, and concerned that 2020’s gestures to greater inclusivity will reveal themselves as a passing trend, rather than a sea change. “You can feel let down when you hope for things. But if we don&#8217;t hope for things, I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re supposed to continue to do the work. My hope is that 2020 isn&#8217;t just a blip on the radar.”</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4bMLnIC0emg\" width=\"810\" height=\"455\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Also in this episode of Milkshake, Barnes shares what he learned while interning in Cape Town that he could have only learned in the South African city: “Undergrad taught me that I was a tool: Go design a YMCA. Go design a car wash. Go design a library. I didn&#8217;t know my agency. Cape Town taught me my agency — and that I can be a force for change,” Barnes says. “It also taught me about the diversity of blackness. I wasn&#8217;t seen as a Black person — I was seen as an American.” Finally, Barnes shares his perspective on a question that’s dominating conversations within the design world: Is it doing enough to nurture the talent of Black architects — and how can the field grow when their contributions are given the attention and support they deserve?</p>\n<p>View Germane’s DMTV Milkshake episode above, then check out the rest of the series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg78zLY1oQztyRgHfo5rKVp1qWAQn8r3k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Diana Ostrom, who has written for Wallpaper, Interior Design, ID, The Wall Street Journal, and other outlets, is also the author of <a href=\"http://farawayplaces.co/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Faraway Places</a>, a newsletter about travel.</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/tag/DMTV-Milkshake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Milkshake</a>, DMTV (Design Milk TV)’s first regular series, shakes up the traditional interview format by asking designers, creatives, educators and industry professionals to select interview questions at random from their favorite bowl or vessel.

(My mom: “We didn’t think you were coming back.”)</p>\n<p>As we prepare to hunker down for the seasons ahead, I’ve struggled with how to revamp this quasi-temporary space – which means I was extremely excited to see Kelly Wearstler’s <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">MasterClass</a> on interior design. Pros: Watching Kelly Wearstler apply paint samples to a white wall in the Proper Hotel in Downtown L.A. is like ASMR for the home design set. I also definitely need a cling-clangy bracelet of metal samples (ideally including various rare and precious metals.) Con: After 150 minutes of instruction, I’m still not 100% on how to handle the 125-square-foot space I’m currently sitting in, but at least now I know to refer to my nascent design scheme as a “story” (drink every time Wearstler says “story” and you will be dead by the end of the class) – and that lemon-yellow (“citron”) paint basically cures all ills.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_434354\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434354\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434354\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-434354\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8-810x456.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8-800x451.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8-768x433.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8-600x337.jpg 600w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kelly Wearstler</p></div>\n<p>Here, a few more notes from a class I wish had been twice (minimum) as long:</p>\n<p>1. Kelly Wearstler names the figures in her paintings/textiles – like Gilda, the inspiration for a private dining room at the Proper Hotel in San Francisco – and she commits to this decision: “You are served dinner on Gilda’s china.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434349\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434349\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434349\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-3-810x457.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-3-810x457.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-3-800x451.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-3-768x433.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>2. We should buy literally everything that catches our fancy: “Having that incredible teapot with a beautiful spoon when you’re stirring your tea – everything is an experience, and you should make it the best you can at home.”</p>\n<p>3. “If we look good, we feel good – and if things are functional, we perform better.”</p>\n<p>4. Nothing manipulates space better than mirrors. This is especially true if you’re a we’re-guessing-celebrity client blowing out a 400-square-foot closet to be used for dressing and entertaining.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434353\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434353\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434353\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-7-810x508.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-7-810x508.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-7-800x501.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-7-768x481.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-7.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>5. For inspiration, lean into your space’s history, as told by its architectural elements: “Engage with your architecture – what is the hinge? What is the door handle? What is the molding around your window? What is your front door? What is your interior door? In terms of the interior architecture, this is your canvas. This is the space that’s going to hold all the beautiful things that you find: art, furniture, lighting. So really be thoughtful about the canvas you’re creating.”</p>\n<p>6. Everyone needs a metal swatching collection that appears to have one sample of solid gold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434348\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434348\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434348\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-2-810x448.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-2-810x448.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-2-800x443.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-2-768x425.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>7. Color! The most affordable way to get it is with paint. “If someone wants something that’s bright and clean, white and the many shades of white, is perfect for them.” (Choosing a white, she says, is harder than choosing a blue.) For something happy: citron. For “sexy and sensual,” a “beautiful scarlet red.”</p>\n<p>8. Watching Wearstler languorously, contemplatively apply paint samples to a room wall at the Proper Hotel in Downtown L.A. basically counts as the day’s meditation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434350\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434350\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434350\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-4-810x452.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-4-810x452.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-4-800x446.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-4-768x428.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-4.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>9. When mixing various textures, think in a single color: “You can’t go wrong with a monochromatic story … All of the materials that are here all have a very distinctive voice and a very distinctive texture, but they work harmoniously together.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434351\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434351\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434351\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-5-810x476.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-5-810x476.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-5-800x470.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-5-768x451.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-5.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>10. Smaller-scale patterns might read as refined whereas its large-scale equivalent will demand more attention.</p>\n<p>11. In her personal living room, Wearstler selected her furniture to activate its two primary architectural features: a 15-foot window and a fireplace: “You can have things that look cool and are sculptural, but it’s important that when you have friends and family over, that the function is there, and it’s warm.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434352\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434352\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434352\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-6-810x457.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-6-810x457.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-6-800x451.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-6-768x433.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-6.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>12. Near the end of the session is a walk-through of Santa Monica’s Proper Hotel, which looks amazing. As an ad for the hotel – which appears alongside a “field trip” to the under-construction DTLA Proper (you’ll remember the paint application) and images from the gorgeous S.F. Proper – this is a five-star experience.</p>\n<p><em>Diana Ostrom, who has written for Wallpaper, Interior Design, ID, The Wall Street Journal, and other outlets, is also the author of <a href=\"http://farawayplaces.co/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Faraway Places</a>, a newsletter about travel.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/YvWtVzWJBhg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 18:00:33 +0000","feedId":39,"bgimg":"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-1-810x449.jpg","linkMd5":"4c4f7809000a0e1ec075ca2ffdd2aa4e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn31@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-03-886_7f7df75d44af6bc1.webp","destWidth":810,"destHeight":449,"sourceBytes":50029,"destBytes":31272,"author":"Design Milk Staff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-1-810x449.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn31@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-03-886_7f7df75d44af6bc1.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-8-810x456.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn48@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-36-007_62a4d95de4fb750c.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-3-810x457.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn41@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-35-584_80ce935db0336709.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-7-810x508.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn74@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-34-656_799b2c0e83523cde.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-2-810x448.jpg":null,"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-4-810x452.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn46@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-36-970_e4b8ee8044e662c8.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-5-810x476.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-34-465_c61c04c767970680.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/masterclass-kelly-wearstler-6-810x457.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn88@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-36-390_6a9b495d738f0cad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/YvWtVzWJBhg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn26@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-35-226_fec07239ec57a5ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001554},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"2020 Gift Guide – Health & Wellness","link":"https://design-milk.com/?p=432211","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/2020-gift-guide-health-wellness/dm-gg-2020-header-healthwellness/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/DM-GG-2020-Header-HealthWellness-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"2020 Gift Guide &#8211; Health &#038; Wellness\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If there was ever a year to remember to put your <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/wellness-holiday-gift-guide-2020?utm_source=editorial_website&#38;utm_medium=gift_guide&#38;utm_campaign=wellness_holiday_gift_guide_2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">health and wellness</a> first, 2020 is definitely the year.

Originally built in 1958, the home features four bedrooms with three bathrooms overlooking a nearly half-acre lot.</p>\n<p>A primary guide for the main palette of the home came from sandy hues of the Sahara Desert, mixed with sun-bleached blues found in the garments worn by the Tuareg people. As such, the interior features a variety of vintage pieces along with some works designed by Robert McKinley himself.</p>\n<p>In an effort to create a unique space during unprecedented times, McKinley comments, &#8220;We were inspired to create an oasis, a space where art and design flow perfectly with the outside world. We wanted to build a space where people can escape and be together.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a

W.E.B. Du Bois Mapping Diagrams<br />\nIn 1897, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that separate was equal. W.E.B. Du Bois, the prominent African-American intellectual, was documenting the African-American Community at the same time as the case. He presented a mixed picture about the state of racial progress in the country. African-Americans faced the failure of Reconstruction to be brought to completion and the coming decades of Jim Crow. Despite discrimination, a new generation of African-Americans found ways to uplift themselves, through grassroots efforts in education and business.</p>\n<p>”It is not one problem,” as Du Bois wrote in 1898, “but rather a plexus of social problems, some new, some old, some simple, some complex; and these problems have their one bond of unity in the act that they group themselves above those Africans whom two centuries of slave-trading brought into the land.” After graduating with a Ph.D. in history from Harvard University, Du Bois sought a way to process all of this information showing why the African diaspora in America was being held back in a tangible and illustrative form.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_433996\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=433996\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-433996\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-433996\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gees-Bend-Quilts-810x745.png\" alt=\"quilt\" width=\"810\" height=\"745\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gees-Bend-Quilts-810x745.png 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gees-Bend-Quilts-800x736.png 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gees-Bend-Quilts-768x707.png 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gees-Bend-Quilts.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo via <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-alabama-women-made-quilts-modern-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Artsy</a></p></div>\n<p>2. Gee&#8217;s Bend Quilts<br />\nAs the Alabama River flows south, it meanders in a series of bends. And about 30 miles from Selma, one of those bends forms an isolated peninsula, which is filled by the hamlet of Gee’s Bend. Gee’s Bend (now also known as Boykin) is home to generations of African-American families whose ancestors were brought to the area as slaves, back when the South was covered in plantations. The women of Gee’s Bend have created a conclave of makers, quilters that are recognized globally and they have made their mark in the Art World.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_434001\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434001\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434001\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-434001\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Urban-Farming-810x544.png\" alt=\"urban farming lot\" width=\"810\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Urban-Farming-810x544.png 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Urban-Farming-800x537.png 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Urban-Farming-768x515.png 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Urban-Farming.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/oko-farms-grows-in-bushwick-thanks-to-one-womans-vision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Vogue</a></p></div>\n<p>3. Urban Farming<br />\nOne thing the Pandemic has taught me is the need for nature. Taking the response a bit further is the need to grow our own food. I have been working with our <a href=\"http://sce.parsons.edu/blog/special_project/design-workshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Parsons Design Workshop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.okofarms.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">OKO Farms</a> to create an Urban Farm that filled a community need in Weeksville, Brooklyn. There are quite a few food deserts across the Metropolitan area. They result in correlated areas of poor health, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The Community Garden movement has existed for decades in New York City, and a new movement in food growing has filled once derelict Urban Spaces, open lots and old warehouse roofs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_433993\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=433993\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-433993\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-433993\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-1520-Sedgwick-Avenue-810x477.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-1520-Sedgwick-Avenue-810x477.png 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-1520-Sedgwick-Avenue-800x471.png 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-1520-Sedgwick-Avenue-768x452.png 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-1520-Sedgwick-Avenue.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo via <a href=\"https://thesource.com/2016/08/11/today-in-hip-hop-history-a-kool-herc-party-pops-off-in-the-bronx-43-years-ago/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Source</a></p></div>\n<p>4. 1520 Sedgwick Avenue<br />\nAugust 11, 1973 can be considered the beginning of the Hip Hop history timeline. What was intended to be an end of summer party at 1520 Sedgwick Ave in the Bronx ending up being ground zero for one of the most important musical phenomenon of the century, the birth of Hip Hop. The building is typical of NYCHA Housing, nothing extraordinary. But it is a famous address for what happened there that Summer in the rec room.</p>\n<p>The event was a back-to-school party in the first floor rec room of the Bronx apartment building. Cindy C. booked her 16-year-old, Clive aka DJ Kool Herc, to spin the decks and the date was set. Hand-drawn index flashcard fliers were handed out all over the city advertising “A Kool Herc Party” with a $.25 cover for the ladies and a whopping $.50 for any fellas looking to have a good time. When the night of the event came, 300 people showed up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_433997\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=433997\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-433997\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-433997\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gordon-Parks-Segregation-Story-810x449.png\" alt=\"children looking through chainlink fence\" width=\"810\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gordon-Parks-Segregation-Story-810x449.png 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gordon-Parks-Segregation-Story-800x443.png 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gordon-Parks-Segregation-Story-768x425.png 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gordon-Parks-Segregation-Story.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo via <a href=\"https://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/the-jim-crow-south-gordon-parks-photo-series-on-exhibit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Medill Reports Chicago</a></p></div>\n<p>5. Gordon Parks<br />\nGordon Parks’ “Segregation Story,” a series of photographs that was first published in Life magazine in 1956. It was controversial because it forced people to view segregation and racial inequality from a different perspective – that of the oppressed. In the photo, six black children face a chainlink fence, peering at a park on the opposite side. Because of segregation we, the viewer, join them as they longingly gaze at the green park and its white occupants.</p>\n<p><strong>Designs by Mark Gardner:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434000\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434000\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434000\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Tanzania-Beekeepers-Sanctuary-810x489.jpg\" alt=\"sanctuary building\" width=\"810\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Tanzania-Beekeepers-Sanctuary-810x489.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Tanzania-Beekeepers-Sanctuary-800x483.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Tanzania-Beekeepers-Sanctuary-768x464.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Tanzania-Beekeepers-Sanctuary.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Tanzania Beekeepers Asali &#38; Nyuki Sanctuary is a beekeeping and honey extraction center with a strong emphasis on providing educational and vocational resources to the growing beekeeping community.

With offices along the north perimeter, limited exposures from two south-facing windows and a large expanse with western exposure, the challenge was to maximize the use of daylight while creating meeting spaces of relative privacy and acoustical control. The design employs a curvilinear glass form as the central organizing element and opaque display fixtures arranged perpendicular to the west-facing windows. The shape of the glass enclosure responds to both the program as well as the structural conditions of the building. The glass is imprinted with a gradient frit to create a subtle visual screening that affords visual privacy for seated guests while providing standing visitors sweeping views of the full showroom.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/KgtZ7BXCK88\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 14:00:39 +0000","feedId":39,"bgimg":"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Featured-Image-810x538.jpg","linkMd5":"dd7e088da51a4b2ddb11dcd33d1ac0e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn10@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-32-572_9e9021fdc267f2cc.webp","destWidth":810,"destHeight":538,"sourceBytes":39857,"destBytes":28122,"author":"Kelly Beall","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Featured-Image-810x538.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn10@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-32-572_9e9021fdc267f2cc.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Headshot-810x810.jpg":null,"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-WEB-DuBois-Mapping-Diagrams-810x794.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn93@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-34-554_9172505415d504d8.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gees-Bend-Quilts-810x745.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn40@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-34-762_986299a684f07416.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Urban-Farming-810x544.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn69@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-36-494_d910552e852475ae.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-1520-Sedgwick-Avenue-810x477.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn35@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-37-552_1bb867e2eca929cc.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Gordon-Parks-Segregation-Story-810x449.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn40@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-37-623_4ee18fd8ab9bf750.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Tanzania-Beekeepers-Sanctuary-810x489.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn70@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-36-232_bcf3e6b587551586.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Bike-Rack-810x1048.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-34-578_0f8cd9983df9dbe4.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/F5-Mark-Gardner-Marc-by-Marc-Jacobs-Showroom-810x540.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/KgtZ7BXCK88":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn54@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-37-006_89ec0eb62be7d629.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001554},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Frövi Launches Bamboo: A Modular Zoning System for Any Workspace","link":"https://design-milk.com/?p=434166","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/frovi-launches-bamboo-a-modular-zoning-system-for-any-workspace/bamboo-modular-shelving-frovi-1/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Bamboo-Modular-Shelving-Frovi-1-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"Frövi Launches Bamboo: A Modular Zoning System for Any Workspace\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Family-owned <a href=\"https://frovi.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Frövi</a>, known for blending a Scandinavian aesthetic with British craftsmanship, just launched the new Bamboo collection marking their commitment to sustainability. <a href=\"https://bamboo.frovi.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Bamboo by Frövi</a> is a modular zoning system designed to add both functionality and efficiency to any workspace. The system is crafted out of sustainable materials, like pressed bamboo, 100% recycled nylon (PA6), and a 70% recycled and 30% virgin PET blend of wool, making the line environmentally conscious.

Specifically, on the negative space surrounding physical objects. By acknowledging this emptiness, it becomes a design element just as important as the objects themselves. While positive shapes often are associated with strong, active, qualities, negative space is calm and peaceful and leaves room for interpretation. Our thesis was that the juxtaposition of these two relative spaces would bring something new and thought-provoking to a room,&#8221; says Cristiano Pigazzini, Note Design Studio.</p>\n<div

What these latest models offer that no other iPhone previously included is a magnetic mounting solution built into the phone for simplified secure attachment.
