In this most recent activity, the group likely used compromised GlassFish servers and Cobalt Strike in initial access operations before switching to the bespoke Winnti, ShadowPad, and Spyder backdoors for long-term access using dedicated actor-provisioned command and control infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2><b>Background</b></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2020, Recorded Future clients received a report on activity linked to a user of the shared custom backdoors Winnti and ShadowPad. This activity targeted a Hong Kong university and airport. The infrastructure and malware used in these intrusions directly overlap with previous reporting by </span><a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ESET</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NTT Group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Winnti Group activity. There are also numerous infrastructure and malware overlaps with activity recently reported by </span><a href=\"https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/backdoored-client-from-mongolian-ca-monpass/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avast</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which described an installer backdoored with Cobalt Strike found on the official website of MonPass, a major certification authority (CA) in Mongolia. Both the ShadowPad and Winnti backdoors are shared across multiple Chinese activity groups. Winnti in particular has been historically used by both APT41/Barium and APT17 and is </span><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">commonly</span></a> <a href=\"https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/apt17-is-run-by-the-jinan-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">associated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with activity linked to multiple groups of loosely connected private contractors operating on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS). In this case, Insikt Group tracks the cluster of activity described in this and our previous report using the temporary name Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22), while we note some historical overlap with activity clustered as APT41 and Barium by FireEye and Microsoft, respectively.</span></p> \n<h2><b>Victimology and Use of Compromised GlassFish Infrastructure</b></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insikt Group tracks known infrastructure and domains linked to TAG-22 using a combination of passive DNS data and adversary C2 detection techniques for ShadowPad, Winnti, and the Spyder Backdoor. In June 2021, we identified TAG-22 intrusions targeting the following organizations in Taiwan, Nepal, and the Philippines using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) data:</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nepal Telecom</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Department of Information and Communications Technology (The Philippines)</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, the targeting of the ITRI is notable due to its role as a technology research and development institution that has set up and incubated multiple Taiwanese technology firms. According to the ITRI’s </span><a href=\"https://www.itri.org.tw/english/ListStyle.aspx?DisplayStyle=20&amp;SiteID=1&amp;MmmID=617731521661672477\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the organization is particularly focused on research and development projects related to smart living, quality health, sustainable environment, and technology, many of which map to development priorities under China’s 14th 5-year plan, previously highlighted by Insikt Group as likely areas of future Chinese economic espionage efforts. In recent years, Chinese groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hackers-taiwan-semiconductor-industry-skeleton-key/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">targeted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> multiple organizations across Taiwan’s semiconductor industry to obtain source code, software development kits, and chip designs.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we believe these 4 organizations were likely the intended end targets of TAG-22 intrusion activity, we also identified several suspected compromised GlassFish Servers communicating with TAG-22 C2 infrastructure. This is in line with recent NTT </span><a href=\"https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reporting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which identified the group exploiting GlassFish Server software version 3.1.2 and below and using the compromised infrastructure to conduct onward intrusion activity, specifically scanning using the Acunetix scanner and deploying the Cobalt Strike offensive security tool (OST). Per NTT researchers, the group likely used this infrastructure in the early stages of intrusions before transitioning to dedicated infrastructure for controlling ShadowPad, Spyder, and Winnti implants. For its dedicated infrastructure, TAG-22 primarily used domains registered via Namecheap and Choopa (Vultr) virtual private servers (VPS) for hosting.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2><b>Nepal Telecom Tradecraft Case Study</b></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By querying the TAG-22 C2 domain vt.livehost[.]live in the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Platform, we identified links to the Shadowpad and Spyder backdoors that combine Recorded Future C2 detections and passive DNS data.</span></p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <img style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.recfut.com/?p=56860/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-1-1.png\" />\n </center>\n <center>\n  <b><i>Figure 1:</i></b>\n  <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Malicious Infrastructure Verdict for vt.livehost[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)</span></i>\n </center>\n <center></center>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allows us to pivot and identify the TAG-22 IP address 139.180.141[.]227, which we have detected being used by the group for both Shadowpad and Spyder command and control.</span></p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <img style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.recfut.com/?p=56860/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-2-1.png\" />\n </center>\n <center>\n  <b><i>Figure 2:</i></b>\n  <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Intelligence Card for TAG-22 C2 139.180.141[.]227 (Source: Recorded Future)</span></i>\n </center>\n <center></center>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <img style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-3-1.png\" />\n </center>\n <center>\n  <b><i>Figure 3:</i></b>\n  <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sample exfiltration event from Nepal Telecom to TAG-22 C2 Infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</span></i>\n </center>\n <center></center>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to identifying additional related malicious infrastructure, using Network Traffic Analysis Exfiltration Events, we were also able to pinpoint specific victims of TAG-22 activity.

While the victim IP address is assigned to Nepal Telecom, for telecommunication companies, this is often insufficient for attributing the true victim organization because the majority of infrastructure owned by those entities is leased or provided to its customers. In this case, we can use the new, proprietary VPN and Geographical Information extension alongside other enrichments to try to pinpoint the victim of this activity.</span></p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <img style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-4-1.png\" />\n </center>\n <center>\n  <b><i>Figure 4:</i></b>\n  <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> VPN and Geographical Information extension for Nepal Telecom IP 202.70.66[.]146 (Source: Recorded Future)</span></i>\n </center>\n <center></center>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By clicking on the Google Maps view within the VPN and Geographical Information extension for this IP address, we can pinpoint a location and confirm that Nepal Telecom is likely the victim of this activity — the location directly points to Nepal Telecom’s head office in Kathmandu.</span></p> \n<p>\n <center>\n  <img style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-5-1.png\" />\n </center>\n <center>\n  <b><i>Figure 5:</i></b>\n  <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> VPN and Geographical Information extension for Nepal Telecom IP 202.70.66[.]146 (Source: Recorded Future)</span></i>\n </center>\n <center></center>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><b>Malware Analysis</b></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through analyzing the identified TAG-22 operational infrastructure, we identified several Cobalt Strike samples likely used by the group to gain an initial foothold in the target environment.

TAG-22 uses shared custom backdoors likely unique to Chinese state-sponsored groups, including ShadowPad and Winnti, while also employing open-source or offensive security tools such as Cobalt Strike and Acunetix. TAG-22’s continued use of publicly reported infrastructure is indicative of a group experiencing a high degree of operational success despite a breadth of public reporting regarding its operations. Insikt Group has primarily identified TAG-22 operating within Asia. However, apart from this campaign, the group has a relatively broad targeting scope both geographically and by industry. This wider targeting scope, coupled with the use of the Winnti backdoor, is typical of several suspected MSS contractors, including </span><a href=\"https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/apt17-is-run-by-the-jinan-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">APT1</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">APT41</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p> \n<p><b>For a full list of indicators of compromise, please refer to </b><a href=\"https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research\"><b>Insikt Group’s Github repository</b></a><b>.</b></p> \n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan/\">Chinese State-Sponsored Activity Group TAG-22 Targets Nepal, the Philippines, and Taiwan Using Winnti and Other Tooling</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com\">Recorded Future</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:23:38 +0000","feedId":4651,"bgimg":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/insikt-group-logo-updated-3.png","linkMd5":"7a98c6ff3704356b2f4a8d35b6b4d79e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-53-39-193_f34cefcaf7a54777.webp","destWidth":2601,"destHeight":419,"sourceBytes":33273,"destBytes":42886,"author":"Insikt Group®","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/insikt-group-logo-updated-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-53-39-193_f34cefcaf7a54777.webp","https://www.recfut.com/?p=56860/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-1-1.png":null,"https://www.recfut.com/?p=56860/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-2-1.png":null,"https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-3-1.png":null,"https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-4-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn74@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-53-40-336_7400f28d4b7f801e.webp","https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-5-1.png":null,"https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-6-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-53-40-257_ea7dd5a8effa7581.webp","https://www.recordedfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan-7-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-53-40-337_e8e796decc2e5383.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626115530533}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:45:30","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:45:30","feedId":4651,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:45:30 +0000","fetchMs":45,"handleMs":9,"totalMs":611147,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"4cf9ab886509ef3fd2ece0a16b714d9c","hostName":"europe64*","requestId":"fb5d124e90ec4d5d9f767396ebb2fbba_4651","contentType":"application/rss+xml;
