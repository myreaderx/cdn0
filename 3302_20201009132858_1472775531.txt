Being prolific and publishing lots of posts and pages is a net positive for engaging and growing your audience, but it also means visitors may be more likely to find content that isn’t relevant to their interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Jetpack Search comes into the picture: It turns your website into a place where visitors can search, refine their results, and find the specific content and products that interest them.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built by the same team that created WordPress.com, Jetpack Search is a powerful search solution backed by Elasticsearch (an open source search platform), <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/traffic/site-stats/\">Jetpack Stats</a>, and our globally distributed data centers &#8212; the very same ones that keep your WordPress.com website up, running, and secure day in and day out. Jetpack Search uses<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2020/04/07/the-new-jetpack-search-architecture/\"> multiple technologies to build a modern search experience</a> that improves website engagement. You can now add Jetpack Search to your WordPress.com site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What makes Jetpack Search better than regular search?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A modern search experience combines great result rankings with a fast and intuitive user interface. Most WordPress themes can’t do this yet, because the default WordPress search function offers only basic options to show the most relevant content to viewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Search combines modern ranking algorithms with your traffic stats so that the best results will float to the top and engage your visitors. Our search algorithms work well with numerous languages and provide custom handling for 29 of the most widely used languages in the world. A large percentage of searches contain typos or spelling errors, but Jetpack Search instantly corrects the search query when there are no matches &#8212; so if a potential customer is looking for, say, <em>collectables</em>, they will still see the most popular <em>collectibles</em> you offer on your online store. Any changes you make to your site will be reflected in your search results within a few minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great algorithms are not enough, though. Jetpack Search displays results instantly, as your readers type into the search box. It does its magic equally well on both mobile devices and desktop computers, and in any theme &#8212; even those without widget areas. As the user refines their search terms or filters the results, Jetpack Search continues to update the results instantly. The user’s search terms will be highlighted in the results, which they will be able to narrow down further with displayed filters.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"43206\" data-permalink=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/jps-demo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif\" data-orig-size=\"1112,630\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"jps-demo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif?w=720\" src=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-43206\" /><figcaption><em>Instant search, spelling correction, and filtering on TwentyTwenty theme.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these benefits come together to provide a compelling and beautiful user experience that will encourage people to stay on your site longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Started with Jetpack Search</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to make Jetpack Search accessible for website owners of all stripes, from those who publish a personal blog to owners of thriving online stores. So we’re offering this new add-on at a price that takes into account how many searchable items &#8212; posts, pages, products, and custom post types &#8212; your site contains.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Record Limit</span></strong></th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Price Per Month</span></strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">100</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">1,000</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$10</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">10,000</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$25</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">100,000</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$60</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">1,000,000</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$200</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Over one million</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$200 per million</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All purchases are fully refundable for 30 days. Even better, when you add Jetpack Search to your site with an annual subscription, you get two months free &#8212; so you only pay for 10 months every year. When your purchase renews after a year, the price will automatically adjust based on the number of items in your search index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think you’ll love Jetpack Search — but more importantly,&#160;your site visitors will love it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the link below to purchase your Jetpack Search subscription. Once you buy it, Jetpack Search will automatically be enabled for your site. You can then customize the colors, filtering, and other details if you’d like — though the out-of-the-box settings work great, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/upgrade/search\"><strong>Get Jetpack Search</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2020/04/07/the-new-jetpack-search-architecture/\">Read about how we made Jetpack Search</a></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 02:06:00 +0000","feedId":3302,"bgimg":"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif","linkMd5":"45c7cec48f28aa9b4c3ce55427fe95e1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-27-58-800_16e001c4c0dbfe75.webp","destWidth":1112,"destHeight":630,"sourceBytes":1792347,"destBytes":2958304,"author":"Greg Ichneumon Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif?w=1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-28-55-579_ff8d4c23fc53afb9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602250060722}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:27:40","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:27:40","feedId":3302,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:27:40 +0000","fetchMs":511,"handleMs":15,"totalMs":77983,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"07219db1b3e400b7fa1500b956025226","hostName":"europe70*","requestId":"556ef0ee3485411393587bf374f0809c_3302","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":2775020,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx33":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:29:22","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:25:35","id":3302,"name":"The WordPress.com Blog","url":"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/feed/","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/e6392390e3bcfadff3671c5a5653d95b?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fbuttonw-com.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn55@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-25-35-813_ca512fa8db4bc41c.png","description":"The latest news on WordPress.com and the WordPress community.","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":2775020,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602250060183,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":524,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":15,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":19874,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":77442,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe-60.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]},"http://us-014.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1112,"destHeight":630,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn73@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-27-58-800_16e001c4c0dbfe75.webp","sourceBytes":1792347,"destBytes":2958304,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":3302,"totalSpendMs":19704,"convertSpendMs":17813,"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:27:40","host":"us-015*","referer":"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/?p=43201","linkMd5ListStr":"45c7cec48f28aa9b4c3ce55427fe95e1","githubUser":"myreaderx10","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.7 MB","destSize":"2.8 MB","compressRate":"165.1%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/jps-demo.gif?w=1024","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1024,"destHeight":580,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-28-55-579_ff8d4c23fc53afb9.webp","sourceBytes":1807765,"destBytes":2775020,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":3302,"totalSpendMs":15881,"convertSpendMs":13037,"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:28:42","host":"europe-60*","referer":"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/?p=43201","linkMd5ListStr":"45c7cec48f28aa9b4c3ce55427fe95e1","githubUser":"myreaderx33","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.7 MB","destSize":"2.6 MB","compressRate":"153.5%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx33":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
