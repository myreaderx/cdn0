This format was highly awaited as being an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1\">open, royalty-free, video coding format</a> developed by the Alliance for Open&nbsp;Media.</p> \n<p><span class=\"caps\">AVIF</span> is already supported on the web in Firefox (experimentally, you must enable <code>image.avif.enabled</code> in <code>about:config</code>), Chrome and Opera, which makes it a serious contender as a web image&nbsp;format.</p> \n<p>It is now supported by <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>, both for import and&nbsp;export.</p> \n<p>Not only this, but <span class=\"caps\">HEIF</span> files (both <span class=\"caps\">AVIF</span> and <span class=\"caps\">HEIC</span>) can now be imported and exported in high bit depth (10- and 12-bit per&nbsp;channel).</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/heif-avif-high-bit-depth.jpg\" alt=\"AVIF and high bit depth HEIF support\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <em><span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10.20 brings <span class=\"caps\">AVIF</span> support, as well high-bit depth support. It will also import <span class=\"caps\">NCLX</span> profiles and metadata.</em> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And finally, <span class=\"caps\">NCLX</span> color profiles and metadata will now be properly&nbsp;imported.</p> \n<p>These changes all happened thanks to the awesome contributions of Daniel&nbsp;Novomesky.</p> \n<h3 id=\"psp\"><span class=\"caps\">PSP</span><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#psp\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h3> \n<p>The plug-in for reading <span class=\"caps\">PSP</span> (Paint Shop Pro) files has received numerous bug fixes and improvements. Raster layers from <span class=\"caps\">PSP</span> images over version 6 are now supported, as well as 16-bit integer, grayscale, and indexed&nbsp;images.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, <span class=\"caps\">PSP</span> blend modes are now better converted to <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> layer modes for correct&nbsp;rendering.</p> \n<p>The importer is also much more robust and is even able to fix errors of some files which may have been wrongly exported by third party software. It also handles some edge cases like zero-length layer names&nbsp;better.</p> \n<p>All these improvements were made by Jacob Boerema, one of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> newest core&nbsp;contributors.</p> \n<h3 id=\"tiff\"><span class=\"caps\">TIFF</span><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#tiff\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h3> \n<p>Multi-layer <span class=\"caps\">TIFF</span> export got improved by allowing to crop layers to image bounds in the exported image. Indeed, <span class=\"caps\">TIFF</span> has no concept of global image bounds, only layer bounds. Hence cropping the layers is the only way to enforce the image&nbsp;bounds.</p> \n<p>Obviously, this cropping may or may not be what you wanted and perhaps you were expecting layers of various sizes. This is why the feature is available as a new optional <em>Crop layers to image bounds</em> checkbox in the export&nbsp;dialog.</p> \n<p>There have been other bug fixes and improvements in the <span class=\"caps\">TIFF</span> plug-in as&nbsp;well.</p> \n<h3 id=\"bmp-dds-jpeg-webp-xpm\"><span class=\"caps\">BMP</span>, <span class=\"caps\">DDS</span>, <span class=\"caps\">JPEG</span>, WebP, <span class=\"caps\">XPM</span>…<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#bmp-dds-jpeg-webp-xpm\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h3> \n<p>Other file format supports were improved. In&nbsp;particular:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><span class=\"caps\">BMP</span> always include color masks when exporting <span class=\"caps\">BMP</span> with color space info, as mandated by <span class=\"caps\">BITMAPV5HEADER</span>&nbsp;specification.</li> \n <li><span class=\"caps\">DDS</span> import is now a bit more permissive, allowing to load some files with invalid header flags regarding compression, while we are able to know the right compression from other flags. This allows to recover invalid <span class=\"caps\">DDS</span> files exported by other&nbsp;software.</li> \n <li><span class=\"caps\">JPEG</span> and WebP detection&nbsp;improved.</li> \n <li><span class=\"caps\">XPM</span> does not export a “None” (transparent) color when unused. Exporting an unused color was not a bug per-se but was not very well handled by some third party&nbsp;software.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"better-handling-of-exif-orientation-metadata\">Better handling of Exif “Orientation” metadata<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#better-handling-of-exif-orientation-metadata\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>In previous release, when an image with an “Orientation” tag was imported, <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> would propose to rotate the image or leave it as-is. If you denied rotation, the image would keep the tag and retain it upon exporting. So when you opened the edited image in other software, you’d get the rotation you didn’t ask&nbsp;for.</p> \n<p>The <em>new</em> policy is to remove the “Orientation” tag whether or not you accept the rotation. Hence what you see in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> is what you will see anywhere else after&nbsp;exporting.</p> \n<h2 id=\"sample-merged-in-the-gegl-operation-tool\"><span class=\"dquo\">“</span>Sample merged” in the <span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span> operation tool<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#sample-merged-in-the-gegl-operation-tool\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>When some filters have a color property, their dialog usually exposes a button allowing to pick a color directly on the canvas. Until now, it could only pick from the active layer (the one you were&nbsp;editing).</p> \n<p>All filters implemented as <span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span> operations now show a <em>Sample merged</em> checkbox in the <em>Tool Options</em> dockable (just below the <em>Sample average</em> option). This allows color picking visible colors when&nbsp;necessary.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/sample-merged-gegl-tool-options.jpg\" alt=\"Sample merged in GEGL operations\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <em>The new “Sample merged” options will allow to pick visible colors when relevant, for instance here with the “Colorize” operation.</em> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"spyrogimp-plug-in\">Spyrogimp plug-in<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#spyrogimp-plug-in\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>Spyrogimp, the official plug-in to draw spyrograph patterns, now works on grayscale images too and won’t clutter the undo history as much as it used&nbsp;to.</p> \n<h2 id=\"improved-indexed-conversion\">Improved indexed conversion<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#improved-indexed-conversion\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>This is actually a feature that arrived in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10.20, but we forgot to mention it in the previous release notes. So let’s describe the changes&nbsp;here.</p> \n<p>The conversion to an indexed image uses a median-cut algorithm to derive a suitable palette for the image. Such algorithm computes each index to be used as the average of colors in a 3D box in a color space, making the result value drift away from the&nbsp;extremes.</p> \n<p>This makes it nigh impossible to achieve pure white or black, even when the original image contained these colors, like in scans of printed documents or technical&nbsp;drawings.</p> \n<p>We now counteract the drift by snapping the whitest color to white and the blackest color to black if the resulting colors of median-cut are sufficiently close to white or black <em>and</em> if the original image already had some pure white or&nbsp;black.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/gimp-palette-conversion.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison of palette creation\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <em>Left is an original image in <span class=\"caps\">RGB</span>, converted to a 6-palette indexed image in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10.18 (center) and 2.10.20 or later (right).</em> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Note that the 2-color optimum palette case is special-cased not to use this modified algorithm as we already provide a dedicated “black and white (1-bit) palette” option which would do the same&nbsp;thing.</em></p> \n<h1 id=\"configuration-and-defaults\">Configuration and defaults<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#configuration-and-defaults\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h1> \n<h2 id=\"sample-merged-default-in-the-color-picker-tool\">Sample merged default in the Color Picker tool<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#sample-merged-default-in-the-color-picker-tool\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>After a small poll (which got 174 answers) on multiple social media platforms, <em>Sample merged</em> option is now enabled by default in the <em>Color Picker</em> tool. The idea is that it should now be less confusing to beginners because they will be able to pick what they see rather than the color in the active&nbsp;layer.</p> \n<p>Of course for advanced users, it doesn’t change a thing as they perfectly know how to toggle this option, both use cases being useful at different times. This change does not affect anything other than the defaults and does not modify how the feature&nbsp;works.</p> \n<h2 id=\"foreground-select-tools-default-engine\">Foreground Select tool’s default engine<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#foreground-select-tools-default-engine\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>We changed the default matting engine of the <em>Foreground Select</em> tool to <em>Matting Levin</em> as this engine performs better in most&nbsp;situations.</p> \n<h1 id=\"debugging\">Debugging<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#debugging\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h1> \n<p>The dashboard dockable now has a new option to record progressive performance logs that contain complete information after each recorded sample. This allows recording complete logs even in cases where they can’t be properly terminated, such as when <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> crashes or freezes in the middle of the&nbsp;log.</p> \n<p>Progressive logs are disabled by default, since they potentially increase the sampling cost. They can be enabled through a toggle in the log file dialog, or through <code>$GIMP_PERFORMANCE_LOG_PROGRESSIVE</code> environment&nbsp;variable.</p> \n<p>Moreover, verbose debug information (<code>gimp-2.10 -v</code> on command line, or debug output) now displays Flatpak related information when it’s relevant: the exact Flatpak build hash, the runtime version, the installed Flatpak extensions, permissions, etc. This helps debugging Flatpak&nbsp;builds.</p> \n<h2 id=\"opencl-now-considered-experimental\">OpenCL now considered experimental<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#opencl-now-considered-experimental\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>Since <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10.0, several <span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span> operations have OpenCL code paths, hopefully allowing faster processing. Unfortunately OpenCL situation is not so idyllic because of the lack of contributions to improve our code as well as faulty&nbsp;drivers.</p> \n<p>In various cases, enabling OpenCL in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> could lead to instability. We decided it was not acceptable anymore and moved the feature into the <em>Playground</em> tab of the <em>Preferences</em> dialog. Technically it means that the feature is hidden unless you run <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> with <code>--show-playground</code> command line option, so that anyone enabling this is really aware of the instability of the feature. Hopefully we will be able at some point to move this back into mainline <em>Preferences</em>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"playground-not-visible-by-default\">Playground not visible by default<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#playground-not-visible-by-default\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>The <code>Playground</code> page in the Preferences is not visible anymore, unless you run a development version of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>, or if you start a stable version with the <code>--show-playground</code> command line&nbsp;option.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless if you activated any of the unstable features from <code>Playground</code>, then the page will always be shown (making it easy to find the settings again if you need to disable&nbsp;it).</p> \n<h1 id=\"gimp-ecosystem\"><span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> ecosystem<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#gimp-ecosystem\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h1> \n<h2 id=\"plug-ins-and-manuals-in-flatpak-gimp\">Plug-ins and manuals in Flatpak <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#plug-ins-and-manuals-in-flatpak-gimp\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>Our official Flatpak now has an extension point for plug-ins. This means that anyone can now package third-party plug-ins as “Flatpak extensions” and contribute them to the Flathub repository. Thanks to the contributor Hubert Figuière, 7 very popular <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> plug-ins are already available to Flatpak users: <span class=\"caps\">BIMP</span>, FocusBlur, Fourier, G’<span class=\"caps\">MIC</span>, GimpLensfun, LiquidRescale, and&nbsp;Resynthesizer.</p> \n<p>The one-liner <span class=\"caps\">CLI</span> call to install them all at once is (if <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> is already installed as Flatpak, and the Flathub repository is&nbsp;configured):</p> \n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n <pre><span></span>flatpak install org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.Resynthesizer org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.LiquidRescale org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.Lensfun org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.GMic org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.Fourier org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.FocusBlur org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.BIMP\n</pre>\n</div> \n<p><em>Note</em>: Flathub does <em>not</em> yet provide a way to discover software extensions directly on its web catalog. The following <span class=\"caps\">CLI</span> call can be used to search for <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> plug-ins: <code>flatpak search org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin</code></p> \n<p>Moreover, the <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> manual will now be installed by default when installing our Flatpak, but not in all languages. To install the manuals in all available languages,&nbsp;run:</p> \n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n <pre><span></span>flatpak install --reinstall flathub org.gimp.GIMP.Manual\n</pre>\n</div> \n<p>Flathub statistics indicate that there are nearly 230K users of our Flatpak package (with about 100K users updating <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> within the first 2 weeks after a build update), which is pretty decent for a single package format on <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span>/Linux.</p> \n<h2 id=\"gegl-and-babl\"><span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span> and babl<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#gegl-and-babl\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>As usual, <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> release is accompanied by <a href=\"http://gegl.org/babl/\">babl</a> (0.1.78, 0.1.80 and 0.1.82) and <a href=\"http://gegl.org/\"><span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span></a> (0.4.24 and 0.4.26) releases, with various bug&nbsp;fixes.</p> \n<p>It is to be noted that, even though <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> <em>minimum</em> requirement is babl 0.1.78, we advise to build against the latest version if possible, i.e. babl 0.1.82. This last version handles more complex parametric TRCs for ICCv4, which means that without these changes, your color profile conversion may be wrong in case you use a profile with these&nbsp;parameters.</p> \n<h2 id=\"continuous-integration\">Continuous Integration<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#continuous-integration\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p><span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> <span class=\"caps\">CI</span> process now runs a <code>distcheck</code> step, hence producing a fully unit-tested source tarball without human&nbsp;interaction.</p> \n<p>Continuous builds of the development version (future <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 3) for Windows were already provided <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/02/24/gimp-2-10-18-released/#continuous-integration\">since <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10.18</a> but the downloadable archive was huge, containing many temporary files from the build process and a wrapper to necessarily run at first launch. We now implemented a new <span class=\"caps\">CI</span> job with a slimmed-down and hopefully usable build (if not please report, or better: send us patches!) and already fully set up with no first launch&nbsp;process.</p> \n<p>The idea came from the <a href=\"http://www.siril.org/\">Siril</a> project (astronomical image processing free software) after we helped them set up a cross-compilation <span class=\"caps\">CI</span>, similar to ours, using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/crossroad/\">crossroad</a>. A pretty good example of exchange between free software where some code goes from one project to another where it is improved, then back to the original one.&nbsp;🥳</p> \n<p>This will be very useful when asking people to test the development version as a lot of bugs are fixed on it (often just because the <span class=\"caps\">GTK2</span> toolkit is simply not maintained anymore whereas the development version using <span class=\"caps\">GTK3</span> fixes the problem by itself). The following dynamic links will always return you the last successful development&nbsp;builds:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>» <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=win64-nightly\">Last development build of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> for Windows 64-bit</a>&nbsp;«</li> \n <li>» <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=win32-nightly\">Last development build of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> for Windows 32-bit</a>&nbsp;«</li> \n</ul> \n<p><em><span class=\"caps\">NOTE</span> 1: test builds are for testing purpose only (as the name tells!). They have not been human-tested, it relies on regularly modified development code, and our automatic build process is still a bit young, which means there may even be bugs specific to the build. So please do not use it for&nbsp;production!</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"caps\">NOTE</span> 2: there are still a few known issues such as missing GObject Introspection, i.e. that the Python 3/Javascript/Lua/Vala plug-ins won’t work with this build&nbsp;(yet).</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"caps\">NOTE</span> 3: these builds are not provided with a fancy installer nor any desktop integration (i.e. no shortcuts in menus, etc.). Just unzip the archive, and double-click <code>gimp.cmd</code> or <code>gimp-2.99.exe</code> files.</em></p> \n<p>These changes are all part of a more global work in progress to improve development code testing as well as eventually automatize the release procedure to be faster, easier, and more&nbsp;trustworthy.</p> \n<h1 id=\"availability-of-macos-builds\">Availability of macOS builds<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/10/07/gimp-2-10-22-released/#availability-of-macos-builds\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h1> \n<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have good news for macOS users at this time.

The new way to make Python plug-ins is streamlined, following the same logics as for other supported languages (C/C++, Python 3, Lua, Vala and Javascript so&nbsp;far).</li> \n <li>Some Wayland bug hunting done (still more to&nbsp;go).</li> \n <li>GimpSpinScale styling improved and the new style is now unique (old non-compact style is not available anymore, unlike in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>&nbsp;2.10.x).</li> \n <li>Usability of the Input Devices editor has been&nbsp;improved.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The user interface is now available in two more languages in the development branch (first new languages since <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2018/08/19/gimp-2-10-6-released/#a-new-localization-marathi\">Marathi support was added back in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10.6</a>): Kabyle and Central Kurdish. Please note though that these two additional translations are not yet present in the <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.10 series. With these, <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> will be available in 83 languages. It is a very good opportunity to remind that translators are doing a tremendous&nbsp;job.</p> \n<p>Also with new file format support (<span class=\"caps\">AVIF</span>), various major file format improvements, new programming languages for plug-ins, our little Wilber is really getting very studious lately, learning many new&nbsp;things!</p> \n<p>Finally, please don’t forget you can <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/donating/\">donate to the project and personally fund several <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> developers</a>, as a way to give back and accelerate the development of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 22:00:00
