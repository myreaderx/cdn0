Image: Hillsborough County Sheriff&#8217;s Office.</p></div>\n<p>The incident occurred at a bond hearing held via the videoconferencing service <strong>Zoom</strong> by the Hillsborough County, Fla. criminal court in the case of <strong>Graham Clark</strong>. The 17-year-old from Tampa was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of social engineering his way into Twitter&#8217;s internal computer systems and tweeting out a bitcoin scam through the accounts of high-profile Twitter users.</p>\n<p>Notice of the hearing was available via public records filed with the Florida state attorney&#8217;s office. The notice specified the Zoom meeting time and ID number, essentially allowing anyone to participate in the proceeding.</p>\n<p>Even before the hearing officially began it was clear that the event would likely be &#8220;zoom bombed.&#8221; That&#8217;s because while participants were muted by default, they were free to unmute their microphones and transmit their own video streams to the channel.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, less than a minute had passed before one attendee not party to the case interrupted a discussion between Clark&#8217;s attorney and the judge by streaming a live video of himself adjusting his face mask. Just a few minutes later, someone began interjecting loud music.</p>\n<p>It became clear that presiding <strong>Judge Christopher C. Nash</strong> was personally in charge of administering the video hearing when, after roughly 15 seconds worth of random chatter interrupted the prosecution&#8217;s response, Nash told participants he was removing the troublemakers as quickly as he could.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52577\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52577\" class=\" wp-image-52577\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/judgenash.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"221\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/judgenash.png 800w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/judgenash-580x571.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/judgenash-768x756.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-52577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Judge Nash, visibly annoyed immediately after one of the many disruptions to today&#8217;s hearing.</p></div>\n<p>What transpired a minute later was almost inevitable given the permissive settings of this particular Zoom conference call: Someone streamed a graphic video clip from Pornhub for approximately 15 seconds before Judge Nash abruptly terminated the broadcast.</p>\n<p>With the ongoing pestilence that is the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation&#8217;s state and federal courts have largely been forced to conduct proceedings remotely via videoconferencing services. While Zoom and others do offer settings that can prevent participants from injecting their own audio and video into the stream unless invited to do so, those settings evidently were not enabled in today&#8217;s meeting.</p>\n<p>At issue before the court today was a defense motion to modify the amount of the defendant&#8217;s bond, which has been set at $750,000. The prosecution had argued that Clark should be required to show that any funds used toward securing that bond were gained lawfully, and were not merely the proceeds from his alleged participation in the Twitter bitcoin scam or some other form of cybercrime.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52580\" style=\"width: 238px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52580\" class=\" wp-image-52580\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 778w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-580x569.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x753.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-52580\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Florida State Attorney Andrew Warren&#8217;s reaction as a Pornhub clip began streaming to everyone in today&#8217;s Zoom proceeding.</p></div>\n<p>Mr. Clark&#8217;s attorneys disagreed, and spent most of the uninterrupted time in today&#8217;s hearing explaining why their client could safely be released under a much smaller bond and close supervision restrictions.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/technology/florida-teenager-twitter-hack.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published an in-depth look into Clark&#8217;s wayward path</a> from a small-time cheater and hustler in online games like Minecraft to big-boy schemes involving <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swapping&#38;x=0&#38;y=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SIM swapping</a>, a form of fraud that involves social engineering employees at mobile phone companies to gain control over a target&#8217;s phone number and any financial, email and social media accounts associated with that number.</p>\n<p>According to The Times, Clark was suspected of being involved in a 2019 SIM swapping incident which led to the theft of 164 bitcoins from <strong>Gregg Bennett</strong>, a tech investor in the Seattle area. That theft would have been worth around $856,000 at the time; these days 164 bitcoins is worth approximately $1.8 million.</p>\n<p>The Times said that soon after the theft, Bennett received an extortion note signed by Scrim, one of the hacker handles alleged to have been used by Clark. From that story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We just want the remainder of the funds in the Bittrex,&#8221; Scrim wrote, referring to the Bitcoin exchange from which the coins had been taken. &#8220;We are always one step ahead and this is your easiest option.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In April, the Secret Service seized 100 Bitcoins from Mr. Clark, according to government forfeiture documents. A few weeks later, Mr. Bennett received a letter from the Secret Service saying they had recovered 100 of his Bitcoins, citing the same code that was assigned to the coins seized from Mr. Clark.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Florida prosecutor Darrell Dirks was in the middle of explaining to the judge that investigators are still in the process of discovering the extent of Clark&#8217;s alleged illegal hacking activities since the Secret Service returned the 100 bitcoin when the porn clip was injected into the Zoom conference.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Judge Nash decided to keep the bond amount as is, but to remove the condition that Clark prove the source of the funds.</p>\n<p>Clark has been charged with 30 felony counts and is being tried as an adult. Federal prosecutors also have <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/three-charged-in-july-15-twitter-compromise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">charged two other young men suspected of playing roles in the Twitter hack</a>, including a 22-year-old from Orlando, Fla. and a 19-year-old from the United Kingdom.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 20:18:39 +0000","feedId":274,"bgimg":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gclark.png","linkMd5":"9c020384a8e53e800a36cdbbed266e16","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn94@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-34-33-371_6d2a6a4a1a8c8704.webp","destWidth":410,"destHeight":481,"author":"BrianKrebs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gclark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-34-33-424_6d2a6a4a1a8c8704.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/judgenash.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn97@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-34-33-678_ad03a76f33730c1a.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn57@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-34-33-408_025081c2d900abd9.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","title":"Hacked Data Broker Accounts Fueled Phony COVID Loans, Unemployment Claims","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=52594","description":"<p>A group of thieves thought to be responsible for collecting millions in fraudulent small business loans and unemployment insurance benefits from COVID-19 economic relief efforts gathered personal data on people and businesses they were impersonating by leveraging several compromised accounts at a little-known U.S. consumer data broker, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-52613\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covidfraud.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covidfraud.png 648w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covidfraud-580x328.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" /></p>\n<p>In June, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by a cybersecurity researcher who discovered that a group of scammers was sharing highly detailed personal and financial records on Americans via a free web-based email service that allows anyone who knows an account&#8217;s username to view all email sent to that account &#8212;

And in 2004, it emerged that identity thieves masquerading as customers of data broker <strong>Choicepoint</strong> had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/24/business/breach-points-up-flaws-in-privacy-laws.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stolen the personal and financial records of more than 145,000 Americans</a>.</p>\n<p>Those compromises were noteworthy because the consumer information warehoused by these data brokers can be used to find the answers to so-called knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions used by companies seeking to validate the financial history of people applying for new lines of credit.</p>\n<p>In that sense, thieves involved in ID theft may be better off targeting data brokers like IDI and their customers than the major credit bureaus, said <strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Computer Science Institute</a> and lecturer at <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This means you have access not only to the consumer&#8217;s SSN and other static information, but everything you need for knowledge-based authentication because these are the types of companies that are providing KBA data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The fraud group communications reviewed by this author suggest they are cashing out primarily through financial instruments like prepaid cards and a small number of online-only banks that allow consumers to establish accounts and move money just by providing a name and associated date of birth and SSN.</p>\n<p>While most of these instruments place daily or monthly limits on the amount of money users can deposit into and withdraw from the accounts, some of the more popular instruments for ID thieves appear to be those that allow spending, sending or withdrawal of between $5,000 to $7,000 per transaction, with high limits on the overall number or dollar value of transactions allowed in a given time period.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity is investigating the extent to which a small number of these financial instruments may be massively over-represented in the incidence of unemployment insurance benefit fraud at the state level, and in SBA loan fraud at the federal level. Anyone in the financial sector or state agencies with information about these apparent trends may confidentially contact this author at <strong>krebsonsecurity @ gmail dot com</strong>, or via the encrypted message service <strong>Wickr</strong> at &#8220;<strong>krebswickr</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>The looting of state unemployment insurance programs by identity thieves has been well documented of late, but far less public attention has centered on fraud targeting <strong>Economic Injury Disaster Loan</strong> (EIDL) and advance grant programs run by the U.S. Small Business Administration in response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\n<p>Late last month, the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/SBA_OIG_Report_20-16_508.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">released a scathing report</a> (PDF) saying it has been inundated with complaints from financial institutions reporting suspected fraudulent EIDL transactions, and that it has so far identified $250 million in loans given to &#8220;potentially ineligible recipients.&#8221; The OIG said many of the complaints were about credit inquiries for individuals who had never applied for an economic injury loan or grant.</p>\n<p>The figures released by the SBA OIG suggest the financial impact of the fraud may be severely under-reported at the moment. For example, the OIG said nearly 3,800 of the 5,000 complaints it received came from just six financial institutions (out of several thousand across the United States). One credit union reportedly told the U.S. Justice Department that 59 out of 60 SBA deposits it received appeared to be fraudulent.</p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52610\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig.png 963w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig-580x467.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig-940x756.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig-768x618.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /></a></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 19:56:59 +0000","feedId":274,"bgimg":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covidfraud.png","linkMd5":"842d371c528b9caadc36bf5df1fcda56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn26@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-34-33-365_ea2bc3b725ddf1e7.webp","destWidth":648,"destHeight":367,"author":"BrianKrebs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covidfraud.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn61@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-34-33-357_ea2bc3b725ddf1e7.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/idi.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn29@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-34-33-862_ce8fc56e618ff5c8.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/superget1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn2@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-34-33-869_c8750f9c8b152014.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ssndobhome.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn98@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-34-33-494_710091f25dd28c50.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sbaoig.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn34@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-34-33-588_8ac558306944afdc.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","title":"Why & Where You Should You Plant Your Flag","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=52197","description":"<p>Several stories here have highlighted the importance of creating accounts online tied to your various identity, financial and communications services before identity thieves do it for you.

But increasingly, adherents to this mantra are finding out the hard way that if you don’t plant your flag online, fraudsters and identity thieves may do it for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The crux of the problem is that while most types of customer accounts these days can be managed online, the process of tying one’s account number to a specific email address and/or mobile device typically involves supplying personal data that can easily be found or purchased online — such as Social Security numbers, birthdays and addresses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In short, although you may not be required to create online accounts to manage your affairs at your ISP, the U.S. Postal Service, the credit bureaus or the Social Security Administration, it&#8217;s a good idea to do so for several reasons.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the majority of the entities I&#8217;ll discuss here allow just one registrant per person/customer. Thus, even if you have no intention of using that account, establishing one will be far easier than trying to dislodge an impostor who gets there first using your identity data and an email address they control.</p>\n<p>Also, the cost of planting your flag is virtually nil apart from your investment of time. In contrast, failing to plant one&#8217;s flag can allow ne&#8217;er-do-wells to create a great deal of mischief for you, whether it be misdirecting your service or benefits elsewhere, or canceling them altogether.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into the list, a couple of important caveats. Adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) at these various providers (where available) and/or establishing a customer-specific personal identification number (PIN) also can help secure online access. For those who can’t be convinced to use a password manager, even writing down all of the account details and passwords on a slip of paper can be helpful, provided the document is secured in a safe place.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important place to enable MFA is with your email accounts. Armed with access to your inbox, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/the-value-of-a-hacked-email-account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thieves can then reset the password for any other service or account that is tied to that email address</a>.</p>\n<p>People who don’t take advantage of these added safeguards may find it far more difficult to regain access when their account gets hacked, because <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/turn-on-mfa-before-crooks-do-it-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increasingly thieves will enable multi-factor options and tie the account to a device they control</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly, guard the security of your mobile phone account as best you can (doing so <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/a-life-or-death-case-of-identity-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">might just save your life</a>). The passwords for countless online services can be reset merely by entering a one-time code sent via text message to the phone number on file for the customer&#8217;s account.</p>\n<p>And thanks to the increasing prevalence of a crime known as <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swapping&#38;x=0&#38;y=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SIM swapping</a>, thieves may be able to upend your personal and financial life simply by tricking someone at your mobile service provider into diverting your calls and texts to a device they control.</p>\n<p>Most mobile providers offer customers the option of placing a PIN or secret passphrase on their accounts to lessen the likelihood of such attacks succeeding, but these protections also usually fail when the attackers are social engineering some $12-an-hour employee at a mobile phone store.</p>\n<p>Your best option is to reduce your overall reliance on your phone number for added authentication at any online service. Many sites now offer MFA options that are app-based and not tied to your mobile service, and this is your best option for MFA wherever possible.<span id=\"more-52197\"></span></p>\n<h4>YOUR CREDIT FILES</h4>\n<p>First and foremost, all U.S. residents should ensure they have accounts set up online at the three major credit bureaus &#8212; <a href=\"https://my.equifax.com/consumer-registration/UCSC/#/personal-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Equifax</a>, <a href=\"https://usa.experian.com/registration/?offer=at_fcras100&#38;br=exp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Experian</a> and <a href=\"https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trans Union</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that the questions these bureaus will ask to verify your identity are not terribly difficult for thieves to answer or guess just by referencing public records and/or perhaps your postings on social media.</p>\n<p>You will need accounts at these bureaus if you wish to freeze your credit file. KrebsOnSecurity has for many years urged all readers to do just that, because freezing your file is the best way to prevent identity thieves from opening new lines of credit in your name. Parents and guardians also can now freeze the files of their dependents for free.</p>\n<p>For more on what a freeze entails and how to place or thaw one, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">please see this post</a>. Beyond the big three bureaus, <strong>Innovis</strong> is a distant fourth bureau that some entities use to check consumer creditworthiness. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">filing a freeze with Innovis</a> likewise is free and relatively painless.</p>\n<p>It’s also a good idea to notify a company called <strong>ChexSystems</strong> to keep an eye out for fraud committed in your name. Thousands of banks rely on ChexSystems to verify customers who are requesting new checking and savings accounts, and ChexSystems lets consumers place a security alert on their credit data to make it more difficult for ID thieves to fraudulently obtain checking and savings accounts. For more information on doing that with ChexSystems, see <a href=\"https://www.chexsystems.com/web/chexsystems/consumerdebit/page/securityfreeze/information/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziDRxdHA1Ngg183AP83QwcXX39LIJDfYwMvM30w1EV-HuEGAEVuPq4Gxt5G7oHmuhHkaQfTYGBOWX6gQrA-nEARwN9L1QL0NzvaggKAaMiX2ffdP2ogsSSDN3MvLR8_QhPIFmUCw4loBOiCBmCXwEolPD6ExQMhDxSkBsaGlHlkxbsmekIAE6xunk!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this link</a>.</p>\n<p>If you placed a freeze on your file at the major bureaus more than a few years ago but haven&#8217;t revisited the bureaus&#8217; sites lately, it might be wise to do that soon. Following its epic 2017 data breach, Equifax <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/myequifax-com-bypasses-credit-freeze-pin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reconfigured its systems to invalidate the freeze PINs</a> it previously relied upon to unfreeze a file, effectively allowing anyone to bypass that PIN if they can glean a few personal details about you. Experian&#8217;s site <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/experian-site-can-give-anyone-your-credit-freeze-pin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">also has undermined the security of the freeze PIN</a>.</p>\n<p>I mentioned planting your flag at the credit bureaus first because if you plan to freeze your credit files, it may be wise to do so <em>after you have planted your flag at all the other places listed in this story</em>. That&#8217;s because these other places may try to check your identity records at one or more of the bureaus, and having a freeze in place may interfere with that account creation.</p>\n<h4>YOUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</h4>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times people have proudly told me they don&#8217;t bank online, and prefer to manage all of their accounts the old fashioned way. I always respond that while this is totally okay, you still need to establish an online account for your financial providers because if you don&#8217;t someone may do it for you.</p>\n<p>This goes doubly for any retirement and pension plans you may have. It’s a good idea for people with older relatives to help those individuals set up and manage online identities for their various accounts — even if those relatives never intend to access any of the accounts online.</p>\n<p>This process is doubly important for parents and relatives who have just lost a spouse. When someone passes away, there’s often an obituary in the paper that offers a great deal of information about the deceased and any surviving family members, and identity thieves love to mine this information.</p>\n<h4>YOUR GOVERNMENT</h4>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re approaching retirement, middle-aged or just starting out in your career, you should <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">establish an account</a> online at the <strong>U.S. Social Security Administration</strong>. Maybe you don&#8217;t believe Social Security money will actually still be there when you retire, but chances are you&#8217;re nevertheless paying into the system now. Either way, the plant-your-flag rules still apply.</p>\n<p>Ditto for the <strong>Internal Revenue Service</strong>. A few years back, ID thieves who specialize in perpetrating tax refund fraud were <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/06/irs-re-enables-get-transcript-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">massively registering people at the IRS&#8217;s website to download key data from their prior years&#8217; tax transcripts</a>. While the IRS has improved its taxpayer validation and security measures since then, it&#8217;s a good idea to <a href=\"https://sa.www4.irs.gov/eauth/pub/login.jsp?Data=VGFyZ2V0TG9BPUY%253D&#38;TYPE=33554433&#38;REALMOID=06-00029c6a-0543-17b0-89b8-163b0acf40c7&#38;GUID=&#38;SMAUTHREASON=0&#38;METHOD=GET&#38;SMAGENTNAME=UOkC7yx4eMTO24FGxPfBRb5q3Mj3Xh3pyXfBEjYyHJ97nGCXu16wx5MzFHjfZmlG&#38;TARGET=-SM-https%3a%2f%2fsa%2ewww4%2eirs%2egov%2fola%2f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mark your territory here as well</a>.</p>\n<p>The same goes for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_motor_vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles</a> (DMV), which maintains an alarming amount of information about you whether you have an online account there or not. Because the DMV also is the place that typically issues state drivers licenses, you really don&#8217;t want to mess around with the possibility that someone could register as you, change your physical address on file, and obtain a new license in your name.</p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, you should create an account for your household at the U.S. Postal Service&#8217;s Web site. Having someone divert your mail or delay delivery of it for however long they like is not a fun experience.</p>\n<p>Also, the USPS has this nifty service called <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Informed Delivery</a>, which lets residents view scanned images of all incoming mail prior to delivery. In 2018, the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> warned that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/u-s-secret-service-warns-id-thieves-are-abusing-uspss-mail-scanning-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identity thieves have been abusing Informed Delivery</a> to let them know when residents are about to receive credit cards or notices of new lines of credit opened in their names. Do yourself a favor and <a href=\"https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create an Informed Delivery account</a> as well. Note that multiple occupants of the same street address can each have their own accounts.</p>\n<h4>YOUR HOME</h4>\n<p>Online accounts coupled with the strongest multi-factor authentication available also are important for any services that provide you with telephone, television and Internet access.</p>\n<p>Strange as it may sound, plenty of people who receive all of these services in a bundle from one ISP do not have accounts online to manage their service. This is dangerous because if thieves can establish an account on your behalf, they can then divert calls intended for you to their own phones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/plant-your-flag-mark-your-territory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">My original Plant Your Flag piece in 2018</a> told the story of an older Florida man who had pricey jewelry bought in his name after fraudsters created an online account at his ISP and diverted calls to his home phone number so they could intercept calls from his bank seeking to verify the transactions.</p>\n<p>If you own a home, chances are you also have an account at one or more local utility providers, such as power and water companies. If you don&#8217;t already have an account at these places, create one and secure access to it with a strong password and any other access controls available.</p>\n<p>These frequently monopolistic companies traditionally have poor to non-existent fraud controls, even though they effectively operate as mini credit bureaus. Bear in mind that possession of one or more of your utility bills is often sufficient documentation to establish proof of identity. As a result, such records are highly sought-after by identity thieves.</p>\n<p>Another common way that ID thieves establish new lines of credit is by opening a mobile phone account in a target&#8217;s name. A little-known entity that many mobile providers turn to for validating new mobile accounts is the National Consumer Telecommunications and Utilities Exchange, or <a href=\"http://www.nctue.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nctue.com</a>. Happily, the NCTUE allows consumers to place a freeze on their file by calling their 800-number, 1-866-349-5355.

This story is about the victims of a particularly aggressive business ID theft ring that&#8217;s spent years targeting small businesses across the country and is now pivoting toward using that access for pandemic assistance loans and unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51644\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/100mask.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"359\" /></p>\n<p>Most consumers are likely aware of the threat from identity theft, which occurs when crooks apply for new lines of credit in your name. But the same crime can be far more costly and damaging when thieves target small businesses. Unfortunately, far too many entrepreneurs are simply unaware of the threat or don&#8217;t know how to be watchful for it.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, with so many small enterprises going out of business or sitting dormant during the COVID-19 pandemic, organized fraud rings have an unusually rich pool of targets to choose from.</p>\n<p>Short Hills, N.J.-based <a href=\"https://www.dnb.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dun &#38; Bradstreet</a> [<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNB/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NYSE:DNB</a>] is a data analytics company that acts as a kind of de facto credit bureau for companies: When a business owner wants to open a new line of credit, creditors typically check with Dun &#38; Bradstreet to gauge the business&#8217;s history and trustworthiness.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Dun &#38; Bradstreet saw more than a 100 percent increase in business identity theft. For 2020, the company estimates <em>an overall 258 percent spike in the crime.</em> Dun &#38; Bradstreet said that so far this year it has received over 4,700 tips and leads where business identity theft or malfeasance are suspected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The ferocity of cyber criminals to take advantage of COVID-19 uncertainties by preying on small businesses is disturbing,&#8221; said <strong>Andrew LaMarca</strong>, who leads the global high-risk and fraud team at Dun &#38; Bradstreet.</p>\n<p>For the past several months, Milwaukee, Wisc. based cyber intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.holdsecurity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hold Security</a> has been monitoring the communications between and among a businesses ID theft gang apparently operating in Georgia and Florida but targeting businesses throughout the United States. That surveillance has helped to paint a detailed picture of how business ID thieves operate, as well as the tricks they use to gain credit in a company&#8217;s name.</p>\n<p>Hold Security founder <strong>Alex Holden</strong> said the group appears to target both active and dormant or inactive small businesses. The gang typically will start by looking up the business ownership records at the Secretary of State website that corresponds to the company&#8217;s state of incorporation. From there, they identify the officers and owners of the company, acquire their Social Security and Tax ID numbers from the dark web and other sources online.</p>\n<p>To prove ownership over the hijacked firms, they hire low-wage image editors online to help fabricate and/or modify a number of official documents tied to the business &#8212; including tax records and utility bills.</p>\n<p>The scammers frequently then file phony documents with the Secretary of State&#8217;s office in the name(s) of the business owners, but include a mailing address that they control. They also create email addresses and domain names that mimic the names of the owners and the company to make future credit applications appear more legitimate, and submit the listings to business search websites, such as yellowpages.com.</p>\n<p>For both dormant and existing businesses, the fraudsters attempt to create or modify the target company&#8217;s accounts at Dun &#38; Bradstreet. In some cases, the scammers create dashboard accounts in the business&#8217;s names at Dun &#38; Bradstreet&#8217;s credit builder portal; in others, the bad guys have actually hacked existing business accounts at DNB, requesting a new DUNS numbers for the business (a DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit identifier for businesses).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52445\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"591\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnb.png 1304w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnb-580x175.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnb-940x284.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnb-768x232.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, after the bogus profiles are approved by Dun &#38; Bradstreet, the gang waits a few weeks or months and then starts applying for new lines of credit in the target business&#8217;s name at stores like Home Depot, Office Depot and Staples. Then they go on a buying spree with the cards issued by those stores.</p>\n<p>Usually, the first indication a victim has that they&#8217;ve been targeted is when the debt collection companies start calling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are using mostly small companies that are still active businesses but currently not operating because of COVID-19,&#8221; Holden said. &#8220;With this gang, we see four or five people working together. The team leader manages the work between people. One person seems to be in charge of getting stolen cards from the dark web to pay for the reactivation of businesses through the secretary of state sites. Another team member works on revising the business documents and registering them on various sites. The others are busy looking for specific businesses they want to revive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Holden said the gang appears to find success in getting new lines of credit with about 20 percent of the businesses they target.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One&#8217;s personal credit is nothing compared to the ability of corporations to borrow money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s bad because while the credit system may be flawed for individuals, it&#8217;s an even worse situation on average when we&#8217;re talking about businesses.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Holden said over the past few months his firm has seen communications between the gang&#8217;s members indicating they have temporarily shifted more of their energy and resources to defrauding states and the federal government by filing unemployment insurance claims and apply for pandemic assistance loans with the Small Business Administration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It makes sense, because they&#8217;ve already got control over all these dormant businesses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So they&#8217;re now busy trying to get unemployment payments and SBA loans in the names of these companies and their employees.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>PHANTOM OFFICES</h4>\n<p>Hold Security shared data intercepted from the gang that listed the personal and financial details of dozens of companies targeted for ID theft, including Dun &#38; Bradstreet logins the crooks had created for the hijacked businesses. Dun &#38; Bradstreet declined to comment on the matter, other than to say it was working with federal and state authorities to alert affected businesses and state regulators.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52446\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/officeboxes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/officeboxes.jpg 1000w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/officeboxes-580x386.jpg 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/officeboxes-940x626.jpg 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/officeboxes-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /></p>\n<p>Among those targeted was <a href=\"https://www.escflorida.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Environmental Safety Consultants Inc.</a> (ESC), a 37-year-old environmental engineering firm based in Bradenton, Fla. ESC owner <strong>Scott Russell</strong> estimates his company was initially targeted nearly two years ago, and that he first became aware something wasn&#8217;t right when he recently began getting calls from Home Depot&#8217;s corporate offices inquiring about the company&#8217;s delinquent account.</p>\n<p>But Russell said he didn&#8217;t quite grasp the enormity of the situation until last year, when he was contacted by the manager of a virtual office space across town who told him about a suspiciously large number of deliveries at an office space that was rented out in his name.</p>\n<p>Russell had never rented that particular office. Rather, the thieves had done it for him, using his name and the name of his business. The office manager said the deliveries came virtually non-stop, even though there was apparently no business operating within the rented premises. And in each case, shortly after the shipments arrived someone would show up and cart them away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She said we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s you,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;Turns out, they had paid for a lease in my name with someone else&#8217;s credit card. She shared with me a copy of the lease, which included a fraudulent ID and even a vehicle insurance card for a Land Cruiser we got rid of like 15 years ago. The application listed our home address with me and some woman who was not my wife&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The crates and boxes being delivered to his erstwhile office space were mostly computers and other high-priced items ordered from 10 different Office Depot credit cards that also were not in his name.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The total value of the electronic equipment that was bought and delivered there was something like $75,000,&#8221; Russell said, noting that it took countless hours and phone calls with Office Depot to make it clear they would no longer accept shipments addressed to him or his company. &#8220;It was quite spine-tingling to see someone penned a lease in the name of my business and personal identity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even though the virtual office manager had the presence of mind to take photocopies of the driver&#8217;s licenses presented by the people arriving to pick up the fraudulent shipments, the local police seemed largely uninterested in pursuing the case, Russell said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went to the local county sheriff&#8217;s office and showed them all the documentation I had and the guy just yawned and said he&#8217;d get right on it,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;The place where the office space was rented was in another county, and the detective I spoke to there about it was interested, but he could never get anyone from my county to follow up.&#8221;<span id=\"more-51865\"></span></p>\n<h4>RECYCLING VICTIMS</h4>\n<p>Russell said he believes the fraudsters initially took out new lines of credit in his company&#8217;s name and then used those to defraud others in a similar way. One of those victims is another victim on the gang&#8217;s target list obtained by Hold Security &#8212; <strong>Mary McMahan</strong>, owner of <strong>Fan Experiences</strong>, an event management company in Winter Park, Fla.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-52447 alignright\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/recycling.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"249\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/recycling.png 625w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/recycling-580x562.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px\" /></p>\n<p>McMahan also had stolen goods from Office Depot and other stores purchased in her company&#8217;s name and delivered to the same office space rented in Russell&#8217;s name. McMahan said she and her businesses have suffered hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraud, and spent nearly as much in legal fees fending off collections firms and restoring her company&#8217;s credit.</p>\n<p>McMahan said she first began noticing trouble almost four years ago, when someone started taking out new credit cards in her company&#8217;s name. At the same time, her business was used to open a new lease on a virtual office space in Florida that also began receiving packages tied to other companies victimized by business ID theft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;About four years back, they hit my credit hard for a year, getting all these new lines of credit at Home Depot, Office Depot, Office Max, you name it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Then they came back again two years ago and hit it hard for another year. They even went to the [Florida Department of Motor Vehicles] to get a driver&#8217;s license in my name.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McMahan said the thieves somehow hacked her DNB account, and then began adding new officers and locations for her business listing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They changed the email and mailing address, and even went on Yelp and Google and did the same,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>McMahan said she&#8217;s since locked down her personal and business credit to the point where even she would have a tough time getting a new line of credit or mortgage if she tried.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way they can even utilize me anymore because there&#8217;s so many marks on my credit stating that it&#8217;s been stolen&#8221; she said. &#8220;These guys are relentless, and they recycle victims to defraud others until they figure out they can&#8217;t recycle them anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>SAY&#8230;THAT&#8217;S A NICE CREDIT PROFILE YOU GOT THERE&#8230;</h4>\n<p>McMahan says she, too, has filed multiple reports about the crimes with local police, but has so far seen little evidence that anyone is interested in following up on the matter. For now, she is paying Dun and Bradstreet more than a $100 a month to monitor her business credit profile.</p>\n<p>Dun &#38; Bradstreet does offer a free version of credit monitoring called <a href=\"https://businesscredit.dnb.com/product/credit-signal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Credit Signal</a> that lets business owners check their business credit scores and any inquiries made in the previous 14 days up to four times a year. However, those looking for more frequent checks or additional information about specific credit inquiries beyond 14 days are steered toward DNB&#8217;s subscription-based services.</p>\n<p><strong>Eva Velasquez</strong>, president of the <a href=\"https://www.idtheftcenter.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Identity Theft Resource Center</a>, a California-based nonprofit that assists ID theft victims, said she finds that troubling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we look at these institutions that are necessary for us to operate and function in society and they start to charge us a fee for a service to fix a problem they helped create through their infrastructure, that&#8217;s just unconscionable,&#8221; Velasquez said. &#8220;We need to take a hard look at the infrastructures that businesses are beholden to and make sure the risk minimization protections they&#8217;re entitled to are not fee-based &#8212; particularly if it&#8217;s a problem created by the very infrastructure of the system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Velasquez said it&#8217;s unfortunate that small business owners don&#8217;t have the same protections afforded to consumers. For example, only recently did the three major consumer reporting bureaus allow all U.S. residents to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">place a freeze on their credit files for free</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done a good job in educating the public that anyone can be victim of identity theft, and in compelling our infrastructure to provide robust consumer protection and risk minimization processes that are more uniform,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s still not good by any means, but it&#8217;s definitely better for consumers than it is for businesses. We currently put all the responsibility on the small business owner, and very little on the infrastructure and processes that should be designed to protect them but aren&#8217;t doing a great job, frankly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rather, the onus continues to be on the business owner to periodically check with DNB and state agencies to monitor for any signs of unauthorized changes. Worse still, too many private and public organizations still don&#8217;t do a good enough job protecting employee identification and tax ID numbers that are so often abused in business identity theft, Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can put alerts and other protections in place but the problem is you have to go on a department by department and case by case basis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The place to begin is your secretary of state&#8217;s office or wherever you file your documents to operate your business.</p>\n<p>For its part, Dun &#38; Bradstreet recently <a href=\"https://www.dnb.com/perspectives/small-business/prevent-business-fraud-during-covid19.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published a blog post</a> outlining recommendations for businesses to ward off identity thieves.

The TCPA prohibits contact with consumers &#8212; even via text messages &#8212; unless the company has &#8220;prior express consent&#8221; to contact the consumer.</p>\n<p>With statutory damages of $500 to $1,500 per call, the TCPA has prompted a flood of lawsuits over the years. From the telemarketer&#8217;s perspective, the TCPA can present something of a legal minefield in certain situations, such as when a phone number belonging to someone who&#8217;d previously given consent gets reassigned to another subscriber.</p>\n<p>Enter The Blacklist Alliance, which promises to help marketers avoid TCPA legal snares set by &#8220;professional plaintiffs and class action attorneys seeking to cash in on the TCPA.&#8221; According to the Blacklist, one of the &#8220;dirty tricks&#8221; used by TCPA &#8220;frequent filers&#8221; includes &#8220;phone flipping,&#8221; or registering multiple prepaid cell phone numbers to receive calls intended for the person to whom a number was previously registered.</p>\n<p>Lawyers representing TCPA claimants typically redact their clients&#8217; personal information from legal filings to protect them from retaliation and to keep their contact information private. The Blacklist Alliance researches TCPA cases to uncover the phone numbers of plaintiffs and sells this data in the form of list-scrubbing services to telemarketers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;TCPA predators operate like malware,&#8221; The Blacklist explains on its website. &#8220;Our Litigation Firewall isolates the infection and protects you from harm. Scrub against active plaintiffs, pre litigation complainers, active attorneys, attorney associates, and more. Use our robust API to seamlessly scrub these high-risk numbers from your outbound campaigns and inbound calls, or adjust your suppression settings to fit your individual requirements and appetite for risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Blacklist paying customers and for people represented by attorneys filing TCPA lawsuits, the Blacklist&#8217;s own Web site until late last week leaked reams of data to anyone with a Web browser. Thousands of documents, emails, spreadsheets, images and the names tied to countless mobile phone numbers all could be viewed or downloaded without authentication from the domain theblacklist.click.</p>\n<p>The directory also included all 388 Blacklist customer API keys, as well as each customer&#8217;s phone number, employer, username and password (scrambled with the relatively weak <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MD5 password hashing algorithm</a>).</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-52559\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robocall2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"249\" height=\"310\" />The leaked Blacklist customer database points to various companies you might expect to see using automated calling systems to generate business, including real estate and life insurance providers, credit repair companies and a long list of online advertising firms and individual digital marketing specialists.</p>\n<p>The very first account in the leaked Blacklist user database corresponds to its CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-heyman-971b5b24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seth Heyman</a>, an attorney in southern California. Mr. Heyman did not respond to multiple requests for comment, although The Blacklist stopped leaking its database not long after that contact request.</p>\n<p>Two other accounts marked as administrators were among the third and sixth registered users in the database; those correspond to two individuals at <strong>Riip Digital</strong>, a California-based email marketing concern that serves a <a href=\"http://sites.riip.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diverse range of clients</a> in the lead generation business, from <a href=\"http://sites.riip.com/sites/Debt_003/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt relief</a> and <a href=\"http://sites.riip.com/sites/TimeShare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">timeshare companies</a>, to <a href=\"http://sites.riip.com/sites/r2d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate firms</a> and <a href=\"http://sites.riip.com/sites/SuperCBD/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CBD vendors</a>.</p>\n<p>Riip Digital did not respond to requests for comment. But According to <strong>Spamhaus</strong>, an anti-spam group relied upon by many Internet service providers (ISPs) to block unsolicited junk email, the company has <a href=\"https://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/evidence/ROK10959/lead-research-group-riip-digital-inc.-throughput-inc./main-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a storied history</a> of so-called &#8220;snowshoe spamming,&#8221; which involves junk email purveyors who try to avoid spam filters and blacklists by spreading their spam-sending systems across a broad swath of domains and Internet addresses.<span id=\"more-52325\"></span></p>\n<p>The irony of this data leak is that marketers who constantly scrape the Web for consumer contact data may not realize the source of the information, and end up feeding it into automated systems that peddle dubious wares and services via automated phone calls and text messages. To the extent this data is used to generate sales leads that are then sold to others, such a leak could end up causing more legal problems for The Blacklist&#8217;s customers.</p>\n<p>The Blacklist and their clients talk a lot about technologies that they say separate automated telephonic communications from dime-a-dozen robocalls, such as software that delivers recorded statements that are manually selected by a live agent. But for your average person, this is likely a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p>Robocalls are permitted for political candidates, but beyond that if the recording is a sales message and you haven’t given your written permission to get calls from the company on the other end, the call is illegal. According to the <strong>Federal Trade Commission </strong>(FTC), companies are using auto-dialers to send out thousands of phone calls every minute for an incredibly low cost.</p>\n<p>In fiscal year 2019, the FTC received 3.78 million complaints about robocalls. Readers may be able to avoid some marketing calls by registering their mobile number with the <a href=\"http://www.donotcall.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Do Not Call registry</a>, but the list appears to do little to deter all automated calls &#8212; particularly scam calls that spoof their real number. If and when you do receive robocalls, consider <a href=\"http://complaints.donotcall.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reporting them to the FTC</a>.</p>\n<p>Some wireless providers now offer additional services and features to help block automated calls. For example, <strong>AT&#38;T</strong> offers wireless customers its free <a href=\"https://www.att.com/offers/call-protect.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Call Protect app</a>, which screens incoming calls and flags those that are likely spam calls. See <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/stop-unwanted-calls-texts-and-faxes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the FCC’s robocall resource page</a> for links to resources at your mobile provider. In addition, there are a number of third-party mobile apps designed to block spammy calls, such as <a href=\"https://www.nomorobo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nomorobo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.truecaller.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TrueCaller</a>.</p>\n<p>Obviously, not all telemarketing is spammy or scammy. I have friends and relatives who&#8217;ve worked at non-profits that rely a great deal on fundraising over the phone. Nevertheless, readers who are fed up with telemarketing calls may find some catharsis in the <a href=\"https://jollyrogertelephone.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jolly Roger Telephone Company</a>, which offers subscribers a choice of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/jollyrogertelephoneco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">automated bots</a> that keep telemarketers engaged for several minutes. The service lets subscribers choose which callers should get the bot treatment, and then records the result.</p>\n<p>For my part, the volume of automated calls hitting my mobile number got so bad that I recently enabled a setting on my smart phone to simply send to voicemail all calls from numbers that aren&#8217;t already in my contacts list. This may not be a solution for everyone, but since then I haven&#8217;t received a single spammy jingle.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 22:18:02 +0000","feedId":274,"bgimg":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robocalls.png","linkMd5":"c293b6dd4e7cf504c4e06d71ce2c5e6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn1@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-34-33-394_6c5ca8d1d1afe8fb.webp","destWidth":477,"destHeight":312,"author":"BrianKrebs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robocalls.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/16/10-34-33-531_6c5ca8d1d1afe8fb.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robocall2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn25@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-34-33-619_2d6f66ffa59fcb00.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","title":"Here’s Why Credit Card Fraud is Still a Thing","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=51973","description":"<p>Most of the civilized world years ago shifted to requiring computer chips in payment cards that make it far more expensive and difficult for thieves to clone and use them for fraud. One notable exception is the United States, which is still lurching toward this goal. Here&#8217;s a look at the havoc that lag has wrought, as seen through the purchasing patterns at one of the underground&#8217;s biggest stolen card shops that was hacked last year.</p>\n<p>In October 2019, someone hacked <strong>BriansClub</strong>, a popular stolen card bazaar that uses this author&#8217;s likeness and name in its marketing. Whoever compromised the shop siphoned data on millions of card accounts that were acquired over four years through various illicit means from legitimate, hacked businesses around the globe &#8212; but mostly from U.S. merchants. That database <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/10/briansclub-hack-rescues-26m-stolen-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was leaked to KrebsOnSecurity</a>, which in turn shared it with multiple sources that help fight payment card fraud.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49240\" style=\"width: 603px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49240\" class=\" wp-image-49240\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/briansdump.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"38\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An ad for BriansClub has been using my name and likeness for years to peddle millions of stolen credit cards.</p></div>\n<p>Among the recipients was <strong>Damon McCoy</strong>, an associate professor at <strong>New York University&#8217;s Tandon School of Engineering</strong> [full disclosure: NYU has been a longtime advertiser on this blog]. McCoy&#8217;s work in probing the credit card systems used by some of the world&#8217;s biggest purveyors of junk email greatly enriched the data that informed <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my 2014 book <em>Spam Nation</em></a>, and I wanted to make sure he and his colleagues had a crack at the BriansClub data as well.</p>\n<p>McCoy and fellow NYU researchers found BriansClub earned close to $104 million in gross revenue from 2015 to early 2019, and listed over 19 million unique card numbers for sale. Around 97% of the inventory was stolen magnetic stripe data, commonly used to produce counterfeit cards for in-person payments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What surprised me most was there are still a lot of people swiping their cards for transactions here,&#8221; McCoy said.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the major credit card associations instituted new rules that made it riskier and potentially more expensive for U.S. merchants to continue allowing customers to swipe the stripe instead of dip the chip. Complicating this transition was the fact that many card-issuing U.S. banks took years to replace their customer card stocks with chip-enabled cards, and countless retailers dragged their feet in updating their payment terminals to accept chip-based cards.</p>\n<p>Indeed, three years later the <strong>U.S. Federal Reserve</strong> <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/2019-payments-study-20191219.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated</a> (PDF) that 43.3 percent of in-person card payments were still being processed by reading the magnetic stripe instead of the chip. This might not have been such a big deal if payment terminals at many of those merchants weren&#8217;t also compromised with malicious software that copied the data when customers swiped their cards.</p>\n<p>Following the 2015 liability shift, more than 84 percent of the non-chip cards advertised by BriansClub were sold, versus just 35 percent of chip-based cards during the same time period.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All cards without a chip were in much higher demand,&#8221; McCoy said.</p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, McCoy and his fellow NYU researchers found BriansClub customers purchased only 40% of its overall inventory. But what they did buy supports the notion that crooks generally gravitate toward cards issued by financial institutions that are perceived as having fewer or more lax protections against fraud.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52471\" style=\"width: 261px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-issuers.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52471\" class=\"wp-image-52471\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-issuers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"406\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-52471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: NYU.</p></div>\n<p>While the top 10 largest card issuers in the United States accounted for nearly half of the accounts put up for sale at BriansClub, only 32 percent of those accounts were sold &#8212; and at a roughly half the median price of those issued by small- and medium-sized institutions.</p>\n<p>In contrast, more than half of the stolen cards issued by small and medium-sized institutions were purchased from the fraud shop. This was true even though by the end of 2018, 91 percent of cards for sale from medium-sized institutions were chip-based, and 89 percent from smaller banks and credit unions. Nearly all cards issued by the top ten largest U.S. card issuers (98 percent) were chip-enabled by that time.</p>\n<h4>REGION LOCK</h4>\n<p>The researchers found BriansClub customers strongly preferred cards issued by financial institutions in specific regions of the United States, specifically Colorado, Nevada, and South Carolina.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For whatever reason, those regions were perceived as having lower anti-fraud systems or those that were not as effective,&#8221; McCoy said.</p>\n<p>Cards compromised from merchants in South Carolina were in especially high demand, with fraudsters willing to spend twice as much on those cards per capita than any other state &#8212; roughly $1 per resident.</p>\n<p>That sales trend also was reflected in the support tickets filed by BriansClub customers, who frequently were informed that cards tied to the southeastern United States were less likely to be restricted for use outside of the region.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52481\" style=\"width: 607px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52481\" class=\"wp-image-52481\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"121\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending.png 1016w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending-580x118.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending-940x191.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending-768x156.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-52481\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: NYU.</p></div>\n<p>McCoy said the lack of region locking also made stolen cards issued by banks in China something of a hot commodity, even though these cards demanded much higher prices (often more than $100 per account): The NYU researchers found virtually all available Chinese cards were sold soon after they were put up for sale. Ditto for the relatively few corporate and business cards for sale.</p>\n<p>A lack of region locks may also have caused card thieves to gravitate toward buying up as many cards as they could from <strong>USAA</strong>, a savings bank that caters to active and former military service members and their immediate families. More than 83 percent of the available USAA cards were sold between 2015 and 2019, the researchers found.</p>\n<p>Although Visa cards made up more than half of accounts put up for sale (12.1 million), just 36 percent were sold. MasterCards were the second most-plentiful (3.72 million), and yet more than 54 percent of them sold.</p>\n<p><strong>American Express</strong> and <strong>Discover</strong>, which unlike Visa and MasterCard are so-called &#8220;closed loop&#8221; networks that do not rely on third-party financial institutions to issue cards and manage fraud on them, saw 28.8 percent and 33 percent of their stolen cards purchased, respectively.<span id=\"more-51973\"></span></p>\n<h4>PREPAIDS</h4>\n<p>Some people concerned about the scourge of debit and credit card fraud opt to purchase prepaid cards, which generally enjoy the same cardholder protections against fraudulent transactions. But the NYU team found compromised prepaid accounts were purchased at a far higher rate than regular debit and credit cards.</p>\n<p>Several factors may be at play here. For starters, relatively few prepaid cards for sale were chip-based. McCoy said there was some data to suggest many of these prepaids were issued to people collecting government benefits such as unemployment and food assistance. Specifically, the &#8220;service code&#8221; information associated with these prepaid cards indicated that many were restricted for use at places like liquor stores and casinos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was a pretty sad finding, because if you don&#8217;t have a bank this is probably how you get your wages,&#8221; McCoy said. &#8220;These cards were disproportionately targeted. The unfortunate and striking thing was the sheer demand and lack of [chip] support for prepaid cards. Also, these cards were likely more attractive to fraudsters because [the issuer&#8217;s] anti-fraud countermeasures weren&#8217;t up to par, possibly because they know less about their customers and their typical purchase history.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>PROFITS</h4>\n<p>The NYU researchers estimate BriansClub pulled in approximately $24 million in profit over four years. They calculated this number by taking the more than $100 million in total sales and subtracting commissions paid to card thieves who supplied the shop with fresh goods, as well as the price of cards that were refunded to buyers. BriansClub, like many other stolen card shops, offers refunds on certain purchases if the buyer can demonstrate the cards were no longer active at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p>On average, BriansClub paid suppliers commissions ranging from 50-60 percent of the total value of the cards sold. Card-not-present (CNP) accounts &#8212; or those stolen from online retailers and purchased by fraudsters principally for use in defrauding other online merchants &#8212; fetched a much steeper supplier commission of 80 percent, but mainly because these cards were in such high demand and low supply.</p>\n<p>The NYU team found card-not-present sales accounted for just 7 percent of all revenue, even though card thieves clearly now have much higher incentives to target online merchants.</p>\n<p>A story here last year observed that this exact supply and demand tug-of-war had <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/data-e-retail-hacks-more-lucrative-than-ever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helped to significantly increase prices for card-not-present accounts across multiple stolen credit card shops in the underground</a>. Not long ago, the price of CNP accounts was less than half that of card-present accounts. These days, those prices are roughly equivalent.</p>\n<p>One likely reason for that shift is the United States is the last of the G20 nations to fully transition to more secure chip-based payment cards. In every other country that long ago made the chip card transition, they saw the same dynamic: As they made it harder for thieves to counterfeit physical cards, the fraud didn&#8217;t go away but instead shifted to online merchants.</p>\n<p>The same progression is happening now in the United States, only the demand for stolen CNP data still far outstrips supply. Which might explain why <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/whos-in-your-online-shopping-cart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we&#8217;ve seen such a huge uptick over the past few years in e-commerce sites getting hacked</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone points to this displacement effect from card-present to card-not-present fraud,&#8221; McCoy said. &#8220;But if the supply isn&#8217;t there, there&#8217;s only so much room for that displacement to occur.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No doubt the epidemic of card fraud has benefited mightily from hacked retail chains &#8212; particularly restaurants &#8212; that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/covid-19-breach-bubble-waiting-to-pop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">still allow customers to swipe chip-based cards</a>. But as we&#8217;ll see in a post to be published tomorrow, new research suggests thieves are starting to deploy ingenious methods for converting card data from certain compromised chip-based transactions into physical counterfeit cards.</p>\n<p>A copy of the NYU research paper is <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nyu-cardshop.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available here</a> (PDF).</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 19:46:03 +0000","feedId":274,"bgimg":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/briansdump.gif","linkMd5":"3495ddcddeb25c33a511a385fd3adee3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn21@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-34-33-937_ec02c9865f2fd619.webp","destWidth":936,"destHeight":60,"author":"BrianKrebs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/briansdump.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn53@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-34-33-898_ec02c9865f2fd619.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-issuers.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-34-33-394_ec1334d9a6e8d6b1.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bc-us-supply-spending.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-34-33-634_9837274b54377c99.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","title":"Three Charged in July 15 Twitter Compromise","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=52521","description":"<p>Three individuals have been charged for their alleged roles in the July 15 hack on <strong>Twitter</strong>, an incident that resulted in Twitter profiles for some of the world&#8217;s most recognizable celebrities, executives and public figures sending out tweets advertising a bitcoin scam.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52296\" style=\"width: 563px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52296\" class=\"size-full wp-image-52296\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bezos-hack.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"683\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-52296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&#8217;s Twitter account on the afternoon of July 15.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Nima &#8220;Rolex&#8221; Fazeli</strong>, a 22-year-old from Orlando, Fla., was charged in a criminal complaint in Northern California with aiding and abetting intentional access to a protected computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Mason &#8220;Chaewon&#8221; Sheppard</strong>, a 19-year-old from Bognor Regis, U.K., also was charged in California with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and unauthorized access to a computer.</p>\n<p>A <strong>U.S. Justice Department</strong> <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">statement on the matter</a> does not name the third defendant charged in the case, saying juvenile proceedings in federal court are sealed to protect the identity of the youth.

According to that document, the juvenile and Chaewon had discussed turning themselves in to authorities after the Twitter hack became publicly known.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 21:43:11 +0000","feedId":274,"bgimg":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bezos-hack.png","linkMd5":"95fcc912010d9b41fe2f3b9c4aa701a4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-34-33-439_6fc80f996480e49c.webp","destWidth":553,"destHeight":683,"author":"BrianKrebs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bezos-hack.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn89@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-34-33-684_6fc80f996480e49c.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gclark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-34-33-424_6d2a6a4a1a8c8704.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn17@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-34-35-583_8d44597042d0f051.webp","https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/beyondkirk.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-34-33-452_fe06b747f9965d03.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:34:33","title":"Is Your Chip Card Secure?

Image: Wikipedia.</p></div>\n<p>Traditional payment cards encode cardholder account data in plain text on a magnetic stripe, which can be read and recorded by skimming devices or malicious software surreptitiously installed in payment terminals. That data can then be encoded onto anything else with a magnetic stripe and used to place fraudulent transactions.</p>\n<p>Newer, chip-based cards employ a technology known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV#:~:text=EMV%20is%20a%20payment%20method,companies%20which%20created%20the%20standard.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EMV</a> that encrypts the account data stored in the chip. The technology causes a unique encryption key &#8212; referred to as a token or &#8220;cryptogram&#8221; &#8212; to be generated each time the chip card interacts with a chip-capable payment terminal.</p>\n<p>Virtually all chip-based cards still have much of the same data that&#8217;s stored in the chip encoded on a magnetic stripe on the back of the card. This is largely for reasons of backward compatibility since many merchants &#8212; particularly those in the United States &#8212; <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/heres-why-credit-card-fraud-is-still-a-thing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">still have not fully implemented chip card readers</a>. This dual functionality also allows cardholders to swipe the stripe if for some reason the card&#8217;s chip or a merchant&#8217;s EMV-enabled terminal has malfunctioned.</p>\n<p>But there are important differences between the cardholder data stored on EMV chips versus magnetic stripes. One of those is a component in the chip known as an integrated circuit card verification value or “iCVV” for short — also known as a “dynamic CVV.”</p>\n<p>The iCVV differs from the card verification value (CVV) stored on the physical magnetic stripe, and protects against the copying of magnetic-stripe data from the chip and the use of that data to create counterfeit magnetic stripe cards. Both the iCVV and CVV values are unrelated to the three-digit security code that is visibly printed on the back of a card, which is used mainly for e-commerce transactions or for card verification over the phone.</p>\n<p>The appeal of the EMV approach is that even if a skimmer or malware manages to intercept the transaction information when a chip card is dipped, the data is only valid for that one transaction and should not allow thieves to conduct fraudulent payments with it going forward.</p>\n<p>However, for EMV&#8217;s security protections to work, the back-end systems deployed by card-issuing financial institutions are supposed to check that when a chip card is dipped into a chip reader, only the iCVV is presented; and conversely, that only the CVV is presented when the card is swiped. If somehow these do not align for a given transaction type, the financial institution is supposed to decline the transaction.</p>\n<p><em>The trouble is that not all financial institutions have properly set up their systems this way.</em> Unsurprisingly, thieves have known about this weakness for years. In 2017, I wrote about <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/atm-shimmers-target-chip-based-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the increasing prevalence of &#8220;shimmers,&#8221;</a> high-tech card skimming devices made to intercept data from chip card transactions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_37813\" style=\"width: 603px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-37813\" class=\" wp-image-37813\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ca-shim2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ca-shim2.png 969w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ca-shim2-580x415.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ca-shim2-768x549.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ca-shim2-940x672.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-37813\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A close-up of a shimmer found on a Canadian ATM.

Additionally, many of the merchant locations employed point-to-point encryption (P2PE) which encrypted the PAN data and further reduced the risk to the payment accounts processed as EMV® Chip.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Visa did not name the merchant in question, but something similar seems to have happened at <strong>Key Food Stores Co-Operative Inc.</strong>, a supermarket chain in the northeastern United States. Key Food initially disclosed a card breach in March 2020, but two weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.keyfood.com/store/keyFood/en/protectingourcustomers?state=NY&#38;city=Albertson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">updated its advisory</a> to clarify that EMV transaction data also was intercepted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The POS devices at the store locations involved were EMV enabled,&#8221; Key Food explained. &#8220;For EMV transactions at these locations, we believe only the card number and expiration date would have been found by the malware (but not the cardholder name or internal verification code).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/visaalert.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52508\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/visaalert.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/visaalert.png 674w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/visaalert-580x413.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" /></a></p>\n<p>While Key Food&#8217;s statement may be technically accurate, it glosses over the reality that the stolen EMV data could still be used by fraudsters to create magnetic stripe versions of EMV cards presented at the compromised store registers in cases where the card-issuing bank hadn&#8217;t implemented EMV correctly.<span id=\"more-52499\"></span></p>\n<p>Earlier today, fraud intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.geminiadvisory.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gemini Advisory</a> released <a href=\"https://geminiadvisory.io/cybercriminals-deploy-emv-bypass-cloning/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a> with more information on recent merchant compromises &#8212; including Key Food &#8212; in which EMV transaction data was stolen and ended up for sale in underground shops that cater to card thieves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The payment cards stolen during this breach were offered for sale in the dark web,&#8221; Gemini explained. &#8220;Shortly after discovering this breach, several financial institutions confirmed that the cards compromised in this breach were all processed as EMV and did not rely on the magstripe as a fallback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gemini says it has verified that another recent breach &#8212; at a liquor store in Georgia &#8212; also resulted in compromised EMV transaction data showing up for sale at dark web stores that sell stolen card data. As both Gemini and Visa have noted, in both cases proper iCVV verification from banks should render this intercepted EMV data useless to crooks.</p>\n<p>Gemini determined that due to the sheer number of stores affected, it&#8217;s extremely unlikely the thieves involved in these breaches intercepted the EMV data using physically installed EMV card shimmers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the extreme impracticality of this tactic, they likely used a different technique to remotely breach POS systems to collect enough EMV data to perform EMV-Bypass Cloning,&#8221; the company wrote.</p>\n<p><strong>Stas Alforov</strong>, Gemini&#8217;s director of research and development, said financial institutions that aren&#8217;t performing these checks risk losing the ability to notice when those cards are used for fraud.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because many banks that have issued chip-based cards may assume that as long as those cards are used for chip transactions, there is virtually no risk that the cards will be cloned and sold in the underground. Hence, when these institutions are looking for patterns in fraudulent transactions to determine which merchants might be compromised by POS malware, they may completely discount any chip-based payments and focus only on those merchants at which a customer has swiped their card.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The card networks are catching on to the fact that there&#8217;s a lot more EMV-based breaches happening right now,&#8221; Alforov said. &#8220;The larger card issuers like Chase or Bank of America are indeed checking [for a mismatch between the iCVV and CVV], and will kick back transactions that don&#8217;t match. But that is clearly not the case with some smaller institutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For better or worse, we don&#8217;t know which financial institutions have failed to properly implement the EMV standard. That&#8217;s why it always pays to keep a close eye on your monthly statements, and report any unauthorized transactions immediately. If your institution lets you receive transaction alerts via text message, this can be a near real-time way to keep an eye out for such activity.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu,
