Similarly to some previous\r\nmodels, it is based on the summation of fields scattered by discrete sub-resolution scatterers, and\r\nenables one to account for the axial and lateral inhomogeneity of the illuminating Gaussian beam.\r\nThe main feature ensuring the high computational efficiency of the described model is that, rather\r\nthan numerical integration of the scattered signal over the receiving aperture, we apply an\r\nanalytical description of both the illuminating-beam focusing and the collection of the scattered\r\nsignals over the receiving aperture. Elimination of numerical integration over the receiving\r\naperture increases the overall computation speed by a factor of ##IMG##\r\n[http://ej.iop.org/images/1612-202X/17/11/115604/lplabac16ieqn1.gif] {$^{}$} ∼ ##IMG## [http...]\r\n{${10^3}$}","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":20447,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4e5a33c51f9d134894abaa454ee8ce28","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Alexander L Matveyev, Lev A Matveev, Alexander A Moiseev, Alexander A Sovetsky, Grigory V Gelikonov and Vladimir Y Zaitsev","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602257645995}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:34:05","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 23:34:05","feedId":20447,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 15:34:05 +0000","fetchMs":28030,"handleMs":6,"totalMs":28038,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"a3e5dc3e5f8da356c063794fbf94e526","hostName":"us-040*","requestId":"615d5dee21bb4ffab5fe8cd4ca4974ee_20447","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:22:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:10:10","id":20447,"name":"Laser Physics Letters - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1612-202X/?rss=1","subscriber":162,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn9@2020_5/2020/09/06/20-10-09-521_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Laser Physics Letters","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602257617958,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":28031,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":6,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
