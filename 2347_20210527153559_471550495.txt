The University of Sheffield stands accused of sending its language students on dumbed-down courses to save money. Fewer pupils at British schools are taking foreign-language exams (a drop in French, the most popular choice, accounts for most of the decline). A hasty analysis might see this trend as a nationalist, populist, post-Brexit mindset at work. But it has been gathering for a long time, not just in Britain but in America, and not just in the Brexit and Trump eras, but well before them.</span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><br></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">The tragic attack on America of September 11th 2001 had one positive consequence. Many Americans realised how entangled their lives were with those of people around the world, and saw that they often did not understand their counterparts’ hopes and fears. Some patriotically applied to join the diplomatic and intelligence services; a few swotty types resolved to learn foreign languages. The number of students studying Arabic at university soared (albeit from a very low base). But the country’s attention has since wandered. The most recent research in America by the Modern Language Association found a drop of 9.2% in enrolment in university-level foreign-languages courses between 2013 and 2016.</span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><br></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">Much more than tub-thumping politics, the likely culprit for all this is the global rise of English. Converse with Europeans of different ages and a three-generation pattern emerges. If they speak English at all, the oldest do so with heavy accents and grammatical mistakes. Middle-aged folk, especially in places like Scandinavia or the Netherlands, have light accents and merely mangle the odd idiom. The youngsters often put their elders to shame. They speak with American accents that could have been plucked from “Friends”—except that they did not pick them up from anything so primitive as an old-fashioned television. Endless time on YouTube, or gaming live with others while trash-talking in English, has made that seem less a foreign language than one of their own.</span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><br></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">All this might understandably make youngsters in Anglophone countries wonder why they should bother learning French or Spanish at school. Why endure the arduous middle phase of learning a language—when you have some knowledge but no experience—if the awkward jumble that comes out of your mouth is liable to be met with a reply in flawless English? True fluency is valuable, as anyone who has sweated to achieve it will proudly attest. But that half-knowledge, the typical outcome of many courses, increasingly looks redundant.</span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><br></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">Yet there are several good reasons to persist with language-learning in schools and universities. First, anyone who plans to move to another country, or interacts with one regularly for work or otherwise, still benefits hugely from almost any familiarity with its language. There is no way to genuinely get to know a place without being able to chit-chat or watch a bit of its television. (Anglophones who doubt this should imagine understanding their country with zero knowledge of English.) Second, even if your contact with the culture in question is only occasional, your efforts to use its language will be much appreciated—at least by older residents, who might otherwise scowl at you for assuming everyone is happy to speak English.</span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><br></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">Foreign languages also have an intellectual value all their own—even if you never set foot in the relevant country. Latin and Greek were for centuries considered training for the mind; the same is true of immersion in any alien tongue. This is how many people acquire what formal knowledge of grammar they have. And the effort involved in talking in a foreign language makes you slow down and reflect on what you are saying and why. Researchers have even found that people make more rational decisions when speaking another language.</span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><br></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;text-align: left;line-height: 1.75em;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">Beyond the individual benefits, 21st-century economies still need people who can function fluently abroad. Just as universal maths education creates a big pool of potential engineers, widespread language teaching does the same for business executives, diplomats, soldiers and spies. Speaking another language is not just a courtesy to others. Much of the benefit still accrues to those who put in the work—and the societies that support them. Even as English continues to rise, Anglophone countries that slash budgets for foreign languages may find themselves lost for words. </span><span style=\"color: rgb(192, 0, 0);font-family: Cambria,
