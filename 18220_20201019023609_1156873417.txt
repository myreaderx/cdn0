Many creatives spend hundreds, if not thousands &#8211; to obtain licensed use to hardware and software as a means to create quality video that can stand on it&#8217;s own next to Hollywood-level productions. Fortunately, Purism, a company that respects your digital rights and privacy &#8211; has created a free software ecosystem to help restore ownership and control to the hands of the user. With PureOS, you can download KDenLive &#8211; an free software video editor &#8211; from the PureOS Store and create high-quality video using tools that rival more expensive editors like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-69440\" src=\"https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kdenlive-Splash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kdenlive-Splash.jpg 600w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kdenlive-Splash-300x151.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>The Librem Mini, a small but powerful desktop PC, is perfect for processor intensive tasks like video editing and rendering.
