Except, in <em>Felix the Reaper</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1503342078?mt=8\">($3.99)</a>, they are not <em>just</em> metaphors, they are also the basic premise of the game. Players will guide Felix, a new field Reaper in the Ministry of Death, as he orchestrates ever more elaborate deaths, intent on impressing his lady-love in the Ministry of Life, Betty. The catch? The two may never meet—Felix must remain in the shadows, while Betty dances in sunlit meadows.</p> \n<p><em>Felix the Reaper</em> is a 3D puzzler in the style of Sokoban. Promising shadowy puzzles, comedy blacker than a city sky at midnight, and a dancing reaper, there are a lot of places it could fall short. Unfortunately, fall short it does… where art, music, and animation are high points, the gameplay itself leaves much to be desired.</p> \n<p><a href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3854A0EB-921C-4453-BF7F-DF92FEDCBAB1.png\"><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270411\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270417\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3854A0EB-921C-4453-BF7F-DF92FEDCBAB1.png 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3854A0EB-921C-4453-BF7F-DF92FEDCBAB1-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3854A0EB-921C-4453-BF7F-DF92FEDCBAB1-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3854A0EB-921C-4453-BF7F-DF92FEDCBAB1-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></a></p> \n<p>Each chapter starts a little before a character’s timely death, and each level therein we guide Felix through shadows, moving barrels here, mirrors there, setting the stage <em>just so</em> for the star of the show to fall. Of course, it wouldn’t be a game, let alone a puzzle game, if all the shadows just aligned perfectly from the get-go. It’s a little more work than that, and frequently requires moving boxes, barrels, bundles of wheat, mirrors, and other miscellaneous items and beings to create a shadowy path to your destination. In addition to rearranging the environment, players also have a measure of control over the sun’s position, almost in a sort of time travel—although that can’t be entirely accurate, because time is explicitly frozen while Felix is around. Whatever the cause, the idea is interesting, and rather fun to play with. </p> \n<p>Although playing with shadows is an immediately interesting mechanic, all the steps and juggling positions and going back and forth and back… and forth again can get rather tedious, especially if you’re never entirely sure what to do (although this is somewhat alleviated by the “next step\" button in the menu). It’s not a big deal in the early chapters, but by chapter four… you’re really starting to feel the tedium sometimes, and that’s without going back to get three skulls, or playing the hardcore level variants. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270411\" alt=\"\" width=\"2355\" height=\"1056\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270425\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CB71D50D-DFB3-4E4F-BA51-0616FF835697.jpeg 2355w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CB71D50D-DFB3-4E4F-BA51-0616FF835697-300x135.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CB71D50D-DFB3-4E4F-BA51-0616FF835697-768x344.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CB71D50D-DFB3-4E4F-BA51-0616FF835697-1024x459.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Well, it’s a little much for me anyway, but for folks who find the basic puzzles a just right, or even a little easy, and who want a bit of a challenge? Well, you’re who the hardcore levels are for. These levels are slightly altered, have the additional objective of collecting coins, and new limitations—namely, players cannot rewind to the last milestone, or restart the level… and if you want to go back and do them later, you’ll have to replay the base level. And if <em>that</em> wasn’t enough of an extra challenge, there are also “super-achiever\", time trials accessible from the level menu for those who meet certain skull requirements. Altogether, there are more than enough levels, at a variety of difficulty levels (although none especially easy), for a great many people.</p> \n<p><a href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D173B282-D5C4-44E5-B351-62F1AB16815D.png\"><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270411\" alt=\"\" width=\"2688\" height=\"1242\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270423\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D173B282-D5C4-44E5-B351-62F1AB16815D.png 2688w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D173B282-D5C4-44E5-B351-62F1AB16815D-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D173B282-D5C4-44E5-B351-62F1AB16815D-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D173B282-D5C4-44E5-B351-62F1AB16815D-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></a></p> \n<p><em>Felix the Reaper</em> is a fun game, but that’s not really due to the gameplay. No, the gameplay itself is often just <em>there</em>, while the enjoyment is primarily due to our dancing protagonist and his tunes. Watching Felix slide from one point to another, dance in place, or bounce his way into the televator is <em>fun</em>, and one wonders what he is listening to. Fortunately, we know. Probably. It isn’t exactly a stretch to assume that the soundtrack we’re listening to is the very same music our lovable reaper is dancing to. If so, it’s not half bad. As background music, each of the thirteen tracks ever so subtly alters the mood from whimsical, to pensive, to melancholy, to upbeat and happy, and more besides, while always keeping to a certain lightheartedness. It’s almost a perfect fit. Almost.</p> \n<p>Why “almost\", you ask? Well, it’s a small, petty thing… but some of—well, actually, a great many of—the dancing animations don’t quite line up with the music. This is almost certainly because they are idle animations, and so difficult to line up perfectly, but… I’ve spent a bit of time watching them (it’s hard not to, when you’re trying to figure out where to put a particular puzzle piece goes), and it becomes glaringly obvious pretty quickly that they aren’t synced up to the music. A small thing, to be sure, but when your main character is supposed to be dancing to the music you’re listening to, it’s annoying to see them not actually in sync.</p> \n<p><a href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/182739F9-724D-4FAC-960B-8605D003CFFE.png\"><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270411\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270418\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/182739F9-724D-4FAC-960B-8605D003CFFE.png 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/182739F9-724D-4FAC-960B-8605D003CFFE-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/182739F9-724D-4FAC-960B-8605D003CFFE-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/182739F9-724D-4FAC-960B-8605D003CFFE-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></a></p> \n<p>Moving back to gameplay, remember how I said it was fun to play with the shadows? I stand by that. It is not fun, however, to constantly try to correct the camera angle. Nor is it fun to tap a square and not go there, or to try and drag an object to a square and either not have it register, or try to place the object on another nearby square. Each of these is annoying individually, but altogether, they’re really quite a pain. Add in the action and move limits, and the clock, and some of the later levels really start to not be very fun.</p> \n<p>That’s not all, though. Part of <em>Felix the Reaper’s</em> appeal is the ridiculously over the top ways each character dies. Deaths like accidentally spearing your brother because you mistook him for a deer; or a dog chasing an extra crispy tenderloin down a well, dragging the blind madman down with him. Haha, Oops. Maybe it’s the gory, close up shots of each death, or maybe it’s that each character is more sad than comedic… but I really don’t see the humour. Which is a shame, because I came in expecting to really enjoy these, and… I’m not.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dW-gAvk7tFs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Right from the start <em>Felix the Reaper</em> makes three promises: There will be dark comedy, there will be shadow puzzles, and there will be dancing skeletons. It delivers on all three. The humour is black, the puzzles are interesting, and Felix’s dance moves are excellent, if somewhat mistimed. This is clearly a labour of love, and that love shows through clearly. Unfortunately, it was not evenly distributed, and the rough patches make themselves known rather quickly. Nevertheless, I would encourage you, oh reader mine, to give it a shot.

In today’s article, we’ve got a full review of<em> Fairy Tail</em> courtesy of Mikhail, summaries of all of the new releases that hit the eShop today, a little bit of news, and a bunch of new sales to check out. It’s a big fella today, of that there is no question. Let’s get into it!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>The Amazing Anti-RPG ‘Moon’ Comes West on August 27th</strong></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FClNYk5Pbdw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>I don’t normally do news on Fridays, but I’ll make an exception this time. Regular readers know I love the works of Onion Games and Yoshiro Kimura. They just have a ridiculous amount of heart, for lack of a more scientific term. The latest game from Onion actually reaches back into the past, when Mr. Kimura worked with a number of other people on a game at the now-defunct Love-de-Lic. <em>Moon</em> was a very unique PlayStation game that questioned a lot of the things we just accept in RPGs, and in doing so served as an inspiration for titles no less famous than <em>Undertale</em>. But the game never officially came out in English. That’s about to change as the game will make its <em>extremely</em> long-awaited debut next month on August 27th.</p> \n<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Fairy Tail ($59.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270333\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD8BA236-081A-44B5-855D-F36394031432.jpeg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD8BA236-081A-44B5-855D-F36394031432-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD8BA236-081A-44B5-855D-F36394031432-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD8BA236-081A-44B5-855D-F36394031432-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Ever since Koei Tecmo acquired Gust a few years ago, it has been interesting to see how the studio’s output has both increased and changed. Gust went from releasing one game in about a year on one or two systems to multiple games in a year across consoles and PC under Koei Tecmo. While the <em>Atelier</em> games had some quality issues around the time <em>Atelier Firis</em> hit PlayStation systems and PC, Gust knocked it out of the park with <em>Atelier Ryza</em>. The studio’s first game after<em> Atelier Ryza</em> is a licensed game based on Hiro Mashima’s <em>Fairy Tail</em>.</p> \n<p>While most anime games are low quality arena brawlers (with games like <em>Kill la Kill IF</em> being the exception and being good), I always appreciate when developers try interesting things with source material. <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> is easily one of the best anime games out there alongside Sega’s <em>Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise</em>. Gust has taken its own strengths with the <em>Atelier</em> series and brought the world and characters of<em> Fairy Tail</em> together through it. <em>Fairy Tail</em> in a lot of ways feels like an <em>Atelier</em> game with additions and changes. This is a double edged sword because it results in a lot of fetch quests but is definitely a step above a generic arena fighter.</p> \n<p><em>Fairy Tail</em> assumes you are familiar with the source material as it starts out with a grand battle tutorial that showcases the “Tenrou Island\" arc of<em> Fairy Tail</em>. The remainder of the game covers the “Grand Magic Games\" and “Tartaros\" arcs with a bit of original storytelling thrown in. There is an in-game encyclopedia for lore and characters but it isn’t really a replacement for knowing things if you care about the characters.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270330\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7BFE9B50-B800-4A71-84C8-3B45267529D5.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7BFE9B50-B800-4A71-84C8-3B45267529D5-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7BFE9B50-B800-4A71-84C8-3B45267529D5-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7BFE9B50-B800-4A71-84C8-3B45267529D5-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>The characters all have their original anime voice actors which is always welcome for fans of the anime but it is disappointing that there is no English dub option available. It definitely looks like Gust games will never have an English dub again sadly.</p> \n<p>I mentioned that <em>Fairy Tail</em> feels like an <em>Atelier</em> game but with a <em>Fairy Tail</em> flavor. This is because the combat draws from <em>Fairy Tail</em> but the gathering, crafting (basic stuff), and progression feels a lot like an <em>Atelier</em> game. You control Natsu Dragneel initially and aim to grow your guild after it has been brought to the bottom of the ranks after the “Tenrou Island\" story. This involves you doing all sorts of basic quests like taking on enemies, helping people, and more. A lot of this gets repetitive in the few dozens of hours you will put into <em>Fairy Tail</em> so keep that in mind as you work towards leveling up parts of the guild and improving the rank.</p> \n<p>You get to control more characters and the game revolves mostly around the characters in the Fairy Tail guild. These characters are all hilarious and perfectly reflect how things are in the anime including the fan-service which there is a lot of in the game through costumes and animations.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270331\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C8E9251C-56CC-4526-B762-C4213C13CDAF.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C8E9251C-56CC-4526-B762-C4213C13CDAF-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C8E9251C-56CC-4526-B762-C4213C13CDAF-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C8E9251C-56CC-4526-B762-C4213C13CDAF-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Combat is turn-based with various combat options mapped to the face buttons. Each skill has a grid based area of effect as well. This adds another layer of strategy to the combat which varies in its difficulty curve as the game progresses. The skills look great in motion. The larger scale battles later on definitely amplify the spectacle on display with loads of enemies to deal with.</p> \n<p>You can also initiate a magic chain once your Fairy Gauge is filled. This fills up after you and your party members attack. In a magic chain, you press specific buttons to execute more actions to continue a chain before finishing things off with a final skill called the Finisher. The number of attacks you can chain depend on character ranks. Some of the skills that involve other characters though feel cheap with 2D portraits used instead of 3D character animations for the most part.</p> \n<p>With <em>Atelier Ryza</em>, Gust finally delivered a new release that actually looked and ran great on Nintendo Switch. <em>Fairy Tail</em> sadly isn’t great on Nintendo Switch. I’ve been playing it on PS4 and Nintendo Switch across both docked and handheld modes. The performance is erratic in both modes on Nintendo Switch while it is mostly smooth on PS4. Visually, the game isn’t a looker anyway with low resolution textures all over certain areas, but it is nice to see how the game scales on Nintendo Switch without many issues for visuals. While recent Gust releases have been good on Switch, <em>Fairy Tail</em> is a few steps back technically.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270332\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2060CACF-F07F-49D3-A654-337AE4320AC2.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2060CACF-F07F-49D3-A654-337AE4320AC2-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2060CACF-F07F-49D3-A654-337AE4320AC2-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2060CACF-F07F-49D3-A654-337AE4320AC2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Overall, <em>Fairy Tail</em> is a competent JRPG and one of the better licensed anime games in recent years. While it doesn’t hold a candle to Gust’s better games like<em> Atelier Ryza, Atelier Sophie</em>, and even <em>Blue Reflection</em>, it is well worth your time if you’re a fan of the anime or Gust games. The original soundtrack also feels like a good fit compared to the anime music that sadly is absent here. Hopefully patches can improve the performance on Nintendo Switch because it isn’t great in its current state.<em> -Mikhail Madnani</em></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 3.5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Fairy Tail ($59.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270380\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fairytail.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fairytail-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fairytail-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fairytail-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Well, you’ve probably read Mikhail’s thoughts on this game since they’re, you know, right above this paragraph. But for those who may have skipped down here for whatever reason, this is a JRPG developed by Gust of <em>Atelier Ryza</em> fame based on the popular anime and manga series <em>Fairy Tail</em>. It’s a good game with some performance issues on the Switch that may bother some. If you’ll allow me to add my perspective, as someone who has very little familiarity with <em>Fairy Tail</em> but a great interest in JRPGs: the story is kind of hard to follow and it feels like it’s assuming the player will already be familiar with a lot of the details of the series. The mechanics are solid, though, and I think if you’re willing to forgive the technical problems and don’t mind looking up some plot stuff on the Internet to fill in gaps, it’s a solid enough RPG to hold you over for a bit.</p> \n<h3><strong>Dodo Peak ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270381\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodopeak.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodopeak-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodopeak-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodopeak-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>The latest game to make its way from Apple Arcade to the Switch is <em>Dodo Peak</em>. It reminds me a little bit of the SEGA classic <em>Flicky</em> in that the goal is to gather up all your babies and take them to the exit. This one is played from an isometric viewpoint instead of a side-view, though. Compared to some games that make the transition from Apple Arcade, <em>Dodo Peak</em> is charging a very reasonable price, and the physical controls make a meaningful difference to the gameplay. Nothing to go running down the street shouting about, but if you enjoy pick-up-and-play arcade-style games, this is a solid choice at a fair price.</p> \n<h3><strong>Paint Your Pet ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270382\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paintyourpet.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paintyourpet-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paintyourpet-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paintyourpet-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>It’s a coloring book. With animals. Not all of them would make good pets, mind you. I don’t think you should keep a lion as a pet. Simply not safe. But you could color one and pretend it’s your pet. You don’t even have to color it in normal lion colors. You can color it green and call it a Martian lion. The sky is the limit here, as long as you consider the sky to be just a bunch of pre-drawn art and a small set of colors to fill them in with. Perhaps amusing enough for young ones, but wouldn’t you rather just give them a normal coloring book? Probably not that far apart in price, and they can go wild in ways this title won’t allow.</p> \n<h3><strong>Naught ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270383\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naught.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naught-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naught-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naught-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Limbo</em>, is that you? Longtime readers with sharp memories may remember <em>Naught</em>, which first debuted on iOS and Android several years ago and even had a re-release on iOS five years ago as <em>Naught Reawakening</em>. Well, this is more or less that game, except it costs five times as much and it won’t disappear from your purchase history anytime soon. It’s a platformer built around the idea of manipulating the environment around your character, and it is decent. It was definitely worth a few bucks back in the day for fans of platformers. In 2020, for twenty dollars, on a platform packed with outstanding platformers at the same price or lower? <em>Ehhh</em>.</p> \n<h3><strong>Nicole ($18.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270384\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nicole.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nicole-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nicole-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nicole-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>A lot of games that call themselves dating sims are really just simple choice-based narrative games with a few forks in the road, but <em>Nicole</em> seems like the real deal. Which is to say, you have to choose how to use your time in order to effectively improve your stats, gain favor with the boy of your choice, and make enough money to make it all happen. But if all of that sim stuff isn’t doing it for you, you can always switch to visual novel mode where you’re just reading. There are a bunch of familiar elements here, including four different boys who fit into the usual archetypes, a main plot that really ends up being more of a side plot, and multiple endings. It’s okay, but not much more than that. Still, it’s novel enough to have something like this on consoles in English that you may want to bite anyway.</p> \n<h3><strong>The Executioner ($9.90)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270385\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theexecutioner.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theexecutioner-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theexecutioner-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theexecutioner-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Nine-ninety, hunh? Well, you’ll be a fun one to include in the sales lists in the future. This game has nothing to do with Mack Bolan and is instead a sort of sim/narrative adventure game that puts you in the shoes of an executioner. You torture and kill people for a living, and somehow try to keep sane while doing it. An interesting idea, but cumbersome writing takes it down a notch. The game is also fairly short, and while that’s not a sin all on its own, the lack of a satisfying close to the story certainly dampens the whole affair. I feel like this game is only a few steps away from being something special and there’s certainly treasure to be found here for the forgiving, but it’s a tough game to recommend wholeheartedly in its current state. It probably goes without saying, but the subject matter here is really dark, so if you don’t like that kind of thing? You were warned.</p> \n<h3><strong>FootGoal! Tiki Taka ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270386\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/footgoaltikitaka.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/footgoaltikitaka-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/footgoaltikitaka-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/footgoaltikitaka-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This game’s title sounds like what someone who wanted to mock soccer would call the sport. Enjoying the <em>FOOTGOAL</em> game, everyone? Anyway, you might think this is another soccer game, or perhaps you wouldn’t. The screenshot is right there, after all. So yeah, this is a foosball game. There’s local multiplayer support for two players, and a few different modes to dip into. Though when it says “different modes\", it means Quick Play, a World Cup mode, and the aforementioned multiplayer. So… not <em>that</em> many, really. But for five dollars I could see this being amusing enough in the right context. And unlike a real foosball table, you don’t have to figure out where to store it when you get bored with it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Tiny Racer ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270387\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tinyracer.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tinyracer-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tinyracer-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tinyracer-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>There are lots of racing games on the Switch, and this is certainly one of them. The appealing concept of racing small toy cars and other vehicles around full-scale environments is squandered thanks to lousy physics, poor collision detection, and irritating progression. There are 15 different tracks, 8 different vehicles, 3 difficulty levels, 3 game modes, and 2-player support via local multiplayer. But what you won’t find here is a game worth spending a tenspot on. At least in my opinion, anyway. You’re free to make your <em>own</em> choices; Chu-Chu died for your sins after all.</p> \n<h3><strong>Lost Wing ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270388\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lostwing.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lostwing-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lostwing-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lostwing-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This high-speed action game is apparently inspired by games like <em>Zaxxon</em>, but in practice its camera view and higher speed make for something quite different. Blast and zoom your way through three different worlds, avoiding obstacles, battling enemies, and taking down the bosses. There are multiple play modes, along with a variety of ships and weapons to enjoy. It’s a very straightforward game in most respects, but it’s also quite challenging. It knows what it wants to do and it does it with style. For the price, I think it’s a fair proposition.</p> \n<h3><strong>Family Mysteries: Poisonous Promises ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270389\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/familymysteriespoisonouspromises.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/familymysteriespoisonouspromises-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/familymysteriespoisonouspromises-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/familymysteriespoisonouspromises-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>We’ve seen a fair number of hidden object adventure games on the Switch recently, but it’s been a little bit since the last one from Artifex Mundi. Well, here we go with <em>Family Mysteries: Poisonous Promises</em>, an adventure game that adopts a police drama-style setting. You’re a detective who has to help their partner, Duke, solve a particularly vexing murder case. Hint: it involves poison. Just when you think you’ve wrapped up the case, you realize it’s only just begun. Like most games from Artifex Mundi, <em>Family Mysteries: Poisonous Promises</em> mixes a somewhat engaging pulpy story with some mild puzzle-solving to create a concoction that many find pleasing.</p> \n<h3><strong>Dininho Adventures ($1.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270390\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dininhoadventures.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dininhoadventures-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dininhoadventures-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dininhoadventures-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>In contrast to its well-made, highly affordable puzzle and shooter games, QUByte’s platformers haven’t fared very well. <em>Dininho Adventures</em> is the latest, and I’ll at least say that it has a better sense of style to it than the last effort from this publisher. You’ll travel through four different worlds, delivering eggs to their nest. There’s apparently an additional world you can unlock if you explore well. A timer counts how long you to take, a helpful option for those who like to do speedruns. Your best times for each stage can be compared with those of your friends, though I’m not sure what means the game uses to do that. Well, it’s only a couple of dollars.</p> \n<h3><strong>Time Tenshi ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270391\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270379\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/timetenshi.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/timetenshi-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/timetenshi-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/timetenshi-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This one is a visual novel about a team of time traveling ladies that you’ll be accompanying on their adventures. The main character is a young man named Kenji who has lost everything in a house fire. Things seem fine at first, but the baddies get their hands on a time travel device and timeline shenanigans begin! Help save the present and future, and perhaps develop a romance along the way. This is a reimagining of the original <em>Time Tenshi</em>‘s story, with an expanded storyline, improved artwork, and more. The series has its fans on PC, and I imagine it will find a following on the Switch as well.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Well, it’s not the Friday deluge we sometimes see. But there are plenty of new sales to check out anyway, from titles like <em>Slime-San</em> that rarely go on sale to regular faces like <em>Chasm</em>. Perhaps more pressing is the weekend outbox, however. The Square Enix sale ends on Sunday, so it’s time to make some hard choices about how far you can stretch your wallet. The latest Activision sale is also coming to a close, but those will likely be back around before too long.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full
