Let's take a look at Adobe Photoshop and some key aspects you need to know to customize your creative certificate design.</p><p>We'll use this <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\">modern certificate template</a> in this demonstration. You can download it now on Envato Elements. It also includes an Illustrator AI file and EPS file, if you prefer those formats. </p><p>Or you can work with a different creative certificate design template. The skills are transferrable. </p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"modern certificate design\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2092/posts/36002/image/modern-certificate-design_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\">creative certificate design template</a> is available for download now on Envato Elements.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's get started:</p><h3>1. The Layers Panel Is Essential</h3><p>When working in Adobe Photoshop, especially when your modern certificate template is a PSD file, your <strong>Layers</strong> panel is essential. This is where we can see the layered pieces of the design. In this panel, we can hide, remove, add, and adjust content more easily.</p><p>If you don't see the <strong>Layers</strong> panel, go to <strong>Window &gt; Layers </strong>to open it up.</p><p>Notice how we see a list of content here.<strong> </strong>Click on the <strong>eye </strong>icon to toggle visibility on and off for any part of the layered design.</p><p>In this example, the layers have been organized in folders. Click on the triangle beside the folder to expand them, so you can see the contents inside.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photoshop Layers\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2092/posts/36002/image/modern-certificate-design_2.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>2. Edit Text With the Type Tool</h3><p>Now that we know how to review our contents, let's turn to the<strong> Type </strong>tool. It's located in your <strong>Tools</strong> panel, and it looks like a letter \"T\". </p><p>Select the<strong> Type</strong> tool. Then, click on any existing text in your layout to edit it. Once the text is active, type and edit as you would in standard word processing software.</p><p>To add new text (rather than editing existing text in your creative certificate template), click in a space without text with the <strong>Type </strong>tool selected. Or create a <strong>New Layer</strong> in your <strong>Layers</strong> panel (click on the plus sign at the bottom of the <strong>Layers</strong> panel). Then click with the <strong>Type </strong>tool. Choose the method that's easiest for you.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Edit Text in Photoshop\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2092/posts/36002/image/modern-certificate-design_3.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>3. Move and Adjust Your Layout</h3><p>Let's say you want to move an entire part of your modern certificate design. Again, this is why the <strong>Layers</strong> panel is so important. Here, we can more easily select one specific part of our design.</p><p>In this example, we can open up the folder labeled <strong>Content</strong> in our<strong> Layers</strong> panel. Then, with the <strong>Move</strong> tool active, we can select any layer here and move it in our layout. Simply select the appropriate layer and then click and drag to rearrange these design elements.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Move Tool in Photoshop\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2092/posts/36002/image/modern-certificate-design_4.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>4. Easily Change Colors</h3><p>What if want to change some of the colors here? There are several different ways this could be achieved in Adobe Photoshop. Here's an easy one. You can try to change colors in a snap when working with shapes.</p><p>In this example, we'll look in our layer folder labeled <strong>Shapes</strong>. We can click on the thumbnail in any shape layer to open up the<strong> Color Picker</strong>. Then, simply select a new color<strong> </strong>by clicking in the color selection space. Click<strong> OK</strong> when you're happy with your selection. Photoshop will apply the new color.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Change Shape Color\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2092/posts/36002/image/modern-certificate-design_5.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>5. Hide and Remove Design Elements</h3><p>How about if you want to remove an entire aspect of your beautiful certificate design? Again, we can turn to our <strong>Layers</strong> panel.</p><p>Remember how we toggled visibility on and off? Click on the <strong>eye</strong> icon to hide a layer. This is a temporary way to remove content from your layout. For a more permanent solution, select the applicable layer and then click on the <strong>trash</strong> icon at the bottom of the <strong>Layers</strong> panel. This will remove the content completely. </p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/brand-achievement-certificate-4HTR3G7\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Hide and Delete Layers\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2092/posts/36002/image/modern-certificate-design_6.jpg\"></a></figure><h2><b>5 Quick Tips for Amazing Certificate Designs</b></h2><p>Now you've got a good idea of some of the creative certificates available at GraphicRiver. Here are some quick tips to help you create the very best award certificate designs:</p><h3>1. Keep the Layout Clean</h3><p>You've only got a limited amount of room to work with. So, resist the urge to add too much information to your certificate. Instead, add only the most essential information. Leave plenty of white space around text and images.  </p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/certificate-diploma-template-BTER3ZU\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Certificate  Diploma Template\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1631/posts/34208/image/Certificate%20:%20Diploma%20Template%20copy.jpg\"></a></figure><h3><b>2. Choose the Right Template for Your Needs</b></h3><p>Make sure the template you choose complements your design and the occasion. If your award is for senior citizens, stay away from childlike designs. Likewise, if you're presenting awards to children be sure to make them fun and lighthearted. </p><h3>3. Keep Your Award Consistent With Your Brand</h3><p>If you've got a brand, keep the colours, fonts and graphics you use on your certificate consistent with your brand. This makes the certificate is easily identifiable as coming from your company or organisation. </p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/modern-certificate-02-U3G2PG\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Modern Certificate 02\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1631/posts/34208/image/Screenshot%202019-11-06%20at%2012.23.21%20pm%20copy.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>4. Add<b> Specific Information</b>\n</h3><p>You want your award to be meaningful to the person receiving it. So, customise the certificate to reflect the unique qualities of each recipient.<br></p><h3><b>5. Proof Carefully</b></h3><p> When presenting a student, employee or colleague with an official certificate, check and double check their personal details.
