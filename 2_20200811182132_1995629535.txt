The courts continue to be deeply split on this question. Back in June, Indiana's Supreme Court <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/indiana-supreme-court-its-unconstitutional-to-force-phone-unlocking/\">reached</a> the opposite conclusion, and several other state and federal courts have reached divergent positions on the issue over the last few years.</p>\n<p>This case focuses on an allegedly corrupt cop named Robert Andrews. Andrews is a former Essex County Sheriff who allegedly tipped off a suspect named Quincy Lowery about a pending police investigation. Under police questioning, Lowery testified that Andrews had advised him to get a new phone to avoid a police wiretap. He also said Andrews helped Lowery identify an undercover police officer and an unmarked police vehicle. These allegations were corroborated by data from Lowery's phone.</p>\n\n<p>The police seized two iPhones belonging to Andrews, but investigators were unable to unlock them. Andrews refused to unlock the phones based on the Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698156#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698156&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RnILkwyrYpI:7in6u_KDaFc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=RnILkwyrYpI:7in6u_KDaFc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RnILkwyrYpI:7in6u_KDaFc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=RnILkwyrYpI:7in6u_KDaFc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RnILkwyrYpI:7in6u_KDaFc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RnILkwyrYpI:7in6u_KDaFc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 16:57:06 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-458737075-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"90c0e7ef48d30aff5a185b77aa074de3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-20-39-866_a44af526c810cb5c.webp","author":"Timothy B.

Seven of the top 10 highest-grossing films released in the United States last year were distributed by the House of Mouse, and hundreds of millions of people went to see them on thousands of screens. Some weeks it felt like the entire film industry <em>was</em> Disney: <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/captain-marvel-review-the-hero-we-and-marvel-studios-need-right-now/\">Captain Marvel</a></em> and the rest of the Avengers (<em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/\">Endgame</a></em>) competed for your attention for a while, as <em>Aladdin</em>, <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/lion-king-remake-review-roaring-visuals-but-the-execution-is-a-hairball/\">The Lion King</a></em>, and <em>Toy Story 4</em> kept up a steady drumbeat of animation until Elsa dropped back onto hapless households in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/review-frozen-ii-is-fun-family-fare-with-stunning-visuals-and-so-so-soundtrack/\">Frozen II</a></em>. In amongst that morass, though, there were still other movies shown, many of them popular with audiences and critics alike.</p>\n<p>But now, the rule that prevented a studio from buying up a major theater chain is gone—opening up the possibility that your local cinema could go whole hog and become a true Disneyplex before you know it.</p>\n<p>On Friday, a federal judge agreed to the Department of Justice's petition to vacate the Paramount Consent Decrees, a landmark 1948 ruling that forbade vertical integration in the film sector and ended the Hollywood <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/The-Hollywood-studio-system\">studio system</a>. In isolation, the decision could raise some concerns. In a world where theaters are decimated thanks to a pandemic and consolidation among media firms is already rampant, the future for independent theaters looks grim.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697598#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697598&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 10:30:01 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/disney-theater-popcorn-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"f313b34a67d39c8343044c95d21dd7d2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/11/18-20-41-721_6f3c4fb2b6341e7f.webp","author":"Kate Cox","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/disney-theater-popcorn-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/11/18-20-41-721_6f3c4fb2b6341e7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/11/18-21-06-853_41da09a91f52636f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=xFv_Fk4svPU:5e7vfGY38jQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn60@2020_6/2020/08/11/18-21-07-021_440dc582bcc5c3c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","title":"McDonald’s CEO sent nude photos of employees over work email, lawsuit says","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698135","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getty-mcdonalds-800x496.jpg\" alt=\"The McDonald's logo on the window of a store.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getty-mcdonalds.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1084\" data-width=\"1750\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The McDonald's logo at a restaurant on November 4, 2019 in New York City.

We look forward to sharing more updates soon.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While this is a bit vague, the shoutout for users of uploaded content is a change of tone from what the company was saying in June. Our YouTube Music article was mainly about the free-versus-premium feature changes in YouTube Music and Google Music, including the requirement of a monthly fee in order to play purchased and uploaded music on Google Home speakers. Before publishing that article, we double-checked with Google to ask if charging to use a Google Home from YouTube music was <em>really</em> what it was planning, and all the company would do is reaffirm the current restrictions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697652#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697652&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 10:45:46 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-800x394.jpg","linkMd5":"092443826ecfd7b5757cdfc910b22638","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-20-39-762_15ba1393810580df.webp","author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-800x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-20-39-762_15ba1393810580df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn92@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-21-07-047_20a4ce2cf5f04099.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hpWISwsTpj4:1D25hvuI2eg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-21-16-038_eda6c00c90d3e908.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","title":"Independent testing confirms the Lucid Air has a range of 517 miles","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698132","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lucid-Air_Production_Driving_release-800x466.jpg\" alt=\"A Lucid Air prototype\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lucid-Air_Production_Driving_release.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1749\" data-width=\"3000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The Air looks superficially the same as when we saw it in 2017, but almost every body panel has changed.

Just before sunrise on July 16, 1945, in a secluded spot in a central New Mexican desert, a prototype bomb nicknamed \"Gadget\" was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot tower and detonated. The blast vaporized the steel tower and produced a mushroom cloud rising to more than 38,000 feet. The heat from the explosion melted the sandy soil around the tower into a mildly radioactive glassy crust now known as \"trinitite.\" And the shock wave broke windows as far as 120 miles away.</p>\n<p>After the Trinity test, Richard Feynman recalled finding his colleague, Robert Wilson, sitting despondently amid the celebration. \"It's a terrible thing that we made,\" Feynman remembered him saying. Hans Bethe famously observed, \"The physicists have known sin. And this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.\" It's often said that physicists became so intent on the intellectual challenge of building an atomic bomb that they lost sight of the profound implications of what they were creating.</p>\n<p>Those implications became all too clear on August 6, 1945, when a gun-triggered fission bomb dubbed \"Little Boy\" fell on Hiroshima, killing an estimated 70,000 to 130,000 people. Three days later, the implosion-triggered \"Fat Man\" was dropped on Nagasaki, adding another 45,000 human casualties. The United States won the war but at a horrific cost. The world has been haunted by the prospect of a devastating nuclear apocalypse ever since—and so has TV and the movies. So to mark this somber occasion, we've compiled a watch list of films and shows that we feel best reflect the complicated legacy of the atomic bomb.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1687982#p3\">Read 55 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1687982&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:40:36 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/atomic-movie-montage-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"74d683ce90aa4ca16cd9d1322f5db43a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/11/18-20-39-685_e904245114c9407a.webp","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/atomic-movie-montage-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/11/18-20-39-685_e904245114c9407a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-21-07-005_f5e318e36eb4af42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn72@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-21-23-171_3465d4e342f68055.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","title":"TCL’s latest 6-Series Roku TVs move up to mini-LEDs, start at $650","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697934","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-TVLifestyleImages-6-Series-02-800x400.png\" alt=\"TCL's new 6-Series QLED Roku TVs come with mini-LED backlights.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-TVLifestyleImages-6-Series-02.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1500\" data-width=\"3000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> TCL's new 6-Series QLED Roku TVs come with mini-LED backlights.

The notion of pitting characters from different properties and different media against one another is exciting to discuss. And when it comes to letting fans live out these arguments, there are few better outlets than fighting games.</p>\n<p>Even within a genre <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/smash-bros-ultimate-review-the-best-fighting-game-on-any-nintendo-system/\">known for character-merging crossovers</a>, there's one two-decade-old game that reigns supreme when it comes to pitting a wide variety of characters against one another. That program is <em>MUGEN</em>, derived from the Japanese word for \"infinite,\" which is an appropriate name for a program that provides near limitless potential for players to create new fighting games and characters.</p>\n<p><em>MUGEN</em> began life just before the turn of the century as a PC-based side-scrolling shoot-'em-up title, created by a small company called Elecbyte. The team was originally experimenting with creating an engine to handle the rigors of so-called shmup games but found that it just wasn't living up to what they had hoped to create. Taking inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.scary-crayon.com/games/sf2pc/\">a PC Korean <em>Street Fighter 2</em> hack known as <em>SFIBM</em></a>, Elecbyte decided to change course from a shooter to a 2D fighting game engine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697826#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697826&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:51:18 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goku_vs_Ronald-800x600.jpg","linkMd5":"a38071f7e9b6ce3e6c3f126c1a58c59d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn24@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-20-57-130_39f8835eeb4ef189.webp","author":"Ars Staff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goku_vs_Ronald-800x600.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn24@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-20-57-130_39f8835eeb4ef189.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn92@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-21-06-980_51ac7e05c6c0af0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-21-06-849_277b0ac7e1123242.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","title":"Russia’s space leader blusters about Mars in the face of stiff budget cuts","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697825","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1145753395-800x534.jpg\" alt='Dmitry Rogozin, director of the Roscosmos State Corporation, gives an open lecture titled \"Transformation of Roscosmos\" at Moscow State University on May 23, 2019.'><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1145753395.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Dmitry Rogozin, director of the Roscosmos State Corporation, gives an open lecture titled \"Transformation of Roscosmos\" at Moscow State University on May 23, 2019.

With the dramatic plunge in the price of panels, solar systems have become competitive with the cost of electricity in a growing number of states, leaving the question of sun exposure to be the primary driver of whether adoption makes sense. Yet photovoltaic-equipped houses remain a rarity in the US, despite many states pushing for the adoption of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>So why isn't that push working? To try to find out, a small team of researchers worked with a non-profit that promotes solar installs, helping test out two different messages. One message focused on self-interest and emphasized the economic benefits of installing panels. The other was what's termed \"pro-social,\" meaning it emphasized that installation of solar would bring benefits to the community. As the researchers found, self-interest was king—even after the promotion was over. But self-interest did have a side benefit in that the systems that were installed tended to get the most energy out of their panels.</p>\n<h2>Scripting Solarize</h2>\n<p>The work relies on a program called Solarize. Solarize runs town-level programs that include a single installer that provides the entire town with a group rate. Program ambassadors also run pro-solar programs within the town, encouraging adoption. These programs were the ones targeted by the researchers, who arranged an experiment based on the message delivered by these ambassadors. Some towns received messages that focused on self-interest, like “save thousands by installing solar.” Others were more community-focused—“Our community is doing something together to have more clean energy,” for example. The researchers worked with the program in Connecticut (one of the researchers is at Yale), which has expensive electricity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698008#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698008&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 22:56:33 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/36776403666_a4aa6f7098_k-800x591.jpg","linkMd5":"1df29b7793b93d06995a40501d0dba60","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-20-39-751_9455b478dc4cbf23.webp","author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/36776403666_a4aa6f7098_k-800x591.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-20-39-751_9455b478dc4cbf23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_745e609436dcd722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:f8EbzGS2qeQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn80@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-09-518_fde1be068b8710da.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","title":"The 2021 Polestar 2 has a great cabin—and deep Android integration","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697885","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Polestar-2-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"A white Polestar 2\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Polestar-2-1.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2000\" data-width=\"3000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> On the road with the new Polestar 2.

Which made last Friday a good day, because we got our first drive in the $59,900 Polestar 2. It's the first mass-production model from a new standalone brand that was spun out of Volvo and Geely a few years ago. And the<em> tl;dr</em> is that the Polestar 2 is a stylish sedan with a wonderful interior, some very fancy suspension bits, and oh—it's also the first car to use Google's Android Automotive OS.</p>\n<h2>A brief history of Polestar</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, Polestar was to Volvo as AMG is to Mercedes-Benz—a tuning company that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/the-2017-s60-polestar-a-volvo-with-a-nurburgring-lap-record/\">spiffed up more pedestrian models</a>, imbuing them with a little Nürburgring magic. But in 2017, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/volvo-tears-up-the-rules-with-a-subscription-only-600-hp-electric-gt/\">Volvo and Geely (which owns the Swedish automaker) spun Polestar out</a> as an independent company, one focused on sustainability and performance. Its first product was the Polestar 1, a hand-built $150,000 plug-in hybrid GT <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/the-polestar-1-is-a-turbocharged-supercharged-plug-in-hybrid-enigma/\">that dazzled me when I drove it in late 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>But with a total production run of only 1,500 cars over three years, you can think of the Polestar 1 like a calling card or a statement of intent. The future of Polestar is purely electric (so no more PHEVs)—and shipping cars in much greater volumes. By the end of 2021, we'll see the Polestar 3, an SUV that promises to look a lot like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/04/polestars-precept-avoids-the-stereotypes-of-performance-car-design/\">stunning Precept concept</a> shown off in April. But first, there's the Polestar 2. (Interesting fact: because Polestar is recognized as a standalone OEM, it has its own allocation of 200,000 vehicles for the IRS plug-in tax credit, as opposed to being counted together with Volvo.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697885#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697885&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:a9NKcHEKb4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J7b-0Rcz1l0:a9NKcHEKb4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:a9NKcHEKb4k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J7b-0Rcz1l0:a9NKcHEKb4k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:a9NKcHEKb4k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:a9NKcHEKb4k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:03:35 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Polestar-2-1-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"ba1b3f9ed3b318d0bf9bcfe951e5b494","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-20-39-732_e04c95d8ba59ea43.webp","author":"Jonathan M.

As the crew's journey into space intensifies, their personal dynamics and the effects of being away from their loved ones back on Earth become increasingly complex. ​<em>Away</em> shows that sometimes to reach for the stars, we must leave home behind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The trailer opens with Emma's NASA engineer husband Matt playing the opening bars of Claude Debussy's \"Clair de Lune\" on a piano, as she presents their daughter Alexis with a gift: a necklace with three stones, representing Earth, the Moon, and Mars. \"And the string is me making my way back to you.

Thomson issued a recall of all of its onions August 1, covering red, yellow, white, and sweet bulbs that were shipped any time after May 1. But the outbreak numbers will likely continue to climb, given the potentially week-long period between eating a bad onion and developing symptoms, plus a typical two-to-four-week lag in case reporting.</p>\n<p>The tainted onions were shipped to wholesalers, restaurants, and grocery stores <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/public-health-notices/2020/outbreak-salmonella-infections-under-investigation.html#a5\">across Canada</a> as well as in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia.

The accelerometers in your phone make a passable-enough seismometer, and together with location data and enough users, you could detect earthquakes and warn users as the shocks roll across the landscape. The University of California-Berkeley, along with funding from the state of California, built an app called \"MyShake\" and a cheap, effective earthquake detection network was born, at least, it was born for people who installed the app.</p>\n<p>What if you didn't need to install the app? What if earthquake detection was just built in to the operating system? That's the question Google is going to answer, with today's announcement of the \"<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/earthquake-detection-and-alerts\">Android Earthquake Alerts System</a>.\" Google is going to build what it calls \"the world’s largest earthquake detection network\" by rolling earthquake detection out to nearly every Google Play Android phone. Here's the meat of the announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All smartphones come with tiny accelerometers that can sense earthquakes. They’re even sensitive enough to detect the P-wave, which is the first wave that comes out of an earthquake and is typically much less damaging than the S-wave which comes afterward. If the phone detects something that it thinks may be an earthquake, it sends a signal to our earthquake detection server, along with a coarse location of where the shaking occurred. The server then combines information from many phones to figure out if an earthquake is happening. We’re essentially racing the speed of light (which is roughly the speed at which signals from a phone travel) against the speed of an earthquake. And lucky for us, the speed of light is much faster!</p></blockquote>\n<p>That \"race\" often works out to only a minute or so of warning, but that's usually enough to duck and cover if you catch the notification.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698029#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698029&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 13:00:07 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-980x940.jpg","linkMd5":"41268a84e6c3945cfad506e76997494a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-20-41-395_5ad964491d8c83f9.webp","author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-980x940.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-20-41-395_5ad964491d8c83f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/11/18-21-10-219_7793635ba24e8d19.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufe1T4QAXKM:j-tOAKXWhNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-21-07-041_d217fb8df51f4646.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","title":"After pulling it three years ago, Google reintroduces Maps for Apple Watch","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697898","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple_watch_app.gif\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The Google Maps app for Apple Watch.

Instead, Google promises the app is launching worldwide \"in the coming weeks.\" The app will offer \"step-by-step\" directions for driving, walking, cycling, or taking public transit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697898#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697898&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:10:39 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple_watch_app.gif","linkMd5":"3d77f9cdaf7c4df88169fdb01460aaa8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/11/18-20-41-382_caa71a448b3b5e0d.webp","author":"Samuel Axon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple_watch_app.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/11/18-20-41-382_caa71a448b3b5e0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/11/18-21-06-832_8ab771082058b79f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/11/18-21-06-896_b13c117f3c43e778.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/11/18-21-06-841_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-21-06-826_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 02:20:39","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:20:39 +0000","fetchMs":89,"handleMs":1776,"totalMs":54732,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.202.112.181","hostName":"damp-dawn-86052.herokuapp.com","requestId":"d98349e49fc5405a9b9fadc9fe648e67_2","bgimgsTotal":19,"bgimgsGithubTotal":19,"articlesImgsTotal":58,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":58},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 02:41:22","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn62@2020_4/2020/08/11/18-20-38-174_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
