If the mere fact that our festival is happening again wasn't enough to convince you to save the date and book any necessary flights, this should. We can now announce a few of the bands who will play this year's fest, as well as a truly badass new feature.</p> \n<p>First, the schedule:<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Friday, July 17</span><br /><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.builttospill.com/\" title=\"Built to Spill\">Built to Spill</a></strong> <br /> <strong><a href=\"http://www.thejesuslizard.net/\" title=\"The Jesus Lizard\">The Jesus Lizard</a></strong> <br /> <strong><a href=\"http://www.yolatengo.com/\" title=\"Yo La Tengo\">Yo La Tengo</a> </strong><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.trts.com/site.html\" title=\"Tortoise\">Tortoise</a></strong> <br /> <br /> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Saturday, July 18</span><br /><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.americanmary.com/\" title=\"The National\">The National</a></strong> <br /> <strong><a href=\"http://www.pharoahe-monch.com/\" title=\"Pharoahe Monch\">Pharoahe Monch</a> </strong><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.thepainsofbeingpureatheart.com/\" title=\"The Pains of Being Pure at Heart\">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> </strong><br />+ many more!<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sunday, July 19</span><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.grizzly-bear.net/\" title=\"Grizzly Bear\"><br />Grizzly Bear</a></strong> <br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.marcata.net/walkmen/\" title=\"The Walkmen\">The Walkmen</a></strong> <br /> <strong><a href=\"http://www.freewebs.com/viviangirls/\" title=\"Vivian Girls\">Vivian Girls</a> </strong><br />+ many more!<br /><br />OK. Now. In past years, we've booked our Friday night lineups by teaming up with <a href=\"http://atpfestival.com/\"><strong>All Tomorrow's Parties</strong></a> and their <a href=\"http://www.dontlookbackconcerts.com/\"><strong>\"Don't Look Back\"</strong></a> series, presenting bands playing classic albums all the way through. Last year, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.tv/pitchfork-live/pitchfork-music-festival-08/public-enemy-rebel-without-a-pause\"><strong>Public Enemy performed <em>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</em></strong></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/44244-pitchfork-music-festival-2007-friday\"><strong>Sonic Youth performed <em>Daydream Nation</em></strong></a> in 2007.</p> \n<p>This year, we're doing something different.</p> \n<p>Starting on Friday night, we're kicking off a new series called \"Write the Night: Set Lists by Request.\" You, the audience, vote on which songs all four bands-- Built to Spill, the Jesus Lizard, Yo La Tengo, and Tortoise-- will play. It'll work like this: When you buy your ticket, you'll get a confirmation email. That confirmation email will include a link to a page where you can vote on which songs from each band you want to hear. The bands will tailor their set lists accordingly. Oh, and did we mention this is the Jesus Lizard's first American show in a decade? Righteous, yes?<br /> <br /> Tickets go on sale March 13, and voting starts the same day. Voting ends June 12.<br /> <br /> Of course, we'll announce a ton more bands in the coming months.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 07 Mar 2009 00:15:00 +0000","feedId":9129,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d5e3764ef331d7ddbb06d164b09062dc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Tom Breihan","publishedOrCreatedDate":1647250165800}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 17:29:25","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 17:29:25","feedId":9129,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 09:29:25 +0000","fetchMs":101,"handleMs":180371,"totalMs":180500,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"245d88d7b2d8f26704713c23b090d029","hostName":"us-004*","requestId":"0af98e200a6f4b1aa996871e74e061c7_9129","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:34:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:20:12","id":9129,"name":"Pitchfork Media - Today","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/pitchfork/today","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1647249985326,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":103,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":180371,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/node/149566_/article/news/149445-pitchfork-music-festival-2009":"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/149445-pitchfork-music-festival-2009","http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/node/149566_/article/feature/44244-pitchfork-music-festival-2007-friday":"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/44244-pitchfork-music-festival-2007-friday"},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
