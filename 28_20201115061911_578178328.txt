If your bf is embarrassed of you, that is his problem and honestly I question if he loves you as much as you think he does if this is what&#39;s concerning him Q\" title=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"463\"/> </div> <h3> 25. </h3> <div> <img class='event-item-lol-image' src='https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9571336448/h9656A443/should-disregard-his-opinion-on-this-just-dont-ask-ketchup-get-nice-steak-only-assholes-do-reply' id='_r_a_9571336448' alt=\"Text - JOsey_W4les_23 • 22h • Asshole Aficionado [16] NTA - Seeing as every nice restaurant I&#39;ve eaten at in the last couple years has prided itself on serving bougie versions of standard fare, think $40 chicken and waffles, l&#39;d wager your BF is a wannabe food snob.
