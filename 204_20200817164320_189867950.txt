But you can also use Wix to create an ecommerce website from scratch.</p>\n<p>The best part about using Wix is an ecommerce platform is its simplicity. Your ecommerce site will get the same drag-and-drop benefits as a traditional Wix website. You just need to choose an ecommerce plan to accept payments online.</p>\n<p>For those of you who are already using Wix, you can always upgrade your plan to activate the ecommerce functionality.</p>\n<p>Your Wix store manager makes it easy to manage inventory, track orders, and communicate with your customers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wix-online-store-builder.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-42751\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wix-online-store-builder.png\" alt=\"Wix online store builder\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wix-online-store-builder.png 800w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wix-online-store-builder-300x143.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wix-online-store-builder-768x366.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Wix has more than 500 ecommerce templates for you to choose from. You can customize your storefront with collections, galleries, related products, and a customer wishlist.</p>\n<p>You’ll also be able to set up global shipping rules from multiple carriers. As of right now, Wix does not support dropshipping. But their website says a dropshipping platform is coming soon, so I would expect that within the next year.</p>\n<p>Unlike other ecommerce platforms, Wix doesn’t take any transaction commissions. So the only fees will come from the payment processor.</p>\n<p>Wix offers four different ecommerce plans; all of which accept online payments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business Basic — $23 per month</li>\n<li>Business Unlimited — $27 per month</li>\n<li>Business VIP — $49 per month</li>\n<li>Enterprise — $500 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All plans come with unlimited bandwidth. You’ll get extra storage at each pricing tier.</p>\n<p>Wix is new to the ecommerce space. So the platform isn’t perfect. But they’ve definitely made improvements as of late. You’re able to do things like target abandoned shopping carts, which wasn’t always on option. So I expect more of these types of improvements in the years to come.</p>\n<h3>Shopify</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10011/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44629 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shopify-Logo.png\" alt=\"Shopify\" /></a><div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10011/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Shopify</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $29/mo<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> 24/7 customer support<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Drag-and-drop site builder<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Used by more than one million online stores<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10011/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Get a 14 day free trial</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10011/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shopify</a> is arguably the most well-known ecommerce platform in the world. More than one million ecommerce businesses are powered by this ecommerce solution.</p>\n<p>As an all-in-one ecommerce platform, Shopify is extremely easy to use and set up right out of the box. It’s a great option for ecommerce sites that don’t have lots of in-house technical resources.</p>\n<p>The amazing part about using Shopify is that its so versatile. It’s used by small businesses and larger-scale operations alike. Kylie Jenner used Shopify to build her billion-dollar empire selling lip kits from Kylie Cosmetics. But you could use it as a small startup as well.</p>\n<p>Another stand out from Shopify is its award-winning 24/7 support, which you’ll have access to even before you sign up for a Shopify plan.</p>\n<p>Shopify makes it easy for you to sell products from your online store, as well as through social media platforms, online marketplaces, and in-person with Shopify POS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10011/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44615 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shopify-1024x428.png\" alt=\"Shopify\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shopify-1024x428.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shopify-300x125.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shopify-768x321.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Shopify drag-and-drop builder is a convenient way to build a new ecommerce website from scratch. All themes are optimized for mobile devices, which is necessary to maximize your conversions.</p>\n<p>Shopify even has its own payment processor built-in the platform. It also integrates with more than 3,200 apps in the Shopify App Store.</p>\n<p>There are three different base plans offered by Shopify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic Shopify — $29 per month</li>\n<li>Shopify — $79 per month</li>\n<li>Advanced Shopify — $299 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind, these are just the base rates. Adding apps, processing payments, and other features will cost you extra.</p>\n<p>High volume stores seeking enterprise-grade solutions can get a custom Shopify Plus quote to fit your needs.</p>\n<p>The entry-level plan will be enough to get you started, but I’d recommend the mid-tier Shopify subscription at a minimum. It comes with better features like gift cards, professional reports, and better discounts for shipping and payment processing.</p>\n<p>Shopify offers a <strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10011/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">14-day free trial</a></strong> for all of its plans.</p>\n<p><strong>More QuickSprout Shopify Reviews and Guides</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/shopify-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/transfer-website-to-shopify/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Transfer Your Website to Shopify</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-ecommerce-website-builder/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Ecommerce Website Builder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/create-ecommerce-website/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Create an Ecommerce Website in 9 Easy Steps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/start-online-store/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Start an Online Store That Drives Sales in 2019</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Squarespace</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44637 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Squarespace-Logo.png\" alt=\"Squarespace\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10014/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Squarespace</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $12/mo<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Unlimited products<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Sell physical &#38; digital products<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> 24/7 customer support<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Get a 14 day free trial</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Squarespace</a> is another popular website builder. But Squarespace has a fully integrated ecommerce platform built-in to every plan except for the entry-level option.</p>\n<p>With Squarespace, building a beautiful website is easy. The templates are modern and fully customizable. You can even install multiple templates to one website and switch between them at any time.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend Squarespace to new ecommerce shops that are unsure of what the future holds. That’s because this platform makes it easy for you to scale or pivot the direction of your sales strategy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10014/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44623 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/squarespace-1024x569.png\" alt=\"squarespace\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/squarespace-1024x569.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/squarespace-300x167.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/squarespace-768x427.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Squarespace</a> has dozens and dozens of ecommerce benefits. Here are some of the top highlights to give you an idea of what you’re getting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited products</li>\n<li>Flexible product varients</li>\n<li>Sell physical and digital products</li>\n<li>Manage subscriptions</li>\n<li>Multiple payment methods</li>\n<li>Mobile-optimized checkouts</li>\n<li>Gift cards</li>\n<li>Abandoned cart recovery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list goes on and on. The drawback of using Squarespace is that there isn’t an app store to add any other integrations or extensions. What you see is what you get. You’ll find that the most popular and useful apps are already built-in, but just make sure you check the full feature list if you need or want something specific.</p>\n<p>These are the Squarespace plans and prices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal — $12 per month</li>\n<li>Business — $18 per month</li>\n<li>Basic Commerce — $26 per month</li>\n<li>Advanced Commerce — $40 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Personal plan does not have ecommerce capabilities. You can sell online using the Business plan, but you’ll pay an additional 3% transaction fee to Squarespace, and won’t get all of the useful ecommerce features.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, I’d recommend the Basic Commerce plan. There are no transaction fees, and you’ll benefit from customer accounts, checkouts on your own domain, ecommerce analytics, social media selling, POS, and other features that you’d expect for an ecommerce shop.</p>\n<p>For gift cards, abandoned cart recovery, subscriptions, and a few other higher-level features, you’ll need to sign up for the Advanced Commerce plan.</p>\n<h3>BigCommerce</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10012/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44630 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BigCommerce-Logo.png\" alt=\"BigCommerce\" /></a><div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10012/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit BigCommerce</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $29.95/mo<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Pricing based on annual sales<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Lots of built-in native features<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Multi-channel selling capabilities<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10012/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Get a 15 day free trial</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10012/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">BigCommerce</a> has been providing ecommerce solutions for the last decade. During that time, they’ve processed more than $17 billion in merchant sales.</p>\n<p>Similar to Shopify, BigCommerce is a robust all-in-one ecommerce platform providing everything you need to sell online. In fact, BigCommerce actually has more native features than Shopify built-in right out of the box.</p>\n<p>Although some of you might be a bit overwhelmed by these capabilities and features.</p>\n<p>But for people who plan on taking advantage of these extra features, it’s nice to know that you won’t have to pay extra for functionalities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10012/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44616 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bigcommerce-1024x489.png\" alt=\"bigcommerce\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bigcommerce-1024x489.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bigcommerce-300x143.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bigcommerce-768x367.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>BigCommerce makes it easy for you to manage sales across multiple channels as well.</p>\n<p>The platform has an outstanding reputation in terms of uptime, loading speed, security, and other performance metrics. They offer unique solutions for B2B stores, wholesale shops, and WordPress users.</p>\n<p>BigCommerce has specific options for ecommerce stores in different industries as well.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re starting a new online store from scratch, or scaling your brick-and-mortar small business into the ecommerce world, BigCommerce is a top solution for you to consider.</p>\n<p>Here’s a quick overview of the BigCommerce plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard — $29.95 per month</li>\n<li>Plus — $79.95 per month</li>\n<li>Pro — $249.95 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As expected, each tier comes with added features and benefits. But what’s unique about BigCommerce’s pricing is that stores will automatically be upgraded to a new plan if they reach certain sales milestones in a year.</p>\n<p>The 12-month sales limits are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard — Up to $50,000</li>\n<li>Plus — Up to $150,000</li>\n<li>Pro — Up to $400,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for example, if you sign up for the Standard plan, you’ll automatically be switched to the Plus plan if you eclipse $50,000 within the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>While that shouldn’t discourage you from using them, it’s important to know this ahead of time so you aren’t surprised if your monthly rate increases.</p>\n<p>Save 10% off Plus and Pro plans with an annual contract.

With more than 22,000 merchants using the platform, it’s not nearly as popular as industry giants like Shopify or BigCommerce. However, 3DCart is a great option to consider for advanced ecommerce users.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend 3DCart to those of you who have built online stores in the past. If you have experience in the ecommerce industry, 3DCart has capabilities that you can take advantage of.</p>\n<p>They don’t offer a drag-and-drop builder, so you’ll need to have a basic understanding of coding and development to customize your themes and templates.</p>\n<p>3DCart stands out as one of the best ecommerce platforms with built-in SEO tools. Here’s an overview of the pricing for its plans:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10413/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44617 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3dcart-1024x436.png\" alt=\"3dcart\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3dcart-1024x436.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3dcart-300x128.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3dcart-768x327.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3dcart-680x290.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Similar to BigCommerce, each plan has restrictions in online sales before you’re automatically upgraded to the next tier. Those limits are $50k, $100k, $500k, and $1 million, respectively, for each plan.</p>\n<p>Other top features and benefits of 3DCart include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No transaction fees</li>\n<li>24/7 customer support</li>\n<li>200+ payment gateways</li>\n<li>Integrations with third-party online marketplaces</li>\n<li>Unlimited bandwidth</li>\n<li>Web hosting</li>\n<li>Free domain for one year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the drawbacks of 3DCart is that the admin dashboard for managing your site isn’t that user-friendly. Lots of themes and designs are outdated as well.</p>\n<p>All 3DCart plans come with a 15 day free trial and are backed by a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44632 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Woocommerce-Logo.png\" alt=\"Woocommerce\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit WooCommerce</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Free to install on WordPress sites<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Easy to customize<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> More than 300+ extensions<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Most popular ecommerce solution in the world<br />\n<a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Try it for free</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WooCommerce</a> is a bit different than the other platforms we’ve seen so far. It’s an ecommerce plugin made for WordPress, as opposed to an all-in-one ecommerce platform.</p>\n<p>But with nearly 80 million downloads, WooCommerce is the world’s most popular ecommerce solution. Nearly 30% of all online stores across the globe are powered by WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>With WooCommerce, any website running on WordPress can be turned into an ecommerce store.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is free to download and install to your WordPress site. But it requires you to have your domain, hosting, and WordPress account already set up. Then it’s just as simple as installing any other WordPress plugin.</p>\n<p>You can customize your store by adding 300+ extensions from the WooCommerce Extensions Store.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44618 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woocommerce-1-1024x367.png\" alt=\"woocommerce\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woocommerce-1-1024x367.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woocommerce-1-300x107.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woocommerce-1-768x275.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is where you’ll integrate payment processors, subscription tools, and store management features. Lots of these extensions are free, but others are priced up to $300 per extension.</p>\n<p>Since WooCommerce is run via WordPress, the customization and capabilities for your online store are virtually limitless. You’ll only need to add features that you plan to use, so you won’t have to worry about anything else cluttering your dashboard.</p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, I would only recommend WooCommerce to content-based websites. Meaning the primary function of your site is not the ecommerce capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a WordPress blog and want to sell 10 or 20 products as a supplemental income strategy, you can install WooCommerce for its ecommerce functions.</p>\n<p>But if you want to build a new ecommerce website from scratch and sell hundreds of different items, I’d look for another solution on our list.</p>\n<h3>OpenCart</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10416/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44638 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/OpenCart-Logo.png\" alt=\"OpenCart\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10416/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit OpenCart</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $0/mo<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> 13,000+ themes and extensions<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Simple interface<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Open-source software<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10416/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Try it for free</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10416/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">OpenCart</a> ecommerce platform provides everything you need to create and manage your online store. More than 342,000 ecommerce sites across the globe are powered by OpenCart</p>\n<p>OpenCart is not a website builder. It’s an open-source software that you can install to add ecommerce functionalities to your existing website.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why I like OpenCart is because the admin dashboard makes it easy for you to manage everything using a singular and simple interface.</p>\n<p>Another major advantage of OpenCart is its marketplace. It has more than 13,000 modules, themes, and extensions. So if you want to integrate something with your ecommerce store, there’s a good chance it’s available on the OpenCart marketplace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10416/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44624 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opencart-1024x577.png\" alt=\"opencart\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opencart-1024x577.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opencart-300x169.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opencart-768x433.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The best part about OpenCart? It’s free to download and install to your website. There are never any monthly or annual fees for using this software.</p>\n<p>However, you will have to pay to use certain extensions. But if you’re running a simple ecommerce website and don’t need many premium extensions, OpenCart is a great way to keep your costs down.</p>\n<p>If you need help or assistance, there are more than 110,000 registered members active on the OpenCart community forum. You can browse through the 550,000+ posts to see if someone already answered your question.</p>\n<p>For dedicated technical support directly from OpenCart, you’ll need to pay. The rate starts at $99 for a one-time fix or $99 per month for advanced ongoing support.</p>\n<h3>Ecwid</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10417/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44639\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ecwid-Logo.png\" alt=\"Ecwid\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10417/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Ecwid</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $15/mo<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Compatible with popular CMS platforms and website builders<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Easy to scale<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10417/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Try it for free</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you’re a WordPress user and want an alternative solution to WooCommerce, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10417/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ecwid</a> would be my next recommendation.</p>\n<p>It’s not nearly as popular as WooCommerce, but it still offers great benefits and specializes in ecommerce sales from multiple marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Unlike WooCommerce, Ecwid is compatible with other platforms as well. In addition to WordPress, Ecwid can be added to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wix</li>\n<li>Weebly</li>\n<li>Squarespace</li>\n<li>Joomla</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Blogger</li>\n<li>Adobe Muse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, you can turn nearly any website into an ecommerce platform with Ecwid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10417/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44625 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ecwid-1024x503.png\" alt=\"ecwid\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ecwid-1024x503.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ecwid-300x147.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ecwid-768x377.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another great benefit of Ecwid is that they have a free forever plan, although its limited to just 10 products. You won’t be able to integrate your online store with other marketplaces for free either.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of Ecwid, you’ll need to sign up for a premium plan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Venture — $15 per month</li>\n<li>Business — $35 per month</li>\n<li>Unlimited — $99 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Venture and Business plans are limited to 100 and 2,500 products, respectively. As the name implies, there aren’t any restrictions on the Unlimited plan.</p>\n<p>As you’d expect, the features and benefits get better as you upgrade to each tier. So you can start off with the entry-level plan and upgrade at any time that you see fit if you outgrow your plan.</p>\n<h3>Magento</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://magento.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44633 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Magento-Logo.png\" alt=\"Magento\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://magento.com/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Magento</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $20,000/year<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Enterprise-level solution<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> 1,000+ themes and extensions<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Drag-and-drop page builder<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://magento.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Get a free demo</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://magento.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Magento</a> is an ecommerce platform designed for enterprise-level online stores.

Magento has powerful and robust ecommerce capabilities for any type of website across all industries.</p>\n<p>Again, I’d only consider Magento if you have a huge online store. It’s not worth it if you’re a small business or ecommerce startup.</p>\n<p>Pricing for a Magento enterprise license starts at over $20,000 per year. They do advertise more options for small business owners, but I’d stay away from those.</p>\n<p>Magento is an industry leader in terms of mobile commerce solutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magento.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44619 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/magento-1024x490.png\" alt=\"magento\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/magento-1024x490.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/magento-300x144.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/magento-768x368.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You’ll be able to create a PWA (progressive web app) to enhance the user experience for customers shopping from their mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Magento has an easy to use page builder with drag-and-drop capabilities.

For the last 20+ years, over 180,000 websites have used this platform to sell online. More than $28 billion in sales have been processed from Volusion stores.</p>\n<p>With Volusion, it’s easy to create your store, sell your products, and scale your business.</p>\n<p>This platform is only intended for stores selling physical products. It’s not made to support digital downloads.</p>\n<p>Volusion is a great choice for those of you offering lots of products. There aren’t any quantity restrictions for the products offered on your site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://volusion.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44621 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/volusion-1024x499.png\" alt=\"volusion\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/volusion-1024x499.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/volusion-300x146.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/volusion-768x374.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Volusion offers exceptional customer service. But the level of support you get depends on your plan. For example, the entry-level plan does not come with phone support. Here’s an overview of the plans and pricing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal — $26 per month</li>\n<li>Professional — $71 per month</li>\n<li>Startup — $161 per month</li>\n<li>Business — $269 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shipping rates are determined by your plan is well. Higher-level plans get better discounts.</p>\n<p>Similar to other ecommerce platforms we’ve seen, your plan will automatically be upgraded if you exceed certain sales milestones in a 12 month period.</p>\n<p>Volusion does have its drawbacks. Lots of their themes seem a bit dated compared to other ecommerce platforms. Volusion also doesn’t have built-in blogging capabilities, so you’ll need to use WordPress or another CMS for that feature.</p>\n<p>You can try Volusion free for 14 days. All plans are backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>\n<h3>J2 Store</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.j2store.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44636 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/J2Store-Logo.png\" alt=\"J2Store\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.j2store.org/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit J2 Store</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Price starts at $8.16/mo<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Joomla shopping cart extension<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Supports subscriptions and memberships<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> 30 day money back guarantee<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.j2store.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Try it for free</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I want to start off by saying that <a href=\"https://www.j2store.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">J2Store</a> is not for everyone. It’s only made for websites that fall into a very specific category.</p>\n<p>J2Store is a shopping cart extension for people using Joomla as a CMS. So it’s not an all-in-one ecommerce platform. You need to already have a Joomla website to use J2Store.</p>\n<p>I like J2Store because you can get everything set up in less than 10 minutes. It’s about as easy as it gets for turning a Joomla site into an ecommerce shop.</p>\n<p>J2Store has more than 350,000 downloads, has 60+ app integrations, and is compatible with 75+ payment gateways.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.j2store.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44622 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/j2store-1024x613.png\" alt=\"j2store\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/j2store-1024x613.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/j2store-300x180.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/j2store-768x460.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/j2store.png 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to selling physical products online, J2Store also supports subscriptions, memberships, digital downloads, partial payments, and deposits. You’ll also be able to manage bookings and reservations using this Joomla shopping cart extension.</p>\n<p>J2Store has the capability to sell products with variants that need to be configured by the customer before checkout.</p>\n<p>You can download and install J2Store for free. But to start selling, you’ll need to upgrade to one of the two premium plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional — $49 per six months</li>\n<li>Developer — $99 per year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two plans are basically identical in terms of features. The biggest difference is that the developer plan supports five sites, whereas the professional plan supports unlimited sites.</p>\n<p>Both premium plans are backed with a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>\n<p>If you’re using Joomla and want to start selling online. J2Store is a no-brainer. But if you’re starting a new ecommerce site from scratch, I can’t say that using Joomla as your CMS is the best option. I’d look for another choice on our list.</p>\n<h3>Salesforce Commerce Cloud</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44641\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Salesforce-Logo.png\" alt=\"Salesforce\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/overview/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Salesforce</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Custom pricing<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Ecommerce and CRM platform<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Ideal for B2B companies<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Leverage AI to drive sales<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Get a free trial</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Salesforce</a> is one of the best CRM platforms on the market today. But recently, they’ve expanded their services into the ecommerce space.</p>\n<p>In 2016 Salesforce acquired Demandware, which is a cloud-based ecommerce solution. They rebranded Demandware and named it the Salesforce Commerce Cloud.</p>\n<p>This is the best solution for those of you who want a CRM and ecommerce platform in the same package.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-44627\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salesforce-1024x591.png\" alt=\"salesforce\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salesforce-1024x591.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salesforce-300x173.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salesforce-768x443.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>The Commerce Cloud also has B2B-specific ecommerce solutions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CRM and ecommerce software, Salesforce stands out with the AI being used to improve the customer shopping experience. By using “Commerce Cloud Einstein” you’ll be able to leverage sales with data from customer purchase history and browsing behavior.</p>\n<p>Salesforce will help you recommend products to users in real-time based on a wide range of factors. Ultimately, this will help you drive more conversions.</p>\n<p>Pricing for the Salesforce Commerce Cloud is not transparent on their website. But it’s based on “gross merchandise value.” You need to contact Salesforce to request a quote.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you can try out the Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Salesforce CRM for free with a trial. The length and terms of the trial depend on your unique situation.</p>\n<h3>Easy Digital Downloads</h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-44640 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EDD-Logo.png\" alt=\"Easy Digital Downloads\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Easy Digital Downloads</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><i class=\"sui sui-check\"></i> Price starts at $99/year<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\"></i> 100+ themes and extensions<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\"></i> Sell subscriptions &#38; digital content<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\"></i> Made for WordPress<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\"></i> <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Learn more</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As the name implies, <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> is made for selling digital products online.

This is the methodology that we used for making the picks on our list above.</p>\n<p>You can use these criteria as well to make your decision easier. I’ll explain which features matter the most, which ones don’t, and break down the details of each element below.</p>\n<h3>Setup and Ease of Use</h3>\n<p>Getting started should always be the first thing to consider. If it’s difficult to get set up out of the box, it’s usually a sign that you’ll have trouble down the road as well.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure that the platform makes it easy for you to start your store, manage your products, edit your website, and collect payments online. Ideally, all of this should be managed in a single admin dashboard or interface with minimal third-party requirements.</p>\n<h3>Type of Ecommerce Platform</h3>\n<p>All ecommerce platforms or not created equally. The type of platform you choose will depend on your current situation.</p>\n<p>There are ecommerce website builders, plugins, and extensions. If you already have a website, you need to make sure that your solution is compatible with whatever CMS you’re using.</p>\n<p>For example, WooCommerce is a plugin made for WordPress sites. J2Store is a shopping cart extension for Joomla. Ecwid is an extension compatible with both WordPress, Joomla, and other platforms as well.</p>\n<p>If you already have an existing website and you just want to convert it to an online store, a plugin or an extension would be better than a website builder.</p>\n<h3>Type of Website</h3>\n<p>The type of ecommerce website you have will also determine your ecommerce platform.</p>\n<p>How many products are you selling? Are you offering physical products, services, or digital goods? Do you need dropshipping capabilities or are you managing shipments on your own?</p>\n<p>An existing blog website that wants to add digital downloads will not need the same solution as a full-blown ecommerce shop that needs to be built from scratch.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>All ecommerce stores will let you process online payments. But you need to look beyond that to see what features they offer and what features you actually need.</p>\n<p>Is everything already built-in to the platform? Or is there a marketplace with themes, integrations, and extensions?</p>\n<p>Some advanced plans come with things like abandoned cart recovery, customer profiles, detailed analytics, and product recommendations. But if you just have a basic site selling a few products, these features may not be important to you.</p>\n<h3>Value</h3>\n<p>The cost of your ecommerce solution will likely be based on the features offered in the plan you select. Some ecommerce platforms are free, but you’ll be charged as you add certain extensions.</p>\n<p>Your rate might even change based on your sales. So make sure you understand how the pricing works before you make a final decision.</p>\n<p>I always look for ecommerce platforms offering a free trial and some type of money-back guarantee. This gives you a chance to try everything out to see if you’re getting the best value.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Choosing an ecommerce platform can be challenging simply because there are so many different options at your disposal. Fortunately, you can narrow your list down based on the criteria that I’ve identified above.</p>\n<p>There’s something for everyone on this list. Whether you’re a beginner in need of an ecommerce website builder, or an experienced developer in need of advanced software for B2B sales, you’ll be able to use this guide to find what you need.</p>\n<p>Here’s a quick overview of the best ecommerce platforms that I’ve reviewed in this guide.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10016/\" target=\"_blank\"

The best website builder for most people is <b><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wix</a><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></b>.</strong></p>\n<p>You want a website—but you&#8217;re not a coder. You just want your website to look good, work, and be easy to set up.</p>\n<p>Good news: even if you&#8217;re not good with coding and developing, you can get a professional-looking website in minutes.</p>\n<p>How? With a great website builder.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, you can now get a world-class website, build it yourself quickly, and no one will ever know. It looks just like a $100,000 site from some fancy marketing agency.</p>\n<p>The designers are that <em>good</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-41765\"></span></p>\n<p>To find the best, I reviewed 31 website builders, testing them on their ease of use, quality of the product, customer support, and pricing. I then narrowed them all down to my top 4 picks for the best website builders.</p>\n<h2>The 4 Best Website Builders</h2>\n<p>My top four picks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wix</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Squarespace</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10053/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Ucraft</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re looking for the easiest way to create a site, a website builder like <b><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wix</a></strong></b> will certainly get you there. These are subscription services with drag-and-drop interfaces and we&#8217;ll explain the pros and cons of each of them in detail.</p>\n<p>But you should also consider building your own website with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><b>WordPress</b></a>. There&#8217;s no subscription fee and your site will be basically limitless. It&#8217;s not an all-in-one service, but it isn’t hard to sign up for the other pieces you&#8217;ll need (a domain name, hosting, and a theme). In this guide, I&#8217;ll walk you through this method too.</p>\n<p>Read on for in-depth reviews of my top picks for 2020 and step-by-step guides to setting them up quickly and cost-effectively.</p>\n<h2>Website Builder Reviews</h2>\n<h3>#1 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wix</a></h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45413\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wix.png\" alt=\"Wix\" /></a><div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Wix</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Automates the tough choices<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Paid plans start at $11 per month<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Free trial period: 14 days<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Traffic and conversion analytics<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Try Wix for free</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wix</a> is easily the best website builder.</p>\n<p>Wix’s artificial intelligence asks you a few questions and literally builds your custom website before your eyes. Imagine a genie that magically creates the website you&#8217;ve been dreaming about before your eyes. It&#8217;s that good.</p>\n<p>Wix does have a free tier, but I don’t recommend it. It has some of the most in-your-face “this was not paid for” company branding I’ve seen — an instant trust breaker. Wix free sites also have cumbersome domain structures: <strong>yourusername.wix.com/sitename</strong> (so we’d be <strong>QuickSproutEditorial.wix.com/QuickSprout</strong>.)</p>\n<p>Connecting your actual domain allows you to attach a Google Analytics profile and add email accounts if you’d like ($5 per account per month, or about half that with an annual plan).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the pricing isn&#8217;t very upfront. Wix wants you to connect your domain before you see the email pricing, for example. I found answers to pricing questions in the support center, not the user flow.</p>\n<p>To start creating a Wix website, just click &#8220;create site.&#8221; You’ll be asked a question: What kind of website do you want to create? From there, the AI will help you build your website. (You can opt-out and go it alone at this point, too, but we appreciated the AI’s help.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-41775\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-artificial-intelligence-website-builder-questions.png\" alt=\"Wix artificial intelligence website builder questions\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-artificial-intelligence-website-builder-questions.png 986w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-artificial-intelligence-website-builder-questions-300x235.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-artificial-intelligence-website-builder-questions-768x601.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px\" /></a><br />\n<em>One of the first screens you&#8217;ll see when you build a website with Wix.</em></p>\n<p>When I tested Wix, I loved how easy it was to find a template that matched our vision. The AI stayed with me as I edited the page, helping me pick the next thing to edit and showing me how to do it.</p>\n<p>The Wix AI matched my new site to my business’ existing online presence, used my logo to create a color palette for my site, pulled right from Instagram, and gave me a template pre-populated with that logo and our street address. Connecting images from existing social media accounts made it easy to pull in all the assets we already owned.</p>\n<p>A fun thing to try is to pick a business you already know and see how close Wix&#8217;s AI comes to replicating it. I used a local yoga studio as an example and Wix did closely match the studio&#8217;s existing site. Even better, I bet they paid a web designer a bit of coin for their design, and I did mine for free with an AI assistant.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#62;As AI progresses, it will be harder and harder to know which site was built via AI and which was built via a designer. You can think of it like passing a &#8220;design turing test&#8221;, i.e. in the future humans will not be able to differential between the two. Then, it’ll have to get innovative. Instead of mimicking what it is learning from what’s created, it will get better and more experimental. It’s easy to see how soon most websites that are created use AI in some way.</p>\n<p>—Wix VP &#38; GM of Consumer Experience Nitzan Achsaf told <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/why-ai-is-the-best-tool-to-help-build-your-next-website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TechRadar</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a lot of variety between the Wix themes, and the personality of each theme matches its name well. The Business Advisor had a spot-on graphic of an analytics dashboard, while Astrologer features an astral hero image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41776\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-theme-template-designs-for-marketing.png\" alt=\"Wix theme template designs for marketing\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-theme-template-designs-for-marketing.png 1067w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-theme-template-designs-for-marketing-300x232.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-theme-template-designs-for-marketing-768x595.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-theme-template-designs-for-marketing-1024x793.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Some of Wix&#8217;s business-centric themes.</em></p>\n<p>Editing your desktop site with Wix does require some patience. To change the text on a text box, you’ll need to hover precisely in the right spot. I did some deep breathing and was able to find enough inner zen to make all the changes I wanted. The mobile editor has the helpful feel I wish the rest of the editor maintained. It’s super easy to click through the options for how your menu, quick actions, and scroll options work on your mobile page. What you change in the mobile editor doesn’t affect anything that happens on desktop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41778\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-website-builder-menu-overwhelm.png\" alt=\"Wix website builder menu overwhelm\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-website-builder-menu-overwhelm.png 1916w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-website-builder-menu-overwhelm-300x150.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-website-builder-menu-overwhelm-768x385.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-website-builder-menu-overwhelm-1024x514.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1916px) 100vw, 1916px\" /></a><br />\n<em>Wix&#8217;s editor requires patience — and some clicking around.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41774\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-AI-website-builder-mobile-menu-selector.png\" alt=\"Wix website builder mobile user interface\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-AI-website-builder-mobile-menu-selector.png 1175w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-AI-website-builder-mobile-menu-selector-300x200.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-AI-website-builder-mobile-menu-selector-768x512.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wix-AI-website-builder-mobile-menu-selector-1024x683.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1175px) 100vw, 1175px\" /></a><br />\n<em>I prefer the easier-to-use mobile editor.</em></p>\n<p>Take note: all of Wix’s plans are automatically set to auto-renew. Sticker shock is real, especially if you signed up with an introductory promo pricing (at the time of publishing, premium plans were a full 50% off, for example).</p>\n<p>There are many <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.wix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">frustrated customers on TrustPilot</a> who’re unhappy with this. It is possible to turn off your auto-renew, but you’ll need to do it more than 14 days before your plan’s anniversary — and if you do it during your 14-day free trial, your trial will be canceled immediately.</p>\n<p>As for which paid plan to pick, you have 7 options: 4 “regular” and 3 “ecommerce.” The difference really boils down to whether you’ll be accepting payments on your site or not. If you’re not sure about how much bandwidth you need, you can always start with a smaller subscription: if you go over the limit, you’ll get a notice from Wix (with no penalty) and can use that as your signal to upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Get Started for Free at Wix</a></strong></p>\n<h3>#2 &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45414\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wordpress.png\" alt=\"Wordpress\" /></a><div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit WordPress</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Best for content management<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Free open-source software forever<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> You&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-domain-registrar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buy a domain name</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">web hosting</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Download WordPress</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a>.

Why&#8217;s that?</p>\n<p>WordPress runs a third of the internet and it has the best content management system — all available for free. Some huge names you’ll recognize run their sites on WordPress.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-42003\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WordPress-User-Collage-e1545155096662.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress User Collage\" /><br />\n<em>If you run WordPress you&#8217;ll be in fine company, including Vogue, Lucky Peach, and Beyonce&#8217;s own website.</em></p>\n<p>Because WordPress is so popular there&#8217;s a huge community of developers and designers creating themes and plugins for you to use.</p>\n<p>Unlike other website builders, WordPress isn&#8217;t a one-stop shop. You&#8217;ll also need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A domain name</strong> &#8211; This is your website&#8217;s address. Ours is QuickSprout.com — you&#8217;ll need to buy yours. We recommend going to <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10688/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Domain.com</a> to buy your domain (get 25% off with coupon code QUICKSPROUT) or you can check out our list of other <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-domain-registrar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recommended domain registrars</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Hosting</strong> &#8211; This is where your website&#8217;s files will be stored, which allows a user to access your site. I recommend starting with a shared plan (the lowest tier) with either <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10167/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SiteGround</a>, of if you don’t mind paying a premium, to go with <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10260/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Engine,</a> which is optimized for WordPress. You can read more in <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our review of the Best Web Hosting Service</a>. This will cost you about $8 a month, but there&#8217;s usually promotional pricing for half-off the first contract.</li>\n<li><strong>A theme</strong> &#8211; A <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress theme</a> controls the look of your website and how all of the information in it works, so a theme is one part design and one part feature set. Every WordPress site comes with a basic theme, and there are thousands of free and paid themes you can select from in the WordPress themes directory. I like to use the $30 themes at <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10269/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Themeforest</a>. If you go with WP Engine, your plan includes 35 or more themes already, which does a bit to defray the steeper price point.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten your domain name and your web host, you&#8217;ll be able to install WordPress within a few clicks and get your login credentials. They don&#8217;t call it <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Installation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress.org’s “famous 5-minute installation”</a> for nothing.</p>\n<p>Log in and you&#8217;ll see that your site is pre-loaded with a starter theme. Using as different one? Simply install it. From here, you&#8217;re set to adjust your site&#8217;s settings, menus, and page structure, and start writing blog posts. WordPress is hands down the winner when it comes to running a content-driven site.</p>\n<p>If you need help at any point, there are tons (literally tons) of guides on the internet. I recommend starting with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217;s support page</a>, which will answer questions like Where to start, Writing posts, and Using themes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-create-a-wordpress-website/\"><strong>Check out our full guide on how to create a website with WordPress!</strong></a></p>\n<h3>#3 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Squarespace</a></h3>\n<div id=\"CTAcontainer\">\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45415\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Squarespace-Logo.png\" alt=\"Squarespace\" /></a><div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#00cc5f;border-color:#00a44c;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:7px 22px;font-size:17px;line-height:26px;border-color:#4ddc8f;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;-webkit-border-radius:8px;text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-moz-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000;-webkit-text-shadow:0px 0px 0px #000000\"><i class=\"sui sui-share\" style=\"font-size:17px;color:#FFFFFF\"></i> <strong>Visit Squarespace</strong></span></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"CTAblock\">\n<p style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;\"><i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #333;\"></i> Stellar templates<br />\nPlans start at $12 per month<br />\nFree trial period: 14 days<br />\n<i class=\"sui sui-check\" style=\"color: #00cc5f; font-size: 20px;\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10052/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><strong>Try Squarespace for free</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>“Build something beautiful” is right.

It can be hard to understand where exactly you are in the Squarespace editor. I kept getting notifications that I was editing demo content, or that I’d see the social logos once we connected our social media, or that we could unlock this or that feature with a paid subscription, but Squarespace didn’t go the extra step to make it easy to make that required move. It was a lot of fumbling through a beautiful interface, not exactly sure what changes were real, or where to head next. I also had some issues saving changes — an error message popped up and we had to move on, without our changes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41782\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Squarespace-website-builder-editor.png\" alt=\"Squarespace website builder editor and page selector\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Squarespace-website-builder-editor.png 1389w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Squarespace-website-builder-editor-300x181.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Squarespace-website-builder-editor-768x463.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Squarespace-website-builder-editor-1024x617.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1389px) 100vw, 1389px\" /><br />\n<em>Editing a site in Squarespace has a bit of a learning curve.</em></p>\n<p>Unlike IKEA, Squarespace is pricier than other website builders.

Below are the four most important ones in my analysis.</p>\n<p>Note: They might differ for you and your business&#8217;s needs. However, I find that these four elements tend to be the most important ones for most.</p>\n<p><strong>Ease of use.</strong> There should be no technical proficiency required and no need for a designer or other outside help. We asked ourselves, How easy it is to get started? And, how long does it take to build a nice looking site?</p>\n<p><strong>A professional high-quality final product.</strong> A professional, well-designed website that reflects your business. We asked, What do the templates look like? How customizable are those templates? Can I add an ecommerce option to sell things on my site? Can I add a menu? A form? A map? Reservations?</p>\n<p><strong>Customer support.</strong> We wanted to know that it&#8217;d be there if you needed it, but we also expect everything to be intuitive enough that you don’t feel like you can&#8217;t go it alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing.</strong> Pretty simple, but we didn&#8217;t just ask how much does it cost? We also asked, Which tier should a person start on and when will they need to upgrade? If it’s free, what’s the trade-off? Does it come with a free domain? Does it come with email addresses? Any other extras to be on the lookout for?</p>\n<h2>Recap: The best website builders for 2020</h2>\n<p>I like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><b>WordPress</b></a> for its ability to run just about any site you can think up.

No hoops to jump through either. They list their support number and live chat options right on their site, you can reach it within two clicks:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44192 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Contact_Us_-_Bluehost.png\" alt=\"Bluehost Review\" /></a></p> \n<p>Bluehost gives you a variety of different features that’s sure to fit your website’s needs too. For example, they have a great SEO tool that scores and tracks how well your website is ranking for specific keywords. This gives you a good idea of how you should optimize your site for the best search rankings.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-48017 size-large\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bluehost-seo-tools-1024x432.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bluehost-seo-tools-1024x432.png 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bluehost-seo-tools-300x127.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bluehost-seo-tools-768x324.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bluehost-seo-tools.png 1274w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p> \n<p>They also offer hosting that will support whatever direction your business grows.</p> \n<p>Let’s say you start with a standard shared hosting plan and want to install WordPress. They have an easy 1-click install to make that happen. Then if your site keeps growing and you want to upgrade to managed WordPress hosting to speed up your site and improve security, they have that too. Or if you want to get more control by upgrading to VPS or dedicated hosting, they have plans for both.</p> \n<p>The point is that Bluehost covers everything you could possibly need from a host. If you start with them, you’ll never need to switch to someone else.</p> \n<h3 id=\"dreamhost-review\"><strong>#2</strong><strong>.

Instead, DreamHost offers a completely custom control panel to manage your website.</p> \n<p>Many customers love it because it’s intuitive. The interface is also more user-friendly than cPanel.</p> \n<p>But it comes with a big caveat: It makes things much more difficult to migrate off DreamHost.</p> \n<p>Migrating to DreamHost is easier than ever though. The host introduced a free plugin that moves your WordPress site for you in just five steps. You’ll also be able to scale your hosting as your site grows.</p> \n<p>In addition to shared hosting and managed WordPress hosting, DreamHost offers low-cost upgrades to VPS and cloud hosting, as well as dedicated servers should you ever need them. Even their VPS plans start at $10/month:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44197 size-full\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DreamHost_VPS_Pricing.png\" alt=\"Dreamhost Cloud\" /></a></p> \n<p>DreamHost is another one of WordPress’s three recommended hosts, and includes some managed WordPress hosting in its basic shared plans. It also offers a managed plan with more bells and whistles called DreamPress. Monthly plans under $3/month are available if you pay annually, $8/month if you’d like to add email. It does have an industry-leading free trial period — a full 97-day money-back guarantee — and transparent pricing that doesn’t increase after your initial contract.</p> \n<p>Customer service is a little less traditional: email support is available 24/7, but live chat is only on during business hours. If you want technical support over the phone, you have to pay an additional $9.95. However, if you spring for either the DreamPress Plus or Pro managed WordPress plans, phone support is included along with other premium features.</p> \n<p>The free trial period is the longest in the business — 97 days. Shared hosting plans start at $2.59/month, and since DreamHost doesn’t do promo pricing, it won’t jump after your first contract is up. This is one of the lowest hosting prices out there, it’s a great option for anyone looking to save every dollar.</p> \n<p>What’s really worth noting is the outstanding offers DreamHost has for nonprofits: one free Unlimited shared hosting plan (which includes unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited sites, and email hosting) for 501(c)(3) organizations, plus a 35% discount on the souped-up DreamPress-managed WordPress hosting. That’s a fantastic deal.</p> \n<h3 id=\"hostgator-review\"><strong>#3.

So be prepared to get on the phone whenever you have a question.</p> \n<p>Unlike some hosts, Hostgator does include support in all its plans. If you want a hosting plan that’s cheap and includes support, this is the host for you.</p> \n<p>HostGator does offer Windows hosting in addition to Linux, as well as a variety of options to upgrade, including cloud hosting, VPS hosting, managed WordPress, and a dedicated server.

Don’t believe it? Try for yourself. InMotion’s 90-day free trial period for shared hosting is one of the longest around and gives you plenty of time to test out InMotion’s support team.</p> \n<p>InMotion’s plans are really straightforward and almost identical. As you upgrade, you’ll get faster servers and extra databases, websites, and subdomains. It’s a straightforward approach we like, especially for small businesses and websites that aren’t overly complex. No pushy upsells or confusing tiers to worry about.</p> \n<p>Even the entry-level plans have excellent customer support. It’s 24/7 via 5 communication channels: phone, chat, email, tutorials, and Q&amp;A, which were actively answered.</p> \n<p>I also appreciate that none of this support is hidden or hard to find. The phone number is broadcast at the top of the page and the chat support login is easy to find in your admin panel.</p> \n<p>There’s nothing more annoying than 24/7 support that requires you first unearth the contact methods on your own. It’s a waste of time and tells me exactly what I need to know about the host.</p> \n<p>I also appreciate that the support is available at your level — whether you’re just starting and need someone to walk you through the ultimate basics with a friendly and supportive demeanor, or you want someone who can talk specs and technical nuances like a pro, the InMotion support has you covered.</p> \n<p>InMotion also has some of the best VPS hosting options.

WordPress hosting is built into all of its shared hosting plans, you’ll get automatic updates, streamlined security, and expert technical support.</p> \n<p>SiteGround is widely considered to be a leader in shared hosting. Its servers are ultra-fast and extra secure, and SiteGround is constantly deploying new updates to keep them that way.</p> \n<p>While all its shared hosting plans are powerful, SiteGround is especially well-known for its highest-tier shared plan, GoGeek, which is suped up with tools developers will find especially useful, including a staging server and Git repo creation. Lots of small business and personal websites will probably find this overkill, but if your needs are more complex than the basics, SiteGround has a lot to love.</p> \n<p>There is one downside. Once you blow through SiteGround’s introductory pricing, your plan’s price will triple.</p> \n<p>For example, its lowest tier of shared hosting jumps from $4/month to $12 and its highest tier jumps from $12/month to $35. That doesn’t feel great.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SiteGround-Pricing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-46610\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SiteGround-Pricing-1024x796.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SiteGround-Pricing-1024x796.jpg 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SiteGround-Pricing-300x233.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SiteGround-Pricing-768x597.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SiteGround-Pricing.jpg 1172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, it was the reason for most of the one-star reviews on TrustPilot.

Most sites are small enough that they don’t need an entire server to themselves so web hosts bundle a bunch of sites together and put them all on the same server.</p> \n<p>This is how web hosts get the price of hosting down.</p> \n<p>In most cases, it’s a great deal.</p> \n<p>There are downsides. If one site on the server gets taken down, yours could get taken down too. If several sites are on the same server and one of those sites gets a huge traffic spike that takes the server down, all the sites go down. So it’s possible for your site to go down at no fault of your own.</p> \n<p>In practice, this rarely happens. Especially for smaller sites that can handle a little downtime every once in awhile, having shared hosting is a great trade-off in order to get the hosting bill lowered.</p> \n<p>Think of shared hosting as the ideal “entry-level” package for your site.</p> \n<p>So which hosting companies are the best for shared hosting?</p> \n<h4>These are the 5 best shared hosting companies:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a></strong></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10009/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>HostGator</strong></a></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dreamhost</a><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10009/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10302/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hostinger</a></strong></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10303/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>A2 Hosting</strong></a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"best-wordpress-hosting\">The Best WordPress Hosting</h3> \n<p>Blogs are one of my favorite ways to build traffic and customers. I’ve managed multiple sites with hundreds of thousands or millions of visitors per month.</p> \n<p>When it comes to blogs, WordPress is by far the best option for running the blog.</p> \n<p>These days, I always get managed WordPress hosting for my high traffic blogs. <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting-for-wordpress/\">Managed WordPress hosting</a> is a specialized hosting package built entirely around WordPress.</p> \n<p>There’s a few major advantages to getting specialized WordPress hosting:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Everything is streamlined around WordPress</li> \n <li>Security is extra tight</li> \n <li>WordPress updates and server maintenance happen automatically</li> \n <li>Backups happen automatically</li> \n <li>The support team has advanced knowledge of WordPress</li> \n <li>The site can handle much higher traffic volume since everything is built around WordPress</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There is one major downside though: the cost.</p> \n<p>Managed WordPress hosting tends to be more expensive. If you’re building a site with the goal to generate tons of traffic (50,000+ visitors/month), it’s absolutely worth it. I go this route even if I don’t have the traffic volume yet. As long as I’ve set a goal to build that traffic over time, I’ll choose a managed WordPress host from the beginning.</p> \n<p>What about smaller sites that want to use WordPress?</p> \n<p>In that case, skip the managed WordPress hosting. The premium features won’t provide enough value to justify the extra cost. Just about every host out there allows you to install WordPress easily and quickly.</p> \n<h4>Our 3 favorite WordPress hosts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10154/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WP Engine</a> </strong></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10005/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>SiteGround</strong></a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"best-small-business-hosting\">The Best Small Business Hosting</h3> \n<p>Any small business owner has a lot on their plate. Marketing, managing the service or product delivery, all the back-office tasks, it adds up.</p> \n<p>Resources are also limited so if something breaks, the owner has to fix it themselves.</p> \n<p>And on top of all that, they need to watch every dollar. Every extra dollar in an expense means one less dollar in their pocket.</p> \n<p>The best web hosts for small business are super reliable, have world-class support when the odd issue does come up, and have a reasonable price. This minimizes the extra tasks for the owner while also keeping expenses low. And when things do go wrong, a solid support team makes the fix as painless as possible.</p> \n<p>You’re looking for that sweet spot between price, reliability, and an amazing support team.</p> \n<h4>These are the 2 best small business web hosts that excel at all three:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a></strong></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10005/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>SiteGround</strong></a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"best-cheap-hosting\">The Best Cheap Hosting</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, you need to save money.</p> \n<p>Whatever the circumstances, there are ways to save on your hosting bills. And since they recur every month, getting them as low as possible does add up over time.</p> \n<p>I want to give you a quick warning though.</p> \n<p>On web hosts, cheap definitely isn’t always great. There is a point where reducing the costs any further seriously impacts the quality of your hosting. Your site will be down on a regular basis, you’ll never be able to get a competent support rep to help you, and every task you try to complete will have a horrendous user experience.</p> \n<p>We’ve found the best <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-cheap-web-hosting/\">cheap web hosts</a>. While their service isn’t quite as good as the others that we recommend, it’s good enough if you’re trying to get the cost down. Just be careful about shopping around for even cheaper deals, it’s usually too good to be true.</p> \n<h4>We recommend these 2 hosts if you’re trying to get your hosting costs as low as possible:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10302/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hostinger</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dreamhost</a><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10009/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></strong></li> \n</ul> \n<p>They’re also good for side projects or ideas that you’re playing around with. Then if it becomes a real project or business, you can always switch to one of the better hosts later.</p> \n<h3 id=\"best-cloud-hosting\">The Best Cloud Hosting</h3> \n<p>If you’re building a larger site or want to guarantee your uptime, you’ll want to look for <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-cloud-web-hosting/\">cloud hosting</a>.</p> \n<p>Cloud hosting is a bit different than shared hosting.</p> \n<p>Instead of a bunch of different sites using the same server, your site will get spread across multiple servers. This has a few major advantages:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Other sites can’t take your site down. If they get a spike, your server can simply start using other servers.</li> \n <li>You can quickly scale your site bandwidth up and down. Since you’re already using multiple servers, it’s really easy to add more or take some away.</li> \n <li>Since there’s redundancy across multiple servers, server uptime gets a lot better.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All these benefits do come with a higher cost. No matter which cloud host you choose, it will be noticeably more expensive than a shared hosting package.</p> \n<p>I use the 50,000 visitors rule. If my site has above 50,000 visitors a month or will in the foreseeable future, I move it to cloud hosting.</p> \n<p>Consider cloud hosting if you’re planning on building a large site or have a business that can’t afford any downtime whatsoever.</p> \n<h4>These are the 3 best cloud hosting companies:<a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10005/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dreamhost</a></strong></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10154/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>WP Engine</strong></a></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10005/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Siteground</a></strong></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How To Find The Best Host For You</h2> \n<p>Before diving into all the criteria on how to evaluate web hosts, I have some simple rules for you on picking your web host:</p> \n<p>1. If you plan on building a high traffic WordPress blog, get <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10154/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WP Engine</a>. The extra cost is well worth it. This is also a good option for folks that want to pay a little extra so they never have to worry about anything related to their hosting.</p> \n<p>2. For all other sites, get a web host that’s fast, has great uptime, and amazing support. <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10005/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Siteground</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10006/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InMotion</a> are your best bets here.</p> \n<p>3. If you really want to get the cost down, do with <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10302/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hostinger</a> or <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10009/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hostgator</a>. Both are decent at low prices. I wouldn’t consider hosts that are any cheaper than this though.</p> \n<p>By following these rules, you’ll be happy with the host that you get and won’t have to switch any time soon.</p> \n<p>So how do we evaluate web hosts? What actually matters?</p> \n<p>Let’s go through all the key items.</p> \n<h3>Site Uptime</h3> \n<p>If people can’t access your site, why have it at all?</p> \n<p>First and foremost, you want a web host with great uptime. This means you’re site is always available and never goes down.</p> \n<p>To try to avoid the “just trust us” promise of near-perfect uptime, most hosts provide some sort of guarantee of at least 99.9 percent uptime. However, that guarantee isn’t much of a guarantee. It just means your bill can be discounted in the event of any unplanned downtime. There’s a lot of fine print on these guarantees, too, including not accepting self-reported or third-party uptime data, and not providing refunds for downtime that was out of the host’s control (for example, a hurricane).</p> \n<h3>Site Speed</h3> \n<p>Site speed impacts everything related to your site. Want search rankings? Get a fast site. Want conversions on your site? Make it fast. Want happy users? Speed it up.</p> \n<p>Every part of your business is impacted by the speed of your site.</p> \n<p>When looking at different web hosts, make sure you’re choosing a host that can serve every page lickity split.</p> \n<p>There is some nuance with site speed.</p> \n<p>In the early days, you need a host that’s fast “enough.” It doesn’t have to be blistering fast but it needs to be fast.</p> \n<p>Think of Amazon. Back in the day when Amazon just sold books, their site needed to be fast but it didn’t need to be instantaneous.</p> \n<p>Now that many people use it for all their shopping, Amazon’s site can’t be fast enough.</p> \n<p>The bigger you get, the faster you’ll want to be. If you’re planning on building a high-traffic site, you’ll want a host that can maintain crazy-fast speeds on large sites.</p> \n<h3>Customer Support</h3> \n<p>When running your own site, web host customer support is the single most important thing a web host can offer.</p> \n<p>Digging through use reviews doesn’t always give you a conclusive answer on the quality of support at a particular web host.</p> \n<p>There can be a discrepancy between reviews and quality. Take, for example, HostGator. Technology publications tend to rank its products highly: it earns a score of 4.5 out of 5 on both <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/web-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CNET</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/316108/the-best-web-hosting-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PCMag</a>. But it has 1 and a half stars on <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hostgator.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trustpilot</a> and only 4 and a half stars on <a href=\"https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/hostgator/#top-reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WhoIsHostingThis</a> — and nearly all of negative comments are directed at customer service.</p> \n<p>Watch out for glowing reviews on top publications, they don’t always reflect reality.</p> \n<p>There is one true test for assessing the customer support quality at any host.</p> \n<p>The free trial customer support test.</p> \n<p>Pretty much every web host has some sort of money-back guarantee on their shared hosting plans, which means you can set up your website and see what you think of the service with relatively low stakes — just your time and any add-on fees you opt into, like paying for domain registration. We recommend going to town with customer support during that trial period. Get on live chat, open tickets, hop on the phone as much as possible to see if you like what you’re being served up.</p> \n<p>Most web hosts offer some sort of free trial period. I recommend using this time to really dig into your host’s customer support — its knowledge center and especially support staff across all channels. That’ll tell you the real story.</p> \n<h3>Traffic Volume</h3> \n<p>The amount of traffic that you get has a huge impact on the hosting that you need.</p> \n<p>For a site that gets 300 visitors every month, pretty much any standard hosting package will be good enough. As long as your web host has strong customer support, you’re good to go.</p> \n<p>As you get bigger, all sorts of small details start to matter a lot more.</p> \n<p>Is the PHP on your server being updated regularly? Do you have a CDN for your content?</p> \n<p>Is your site being backed up daily and can you restore it within 15 minutes if something goes wrong?</p> \n<p>Do you have an SSL certificate? Can your server handle a giant traffic spike during a marketing promotion?</p> \n<p>Whenever I have a larger site, I look for premium hosting that takes care of all this for me. And if I’m planning on building a large site, I look for a host that can easily scale to millions of visitors per month. I’m happy to pay a premium price in order to guarantee easy upgrades in the future.</p> \n<p>Don’t skimp if you’re going big.</p> \n<p>And if you plan to stay under 50,000 visitors/month, get a standard shared hosting package. There’s no reason to worry about the advanced stuff.</p> \n<h3>Price</h3> \n<p>While you don’t want to overpay on hosting, you definitely don’t want to underpay either.</p> \n<p>Avoid choosing a host exclusively on price.</p> \n<p>Most basic web hosting plans are in the $10-$20/month range. Yes, there are cheaper options. Some of them are promotional offers that go away at renewals. Others are hosting plans with terrible support and uptime.</p> \n<p>My rule is if the price sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p> \n<p>I also don’t worry about chasing promotional offers to save a few dollars. For every site I’ve ever managed, we used our host for years on end without ever switching once we had a host we were happy with. Promotional offers come and go pretty quickly.</p> \n<h3>Migration Features</h3> \n<p>The ability to easily and quickly migrate an existing site will save you weeks of time.</p> \n<p>Even a basic WordPress site can be a real hassle to migrate. First you have to set up a new WordPress install on your new host. Then you need to export the database of content from your old site and import it into your new one. Finally you have to re-configure everything in WordPress like the theme, plugins, and settings.</p> \n<p>That’s a real pain and that’s why we put together <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/the-simple-guide-to-moving-your-wordpress-site-to-a-new-domain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an entire guide on WordPress migration</a>.</p> \n<p>It is possible to skip all this.</p> \n<p>Some hosts will offer a 1-click migration for popular site builders like WordPress.</p> \n<p>If you’re switching hosts and handling the migration yourself, look for an easy migration feature. This is a great way to make the final decision once you’ve narrowed it down to a few final options.</p> \n<h3>Managed Hosting</h3> \n<p>Here’s how a normal host works:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>After you sign up, you get a login.</li> \n <li>The login takes you to cPanel. The cPanel is an app on your server that lets you manage it through a UI without needing to know how to code anything.</li> \n <li>You configure your server however you want.</li> \n <li>There’s a FTP option to upload files manually to your server.</li> \n <li>There are also quick options for installing WordPress and other site software if you want.</li> \n <li>You get full access and can do anything you want. It’s a “choose your own adventure.” Install WordPress, Drupal, Magento, or code your entire site by hand.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Most web hosts work like this.</p> \n<p>There are also managed web hosts. These hosts customize the hosting environment and manage a lot more of it for you.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10154/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WP Engine</a> is the best example, they’re a managed host for WordPress. Instead of getting a cPanel login that lets me do anything I want, WP Engine gives me a login to their custom interface that’s built to manage WordPress sites specifically.</p> \n<p>When a web host is optimized exclusively for WordPress, three key things happen. First: It gets faster than pretty much any shared hosting provider can dream of. Everything can be tailored to making WordPress work its best, whether that’s optimizing website caching or tinkering with the command line tools. The host only needs to know how to support WordPress, as opposed to, say, Joomla and a Node server and some sort of custom-made site and on and on.</p> \n<p>Second: Sites get more secure and stable. A managed WordPress host can build a system that predicts, accommodates, and patches all of WordPress’s vulnerabilities. That means fewer malicious attacks and less downtime.</p> \n<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly for small businesses: Admin and site maintenance get a lot easier. And that service is vital because managed WordPress hosting is significantly more expensive than shared web hosting services.</p> \n<p>While I give up some flexibility from not having a basic web server like other hosts, a managed host takes care of a lot of ongoing tasks that I’d normally have to handle myself.</p> \n<p>If you have a small business site, a normal host is fine. If you’re building a larger site, a managed host will save you a ton of time in the long run and is worth the extra cost.</p> \n<h2>Definitions: Shared, Virtual Private Servers, Cloud, and Dedicated Hosting</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-shared-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Shared hosting</b></a> means that you share space with a bunch of other sites on the same server. The advantage is that it’s a lot cheaper. The downside is that other sites can impact the performance of your site. If someone else gets a huge traffic spike, it could impact everybody on that server before the web host throttles their traffic.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-vps-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Virtual private servers (VPS)</b></a> also has multiple sites on the same server But these sites have dedicated space that’s managed by software. You get many of the benefits of having a dedicated server (you own IP address, less volatility in uptime, etc) without needing an entire server for just yourself. But the performance isn’t quite as good as having your own server to yourself.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-cloud-web-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Cloud hosting</b></a> is similar to VPS but instead of having space on once server, you get space across multiple servers. Like VPS, it’s resilient to traffic spikes from other sites. If a site on your same server takes that server down, your host simply moves your site to another server. That’s why they call it “cloud” hosting.</p> \n<p>It’s also extremely scalable for your own site. Adding more resources to your site is a breeze since your host only needs to increase the total server resources that you can consume at any given time. Because of these advantages, it does tend to be more expensive.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-dedicated-hosting-plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Dedicated hosting</b></a> gives you a server just for you. No one else gets space on that server. You’ll also be in complete control and can configure that server however you want.</p> \n<p>Which of these should you get? Here are some simple rules of thumb:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Small sites should be on shared hosting. Any impact from other sites on the same site will be minor. This is the best option for any site that does 50,000 visitors per month or less.</li> \n <li>When you get over 50,00 visitors/month, move towards cloud hosting and then a dedicated host if you really need it. Don’t worry about a dedicated host until spending thousands of dollars per month on hosting sounds like a rounding error in your annual budget.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Last Tip: Ignore Free Web Hosting</h2> \n<p>For just about everyone, free hosting is not worth it.</p> \n<p>Web hosting is not where you should save money. If you’re worried about the price of hosting, I’d say you need to worry about generating revenue and traffic before trying to save a few extra dollars cutting hosting costs.</p> \n<p>A free host is only good for something like an event one-pager or an extremely small, extremely low-traffic site. If you are doing either of those things, you should still skip the free host route and jump straight to a free website builder that’ll let you link your site to a custom domain for free, like <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10159/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">UCraft</a> or <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10158/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google Sites</a>. They’re both <i>very</i> basic limited builders, but they are easier to get up and running than a free web host.</p> \n<p>That being said, there are some great free and discount web hosting plans for nonprofits and educators. If that’s you and you want to know more, head over to my <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-free-web-hosting/#alternatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best free web hosts review</a>.

Promises of unlimited storage, bandwidth, and sites plus 5 email accounts, but so unprofessional I’d pass.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Educators and nonprofits often qualify for free (or deeply discounted) hosting by some truly excellent providers</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/?p=41747#alternatives\">Jump here</a> to read more.</p> \n<p>Let’s review the top five free web hosts.</p> \n<h2>The 5 Best Free Web Hosts</h2> \n<h3>Awardspace</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>1 site, 1GB storage, 5GB bandwidth</li> \n <li>No ads</li> \n <li>Domain registration</li> \n <li>Limited customer support ticketing, live chat, online documentation</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10026/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Awardspace</a></strong> is a big player in the free hosting space. For more than a decade, they’ve provided a great hosting service. It stands out for offering a full gig of storage, more than many others, and, according to a friendly sales rep we chatted with, up-to-date versions of PHP and MySQL. It also offers the Zacky drag-and-drop website builder, plus an easy-to-use WordPress and Joomla installer. Note: If your site receives no traffic for 12 months, it will automatically be set to inactive; after two more weeks of notices, it will be deleted.</p> \n<h4>More Awardspace specs</h4> \n<p>PHP 7.2, MySQL 5.7, 30MB database storage, 1 email account, no SSL</p> \n<h3>Atspace</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>1 site, 1GB storage, unlimited bandwidth</li> \n <li>No ads</li> \n <li>Domain registration</li> \n <li>Limited 24/7/365 customer support, live chat, limited ticketing, online documentation</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10027/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atspace</a></strong> has nearly identical stats to Awardspace, with the exception of unlimited bandwidth (as opposed to Awardspace’s 5GB) and a claim of 24/7/365 support. (Digging deeper, though, Atspace lists that support as “limited 24/7/365 support” so take that with a big fat grain of salt.) Atspace also uses the Zacky website builder and app installer for apps like WordPress and Joomla.</p> \n<h4>More Atspace specs</h4> \n<p>PHP 7.2, MySQL 5.7, 30MB database storage, 1 email account, no SSL</p> \n<h3>Freehostia</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>5 sites, 250MB storage, 6MB bandwidth</li> \n <li>No ads</li> \n <li>Domain registration</li> \n <li>24/7 customer support with 1-hour ticket response and online documentation</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10030/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Freehostia</a></strong> offers free cloud hosting on its Chocolate plan (your guess is as good as ours). That means it should be fast, but the Chocolate plan is also very small: only 250MB of disk space and 10MB of database storage. That said, it does include a free self-signed SSL certificate, a site builder with free templates, and the promise of a response to help tickets in under one hour — pretty much unheard of. If you have a small enough site, the customer service promise alone makes Freehostia a compelling pick.</p> \n<h4>More Freehostia specs</h4> \n<p>PHP&nbsp;4 / 5 / 7, MySQL 5, 10MB database storage, 3 email accounts, self-signed SSL</p> \n<h3>Agilityhoster</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>1 site, 1000MB storage, 5GB bandwidth</li> \n <li>No ads</li> \n <li>Domain registration</li> \n <li>Limited ticketing, live chat, online documentation (24/7 customer support for system malfunctions only)</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10028/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Agilityhoster’s</a></strong> free tier is slightly smaller than what’s offered from Awardspace and Atspace: only 1000MB of storage and one 20MB MySQL database. It also lacks any sort of website builder, although it does have a simple WordPress and Joomla installer to get you up and running quickly. A sales rep confirmed that it runs up-to-date PHP and MySQL.</p> \n<h4>More Agilityhoster specs</h4> \n<p>PHP 7.2, MySQL 5.7, 20MB database storage, 1 email account, no SSL</p> \n<h3>Byethost</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Unlimited sites, storage, and bandwidth</li> \n <li>No ads</li> \n <li>Domain registration</li> \n <li>24/7 customer support and knowledge base</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10029/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Byethost</a></strong> is by far the most generous free web host with unlimited sites, unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, and five email accounts. It also provides an automatic SSL on all domains, and includes a free site builder with templates. That said, Byethost is one of the least professional-looking hosts I looked at, with a poorly written website and enough vagueness that I wonder how unlimited its unlimited offerings actually are. Unless you think you need a lot of database space, I recommend going with a different free host.</p> \n<h4>More Byethost specs</h4> \n<p>PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0; unlimited database storage; 5 email accounts; self-signed SSL</p> \n<h2>Free Hosting for Ecommerce Sites</h2> \n<p>Selling products through a website that’s hosted for free isn’t easy. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t say this: if you’re serious about starting a business online, you need to run your ecommerce with Shopify. It’s the only contender in this space, and the subscription cost is well worth it.</p> \n<p>Most free sites don’t support ecommerce, and when they do, the experience is pretty limited.</p> \n<h3>Strikingly</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Sell 1 product on the free plan</li> \n <li>Custom domain costs additonal $24.95/year</li> \n</ul> \n<p>I was actually pretty surprised to find <strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10034/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Strikingly</a></strong>, a website builder that also offers built-in ecommerce on its free plan.</p> \n<p>The catch here is pretty big: You’ll be limited to selling one single product, and you’ll be limited to using a Strikingly.com subdomain. So, it’s ecommerce but it’s definitely no place to build an ecommerce business.

That’s why I included it at all. But, you already know how I feel about subdomains. (They are instant trust breakers for people who aren’t already convinced to buy from you.)</p> \n<p>Free online stores are a little easier to come by. The difference? Online stores are just the stores, without the bells and whistles of a full-fledged website. That means no blog, no additional content — just products.</p> \n<h3>Square</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Drag-and-drop editor, plus four customizable themes</li> \n <li>Supports custom domain name</li> \n <li>Transaction fee: 2.9% + $0.30</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10035/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Square</a></strong> is a powerhouse business that was originally best known for its point-of-sell credit card swipers found at every farmers market and craft fair. Its free online store hosts unlimited products and has decent functionality.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41755\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Square_Templates-e1542743137909.png\" alt=\"Square's free online store templates\" /><br /> <em>Square offers four customizable templates for its free online stores.</em></p> \n<h3>Ecwid</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>10 product limit</li> \n <li>Start Site supports custom domain name</li> \n <li>Transaction fee: Depends on payment provider (Ecwid supports 40 gateways)</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10037/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ecwid</a></strong> is a really interesting option. While it offers a free online store like Square (Ecwid calls it a “Starter Site”), Ecwid also offers a free online store <em>widget</em> with code you can insert into pretty much any platform your site is on from Wix to WordPress to Tumblr just like you’d insert a YouTube video. That widget also means you sell simultaneously on multiple sites.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41761\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-21-at-2.46.36-PM-e1542840619903.png\" alt=\"Image showing how you can embed an free Ecwid online store to any site.\" /><br /> <em>You can add an Ecwid online store to any website for free.</em></p> \n<h2>The 2 Free Website Builders with Free Hosting</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ucraft</a> —&nbsp;If you just need one page, Ucraft’s one-page site builder will get you online and looking professional for free with a custom domain.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10024/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Sites</a> — Google is a free site builder that can host a custom domain and is a good choice for something simple like a wiki.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Hands-down the easiest way for most people to get a website up and running is using a <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-website-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website builder</a>, where you can drag-and-drop content blocks and tinker around with customizable templates. Most website builders are only free if you use a subdomain (for example, our URL on a Wix subdomain would look like: quicksprout.wix.com), which is a dealbreaker for anyone who wants to run a professional-looking site. I don’t like it one bit.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p><strong>What’s a custom domain?</strong> A custom domain is what switches your url from www.MyBrand.WebHost.com to www.MyBrand.com. If you’re serious about your business, you need to use a custom domain —&nbsp;free subdomains just scream, “I didn’t pay for this,” which is like putting up a flashing sign that says BUYER BEWARE.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I have great news, though. There are two builders that host websites for free <em>and</em> connect to a custom domain. They are super simple and have limited functionality — but since super simple, limited websites are the only ones I recommend hosting for free, that’s not really a problem. The two that meet these criteria are <strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ucraft</a></strong> and&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10024/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Sites</a></strong>.</p> \n<p>If all you need is a super simple page — AKA the only kind of site that should run on a free host anyway — I recommend you try a free website builder that hosts custom domains, like Ucraft or Google Sites.</p> \n<p>Design limitations are probably the biggest downside to using a free website builder. If the templates available on Ucraft and Google Sites aren’t what you’ve envisioned for your site, the next easiest free option is to find a free template you like and pair it with a free web host. I may be beating a dead horse, but <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the best web hosting services</a> aren’t that expensive. We’re talking around $4/month for the initial contract. I think the price more than pays for itself in customer service, security, and speed.</p> \n<h3>Ucraft Review</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Drag-and-drop builder, plus customizable templates (although you can’t update fonts)</li> \n <li>Single page</li> \n <li>Supports custom domain</li> \n <li>Ucraft ad floats in bottom-right corner</li> \n <li>Upgrade for unlimited pages, more customization, and no ads for $6/month</li> \n <li>Ecommerce functionality starts at $14/month</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ucraft</a></strong> has a free plan for a single-page website that’s built with what it calls “elements.” An element is any individual piece of content: a title, a text block, a video, an image, an image gallery, a button. Ucraft’s free tier supports up to 50 basic elements, so that single-page website can hold a decent amount of content — just nothing too snazzy.<i></i></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41749\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UCraft_Templates-e1542741270924.png\" alt=\"Some of the customizable templates available from Ucraft website builder.\" /><br /> <em><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six of Ucraft’s 21 free templates, including a blank page for a completely customized site.</span></i></em></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41750\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ucraft_FloatingAd.png\" alt=\"Ucraft's floating footer ad\" srcset=\"https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ucraft_FloatingAd.png 437w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ucraft_FloatingAd-300x53.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\" /><br /> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A “Powered by UCRAFT” ad hovers in the bottom right corner of all free Ucraft websites.</span></i></p> \n<h3>Google Sites Review</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Drag-and-drop builder, plus limited customizable themes</li> \n <li>Unlimited storage</li> \n <li>Supports custom domain</li> \n <li>Google Sites ad in footer</li> \n <li>Integrates with GMail</li> \n <li>There are no upgrade options — this is everything</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10024/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Sites</a></strong> is your other option for a super simple free site. And when I say “super simple,” I mean it. There are only six versions of the same template to choose from, and a limited number of layouts to work in. It’s super basic. In fact, lots of Google Sites are used for basic things like internal wikis.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41752\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GoogleSites_Themes-e1542741563533.png\" alt=\"The six themes available on Google Sites\" /></p> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Sites offers one basic template in six simple themes.</span></i></p> \n<p>That said, Google Sites hosts as many pages as you want at no cost. It connects to your custom domain. It integrates with every other Google service, like Docs, Forms, and Slides. And it’s absurdly simple to use, especially if you’re used to working in Google products. If you already have a Google account, or are paying for GSuite for email hosting (which I wholeheartedly recommend), it’s a no-brainer.</p> \n<h2>Free Web Hosting Alternatives for Subdomain Sites</h2> \n<p>If you’re okay with a subdomain (as opposed to a custom domain) your options for free hosting increase. That’s because lots of great website builders offer freemium versions of their platforms when you use a subdomain — for example, our URL would be quicksprout.wordpress.com or quicksprout.wix.com.</p> \n<p>Obviously, a subdomain lacks the professionalism of a custom domain, and free versions of any website builder product or platform tend to be pretty stripped down. But if you’re interested in launching content quickly, subdomains offer a really low barrier of entry. Most can launch in just a few minutes. Even better, if you envision a more robust web presence in the future, starting for free on the platform you ultimately want to use means you’ll have everything already built. You’ll just need to upgrade.</p> \n<p>At the free level, these 3 are pretty comparable. They’ve all got an assortment of free templates or themes, an easy-to-use editor, limited storage, and ads for their service floating near the footer or in a bottom corner of the site. If you may eventually upgrade to a paid plan, check out <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-website-builder/\">our review of website builders</a>. I go into a lot more detail than I do here.</p> \n<h3>Weebly</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Drag-and-drop builder, plus templates</li> \n <li>500MB storage</li> \n <li>Weebly.com subdomain (yoursite.weebly.com)</li> \n <li>Displays Weebly ads</li> \n <li>Upgrade for custom domain, no ads, and ecommerce functionality: starts at $8/month</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The free version of <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10033/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Weebly</a> includes ads and a Weebly subdomain. You’ll be limited to 500MB of storage, but will have the full drag-and-drop builder plus templates. You can always start with the free version and upgrade later, though Weebly’s ads are pretty obvious.</p> \n<h3>Wix</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Drag-and-drop builder, plus templates</li> \n <li>500MB storage</li> \n <li>500MB bandwidth</li> \n <li>Wix subdomain (username.wixsite.com/siteaddress)</li> \n <li>Displays Wix ads</li> \n <li>Upgrade for custom domain, no ads, and ecommerce functionality: starts at $11/month</li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10032/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wix’s free plan</a> is a lot like Weebly’s — you’ll get 500MB of storage and a drag-and-drop builder with templates. But you’ll subsidize your free plan with ads and one of the most eggregious subdomains out there,&nbsp;username.wixsite.com/siteaddress. You have the option to start for free and upgrade at a later time.</p> \n<h3>WordPress.com</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Choose from free themes</li> \n <li>3GB storage</li> \n <li>Unlimited bandwidth</li> \n <li>WordPress.com subdomain (yoursite.wordpress.com)</li> \n <li>Displays WordPress ads</li> \n <li>Upgrade for custom domain and no ads: starts at $4/month</li> \n</ul> \n<p>I love WordPress, but typically recommend people go with WordPress.org, the self-hosted version. The fully hosted version does have a free subdomain plan with free themes, but you’ll be using a subdomain and displaying WordPress ads. To get rid of those elements, it’ll be $4 a month, or about the price of some of the best web hosts. I think it’s better to go the self-hosted route at that point.</p> \n<p><a name=\"alternatives\"></a></p> \n<h2>Best Free Web Hosting for Nonprofits and Educators</h2> \n<p>There are excellent — and extremely robust — free hosting options available for nonprofits and educators. These typically aren’t stripped-down versions, but full-blown <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/best-shared-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shared hosting plans</a> that are available for free, including custom domains, full technical functionality, and attentive customer support.</p> \n<h3>For nonprofits, I recommend DreamHost.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10050/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10038/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DreamHost</a></strong> offers one free Unlimited shared hosting plan (which includes email hosting) for 501(c)(3) organizations, plus a 35% discount on its suped-up DreamPress managed WordPress hosting. Both are killer deals.</p> \n<p>DreamHost is a really big name in web hosting. It’s one of our top picks for best web hosts for small businesses and is one of three recommended hosts by WordPress itself. Most of the other free web hosts for nonprofits don’t have nearly as strong of reputations, nor offer as robust free plans. This plan has unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, and you can host an unlimited number of sites.

SiteGround offers all the features and functionality of its StartUp Plan (including 24/7 support on chat, phone and ticket) to teachers for free with a SiteGround subdomain. SiteGround also discounts its hosting for students.

Check out my <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/inmotion-web-hosting-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InMotion hosting review</a> for more info on the hosting company.</p> \n<h4><strong>Weebly for Educators</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Drag-and-drop editor, plus templates</li> \n <li>Unlimited bandwidth and storage</li> \n <li>Includes 40 student accounts</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10046/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Weebly</a></strong> has a eductor-focused arm of its website builder business. It works just like Weebly for any small business or personal website, but is geared for educators. The edu-version of Weebly gives the option of publishing content to a custom domain, not a Weebly subdomain. It also skips all Weebly advertising.</p> \n<p>If you like the sound of Weebly and a website builder, check out WordPress’s version, <strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10047/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edublogs</a></strong>. Similarly, it offers an ad-free environment with class and student management functionality, edu-focused plugins, and an Edublog subdomain.</p> \n<h2>The Cons of Free Hosting</h2> \n<p>Like I mentioned above, I’m not going to dance around the fact that there are plenty of downsides to free web hosting. To make my recommendations for the best free host, which is definitely a title that’s relative to the niche, I took the following six criteria into consideration.</p> \n<h3><strong>Ads</strong></h3> \n<p>Some free web hosts stay afloat by selling ad space. We wanted to avoid those providers — no one wants random ads appearing in the middle of their content — and opted for hosts that support their free tier from sales of their paid hosting plans.</p> \n<h3><strong>Email hosting</strong></h3> \n<p>My recommendations offer at least one custom email address and free email hosting since that is one of the glaring things lacking from a free website builder. (Ucraft doesn’t offer email hosting at all and Google Sites only offers a custom email address if you pay $5/month for GSuite.) An email that’s attached to your website and domain name is great to have for one-off correspondences (plus looks pro on a business card), and a free web host provider’s email hosting is perfect for that.</p> \n<p>But be warned, your legit emails may be flagged as spam. Why? Free hosting is a hotbed for less-than-savory online activity, and your site might get lumped into a server of bad actors. In other words: spam filter activated. If you’re going to use your email a lot or for anything important — say for sending out a newsletter or for marketing promotions — we recommend upgrading to email hosting through a service like <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10049/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GSuite</a> or even a domain registrar like <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qsp10048/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Namecheap</a>, which sells email hosting starting at $10/year.</p> \n<h3><strong>Storage and bandwidth</strong></h3> \n<p>Free web hosting has famously low limits for both disk space and bandwidth. If you go over your limit, your site may get suspended or you may be automatically upgraded to a paid service. Even when providers like Byethost offer unlimited bandwidth and storage, it’s not infinite. Just like with a paid service, unlimited storage and bandwidth only last until you start negatively impacting the other sites on your server — and all hosts are extremely vague about how much traffic or storage is too much traffic or storage. Have a negative impact and your site may still be suspended or auto-upgraded.</p> \n<h3><strong>PHP and MySQL</strong></h3> \n<p>PHP is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s what apps like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal run on, and therefore what a lot of websites use. MySQL are databases those apps store information on. Your web host needs to support up-to-date versions of both.</p> \n<p>The problem: Most hosts don’t disclose the exact version of the PHP or MySQL they run. And even if these apps do work, there is a high likelihood that with any free host they are going to load slowly — a PHP application requires a lot more lift from what is probably an extremely burdened server. If you’re worried at all about page load time (and you should be — <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\">Google takes it into account</a>), we recommend limiting anything you build on a free host to a simple static HTML/CSS site.</p> \n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is database limitations. Every piece of software you want to use on your site requires a database to store its information. If you are running WordPress, it needs a database. If you’re running another app, it’s going to need its own database. Most free hosts impose a limit on the number of databases your site can access, and the amount of storage available in that database.</p> \n<h3><strong>SSL certificate</strong></h3> \n<p>Secure Sockets Layer encryption is what confirms a website is secure enough to receive sensitive data like credit card data and passwords. SSL certificates are the only way a site can do any sort of ecommerce at all, but <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google also considers it a factor</a> for where any site, ecomm or not, shows up in search rankings.</p> \n<p>Most free web hosts don’t offer a free SSL certificate; the ones that do tend to offer a “self-signed” SSL. <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/self-signed-ssl-certificate/258183/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Self-signed SSLs</a> are issued by servers, not by a certificate authority (Comodo, Digicert, Let’s Encrypt, etc). They offer the same level of encryption, but it’s not the standard version, so web browsers will still flag your site and issue a security warning to visitors.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41754\" src=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mozilla_SSL_Warning-e1542742763344.png\" alt=\"An unsecure connection warning from Mozilla\" /></p> \n<h3><strong>Customer support</strong></h3> \n<p>With any free host customer support is going to be limited, slow to respond, and not all that helpful. That’s just the way it is.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p><strong><em>A note on custom domain names and domain privacy:</em></strong> You can host a site with a custom domain for free, but you’re still going to have to purchase the domain name through a domain registrar. Lots of hosting providers have a domain registration arm of their business, but you can also purchase a domain anywhere and connect it to your free web host. No matter what, we recommend also springing for domain privacy, which keeps your personal information (including your phone number and physical address) from being listed on the WHOIS public database. Opt out, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@valgaze/this-is-what-happens-when-whois-data-is-made-public-60b419bc2e89\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you’ll be spammed like crazy</a> — at least for now. (Since the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018, domain registrars are “<a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/playing-game-guess-who-domain-name-dispute-process-post-gdpr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refraining from publishing this information</a>” to avoid liability. Others are retracting information to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbpgga/whois-gdpr-europe-icann-registrar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">avoid accusations</a> of selling information to spammers.)</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2>Recap: The Best Free Web Hosting (<em>If</em> It Makes Sense for You)</h2> \n<p>If you’re after free web hosting, you might really want the simplicity and ease of a free website builder. I’m impressed with both Ucraft and Google Sites which provide easy to use drag-and-drop templates and support custom domains. Yes, you’ll be limited in design and there will be some sort of “Powered by” ad in the footer on both. If those are deal-breakers, you probably do want web hosting.</p> \n<p>Any free host will have similar drawbacks: limited storage and bandwidth, potential for spam-flagging email, and limited customer support. Go with Awardspace for more storage (1GB), Atspace for 24/7/365 help, or Freehostia if your site is really small (under 250MB).</p> \n<p>If you’re an educator or nonprofit, you have a lot more — and better — options. SiteGround and InMotion Hosting, two of our very favorite web hosts, have excellent free plans for educators. So does website builder Weebly. And Dreamhost, another of our favorite web hosts, doesn’t charge nonprofits for one free Unlimited shared hosting plan.</p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a
