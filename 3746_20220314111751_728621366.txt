Rather than returning to his gun-toting roots, the Punisher has instead taken up leading the infamous Hand in their gruesome mission. As surprising as it may be to see the Punisher working alongside such cold-blooded killers, they have gone to incredible lengths to bring Frank into the fold, and they could very well change the course of his life for however much longer it lasts.</p><p><em>Punisher </em>#1 (by Jason Aaron, Jesus Saiz, Paul Azaceta, Dave Stewart, and VC's Cory Petit) has introduced Frank Castle to a whole new world compared to what he is used to. It has also shown readers exactly how Frank came to be the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/timeless-punisher-leader-hand-ninjas/\">current leader of The Hand</a>. After being violently confronted by a small army of Hand ninja in his home, Frank tore his way through them until he stood alone with the woman who brought this all down upon him. Rather than striking back against him, however, she instead offered Frank the one thing he has been aching for since he became the Punisher. The Hand hasn't just given Frank a second chance at having a family, they have brought Maria Castle back to life.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/punisher-jason-aaron-interview/\">Jason Aaron Puts the Marvel Universe in the Punisher's Hands</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/punisher-1-the-power-of-the-beast-.jpg\"/></figure><p>First seen in Gerry Conway and Tony DeZuniga's \"Death Sentence\" from the pages of 1975's <em>Marvel Preview </em>#12, Maria Castle was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/punisher-frank-castle-wife-maria-marvel/\">the loving wife of Frank</a> and mother to their son, Frank Jr., and elder daughter Lisa. Like their children, Maria was a victim of the tragic shooting that led to Frank becoming the Punisher. The fact that Frank has embraced her return despite all of the obvious red flags makes it all the more clear that he never recovered from the trauma of his family's death <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/punisher-love-rival-assassin/\">despite occasionally finding love since then</a>. It also paints a dark picture of what is to come, especially considering The Hand's own history with resurrection.</p><p>For all of the nearly two thousand years that The Hand has existed, their number one priority has always been to bring about the reign of their dark god on Earth. The Beast, the demonic entity worshipped by The Hand, is one of the most menacing figures the Marvel Universe has to offer. It may have also found a perfect host in Frank Castle, someone whose spirit has been deeply tainted by near-constant bloodshed. Normally, the Punisher could be expected to catch onto the fact that he is being shepherded towards a brutal future, yet Maria's presence seems to have completely clouded his judgment.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/punisher-frank-castle-wife-maria-marvel/\">Marvel's New Punisher Series Changes a Fundamental Part of Frank Castle's Story</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/punisher-1-maria-.jpg\"/></figure><p>As hard as it is to imagine that the Punisher would willingly walk towards literal damnation as part of someone else's master plan, that appears to be exactly what is unfolding under The Hand's guidance. There is always the chance that Frank is playing his new benefactors' own goals against them from the inside, though that would require putting himself through some serious emotional anguish along the way. Then again, if there is any Marvel hero who has come to terms with pain, it is absolutely Frank Castle. Hopefully, the relief he has found in The Hand won't be so much that he doesn't see the true threat coming his way. If so, Maria Castle might just be the death of him.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-punisher-maria-resurrection/\">The Punisher's Shocking Return Almost Happened Before - Until Frank Stopped It Himself</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    \n\n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 11:00:53 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/punisher-1-header.jpg","linkMd5":"0d4f78d8a487bae5f398530c377748e8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_1/2022/03/14/11-17-44-339_f53aea9d00e12280.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":91166,"destBytes":91166,"author":"John Dodge","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/punisher-1-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_1/2022/03/14/11-17-44-339_f53aea9d00e12280.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/punisher-1-the-power-of-the-beast-.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn2@2020_5/2022/03/14/11-17-51-204_1287e0cb133ee1e3.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/punisher-1-maria-.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_3/2022/03/14/11-17-50-820_fcd16bafc5c25074.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647256639657}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 19:17:19","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 19:17:19","feedId":3746,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 11:17:19 +0000","fetchMs":600,"handleMs":147,"totalMs":32620,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":100,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-001*","requestId":"ae112c29f4294d578f89af3878a38032_3746","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":254592,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":3,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":3,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx29":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:29:30","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:36:34","id":3746,"name":" CBR - Feed ","url":"http://www.comicbookresources.com/feed.php?feed=all","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/apple-icon-57x57.fcc95351.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn46@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-34-59-416_8ce38f8de2c4dd42.png","description":"Covering comics, movies, tv like no other in the world.
