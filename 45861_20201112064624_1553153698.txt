The shop is the home and business of the wizard Morlibint, a scholar who enjoys talking about magical theory only slightly less than thrilling fiction. Imagination, he insists, is the most wondrous magic of all. Morlibint is a middle-aged man with short, red hair and a perpetual scowl that quickly transforms into a smile when he identifies a fellow bibliophile. </p> \n   <p>Odd Stories is an excellent place for anyone seeking gripping novels, clever anthologies, or useful textbooks, and Morlibint is a valuable contact for any party. He’s happy to exchange spells with another wizard, sell arcane scrolls to adventurers, or buy rare tomes that heroes come across in their travels. He never accompanies adventurers on their quests, however, instead finding excitement in treasured books from the safety of his favorite fireside armchair.</p> \n   <br clear=\"all\"> <h4 style=\"color:purple\">Morlibint — Creature 4</h4> <p> <span style=\"color:plum\"><b>Unique, LN, Medium, Human, Humanoid</b></span><br /> Male human wizard</p> <p><b>Perception </b> +7<br /> <b>Languages </b> Aklo, Common, Draconic, Elven, Sylvan, Undercommon<br /> <b>Skills </b> Academia Lore +8, Arcana +12, Crafting +10, Diplomacy +8, Medicine +7, Nature +7, Occultism +10, Performance +8, Religion +7, Society +10<br /> <b>Str</b> 10, <b>Dex</b> 12, <b>Con</b> 12, <b>Int</b> 18, <b>Wis</b> 12, <b>Cha</b> 14<br /> <span style=\"color:plum\"><b>Items </b><em>minor healing potion</em>, scholarly journal compendium (fictional literature), <em>scroll of invisibility, scroll of knock</em>, spellbook,<em> +1 staff</em></span><br /> <b>AC</b> 21; <b>Fort</b> +11; <b>Ref</b> +9; <b>Will</b> +9<br /> <span style=\"color:plum\"><b>HP</b> 60</span><br /> <b>Speed</b> 25 feet</p> <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] <em>staff</em> +9 (two-hand d8); <b>Damage</b> 1d4 bludgeoning</p> <p><b>Arcane Prepared Spells</b> DC 21, attack +13; <b>2nd</b> <em>comprehend language, dispel magic, illusory creature</em>; <b>1st</b> <em>color spray, magic missile, unseen servant</em>; <b>Cantrips (2nd)</b> <em>dancing lights, daze, detect magic, mage hand, telekinetic projectile</em></p> <p><b>Focus Spells (1 Focus Point) (2nd)</b> <em>hand of the apprentice</em></p> <p><b>Call Bonded Item</b> [one-action] (concentration, conjuration, teleportation) Morlibint teleports his scholarly journal into his hand from up to 1 mile away.</p> <p><b>Drain Bonded Item</b> [free-action] (arcane) <b>Frequency</b> twice per day; <b>Requirements</b> Morlibint hasn’t acted yet on his turn; <b>Effect</b> Morlibint draws some of the power in his scholarly journal.

Morlibint searches through fictional accounts of the creature to find the answer, which might not be entirely accurate.</li> \n     <li>Morlibint has learned the location of a particularly valuable tome and offers the heroes both the opportunity to retrieve it (he only wants to copy a few pages from it) and hints about the curse the tome reputedly imparts on those who carry it.</li> \n    </ul>
