PMM has two main architectural components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>PMM Client &#8211; Client that lives on each database host in your environment.  Collects server metrics, system metrics, and database metrics used for Query Analytics</li>\n<li>PMM Server &#8211; Central part of PMM that the clients report all of their metric data to.   Also presents dashboards, graphs, and tables of that data in its web interface for visualization of your metric data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more details on the architecture of PMM, check out our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/concepts/architecture.html\">docs</a>.</p>\n<h2>Query Analytics</h2>\n<p>PMM Query Analytics (&#8220;QAN&#8221;) allows you to analyze MongoDB query performance over periods of time.  In the below screenshot you can see that the most longest-running query was against the testData collection.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72095 size-full\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM.png\" alt=\"Percona Monitoring and Management query analytics\" width=\"4412\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM.png 4412w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM-300x30.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM-1024x101.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM-200x20.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM-1536x151.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM-2048x201.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.31.19-PM-367x36.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4412px) 100vw, 4412px\" /></p>\n<p>If we drill deeper by clicking on the query in PMM we can see exactly what it was running.

This is a limitation of the MongoDB API in general &#8211; the drivers will send the request with perfect functional accuracy but it does not necessarily resemble what the user typed (or programmed).  But with an understanding of this, and focusing first on what the &#8220;command&#8221; field contains it is not too hard to picture a likely original format. For example the example above could have been sent by running &#8220;use mpg; db.testData.find({&#8220;x&#8221;: { &#8220;$lte&#8221;: &#8230;, &#8220;$gt&#8221;: &#8230; }).skip(0)&#8221; in the shell. The last &#8220;.skip(0)&#8221; is optional as it is 0 by default.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can see the full explain plan for your query just as you would by adding .explain() to your query.   In the below example we can see that the query did a full collection scan on the mpg.testData collection and we should think about adding an index to the ‘x’ field to improve the performance of this query.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72093 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.36.33-PM-614x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.36.33-PM-614x1024.png 614w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.36.33-PM-180x300.png 180w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.36.33-PM-90x150.png 90w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.36.33-PM-367x612.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-1.36.33-PM.png 876w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" /></p>\n<h2>Metrics Monitor</h2>\n<p>Metrics Monitor allows you to monitor, alert, and visualize different metrics related to your database overall, its internal metrics, and the systems they are running on.</p>\n<h3>Overall System Performance View</h3>\n<p>The first view that is helpful is your overall system performance view.   Here you can see at a high level, how much CPU and memory are being used, the amount of writes and reads from disk, network bandwidth, # of database connections, database queries per second, RAM, and the uptime for both the host and the database.   This view can often lead you to the problematic node(s) if you’re experiencing any issues and can also give you a high level of the overall health of your monitored environment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72106 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"4958\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM.png 4958w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM-300x21.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM-1024x72.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM-200x14.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM-1536x108.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM-2048x145.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.27-PM-367x26.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4958px) 100vw, 4958px\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72107 size-full\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM.png\" alt=\"Percona Monitoring and Management system overview\" width=\"4970\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM.png 4970w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM-300x31.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM-1024x107.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM-200x21.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM-1536x160.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM-2048x213.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.01.36-PM-367x38.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4970px) 100vw, 4970px\" /></p>\n<h3>WiredTiger Metrics</h3>\n<p>Next, we’ll start digging into some of the database internal metrics that are helpful for troubleshooting MongoDB.  These metrics are mostly from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/\">WiredTiger Storage Engine</a> that is the default storage engine for MongoDB since MongoDB 3.0.  In addition to the metrics I cover, there are more documented <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-wiredtiger-details.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The WiredTiger storage engine uses tickets as a way to handle concurrency, The default is for WiredTiger to have 128 read and 128 write tickets.  PMM allows you to alert when your available tickets are getting low.  You can also correlate with other metrics as to why so many tickets are being utilized. The graph sample below shows a low-load situation &#8211; only ~1 ticket out of 128 was checked out at any time.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72110 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-1024x255.png\" alt=\"Percona Monitoring and Management wiredtiger\" width=\"900\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-1024x255.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-300x75.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-200x50.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-1536x382.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-2048x509.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.05.53-PM-1-367x91.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>One of the metrics that could be causing you to use a large number of tickets is if your checkpoint time is high.   WiredTiger, by default, does a full checkpoint at least every 60 seconds, this is controlled by the WiredTiger parameter <em>checkpoint=(wait=60))</em>.  Checkpointing flushes all the dirty pages to disk. (By the way &#8216;dirty&#8217; is not as bad as it sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s just a storage engine term meaning &#8216;not committed to disk yet&#8217;.)  High checkpointing times can lead to more tickets being in use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72111 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-1024x240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-1024x240.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-300x70.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-200x47.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-1536x361.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-2048x481.png 2048w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-2.10.00-PM-367x86.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, we have WiredTiger Cache Activity metrics. WiredTiger Cache activity indicates the level of data that is being read into or written from the cache.  These metrics can help you baseline your normal cache activity, so you can notice if you have a large amount of data being read into the cache, perhaps from a poorly tuned query, or a lot of data being written from the cache.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72112

has database metrics that are not WiredTiger specific.   Here we can see the uptime for the node, queries per second, latency, connections, and number of cursors.   These are higher-level metrics which can be indicative of a larger problem such as connection storms, storage latency, and excessive queries per second.  These can help you hone in on potential issues for your database.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72114 size-large\"

Metrics</h3>\n<p>System metrics can point you towards an issue at the O/S level that may or may not correlate to your database.  CPU, CPU saturation, core usage, DISK I/O, Swap Activity, and Network Traffic are some of the metrics that can help you find issues that may start at the O/S level or below.  Additional metrics to the below can be found in our <a target=\"_blank\"

1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></span>Percona is pleased to announce the release of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/postgresql-distribution\">Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 13</a>. This release is available for immediate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/downloads/postgresql-distribution-13/LATEST/\">download</a> and includes all of the latest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html\">features</a> of PostgreSQL 13 Core Distribution.</p>\n<h3>Reduce Resource Usage</h3>\n<p>This release includes enhancements to existing features that deliver a more streamlined and optimized environment, helping you to reduce overall resource usage. This includes minimizing bloat with parallel Vacuum, which helps the Vacuum process to run more quickly and efficiently, improving the use of storage and improving performance. Deduplication of B-Tree indexes also helps save storage space by reducing the amount of storage needed for indexes. It also uses resources more efficiently during query with additional opportunities to benefit from partition enhancements. This means that your query processes less data and frees up resources.</p>\n<h3>Improve Response Times</h3>\n<p>With enhancements that deliver more efficient <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/09/10/index-improvements-in-postgresql-13/\">use of indexes</a> and smarter sorting capabilities, you can expect better overall performance and improved response times. This includes incremental sort which avoids sorting data that has already been sorted and delivering query results faster.  New partition wise joins break down a join between partitioned tables into joins between their partitions, resulting in smaller data volumes being processed more quickly. Improvements to GiST, SP-GiST, and GIN indexes, provide overall performance improvement and speed up query processing. There are also some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/10/01/postgresql-13-new-feature-dropdb-force/\">new PostgreSQL commands</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/09/30/postgresql_fdw-authentication-changes-in-postgresql-13/\">authentication changes</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are including a technical preview of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/10/14/announcing-pg_stat_monitor-tech-preview-get-better-insights-into-query-performance-in-postgresql/\">pg_stat_monitor</a>, a custom extension written by Percona.  This extension gathers and aggregates query performance data, enabling better and faster query analysis. It can be used alone, but its capabilities are best used when combined with the latest release of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a>. This enables you to easily analyze your PostgreSQL queries, using the pg_stat_monitor metrics, to quickly identify and remedy issues with scaling, bottlenecks, and potential outages.</p>\n<p>Percona is also planning to extend our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/services/managed-services\">Managed Services</a> offerings to include PostgreSQL early next year. This means that you will be able to have your MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Maria DB databases all managed by a single source. As always, we continue to provide <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/services/support\">support</a> for these open-source database products and offer professional <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/services/consulting\">consulting</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/training\">training</a> services.</p>\n<p>For more details on PostgreSQL 13, check out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html\">release notes from PostgreSQL</a>.
