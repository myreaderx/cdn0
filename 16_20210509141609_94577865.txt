Montgomery writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hummingbirds are the lightest birds in the sky. Of their roughly 240 species, all confined to the Western Hemisphere, the largest, an Andean “giant,” is only eight inches long; the smallest, the bee hummingbird of Cuba, is just over two inches long and weighs a single gram. </p>\n<p>Delicacy is the trade-off that hummingbirds have made for their unrivaled powers of flight. Alone among birds, they can hover, fly backward, even fly upside down. For such small birds their speed is astonishing: in his courtship display to impress a female, a male Allen’s hummingbird, for instance, can dive out of the sky reaching sixty-one miles per hour, plunging from fifty feet at a rate of more than sixty feet per second &#8212; and pulling out of his plunge, he experiences more than nine times the force of gravity. Adjusted for body length, the Allen’s is the fastest bird in the world.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73429\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?resize=680%2C1122&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1122\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73429\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?w=1100&#38;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?resize=320%2C528&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?resize=600%2C990&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?resize=240%2C396&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?resize=768%2C1267&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould3.jpg?resize=931%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 931w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pale-tailed Barbthroat Hummingbird by John Gould, 1861.

The camera captured what was far too rapid for the human eye to register, liberating the human mind to probe the physics beneath the phantasm. Montgomery observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hummingbirds are less flesh than fairies. They are little more than bubbles fringed with iridescent feathers &#8212; air wrapped in light.

Montgomery details the physiology and physics of their infinity-symbol hover wingbeat:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The upstroke as well as downstroke require enormous strength; every stroke is a power stroke. Like insects and helicopters, hummingbirds can fly backward by slanting the angle of the wings; they can fly upside down by spreading the tail to lead the body into a backward somersault. Hovering becomes so natural to a hummingbird that a mother who wants to turn in her nest does it by lifting straight up into the air, twirling, then coming back down. A hummer can stay suspended in the air for up to an hour.</p>\n<p>Hummingbirds are specially equipped to perform these feats. In most birds, 15 to 25 percent of the body is given over to flying muscles. In a hummingbird’s body, flight muscles account for 35 percent. An enormous heart constitutes up to 2.5 percent of its body weight &#8212; the largest per body weight of all vertebrates. At rest, the hummingbird pumps blood at a rate fifteen times as fast as that of a resting ostrich, and that blood is exceptionally rich in oxygen-carrying hemoglobin.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73435\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?resize=680%2C1191&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1191\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73435\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?resize=320%2C561&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?resize=600%2C1051&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?resize=240%2C420&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?resize=768%2C1346&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greentailedhummingbird.jpg?resize=877%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 877w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Green-tailed Hummingbird by William Swainson, 1841.

If a human were to sustain the activity level of a hummingbird, they would have to consume 155,000 calories per day &#8212; nearly 80 times what the United States government recommends for an average adult &#8212; and would ultimately self-combust as their body temperature rises to 370 degrees Celsius, or around 700 Fahrenheit. Montgomery furthers the marvelous mathematics of equivalency: </p>\n<blockquote><p>To fuel the furious pace of its life &#8212; even resting, it breathes 250 times a minute, and its heart pounds at five hundred beats per minute &#8212; a hummer must daily visit fifteen hundred flowers and eat six hundred to seven hundred insects. If the nectar alone were converted to its human equivalent, that would be fifteen gallons a day.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73434\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?resize=680%2C1115&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1115\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73434\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?resize=320%2C524&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?resize=600%2C983&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?resize=240%2C393&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?resize=768%2C1259&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mangohummingbird.jpg?resize=937%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 937w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mango Hummingbird (young) by William Swainson, 1841.

With her spare poetics, Montgomery offers an admonition radiating an invitation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today, perhaps more than ever before, we thirst for community; we hanker for transformation; we long to reconnect with the incandescence of life. We need to make those inner journeys. But what if there are no bees or butterflies or hummingbirds to accompany us? It’s a growing possibility.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73431\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?resize=680%2C1127&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1127\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73431\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?w=1100&#38;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?resize=320%2C530&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?resize=600%2C994&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?resize=240%2C398&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?resize=768%2C1273&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hummingbird_gould1.jpg?resize=927%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 927w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rufous-breasted Hermit Hummingbird by John Gould, 1861.
