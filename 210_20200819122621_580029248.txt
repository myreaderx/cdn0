It allows you to have a business number and a personal number on the same device and you can use two carriers to make sure you always have coverage. They're a common thing in many parts of the world, but rare for phones marketed to the United States.</p>\n\n<p>You might think that these reasons sound great and are wondering why you can't just head to the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-reaches-major-merger-milestone-officially-retires-sprint-brand\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">T-Mobile store</a> and grab a new <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Galaxy Note 20</a> that's dual-SIM capable. You're not alone. It all boils down to two things — an actual need and the fact that U.S. carriers don't like the idea.</p>\n\n<h2>The U.S. mobile market is different</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/why-dont-we-see-very-many-dual-sim-phones-us\" title=\"Dual-SIM phones are amazing, but in the U.S., carriers hate them\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/verizon-coverage-map.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the States, there are <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-sprint-faq\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">three nationwide carriers</a> as well as many smaller regional carriers that mostly piggy-back on them. These are fully private (and largely unregulated when it comes to business practices) companies even though they often receive federal funding for expansion and maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>The actual geography of the U.S. is different, too. Here in the U.S., you'll find huge areas of little or no population but these places still have service for the most part. We've all been to dead spots, but you can usually get a signal from at least one carrier everywhere you'll ever go. Carriers use this as a reason to charge so much more than the rest of the world when it comes to a cell phone plan, and we can't say they're wrong — maintaining a network where nobody lives to use it and pay for it means the rest of the country gets to pay more.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull left\">\n  <p>The U.S. is different (and weird) when it comes to the mobile market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many parts of the world aren't like this. Throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America you'll find things like small regional independent carriers, places where they are no coverage and no plans to expand to include it, and highly regulated government-backed companies that provide cell service.</p>\n\n<p>This helps keeps costs lower and makes a dual-SIM phone something many people actually need. You can drive or take a train for just a few hours and end up somewhere that you would be roaming or even a place where your service <em>can't</em> work because it's government-sponsored for a specific region. You'll also need a satellite phone for many places, which is something we don't have to worry about.</p>\n\n<p>This will be a very unpopular opinion, but because the U.S. has nationwide coverage from most carriers and because service is so expensive, we don't <em>need</em> dual-SIM phones. I've used one and they can be really handy, but options like <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-voice-excellent-features-finally-work-google-fi\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Google Voice</a> can do the same thing. This opinion would be different if roaming was still a big thing or if the government decided Verizon could only work in a few specific states. We might want to see dual-SIM phones in those cases, but we don't really need them unless we do a lot of international travel or live close to the border with Canada or Mexico.</p>\n\n<h2>Your phone was built for a carrier</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/why-dont-we-see-very-many-dual-sim-phones-us\" title=\"Dual-SIM phones are amazing, but in the U.S., carriers hate them\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/04/t-mobile-ceo-mike-sievert.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Another thing that's common in the U.S. but not so much in the rest of the world is how we buy our phones — directly from a carrier through a service contract or a financing option.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull right\">\n  <p>In the U.S., most high-end phones are sold to carriers, not consumers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That means Samsung, for example, makes phones for marketing in the States the way carriers like them to be made because the carriers are its actual customer. Luckily, most of the things the carrier wants to see are the things we like to see: big bright screens, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-every-us-city-5g-coverage-right-now\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">fast network speeds</a>, and extras like waterproofing or <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">wireless charging</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things the carriers <strong>do not</strong> like is dual-SIM capability. When you buy a phone from Verizon or T-Mobile, you pay them for it but they did not get it for free. A carrier makes most of its money by selling you service, so giving you the ability to buy a phone and use another company for cell service cuts into the bottom line.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull left\">\n  <p>Carriers care more about locking you in that selling you a phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also why carriers used to only sell locked phones and fought so hard against eSIM technology — both make it easy to buy a new phone and use it somewhere else and it means you might not have to buy a new phone if you switch. Carriers love nothing more than keeping a customer locked in year after year and getting that $100 or more you spend every month.</p>\n\n<p>Since most people don't switch carriers, this system works for the most part. Even business travelers will often just buy an international roaming package from their carrier and not care about having a dual-SIM phone unless they visit a place like China where network bands are very different.</p>\n\n<h2>You can find them if you look for them</h2>\n\n<p>Dual-SIM phones are available in the U.S. even if they aren't very well advertised. You'll find them <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">unlocked</a> on places like Amazon or eBay from many different manufacturers. With eSIM technology, where a virtual SIM card can be downloaded from a carrier, phones like the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review-6-months\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Google Pixel 4</a> are also dual-SIM capable.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull right\">\n  <p>You can find dual-SIM phones if you go looking for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can also buy a phone directly from its manufacturer and get a dual-SIM model that works with U.S. carriers, though that may mean you're paying full-price all at once. <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUnU92704YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-note20-5g%2Fbuy%2F&amp;token=9TpOUuvj\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Samsung</a> and <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinmid%3D10855%26awinaffid%3D103504%26clickref%3DUUacUdUnU92704YYr%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.oneplus.com%252Foneplus-8-pro%253Ffrom%253D8pro&amp;token=1795mAvk\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">OnePlus</a> are great options for this.</p>\n\n<p>Most people in the U.S. don't need a dual-SIM phone, but life is boring if you can only have what you need. If you really do need one, or just want one, you still have options.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block best-award\">Best dual-SIM phone</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">OnePlus 8 Pro</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/why-dont-we-see-very-many-dual-sim-phones-us\" title=\"Dual-SIM phones are amazing, but in the U.S., carriers hate them\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/04/oneplus-8-pro-black-front-render.png?itok=piMKD2vt\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">More expensive, more capable.</p>\n\n<p>The OnePlus 8 Pro is an impressive and well-designed Android smartphone that's also dual-SIM capable.

Assuming you're OK with the high price and exclusivity to Verizon Wireless, it's 2020's sleeper hit.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Premium for less</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Motorola Edge</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-vs-motorola-edge\" title=\"Motorola Edge Plus vs. Motorola Edge: Which should you buy?\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/07/motorola-edge-render-no-clock-cropped.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-256GB-Camera-Solar/dp/B08B9SGGRS?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU92674YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$700 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"pros\">Pros</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Curved display is stunning</li>\n<li>AMOLED screen with 90Hz refresh rate</li>\n<li>Excellent performance</li>\n<li>Long-lasting battery</li>\n<li>Unlocked for all carriers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 class=\"cons\">Cons</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bad cameras</li>\n<li>No wireless charging</li>\n<li>Cheaper build</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"end\">The goal of the Motorola Edge is simple — offer 80% of the Edge+ experience for hundreds of dollars less and make it unlocked for all U.S. carriers. Using the Motorola Edge is a joy, as it has the exact same display, great performance, and top-notch battery life of the Edge+. You need to put up with some pretty mediocre cameras and no wireless charging in exchange for that lower price, but depending on your budget, it could be the better buy.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Motorola's Edge series of phones marks its return to the flagship space, and with both the Edge and Edge+, the company has crafted two <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">very good Android phones</a>. The Edge+ is the best of the duo, offering the highest-end specs and most premium experience currently offered by Motorola. Compared to the regular Edge, you benefit from a more capable processor, vastly better cameras, and extra goodies like wireless charging and a metal design. You make a few compromises here and there with its less expensive sibling, but the day-to-day experience of using the Edge feels almost as good as the Edge+ while costing considerably less money.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Motorola Edge+ vs. Edge <em>Price and availability</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-vs-motorola-edge\" title=\"Motorola Edge Plus vs. Motorola Edge: Which should you buy?\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/04/motorola-edge-plus-review-11.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Motorola Edge+ and Edge have a lot in common, but when it comes to the phones' pricing and availability, this is where we see some of the biggest differences. The Edge+ is the most expensive of the two devices with a retail price of $1,000, whereas the Edge costs considerably less at just $700.</p>\n\n<p>Even more important is <em>how</em> you're able to buy the two phones. The cheaper Motorola Edge is sold as a universally unlocked smartphone, meaning it's compatible with every U.S. carrier. Whether you have AT&amp;T, Sprint/T-Mobile, Verizon, or any smaller wireless provider, the Motorola Edge should work without a hitch.</p>\n\n<p>Comparatively, the Edge+ is a Verizon exclusive in the U.S. and can only be used on the Verizon network. That greatly limits the potential audience for the phone, and at the end of the day, is ultimately one of its biggest weaknesses.</p>\n\n<h2>Motorola Edge+ vs. Edge <em>Where the Edge+ comes out ahead</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-vs-motorola-edge\" title=\"Motorola Edge Plus vs. Motorola Edge: Which should you buy?\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/04/motorola-edge-plus-review-24.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The high price and limited availability of the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Motorola Edge+</a> is certainly a bummer, but if you're already a Verizon customer and can stomach its cost, there's a <em>lot</em> to like about the phone. It all starts with that display, which is downright stunning. The Edge+ treats you to a 6.7-inch OLED screen with a crisp 2340x1080 resolution, along with a buttery smooth 90Hz refresh rate. This all comes together with the drastically curved edges, which flow over the sides of the phone like a waterfall. This design makes the Edge+ instantly stand out, and when paired with the sturdy metal construction, you end up with one gorgeous-looking phone.</p>\n\n<p>Flipping the Edge+ over and looking at the camera system, you'll find the best set of cameras Motorola has ever put in a phone. The 108MP primary camera is the star of the show, and it's joined by a 16MP ultra-wide/macro camera, 8MP telephoto camera, and a time-of-flight sensor for capturing more data with your images. The Edge+ takes very good photos, and while they might not be as flawless as shots taken with a Pixel 4 or Galaxy S20, it's still a trusty device for preserving memories wherever you go.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood, the Edge+ continues to impress. It's powered by the flagship Snapdragon 865 processor, a healthy 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for saving all of your digital files. The 5,000 mAh battery allows for great endurance, and thanks to both 18W wired and 15W wireless charging, it's easy to refuel the phone whenever you need to.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is backed up by Motorola's software experience, which is one of the best that Android has to offer. Motorola's take on Android is one of the best that's out there, as it preserves the clean aesthetic of stock Android while adding genuinely helpful features where they matter. The phone is also backed by a promise of at least two major OS updates, which is better than what we usually see from the company.</p>\n\n<table class=\"spec-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th></th>\n  <th>Motorola Edge+</th>\n  <th>Motorola Edge</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td>Operating System</td>\n  <td>Android 10</td>\n  <td>Android 10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Display</td>\n  <td>6.7-inch <br> OLED <br> 2340 x 1080 <br> 90Hz</td>\n  <td>6.7-inch <br> OLED <br> 2340 x 1080 <br> 90Hz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Processor</td>\n  <td>Qualcomm Snapdragon 865</td>\n  <td>Qualcomm Snapdragon 765</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Memory</td>\n  <td>12GB RAM</td>\n  <td>6GB RAM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Storage</td>\n  <td>256GB</td>\n  <td>256GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Rear Camera 1</td>\n  <td>108MP primary camera <br> f/1.8 <br> OIS</td>\n  <td>64MP primary camera <br> f/1.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Rear Camera 2</td>\n  <td>16MP ultra-wide/macro camera <br> f/2.2</td>\n  <td>16MP ultra-wide/macro camera <br> f/2.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Rear Camera 3</td>\n  <td>8MP telephoto camera <br> f/2.4 <br> OIS</td>\n  <td>8MP telephoto camera <br> f/2.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Rear Camera 4</td>\n  <td>Time-of-flight sensor</td>\n  <td>Time-of-flight sensor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Front Camera</td>\n  <td>25MP <br> f/2.0</td>\n  <td>25MP <br> f/2.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Battery</td>\n  <td>5,000 mAh</td>\n  <td>4,500 mAh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Charging</td>\n  <td>18W TurboPower wired charging <br> 15W wireless charging <br> 5W wireless power sharing</td>\n  <td>18W TurboPower wired charging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>5G</td>\n  <td>Sub-6 <br> mmWave</td>\n  <td>Sub-6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Carrier Support</td>\n  <td>Verizon</td>\n  <td>AT&amp;T <br> T-Mobile <br> Verizon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Dimensions</td>\n  <td>161.07 x 71.38 x 9.6mm</td>\n  <td>161.64 x 71.1 x 9.29mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Weight</td>\n  <td>203g</td>\n  <td>188g</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Motorola Edge+ vs. Edge <em>What the regular Edge does well</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-vs-motorola-edge\" title=\"Motorola Edge Plus vs. Motorola Edge: Which should you buy?\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/07/motorola-edge-review-4.jpeg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It's no secret that the Edge+ is the better of the two phones, but that's not to say that <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">the regular Edge</a> is bad. It looks and feels just like the Edge+ in so many regards, making it a really enticing option if you don't feel like spending $1,000 on your next phone (or if you use a carrier other than Verizon).</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the Motorola Edge is its display. It has the exact same display as then Edge+, curves and all. Motorola didn't compromise the screen panel, resolution, or refresh rate, which is quite a feat considering the Edge's lower price. The internal specs are also very good, with the Edge touting a very fast Snapdragon 765 processor, 6GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a generous 4,500 mAh battery.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest downsides to the Edge, however, is its camera system. It's possible to take decent photos with the phone, but overall image quality leaves a lot to be desired. Images are often soft, low-light photography is quite weak, and the camera app itself is often slow/unresponsive where the rest of the phone's performance is just fine. It's a serviceable set of cameras if all you're doing is posting super casual photos on Twitter and Instagram, but if you want to do anything beyond that, the Edge+ is the better fit.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a step down on the software side, as Motorola is only promising one major OS update for the Edge. That means once the phone is updated from Android 10 to Android 11, it won't see any further Android versions. Motorola has had a long struggle with offering good software support for its phones, but only getting a single update for a $700 smartphone is pretty ridiculous.</p>\n\n<h2>Motorola Edge+ vs. Edge <em>Two solid choices</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-vs-motorola-edge\" title=\"Motorola Edge Plus vs. Motorola Edge: Which should you buy?\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/07/motorola-edge-review-7.jpeg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Motorola has been kicking out rock-solid <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">budget phones</a> for years at this point, and as much as we've enjoyed those, it's exciting to see the company return to making legitimate flagships. There was some hesitation leading up the debut of the Edge series, but Motorola has proven that it still has the chops to compete in this space.</p>\n\n<p>The Edge+ is marred by a fairly high price and its exclusivity to Verizon, but the fact that those are its two biggest issues is impressive. Whether it be the phone's display, specs, software, or design, just about everything with the Edge+ works incredibly well. It's a unique alternative to something like the Galaxy S20, and for a first attempt at returning to high-end devices, we're thrilled with how the Edge+ turned out.</p>\n\n<p>For shoppers that do have an issue with the Edge+'s price and availability, the unlocked and more affordable Edge is a great companion to it. You get a plastic body instead of metal, the cameras aren't as good, and there's no wireless charging, but the rest of the experience is every bit as nice. The Motorola Edge has a gorgeous display, is plenty fast, and has an identical software experience that's a joy to use. There aren't a lot of phones competing in this \"value flagship\" space, but we're thrilled that Motorola decided to throw its hat into the ring.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">True flagship</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Motorola Edge+</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-plus-vs-motorola-edge\" title=\"Motorola Edge Plus vs. Motorola Edge: Which should you buy?\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/04/motorola-edge-plus-cropped.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The best Moto phone you can buy</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUnU92674YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-motorola-edge-plus%2Fp&amp;token=S6uteCi9\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$1,000 at Motorola</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">High price and annoying availability aside, the Motorola Edge+ is a fantastic flagship smartphone that's worth your attention.

For one thing, it has full-area surface cover. There's also a carrier for your pressure pen and a thinner border so there's a larger drawing surface. It also has an 8GB microSD card built in, which you can use for storage.</p>\n\n<p>You'll also get a carrying case and a glove to help you reduce the friction between your hand and the tablet. The tablet works with Windows 7 or later and Mac OS 10.11 or later. It's also easily compatible with a wide range of art programs including popular software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, Corel Painter, Gimp, and more.</p></div></div></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 12:06:10
