The first and third Age titles were both fine games, of course, as was their stoner cousin Age Of Mythology. But it was AoE2 that would be enshrined as one of the all-time RTS greats, and it&rsquo;s the inevitable benchmark against which AoE4 will be measured, when it launches later this year. Just the twenty-year fug of strategy dad nostalgia surrounding the series would have been a significant enough headwind for AoE4 developers Relic Entertainment to release into. But thanks to a belting remaster of AoE2 in 2019, the old bruiser is somehow once again the RTS of the day, complete with brand new expansions, lashings of fresh esports, and the largest player base it has ever had. \n</p>\n<p>Launching a new Age game now has the air of a prince giving a nervous funeral speech, where he promises to exceed the glories of his father&rsquo;s reign, even as the king&rsquo;s body casually bench-presses a horse from the coffin next to him. How do you supplant a game whose star still seems to be rising? Change too much, and you&rsquo;ll be beasted for fixing what wasn&rsquo;t broken. Change too little, on the other hand, and you&rsquo;ll be castigated for not fixing the broken bits. It&rsquo;s a hell of a balancing act, for sure. And yet, after watching the footage from today&rsquo;s Fan Preview event, and speaking with the folks at Relic, they look well in reach of pulling it off. </p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/preview-age-of-empires-4-looks-like-its-got-the-right-balance-between-old-and-new-and-elephants\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=_0slhNgEaSo:hoEREF-YpT8:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=_0slhNgEaSo:hoEREF-YpT8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/_0slhNgEaSo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 16:30:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/age_of_empires_4_preview2.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/age_of_empires_4_preview2.jpg","linkMd5":"fd7b26c87e1cca768ca7e518285b50d9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn17@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-43-36-285_80e2b89ba55c4d35.webp","destWidth":1692,"destHeight":950,"sourceBytes":254342,"destBytes":177206,"author":"Nate Crowley","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/age_of_empires_4_preview2.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/age_of_empires_4_preview2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn17@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-43-36-285_80e2b89ba55c4d35.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-20-691_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-20-612_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/_0slhNgEaSo":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245815001},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:35","title":"What are we all playing this weekend?","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-140","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/wappwapwpapwap.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/wappwapwpapwap.jpg\" /> <p>Maybe this is because I try hard to ignore it, but did this April Fool's Day seem a quiet one?

The theory was beautiful. In order to buy into breeding programmes for high-profile endangered species, players first had to prove their credentials with the husbandry of more mundane beasts. By trading healthy, happy animals with other player zoos, it was supposed, folks could work their way gradually towards the purchase of prestigious creatures like pandas, gorillas and &lsquo;phants. </p>\n<p>Inevitably, however, players gamed the living crikey out of the market, and - <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/planet-zoo-is-temporarily-a-game-about-mass-producing-knackered-warthogs\">as I documented at the time</a> - the wheels fell off with a resounding clang. Early birds hoarded orangutans and the like in vast sheds from the word go, driving most animals into stratospheric price positions, and trapping the vast majority of the playerbase in a reeking purgatory of ostriches, warthogs and peafowl. The only way out of this monotony was through quite literal brute force: by creating zoos that were little more than sprawling factories, churning out hundreds of inbred, genetically bungled animals in the desperate hope of one day being able to afford a mediocre crocodile. </p>\n <p><a
