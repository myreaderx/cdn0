There's no free car parking at the office and all the other parking is either expensive or out of town. I've cycled for the past couple of weeks and found it quicker than driving. This includes the time it takes for me to take a shower at work. Speaking to my colleagues they can't get their heads round why I'd do this when I have a car.<br>\n<br>\n我上班路程不到10英里，每周需要在办公室呆两天。办公室那边没有免费停车场，其他停车场要么很贵，要么在镇外。过去几周我都是骑自行车，发现这比开车快，还包括洗澡的时间。我和同事们说，他们无法理解我都有车了为什么还要骑自行车。\n                                                                \n                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    I'm not a some insulate Britain eco warrior, I'm a tight northerner who feels like I've stumbled on the money and time saving holy grail.<br>\n<br>\n我并不是什么英国环保斗士，我是保守的北方人，我觉得自己偶然发现了省钱省时的方法。\n                                                                \n                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    For those that have a short commute that you normally take solo to a regular place of work what puts you off cycling?<br>\n<br>\n对上班路程短，通常一个人去固定地点上班的人来说，是什么让你不骑自行车上班？<br>\n\n                                                                \n                            </div><br>\n                                                                        </div>\n                    <div class=\"post-tip\">评论翻译</div>\n                    <div class=\"post-comment content\">\n                                                                                <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    SmallRaffe<br>\nDrivers. A lot of people I know commute by bike; most of them tell stories about being actually clipped by vehicles and other near misses. Most tell me that they’ve been in an incident at least once a year. Sadly, in the car vs cyclist fight, the soft fleshy one loses. Cuts and scratches aren’t great, but I’ve known people to have broken limbs and in once case, life altering injuries. I’d consider cycling but only on a dedicated cycle lane away from traffic.<br>\n<br>\n因为各种司机。我认识很多骑自行车上下班的人，他们不少人讲述了被车辆和其他险情碰到的故事。他们告诉我每年至少发生一次事故。可悲的是，在汽车与自行车的碰撞中，柔软的肉体总是输的一方。刮伤和擦伤还不严重，但我知道有人四肢骨折，有一例受的伤让他的生活都改变了。我会考虑骑自行车，但只在远离交通的专用车道上。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Inabitdogshit<br>\nThanks for the reply, drivers are my main concern. Where I am the cycle lane and protection is fairly good so I am lucky. Also it appears fairly quiet at the moment with people still working from home.<br>\n<br>\n感谢你的回复，司机也是我主要担心的问题。我所在的自行车道防护相当不错，所以我很幸运。另外，现在很多人还是在家工作，所以路上相当安静。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    snugasabugthatssnug<br>\nIf you don't already have one, get a camera for your bike. If anything does happen, at least you'll have a bit of evidence.<br>\nAnd you could do what in my dad did - upload near misses and bad driving to YouTube (though he didn't end up with many subscribers... His most watched video is him cycling into a hedge).<br>\n<br>\n如果你的自行车还没有摄像头，买一个吧。如果真的发生了什么，至少你能有些证据。<br>\n你可以像我爸爸一样，将差点相撞和糟糕的驾驶上传到YouTube（尽管他没有多少订阅……他观看数最多的视频是他骑自行车撞到树篱）。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    The_Editor_<br>\nThis really struck me earlier this year...<br>\nI bought my first bike as an adult in September last year. Since then I've been clipped by a car (didn't see me when they pulled out at a junction), a good friend of mine got doored a few weeks ago (passenger swung open the door without looking) and ended up in A&E (he's fine, the bikes not...), and on my first cycling club group ride my group (slow group) rolled up behind a cyclist vs. car where one of the fast group collided with a car head on and was pronounced dead at the scene by the paramedics when they arrived.<br>\nIn 1 year, I've had a crash, so's my friend, and we witnessed the aftermath of a fatality... Seems everyone that spends time on the UK roads will have at least one story like this, and the grizzled greybeards in the cycling club have dozens...<br>\n<br>\n年初的事故让我震惊。<br>\n去年9月，作为成年人我买了第一辆自行车，那之后我被一辆车碰到了，他在路口停车时没有看到我，我的一个好朋友几周前也撞到了门，乘客没看到他把门打开了，最后进了急症室，他没事，自行车却坏了。在我第一次参加自行车俱乐部小组赛时，我的小组（慢速组）跟在一辆自行车和一辆汽车后面，快速组的一名骑手和一辆汽车迎面相撞，医护人员到达时直接宣布死亡。<br>\n在一年里，我和我的朋友都出过车祸，我们目睹了一起车祸的严重后果。似乎所有在英国道路上花了时间的人都至少会有一个这样的故事，而自行车俱乐部里的老人看过的就多了……\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    donoteatshrimp<br>\nCycling through the town centre on my commute really has me weighing up whether it's worth it to save 20mins. Just today a car reversed out in front of me while another was passing me on the right on a road barely able to fit 1 car. And had the audacity to honk at me as they clipped me! Still has me stewing.<br>\nAnd cyclepaths on pavement may as well not exist, people walk on them more often than the foot side and look at you as if you've spat in their face if you dare ring your bell behind them.<br>\n<br>\n我上下班的路程要经过市中心，这让我权衡骑车节省那20分钟是否值得。就在今天，一辆车在我前面倒车，那条路很窄，同时另一辆车从我右边经过。他们刮到我的时候还放肆的朝我按喇叭！我现在还在害怕。<br>\n人行道上好像根本没有自行车道一样，人们在自行车道上走的要比在人行道上多，如果你敢在他们身后按铃，他们看你的眼神就好像你在他们脸上吐了口水似的。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    RufusLoudermilk<br>\nNot having a bike, and it being a very short walk from my bedroom to my home office.<br>\n<br>\n没有自行车，我的卧室到我的家庭办公室只有很短的步行距离。<br>原创翻译：龙腾网 http://www.ltaaa.cn 转载请注明出处<br><br>\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Non-Combatant<br>\nI work on a ship.<br>\n<br>\n我在船上工作。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Ninjotoro<br>\nAs a Dutch person: no cycling infrastructure.

I get to work and I have to put my soaked coat and waterproof trousers in a tiny square locker. After my 10 hour shift they are still damp and stink. As soon as I got a car I ditched the bike.<br>\n<br>\n我曾经骑车走5英里去上班，让我不再骑车的是天气。12月早上五点半，外面一片漆黑，风又吹雨又刮的。我上班的时候，必须把湿透的外套和防水裤放在一个小方形储物柜里。10个小时的班后，它们还是湿的，还很难闻。我一买到汽车就把自行车扔了。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Inabitdogshit<br>\nThat does sound grim.

If you have a place where you can hang them up at work without fear of getting them stolen that would help.<br>\n<br>\n我发现我的防水裤无论如何都是干的，但我的外套坏了的时候开始漏水了。如果你上班时有个地方把它们挂起来而不用担心被偷就好了。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    helic0n3<br>\nAs someone in that situation who drove every day then converted to cycling, it was just disbelief that it could work, and that I was physically able to do it. I imagined my 6 mile commute to take me over an hour for example rather than the 35ish minutes it did take. In normal traffic this was quicker than driving. The two big hills I thought would either kill me or I'd be stuck pushing my bike up them every day like a mug were fine and I got fitter as a result. Bad sections of road were avoidable with obscure routes I didn't even know existed. I thought every other day it would rain - it really made me realise how our weather on the whole is pretty mild. I thought it would be a hassle getting showered and changed in work, but really I just left a change there and a towel and I was all done, fresh and ready to go. In bad weather I'd still drive if I could, but the bike was a revelation.<br>\n<br>\n作为曾经每天开车的人，我现在改骑自行车了，难以置信的是我竟然能行，我的身体也能做到。我原来想象骑6英里要花一个多小时的，结果就35分钟。这比开车快了。我原以为翻过那两座大山会要了我的命，要么就得把自行车推上去，结果竟然没问题，我还变得更健康了。糟糕的路段可以通过一些我之前不知道的小路绕过去。我原以为每隔一天就会下雨，结果让我意识到我们的天气在总体上还是相当和煦的。我原以为上班时洗澡和换衣服会很麻烦，但我只留了衣服和毛巾在那里，一切就搞定了。天气不好的时候我还是会开车，但骑自行车让人耳目一新。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    AF_II<br>\n100% traffic.

This makes cycling more dangerous and less comfortable.<br>\nI'd also add that the road surfaces near me are atrocious and that puts me off cycling on them. I feel like me and my bicycle are getting slowly shaken to death, and there is the very real worry of getting a flat tire half way to work. (That said my gf drives to work and also has this problem)<br>\nAnother factor for me is carry capacity.

Compared to the bus which takes 45 minutes and costs £4.50 return. No parking at work and nearest parking is a 20 min walk away. So cycling was the clear winner.<br>\nThe only off-putting thing was that I was involved in a collision once and have had several near misses. Even though the route is all cycle lanes, I have lights and reflective clothing on, I signal and obey road rules...it can still feel treacherous sometimes. They've actually been putting in a proper separated cycle lane on my route so I'm looking forward to when that finishes.<br>\nI think safer purpose built cycle routes might encourage more people. As will the cost of electric bikes going down.<br>\n<br>\n我现在在家工作，但以前骑自行车上班。单程7公里，大约需要25分钟。而巴公车需要45分钟，往返费用为4.50英镑。工作地点没有停车位，最近的停车场要不行20分钟走过来。所以骑自行车明显胜出。<br>\n唯一令人不快的是，我曾经遭遇过一次碰撞，还有几次差点出事。即使道路都是自行车道，我的车有灯，穿着反光服，遵守交通规则……有时还是会觉得很危险。我的路程上正在建造一条不错的独立自行车道，所以我很期待它什么时候能完工。<br>\n我认为更安全的专用自行车道可以鼓励更多的人骑自行车。电动自行车的价格也会下降。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Username_LOLZ<br>\nWeather has been fairly good for cycling over the past couple of weeks.

If it's particularly grim I can always work from home or drive, but again it's surprisingly rare.<br>\n<br>\n过去5年我一直骑自行车上班，说实话，冬天并没有你想的那么糟糕。<br>\n日出的时间最晚是早上8点，但我是9点上班，所以我从来不用摸黑骑车。<br>\n寒冷从来都不是问题，运动了很快就会热起来，就和我的骑车加热速度一样快。<br>\n即使是在冬天，实际上也很干燥。尽管在感觉上很多时候都在下雨，但很少下一整天。大多数时候，我都避免被淋湿。我会穿防水外套、裤子和鞋子，当我开始工作的时候，我身上已经干了。如果天气特别糟糕，我还可以在家工作或开车，但这种情况非常罕见。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    mrwithers<br>\nI have a 6km commute, and before getting a car last year I cycled to work on most days, barring extreme weather conditions.

I weigh the options of risking death every time I cycle in (never been knocked off, but have had so many close calls) or spending a little more on diesel and parking to get here safely.<br>\nThe car is a no brainer.<br>\nThe council are currently setting up segregated cycle lanes along my main commute now, which will definitely encourage me to take up cycle commuting again.<br>\nThat and the increase in weight gain since getting a car!<br>\n<br>\n我上班路程6公里，去年在买车之前，除了极端天气情况，我基本都是骑自行车上班，已经这样做16年了。自从买了汽车，我骑自行车的时间比以前少了很多。我对骑车和开车进行了权衡，骑车每次都要冒着死亡的风险(没被撞过，但有很多次差点被撞到)，开车要在柴油和停车上多花一点钱，但更安全。<br>\n很明显选汽车。<br>\n市政府目前正在我的主要上班路线上建造隔离的自行车道，这肯定会鼓励我再次骑自行车。<br>\n自从买车后，我的体重都增加了。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Hcmp1980<br>\nI don’t want to die by being smashed into by a car.<br>\n<br>\n我不想被车撞死。\n                                                                                            </div><br>\n                                                        <div class=\"box\">\n                                                                    Mawdster<br>\nAs a working woman it was just too hard to do what with showering and taking business clothes and putting on make up at work.
