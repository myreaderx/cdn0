This article was originally published in November 2011.</em></p>\n<p><em>This is a guest post from wilderness survival expert and instructor <a href=\"http://www.creekstewart.com/\">Creek Stewart</a>. </em></p>\n<p>I don’t remember my first kiss or even who it was with. I can barely recollect getting my license to drive. I vaguely remember my high school graduation and my entire time spent at college is a blur. However, I remember exactly where I was, what I was wearing, and how I felt when I got my first survival knife over 20 years ago. Just thinking about it brings back some of my fondest childhood memories. It was the RAMBO knife with the hollow handle that housed a little fishing kit along with a few other miscellaneous items. My love affair with knives began at a young age, and I’ve been hooked ever since. Movies seem to always have the coolest survival knives, but does the survival knife really have a place in the “real world”?</p>\n<p>That was a rhetorical question. Yes, it most certainly does.</p>\n<p>Despite our advancements in medicine, technology, travel, and communications, millions of people across the globe face disaster and its merciless consequences each year. In addition, thousands of individuals are thrust into unexpected and unpredictable life or death situations where survival depends on experience, knowledge, and the resources on hand. My point? <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-bug-out-bag-your-72-hour-emergency-evacuation-survival-kit/\">It is wise to keep important survival resources close by</a> — just in case. One of your most important survival tools is a quality knife.</p>\n<p>The cutting blade has carved itself an indispensable place in survival history. For thousands of years, man has depended on a cutting tool of some kind to help meet basic survival needs: food, water, fire, and shelter. Now, in our modern society, we casually refer to this blade as the “survival knife.” It has certainly earned that name. However, not all survival knives are created equal.</p>\n<p>I have the privilege of strapping a survival knife to my hip on almost a daily basis here at <a href=\"https://willowhavenoutdoor.com/\">Willow Haven</a>. I completely understand, though, that this isn’t practical for most. At a minimum, a survival knife should be kept accessible. You might be surprised how often you’ll use it — even if not in a survival situation. I never travel without my survival knife. I pack it in my checked baggage on the plane. I keep it on my hotel nightstand. It’s always in the console of my truck when road-tripping, and I never set off for an adventure without it. Whether fishing, backpacking, hunting, boating, skiing, hiking, or camping, my knife is a trusted companion. I’m rarely more than a stone’s throw away from it at any given moment.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21301 size-full\" title=\"truck-console\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/truck-console.jpg\" alt=\"Survival knife in leather holster on floor of car.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21302 size-full\" title=\"survival-knife-luggage\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/survival-knife-luggage.jpg\" alt=\"A knife holster in a suite case with a book.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>A “survival knife” is just as it sounds — a knife that can help you survive. It is a tool with literally hundreds of survival-related functions. Below is a short list:</p>\n<ul><li>Cutting/slicing</li>\n<li>Digging</li>\n<li>Splitting</li>\n<li>Self-defense</li>\n<li>First aid tool</li>\n<li>Food prep</li>\n<li>Shelter building</li>\n<li>Fire making</li>\n<li>Hunting weapon</li>\n<li>Prying tool</li>\n<li>Signaling</li>\n<li>Hammering</li>\n<li>Makeshift screwdriver</li>\n</ul><p>When it comes to your survival knife, less is typically more — despite what you may see on TV. Hang the cool movie prop knife on a wall and embrace the simplicity of a skillfully designed survival knife. Function trumps styling — always. Your first priority is performance and that will depend on a variety of time-tested key features.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">6 Important Survival Knife Features</span></h3>\n<h3>Survival Knife Feature #1: Size</h3>\n<p>Does size matter? Yes, but when it comes to your survival knife, bigger is not always better. If your blade is too big, you sacrifice the ability to effectively use it for detailed tasks such as <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-field-dress-and-butcher-a-rabbit/\">dressing small game</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-build-a-small-game-survival-snare/\">carving precision snare sets</a>.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21303 size-full\" title=\"snare-set\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/snare-set.jpg\" alt=\"Large survival knife cutting small sticks branches.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>On the flip-side, a small blade does not perform well with more rugged tasks such as batoning and chopping. Batoning is when you strike the back of your knife blade with a heavy object to drive the knife through thick or stubborn wood. This allows the blade to be used for splitting wood and cutting through large limbs and trees.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21304 size-full\" title=\"splitting-log\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/splitting-log.jpg\" alt=\"Large survival knife splitting a small log.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>Having used many survival knives, I’ve found the ideal size to be around 9-11 inches in length. For example, my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LW4J04/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=217145&#38;creative=399373&#38;creativeASIN=B005LW4J04\">Blackbird SK-5</a> survival knife pictured below is 10” in OVERALL length with a 5” blade.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21305 size-full\" title=\"size\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/size.jpg\" alt=\"Measuring large survival knife with measurement tape.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<h3>Survival Knife Feature #2: Fixed Blade</h3>\n<p>A fixed blade knife is more durable and reliable than a folding knife. While I love a good folder <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/beginners-guide-to-edc/\">for Every Day Carry (EDC)</a>, a fixed blade has the upper hand when it comes to meeting the demands a survival situation might present.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21306 size-full\" title=\"folder\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/folder.jpg\" alt=\"Survival knives fixed blade and folding blade.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>A joint of any kind is a weakness. Minimize the risk of damaging or losing your key survival resource by choosing a knife that is better suited for pounding, chopping, thrusting, prying, and rigorous cutting.</p>\n<h3>Survival Knife Feature #3: Full Tang</h3>\n<p>Not only should your survival knife be a fixed blade, but it should also be FULL TANG. “Full tang” indicates that the blade and handle are constructed from one continuous piece of metal. Scales or grips are typically attached to the handle portion for a more comfortable grip. A full tang knife is much more robust than partial tang styles such as the half tang, push tang, or rat-tail tang. As you can see in the photo below, the profile of a full tang blade is much more substantial than its rat-tail friend.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21307 size-full\" title=\"rat-tail-tang\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/rat-tail-tang.jpg\" alt=\"Survival knife full tang and rat tail tang. \" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>Over time, partial tang knife blades can loosen and develop “play” in the handle — especially under demanding tasks such as batoning, prying, and chopping. If a partial tang blade comes loose from the handle, it can be very difficult (and dangerous) to use effectively. In contrast, a full tang knife blade is still very functional even if the scales come off. It can be wrapped with cordage for added comfort and grip.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21308 size-full\" title=\"paracord-wrap\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/paracord-wrap.jpg\" alt=\"Full tang survival knife with Paracord wrapped around handle.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>There is absolutely no advantage in choosing a partial tang blade over a full tang design for your survival knife. It’s difficult to break a solid piece of continuous metal. An easy way to spot a full tang knife is to look for the metal tang sandwiched between the knife’s scales. Below are a few examples. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_21309\" style=\"width: 510px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21309\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-21309 size-full\" title=\"multiple-full-tangs\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/multiple-full-tangs.jpg\" alt=\"Different kinds of pocket knives.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-21309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Note: Not all full tang knife blades have an exposed tang as shown in these examples.</p></div>\n<h3>Survival Knife Feature #4: Sharp Pointed Tip</h3>\n<p>This may seem obvious, but I’ve seen many “survival knives” with angled, rounded, hooked, or straight cut flat tips. Despite any contrary argument, there are many compelling reasons why your survival knife should have a sharp pointed tip. The first is self-defense — against man or beast. Anything other than a sharp spear point tip compromises your ability to effectively thrust or stab your knife as a weapon — especially through thick fur/hide or layered clothing.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a spear point knife can be used as a hunting weapon — either by itself or lashed to a pole to create a longer reach spear. I keep the allen wrench (which came with my knife) in my knife sheath pocket at all times. This allows me to remove the scales and lash the full tang blade almost seamlessly onto a staff as a spear-point.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21310 size-full\" title=\"scales-removed\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/scales-removed.jpg\" alt=\"Opened survival knife handle.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21311 size-full\" title=\"spear-lashing\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/spear-lashing.jpg\" alt=\"A man holding Survival weapon made with pocket knife.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21312 size-full\" title=\"spear-in-action\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/spear-in-action.jpg\" alt=\"A man pointing hunting weapon toward a tree.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>On a more practical note, I find myself using the sharp knife point for all kinds of tasks while teaching survival classes and training in the field. Below is a short list of tasks in which a sharp pointed knife tip excels over other styles:</p>\n<ul><li>Detailed prying and picking</li>\n<li>Cleaning/dressing small game such as fish</li>\n<li>Drilling/notching</li>\n<li>Clothing/gear repairs</li>\n<li>Splinters!</li>\n<li>Processing some wild edibles such as pine nuts, acorns, walnuts, and hickory nuts</li>\n<li>Accessing live bait in hard to get areas</li>\n</ul><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21313 size-full\" title=\"hickory-nut\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/11/hickory-nut.jpg\" alt=\"A man using a single-Edged Blade with Flat Ground Spine.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<h3>Survival Knife Feature #5: Single-Edged Blade with Flat Ground Spine</h3>\n<p>Your survival knife should not have a double-edged dagger style blade. A double-edged blade is just not necessary for the vast majority of (if not all) survival uses. Actually, it can be a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Not only do I recommend a single-edged blade, but I prefer for the back side (spine) of my survival knife to have a flat 90 degree grind. A flat ground spine is ideal for striking a fire-starting ferro-rod. Rounded or beveled spines make this almost impossible.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21314 size-full\" title=\"fire-steel\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/fire-steel.jpg\" alt=\"A man using pocket knife for fire-starting ferro-rod.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>I regularly use my survival knife to baton through large pieces of wood. Whether splitting firewood or constructing makeshift shelters, a sharpened back edge would make this function nearly impossible.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21315 size-full\" title=\"batoning-limb\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/batoning-limb.jpg\" alt=\"A man using pocket knife for splitting wood.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>I also frequently use the back edge of my knife as a thumb rest for added leverage and control during tedious carving projects such as making feather sticks or notching triggers for traps and snare sets. Projects like this would be difficult and dangerous with a double-edged blade.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21316 size-full\" title=\"feather-stick\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/feather-stick.jpg\" alt=\"Man using pocket knife to remove bark of stick. \" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<h3>Survival Knife Feature #6: Solid Pommel</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21317 size-full\" title=\"pommel\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/pommel.jpg\" alt=\"A knife with leather holster placed on the ground.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<p>The “pommel” is the bottom of the knife’s handle — also referred to as the butt. I regularly use the pommel on my survival knife for light duty pounding and hammering. It’s perfect for driving in shelter stakes. I’ve also used my knife point to chip out crude ice fishing holes by pounding the pommel with a heavy stick to drive the blade into the ice. Some knives are designed with a rounded or hooked pommel that is not ideal for hammering. I believe in getting the most uses possible from your knife. A well-designed and substantial pommel only adds to your list of capabilities.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21318 size-full\" title=\"driving-stake\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2011/11/driving-stake.jpg\" alt=\"A man digging the ground with stick.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></img></p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Use the above 6 criteria as a benchmark for choosing a potential survival knife. Only you can decide the features on which you are and are not willing to compromise. Beyond this, pretty much everything else comes down to personal taste.</p>\n<p>There are many survival knives on the market that include these 6 survival features, yet look nothing like each other. There are countless styling options that come down to personal preference and have little bearing on survival functionality. Some of these features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Blade steel (carbon or stainless – varying options with varying results)</li>\n<li>Handle material (rubber, micarta, bone, antler, etc…)</li>\n<li>Color or finish</li>\n<li>Lanyard holes</li>\n<li>Decorative milling</li>\n<li>Jimping</li>\n<li>Serrated or non-serrated blade</li>\n<li>Sheath design and style</li>\n<li>Knife designer/manufacturer/brand</li>\n<li>Blade style</li>\n<li>With or without finger guards</li>\n<li>Blood groove</li>\n</ul><h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conclusion</span></h3>\n<p>A survival knife is not a magic wand nor does it have inherent magical saving powers. The true value is in the skill of the one who wields it. Skill only comes from practice and repetition. You don’t buy a survival knife to decorate your man cave — it is a tool that’s meant to be used. Since the beginning of mankind, the cutting blade helped to shape how our ancestors hunted, fought, built, and survived. From cavemen with sharp rocks to a soldier in modern warfare, there will never be a relationship quite like that between a man and his blade.

But quarantining in the cold and dark of winter? Woof. You get done with dinner, and then it’s like . . . alright, now what?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, you can watch a movie or pull something out of the board game cabinet, but you probably don’t want everyone staring at a screen every night and you can only play The Floor Is Lava so many times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your family has been experiencing some pandemic-induced wintertime doldrums, below we present over 30 ideas for whiling away these long, dark nights. They have been selected and recommended based on the following criteria:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Indoor.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are things you can do entirely within the confines of your house, because baby, it’s cold outside. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Easy.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are tons of involved crafts to tackle out there, but at the end of a long day, nobody wants to bust out a ton of supplies, spend an hour on some meticulous project, and then have a bunch of clean-up to do. The activities below require minimal supplies (and that which is required you’ll already have lying around the house) and minimal preparation and work. They’re turnkey. Save <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/category/manly-skills/projects/\">more involved crafts</a> — like building a <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/kid-craft-of-the-week-easy-no-sew-teepee/\">periscope</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/kid-craft-of-the-week-pencil-catapult/\">pencil catapult</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/battery-with-quarters/\">coin-powered battery</a> — for Saturday afternoons. Which, let’s face it, are awfully long too.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Novel. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes a little weird and eccentric, these are activities that you may not have previously thought about doing, and that will give you a welcome break from your typical entertainments.</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The McKay family has field-tested all of these ideas and given them our seal of approval. Some will keep your kid occupied for a fairly long time; others provide a short diversion and quick laugh. Some are one-and-done type things; others are games your kids will want to play night after night after night (sometimes to your chagrin!). Keep this list handy and pick a couple things each evening to try out and use to pass the time in some memorably interactive, full-bore wholesomeness. </span></p>\n<h3>Wonder Ball Game</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This old camp game, passed down to us by Kate’s father, has been a weirdly big hit in our household. It’s akin to hot potato: you toss a ball around a circle while all singing the Wonder Ball song, and whoever has the ball in their hands when the last word of the song (“out!”) is warbled, is, well, out. Keep on doing rounds of it until only one person, the winner, is left standing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s how the song goes:</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wonder Ball</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goes round and round</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To pass it quickly</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are bound</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re the one</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hold it last</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game for you</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Has surely past</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are</span></em><br></br><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out!</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our house, we call the game “Wonder Toad” because instead of using a ball, we use a big plushie of Toad from Mario Kart.

The thing that makes this fun are the fortunes. You need a good mixture of good fortunes and bad ones. So for every “You’ll win the lottery” fortune, you’ll need a choice prediction like “You’ll live in a garbage can like Oscar the Grouch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also like throwing in things like “You’ll eat boogers for the rest of your life” or “Your breath will smell like farts.” Dad gets an immature kick out of it; so do the kids.</span></p>\n<h3>Finger Challenge</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9nKgSGhqbE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br></br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A physical coordination challenge in the vein of “pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your left hand has your thumb up; your right index finger is pointing at your left thumb. Now, simultaneously switch your left hand to pointing and your right hand to the thumbs up position. It seems like this would be easy, but it’s not. It’s like something gets crossed in your brain to make it hard to do. With some practice, though, you’ll eventually be able to seamlessly make the switch between thumbs up and pointing.</span></p>\n<h3>Fort-Building</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the category of secret hideout creation, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/kid-craft-of-the-week-easy-no-sew-teepee/\">making a full-on teepee serves as a great weekend project</a>, but improvised forts are the name of the game on a weeknight. The other week the kids built some creatively jerry-rigged forts using couch cushions, chairs, pillows, blankets, and bedsheets. They spent a good hour working on their respective constructions, and then got to sleep the night in them to boot. </span></p>\n<h3>Flour Mountain Game</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132277\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2.jpg 1550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2-768x257.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2-1536x513.jpg 1536w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2-320x107.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2-640x214.jpg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2-1280x428.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you burned out on the early-pandemic baking craze and now have copious amounts of flour lying around, you can put it to good use in this game. It’s a good one for when you don’t mind getting a little messy (it’s wise to do it right before bathtime).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pour a pile of flour out onto a plate, and then mold it into a cone/mountain shape. Place a match or toothpick upright at the top of the mountain. To play the game, each person uses a butter knife to cut away a bit of the mountain, trying not to let the toothpick fall. Participants can make whatever size cuts they’d like; they’ll naturally get smaller the closer they get to the toothpick. Whoever makes the toothpick fall first, has to pick it up with their mouth — which is likely to result in the person getting flour all over their face. If your kids are like our kids, they may be tempted to intentionally be the one who makes the toothpick fall, because they </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get flour all over their face.</span></p>\n<h3>Glass Bottle Xylophone </h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132280\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/bottles.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/bottles.jpeg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/bottles-320x240.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably know that water-filled vessels can be used to play music, but have your kids ever actually experimented with the idea?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill up glass bottles (or drinking glasses) of the same size and shape with varying amounts of water. You can then play around with them in as nuanced or as loosey goosey a way as you want. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap on the bottles with a spoon to see the way the water level impacts the sound; check out the difference in sound that is made when you tap on a water-filled section of a bottle versus an empty section; blow across the tops of the bottles to make yet another type of noise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now if you want to get fancy, you can actually </span><a href=\"http://www.helpmykidlearn.ie/activities/8-9/detail/glass-bottle-xylophone\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“tune” the bottles to a scale and play some songs with your “xylophone.”</span></a></p>\n<h3>Hanger on Head</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132385\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/hanger1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/hanger1.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/hanger1-320x143.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/hanger1-640x285.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a short, weird interlude of entertainment, have your kid close his eyes, tell him to relax his neck, and then put a plastic hanger around his head — above the eyes and ears, like where a ballcap would sit.

Even if they don’t have experience with handling a pocket knife, the soap is so soft they can do this with a butter knife. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-carve-a-turtle-out-of-a-bar-of-soap/\">We’ve got instructions on how to carve a turtle into soap here</a>, but you can also just let your kids be creative and go to town on their bars, carving whatever they want. </span></p>\n<h3>Sleeping Giant</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-importance-of-roughhousing-with-your-kids/\">We’ve talked about roughhousing on the site plenty of times in the past</a>. Gus and Scout are now 10 and 7 and we’re still at it, and doing it even more on these long dark nights. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve invented some roughhousing games as the kids have gotten older. The one the kids like to play the most is called “Sleeping Giant.” It was inspired by the story of Polyphemus in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odyssey. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I put the kids in a cave area (it’s usually a spot between our bed and the wall) and block the entrance with my body. I pretend that I’m sleeping and the kids have to try to get over me without touching me. If their bodies glance mine in their attempts (I make that harder to avoid by moving my arms and legs up and down), the sleeping giant awakens and tries to devour them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they get by me or I catch them three times, a no-holds-barred battle royale commences. I throw them on the bed; they do jiu-jitsu locks on me. It’s a hootin’ hollerin’ good time.</span></p>\n<h3>Floating Arms</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Amaze your kid with this classic trick. Stand her in a doorway, and have her lift her arms until the back of her hands are pushing against the doorframe. Hold for 60 seconds. Have her then take a step forward and experience the feeling of her arms magically floating to the sky.</span></p>\n<h3>Put Your Head Through a Piece of Paper Challenge</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132281\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/paper.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/paper.jpeg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/paper-320x240.jpeg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/paper-640x480.jpeg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut a piece of paper into fourths and give one of the slips to your kid, asking him to make a hole in it in such a way as to be able to put his head through it. He will hilariously fail. He will then enjoy learning the clever secret to making the seemingly impossible possible, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-put-your-head-through-a-piece-of-paper/\">which we’ve laid out here</a>. </span></p>\n<h3>Poor Kitty Game</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the members of the family except he or she who will first play the part of the cat sit down. The person playing the cat then gets down on all fours and crawls over to one of the family members and meows three times. This person then has to pat the “kitty” on the head three times and say, “Poor kitty, poor kitty, poor kitty.” The “cat” should act as silly and comical as possible, and the first person who laughs becomes the new kitty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We found this game in a book of kids’ activities from the 1960s, and it was so totally bizarre that it had us all in stitches before we even started. The laughter continued as we played and took turns meowing and nuzzling each other’s legs.</span></p>\n<h3>Make a Paper Balloon</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132342\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ball.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ball.jpg 585w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ball-320x220.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Origami is a perennially effective boredom killer for kids, and arguably the most fun kind of origami is that which results in a creation that has some kind of functionality — like a frog you can jump, a box you can put things in, a <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/dollar-bill-into-a-ring/\">ring you can wear</a>, a<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/origami-ninja-star/\"> ninja star you can use to vanquish your foes</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the king of this category is the origami balloon. It’s just cool to blow something up that’s made out of paper. Once constructed, you can play hacky sack with it, throw it at your little sister, bat it around like a cat, and even fill it up with water and turn it into a water bomb; drop it off your deck and watch it go splat.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-paper-balloon-water-bomb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find the full instructions to make a paper balloon here.</span></a></p>\n<h3>Heads Up, Seven Up</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game your elementary school teachers had you play when it was raining at recess. Admittedly, it’s not as fun when there are just four or five participants (we do our familial version with one person having their eyes closed/thumb up, while the three other participants are the potential thumb taggers — that way the eyes-closed participant has more potential taggers to guess between). But our kids still really enjoy it. The hoot of it is planning subterfuges designed to fool the person with their eyes closed as to who did the thumb tagging deed. If you need a refresher, <a href=\"https://www.funology.com/heads-up-seven-up/\">here’s how to play</a>.</span></p>\n<h3>Invisible Ink</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132285\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ink2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ink2.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ink2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ink2-640x426.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evoking as it does the worlds of secret agents and swashbuckling pirates, what kid doesn’t love invisible ink? The problem is that the classic formula for invisible ink — lemon juice + heat — doesn’t actually work all that well. We’ve ferreted out the recipe that actually does, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/two-methods-for-homemade-invisible-ink-one-of-which-works/\">which you can find here</a>. Bonus: you probably already have everything you need to make it in your cabinets right now.</span></p>\n<h3>Musical Chairs</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We played this the other night and it was a fun success, even with just our four familial participants. The kids enjoyed both participating in the game, and taking their turn as the “DJ,” who gets to pick their favorite song off Spotify, and be the one who starts and stops it as the other family members march around the empty chairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one round, things got pretty rowdy in the fight over the last chair; a lip was busted; blood was spilt. McKays don’t mess around.</span></p>\n<h3>River Rat </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also try “River Rat” as a variation on musical chairs. Family members stand on either side of a small, elongated area rug, which represents a river. One person will start and stop the music. When the music plays, family members march back and forth over the rug. Whoever is in the “river” when the music stops, is a river rat, and is out of the game.</span></p>\n<h3>Paper Airplane Contest</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132286\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/plane.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/plane.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/plane-320x213.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-the-worlds-best-paper-airplanes/\">Fold paper airplanes.</a> Throw them. See whose plane goes the furthest. </span></p>\n<h3>Levitate a Thread</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132279\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/comb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/comb.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/comb-320x212.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/comb-640x423.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can your kid make a thread rise off the table? He can when he uses a comb which has been activated with the “magic” of static electricity. Just run a comb through your hair a few times, hold it close to a thread (or a small piece of paper towel) and — voila! — the thread will levitate upwards. </span></p>\n<h3>Get Up Off the Floor Without Using Your Hands Challenge</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/take-the-simple-test-that-can-predict-your-mortality/\">we wrote about the Sitting-Rising Test</a>. It’s a physical evaluation that can predict mortality. The fewer appendages you need to use to get up off the floor from the sitting position, the longer you’re likely to live. The more appendages you have to use, the sooner you’re likely to die.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, besides being a test to see how likely you are to kick the bucket, it’s also a fun game to play with your kids. See if they can get off the ground without using their hands/arms/knees. See if they can find more than one way to do so.</span></p>\n<h3>Dude Perfect Trick Shots</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of the trick shots your kid watches on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRijo3ddMTht_IHyNSNXpNQ\">Dude Perfect</a> and scale it down. We do a lot of bottle flipping, no-look sock shots into the clothing basket, and bouncing balls down the staircase and into a cup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t forget to scream and run around like a crazy person after a successful stunt. It wouldn’t be a Dude Perfect trick shot without it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pound it. Noggin. SEE YA!</span></p>\n<h3>Feats of Strength</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Related to roughhousing are old-school feats of strength. These are games that pit participants in a mano-o-mano test of strength and balance. If you were a Boy Scout, you probably played some of these games. Foot boxing, Indian leg wrestling, and Indian staff wrestling are a few such showdowns; <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manly-feats-of-strength/\">be sure to check out this article for more</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re much bigger than your kid, going head to head with him wouldn’t make for a fair fight. Instead, pair up kids of a similar size to compete. Though if you’ve got teenagers, they’ll probably be able to give Dad a run for his money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t forget to do your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8Eag9CAFk\">Airing of Grievances</a> before performing these feats of strength too. </span></p>\n<h3>See Through Paper</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132278\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/coin.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/coin.jpeg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/coin-320x240.jpeg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/coin-640x480.jpeg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put a piece of paper over a coin and ask your kid if they can figure out the date on the coin. They will be stumped. You then give a knowing chuckle, and rub the top of the coin with a pencil, creating a relief that will reveal the year it was minted. </span></p>\n<h3>Cartwheel Contest</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a contest to see who can do the best cartwheel (or the least worst one). Spoiler alert: Dad did not win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also try somersaults, handstands (or at least a tripod headstand), and other variations of poorly performed gymnastics. </span></p>\n<h3>3 Marker Challenge</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an idea Scout gleaned off YouTube. Each participant reaches into a box of markers and, without looking, pulls out three. When each person has chosen three random markers, everyone has to use their respective collection to draw a picture on the same theme; e.g., everyone draws a hamburger, and if you’ve got a blue, pink, and orange marker to get the job done, you’ve got to figure out how to make the best of it. You then argue about who did the best job.</span></p>\n<h3>Paper Cup Phone</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132347\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/cups3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/cups3.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/cups3-320x161.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology of telephones may have changed a lot in the last couple of decades, but making one out of paper cups remains a source of perennial fun. </span></p>\n<p>Making a paper cup phone is easy: poke a hole in the bottom of a cup and stick a string through the hole. Tie the string inside the cup to a toothpick; this will keep the string from falling out when you pull the “telephone line” between the cups tight (tautness improves sound quality). Repeat with another cup, making a lengthy line between the two cups so you can stand far enough apart that you wouldn’t be able to hear each other talking without the aid of your telephone. One person puts the cup up to their ear to listen; the other talks softly into their cup. The sound volume/quality is surprisingly impressive for such a primitive piece of tech!</p>\n<h3>Indoor Obstacle Course</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottomans, chairs, brooms, and cardboard boxes can all be used to create an obstacle course. Have the kids put it together and then bust out your phone’s stopwatch and have a contest to see who can get through it the fastest.</span></p>\n<h3>Shadow Puppets</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132362\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/shadow2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/shadow2.jpg 675w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/shadow2-320x210.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/shadow2-640x419.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shadow puppets are fun to make as you tuck your kids into bed. But they can also be played with before bedtime. Point a lamp at a wall, and put your hands, specially positioned to form the silhouettes of different animals (<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-16-shadow-puppets/\">here’s how to make 16 of them</a>), in front of the light. Shadows of the animals will be projected on the wall, and each family member’s animal can interact with the others, to create a full-on puppet show.<br></br></span></p>\n<h3>Catch the Cane Game</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All family members except for one should sit in a circle of chairs. The one not seated stands in the center of the circle, holding a broomstick or PVC pipe or other kind of stick, with one end of it touching the floor. The stick-holder then calls the name of someone sitting in the circle while simultaneously letting go of the cane. The person whose name is called has to jump out of their chair and catch the stick before it falls. If he does catch it, the stick-holder tries again and calls another person’s name; if he doesn’t catch it, the stick-holder sits down, and the person who missed the stick becomes the new stick-holder.</span></p>\n<h3>The Rope Trick</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132282\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/rope.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/rope.jpeg 400w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/rope-320x426.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give your kid a piece of rope about three feet in length and have them hold it with one end in each hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenge them to tie a knot with the rope without letting go of either end of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch their fruitless efforts with your arms folded. When they finally give up, ask them (while your arms are still folded) to place the ends of the rope in each of your hands. Unfold your arms . . . and a knot magically appears!</span></p>\n<h3>Toothpick Puzzles</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_132345\" style=\"width: 610px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-132345\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-132345 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/tooth1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/tooth1-1.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/tooth1-1-320x161.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-132345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Puzzle set-up + answer</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use 12 toothpicks to make 4 squares.

How can you take away 6 toothpicks to form 2 squares?</span></p>\n<h3>Pass the Story</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually played this game a lot back in my high school football days. On the ride home from away games, my buddies and I would sit in the back of the bus dirty and exhausted, and take turns collectively spinning a yarn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game is simple: One person starts a made-up story. About a minute in, he stops and passes the story off to someone else, who then picks up where the first person left off and adds his own segment of the story for a minute. He then passes it off to the next person. Each person has to use the thread they inherited from the last, and then can take the tale in their own random direction. When done with your family, it’s always fun to hear the silly stuff your kids will add to the story.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/30-tricks-games-and-stunts-to-entertain-your-kids-on-long-dark-winter-nights/\">30+ Tricks, Games, and Stunts to Entertain Your Kids on Long, Dark Winter Nights</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/KY1Z6rfy48U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 20:36:44 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8a8a9ac4b76a85c030f2e32d82cb622c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/Family-Entertainments-Header-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-461_df4ad5acb2536ad6.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/fortune5.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn31@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-36-472_97d9718681365110.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/flour2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn15@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-36-460_bb8a9ba05f98c8cd.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/bottles.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn20@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-36-510_340d5b960168bedd.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/hanger1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn80@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-35-627_b8e49b2b8e37318b.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/soap-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn81@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-36-418_5eac14205c494a22.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/paper.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-368_f5e66961672a2060.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ball.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn87@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-35-309_c4b1849a175771e7.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/ink2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn23@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-35-430_2416672dd4a4aad3.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/plane.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn54@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-48-495_772067d76642efc2.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/comb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn88@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-36-461_bf0eea8d277b63e8.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/coin.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn19@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-415_f93b4f15e67c04db.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/cups3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn4@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-36-409_d033902abd99f867.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/shadow2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-38-861_a3a9ac33b6cee8e5.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/rope.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-36-605_04a73f2f36b10f5f.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/tooth1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-00-725_6d7788a2bef39cf4.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/puzzle4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn92@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-36-309_d16b00e7082c80b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/KY1Z6rfy48U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn79@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-48-504_99fe816d287dbba0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673611018},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:11","title":"Huckberry’s Top 15 Men’s Gift Ideas for 2020 (+Giveaway!)","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=131184","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132256\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/AOM-Holiday20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/AOM-Holiday20.jpg 1200w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/AOM-Holiday20-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/AOM-Holiday20-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/AOM-Holiday20-640x640.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></img></p>\n<p>Have you been stumped as to what to gift to some of the men in your life?

Jordan</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Before he commanded the liberation of Europe and led the nation through the height of the Cold War, Dwight D. Eisenhower grew up with traditional Midwestern tastes. In England, commanding forces that would successfully invade two continents, he turned down fancy meals his assigned cook offered in favor of fried steak, corn pudding, chicken soup, and other dishes reflecting his Kansas boyhood. As the pressure of the looming D-Day invasion mounted in the spring of 1944, Ike would occasionally relieve the almost unbelievable stress by cooking his own breakfast, even washing his own dishes.</p>\n<p>Ike took pride in his down-home familiarity with the kitchen, and as president, he collected some of his favorite recipes in a White House file. One, found in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, was Ike’s special favorite around holiday time. Archived in the Presidential Papers under “Beverages,” President Eisenhower kept a declassified recipe for bourbon eggnog. As a boy, Ike worked in an Abilene creamery, and like Eisenhower the President, Ike’s recipe <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-641-how-eisenhower-led-a-conversation-with-ikes-granddaughter/\">takes the “middle way,”</a> combining the enjoyable sweet wholesomeness of postwar America with bourbon-backed strength Ike believed in.</p>\n<p>I made Ike’s 5-star recipe after researching my book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H0M8GI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B004H0M8GI&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Brothers Rivals Victors</em></a> and found his holiday drink spectacular. If you enjoy a glass of nog as part of your yuletide festivities, this recipe is as good as anything you’ll find in stores. It doesn’t take long to make, and you can substitute your favorite rum or brandy in place of the General’s preferred bourbon.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Make Eisenhower’s Homemade Eggnog</span></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-131608\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/image001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/image001.jpg 564w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/image001-320x410.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\"></img></p>\n<h3>Assembling Your Forces</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-131637\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0667.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0667.jpg 450w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0667-320x349.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></img></p>\n<p>The Eisenhower plan of attack starts with a solid, disciplined force of easily obtainable ingredients:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>A dozen egg yolks.</strong> Buy a dozen eggs, crack them gently, and use the egg shells to pour the yolk back and forth until the clear liquid is gone and the heavier yolk remains. Put them into a separate bowl as you work through the dozen.</li>\n<li><strong>One pound of granulated sugar.</strong> Your basic white sugar will do.</li>\n<li><strong>One quart of bourbon.</strong> You don’t need a high-level small batch, or an expensive bottle of Pappy Van Winkle. When blended with the other ingredients, the sherry cask oak and smoky flavors of top-shelf bourbon won’t be noticeable, so stick with your favorite go-to weekend brand.

Next comes the sugar, added little by little so the egg-sugar mixture takes a semi-gloss, light yellow appearance. Maintain rigid military discipline as you add the bourbon to the mix — little by little, letting the mixture absorb the bourbon reinforcements before adding more. (“<u>Very slowly</u>,” Ike orders, advising, “The process up to here would normally consume at least 30 minutes — with a good mixer.” Here, Ike was a little bit conservative; in my experience, 15-20 minutes should do just fine.)</p>\n<p>Next comes the coffee creamer, which can go in a little faster. When all is in order, put the bowl into the refrigerator (“icebox” in early 20<sup>th</sup> century parlance), and let it cool until about 30 minutes before you are ready to serve it. A few to several hours of refrigeration is optimal; in my case, I left it in overnight.</p>\n<h3>Hit the Beaches</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-131640\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0692.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0692.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0692-320x240.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0692-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>At about 30 minutes to H-Hour, pour the whipping cream into a separate bowl and beat it with a whisk until it is “moderately thick.” Here Ike gives his local commander on the scene some discretion. Don’t make it meringue-thick, just aerated enough to make it run a little slower. Mix the whipping cream into the refrigerated mixture — again slowly and deliberately — then pour the mix into the serving bowl. Top with ground or grated nutmeg, then get out the glasses and ladle.</p>\n<h3>Victory!</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-131639\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0701.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0701.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0701-320x240.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/IMG_0701-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>Allowing for spillage and taste-testing, Ike’s eggnog produces approximately one gallon (enough for about 30 good-sized glasses). It doesn’t pack the kick you would expect from a dish made with a quart of bourbon. It is sweet, but not overly so, and in keeping with Ike’s moderation, it is a balanced mixture, where sugar and cream work together like Patton and Bradley. (Actually, it pairs better than those two headstrong generals did in Sicily.)</p>\n<h3>What Price Victory</h3>\n<p>As you can see from the ingredients, this is not a low-calorie treat. Toast the holidays, savor your culinary victory, and have your aide-de-camp remind you to do a few extra exercises later, to keep your waistline from becoming a casualty of your holiday offensive.</p>\n<p>_________________</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://jonathanwjordan.com/\">Jonathan W.

You probably don’t think of office work and cubicles.</p>\n<p>But my guest today says that the soul is involved in every kind of work, and poetry is an essential vehicle for examining what your work is doing to your soul, and for learning to bring more soul into what you do. His name is <a href=\"https://davidwhyte.com\">David Whyte</a> and he’s a poet, a philosopher, and the author of multiple books of both poetry and prose, as well as a corporate consultant who uses poetry to help companies with their organizational leadership. We begin our conversation with David’s background in marine zoology and how his experience being a naturalist guide in the Galapagos Islands influenced his ideas on the conversational nature of reality. We discuss how the amount of time you spend at your job is greatly shaping who you are, the way we lose youthful idealism for our work, and the importance of inviting the right kind of danger into your life. David then unpacks what the ancient tale of Beowulf can teach men about having hard conversations both personally and professionally, and bridging one’s outer and inner lives. We talk as well about the importance of men having good friendships outside the office. Along the way, David reads a few short, stirring poems that speak to these themes.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>How and why David went from marine zoologist to poet and philosopher </li>\n<li>The poetry of the office </li>\n<li>On allowing people to be themselves </li>\n<li>How <em>Beowulf</em> can help men explore the fear of bringing our soul into our work</li>\n<li>Men and work; men and friendship </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/20-best-poems/\">20 Classic Poems Every Man Should Read</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/our-disembodied-selves-and-the-decline-of-empathy/\">Our Disembodied Selves and the Decline of Empathy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-best-way-to-find-your-vocation/\">The Best Way to Find Your Vocation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/find-your-true-calling/\">A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544570308/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0544570308&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Beowulf</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-567-understanding-the-wonderful-frustrating-dynamic-of-friendship/\">Understanding the Wonderful, Frustrating Dynamic of Friendship</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/understanding-male-friendships/\">Understanding Male Friendships</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132414\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/91PT6v7wS6L.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"337\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/91PT6v7wS6L.jpg 337w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/91PT6v7wS6L-320x475.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With David</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://davidwhyte.com\">David’s website</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

By reading them you can learn not only about an individual’s life, but through that personal prism, find an accessible window to the historical period in which they lived. Paradoxically, the more particular something is, the more generally it can be applied, and even if some figure lived a very different and much more epic life than yours, following the contours of their story can grant you plenty of insight into your own.</p>\n<p>But what do you do when you decide to read a biography of someone, and find there are multiple options to choose from?</p>\n<p>There are said to be upwards of 15,000 books about Abraham Lincoln, the most of any figure in history outside of Jesus. Plenty of other figures have bibliographical files reaching into the thousands, and countless other persons of lesser historical importance have more than a few major biographies about them too. With numbers like that, selecting the<em> best</em> one to read can turn a simple quest for a book to read into a long-term research project. But there are a few methods you can use to sort through the options and find the right biography for you, which I’ll detail below.</p>\n<h3>Consider the Time Period and Publishing Date<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an individual was particularly eminent, a new biography about them is likely to come out every decade or two. You can find books on the same person published in 1920, 1970, and 2020, and each will give you a very different reading experience; for example, a biography of Thomas Jefferson from the 1950s paints a different picture of the man than does a biography of him from the last decade. All books, just like their subjects, are products of their time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main differences between older and newer biographies is the way they approach their subjects and how the author views what a biography is “for”:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Older Bios </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Older biographies tend to concentrate more on a subject’s outward accomplishments than their inner thoughts and private life. They don’t get much into interpersonal relationships nor traffic in psychological speculation. Digging into an individual’s private life was formerly seen as inappropriate, and older biographies are written more like eulogies — summaries of the broader, publicly-known contours of a person’s life, with their failings downplayed, and their achievements emphasized, all tinged with a bit of romanticism and idealism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In line with this, older biographies are sometimes trying to subtly or not so subtly offer a moral education along with an individual’s story, and are often written in a more inspiring, soul-stirring manner. For example, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520063465/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0520063465&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Robert Richardson’s 1986 biography of Thoreau</a> is far more meaningful than anything new on the market. In general, the most transcendent biographies I’ve read — those that inflame my </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thumos </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— are on the older end. It’s a style of writing no longer in vogue, but still worth consuming.    </span></p>\n<p><strong>Newer Bios</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newer biographies are written in a more journalistic style, in which the author’s aim is more to pass along information than to impart inspiration; as such, they tend to offer a more balanced, less mythical and romantic view of the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern biographies often contain updated, more accurate information about their subject, gleaned from declassified medical records, previously family-kept letters, and recently unearthed journals. Such sources are used to fill in details not only about a person’s public life, but to analyze their private life and psychology as well, all of which can really change how an individual is written about and viewed. Modern bios typically take a “warts-and-all” approach to their subjects, not shying away from pointing out a subject’s perceived shortcomings or moral failings, nor from speculating about potential skeletons in their closet. For example, even modern authors like Ron Chernow and Andrew Roberts, who take more of a heroic stance towards their subjects, will write about and address the poor treatment of George Washington’s slaves or Winston Churchill’s belief in the superiority of white, English-speaking people, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the difference in tone/approach between older and newer bios, you’ll also find a difference in writing style, with the style of the latter — which relies more on an accessible, narrative format than in decades past — being much easier to read. This newer style of biography isn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessarily</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> superior to the drier, more linear style of the past, but it is often more palatable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which route you should go when there’s an older and a newer version of a biography available is up to your own tastes and aims with reading.

Do you want to be inspired?</span></p>\n<h3>Read Multiple First Chapters<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best, easiest way to discern between various biographies on the same person is to simply read the first chapter of a number of books. Within a few pages, you’ll get a sense of the writing style and the author’s general thesis of the person. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132403\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-roberts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-roberts.jpg 333w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-roberts-320x480.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s look at the example of Napoleon through two of his recent biographers: When you read the introduction to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143127853/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0143127853&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Andrew Roberts’ biography of Napoleon</a>, you’ll see that the author views the French general through a “Great Man” lens of history — that is, Napoleon was a misunderstood but brilliant and singular leader who changed the course of history through the exercise of admirable and heroic qualities. As mentioned, Roberts writes in a style that harkens back to the “moral” biographies of decades past but have recently gone out of vogue. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132406\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/nap-zam2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"321\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/nap-zam2.jpg 636w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/nap-zam2-320x498.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465055931/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0465055931&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Adam Zamoyski</a>, another biographer, has more of a “product of his times” view of Napoleon, and it becomes obvious right away in the preface that the author takes no moral stance towards the man, but simply seeks to explain him. Even looking at the covers, you can see that there’s going to be a difference in their posture towards their subject. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I used to just read the introduction/preface to make my choices, I’ve recently discovered I should go just a little further and read the first actual chapter. In introductory text, some authors will use a different, more casual tone than they do in the “real” text, which can be a little misleading to a reader who’s trying to choose a book. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132407\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon.jpg 1674w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon-768x395.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon-1536x789.jpg 1536w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon-320x164.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon-640x329.jpg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon-1280x658.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a bookstore, this sort of comparative reading is an incredibly easy thing to do. Online, particularly with Amazon, you have a few options: 1) Take advantage of the free Kindle samples that Amazon dishes out. There’s no limit, so go crazy. 2) For newer and more popular titles, you can hit the “Look Inside” button on the paperback or hardcover options, and you can often read quite a few pages of the introduction, preface, and/or first chapter(s). 3) If it’s an older, less popular book, you might just have to buy some books and test ‘em out. Here’s a trick to keep in mind: as long as it’s fulfilled by Amazon (and not a third-party seller), you can return any book within 30 days. So grab a few Lincoln biographies, read the first chapter of each, and only keep the one you like best (or maybe you’ll realize you want to read a number of viewpoints!). </span></p>\n<h3>Read Reviews<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Book reviews, both from average consumers and critics, should be taken into consideration. On Amazon, people are weird about reviews. They’ll get oddly personal or review just the product/packaging or leave a one-word summary of their thoughts (“Terrible!”). I’ve found Goodreads to be a much more accurate review site because people posting there tend to be dedicated readers. You’re not going to use and post reviews to Goodreads if it’s not a somewhat passionate hobby. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to critics’ reviews, there are a few places I go. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kirkus Reviews</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publishers Weekly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offer short, summary-like takes that are published without bylines in order to remove any semblance of bias. The other primary outlets I go to are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wall Street Journal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Both provide longer form, essay-like reviews that go more in-depth into a book’s strengths and weaknesses, but each can be politically/culturally slanted too. Reading both will provide a good balance.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviews shouldn’t be taken without a grain of salt, but if you’ve read a couple chapters of a book and enjoyed it, then gone on to find favorable reviews across the board, going with that particular biography will be a pretty safe bet. </span></p>\n<h3>Factor in Length and Time Commitment</h3>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I’ve taught more — and particularly, as I’ve done more after-action evaluation on which books actually make a difference in the lives of students and friends — I’ve come to value more books and writers that economize well. . . . over time I’ve come to prefer Robert Dallek to Robert Caro for a biography of Lyndon Johnson. Both of them are brilliant, and Caro’s details are amazing, but there’s a lot more bang per paragraph in Dallek’s 400 pages than in Caro’s 3,000-plus-page version. —Senator Ben Sasse</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first started reading biographies, I’d go full obsessive bibliophile and want to explore the longest series and thickest books I could find. I read Sasse’s philosophy on brevity when it was published a couple years ago and thought it was lame. But I gotta say, a couple years later and with dozens more biographies in my “books read” list, I agree with him more and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is a busy endeavor and motivation for a personal reading project can be hard to come by. Staring down a multi-volume biography can be so intimidating as to render you unable to even start. It’s perfectly acceptable to pick a shorter book that won’t take as much time, and as Sasse said, offers “more bang per paragraph.” Sometimes a book like that will spur your interest and lead you to further reading; sometimes, on the other hand, you’ll realize that a relatively bite-sized sampling is all you needed on a certain subject.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And don’t neglect what are often called “micro-histories” of certain individuals. These are books that delve into a single aspect of a subject or just a short period of time in their life rather than the entire cradle-to-grave treatment. These sorts of books can speak volumes to the essence of a person and give the reader an outsized impact without requiring the commitment of a door-stopping tome. When it comes to Grover Cleveland, for instance, I much preferred Matthew Algeo’s slim </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156976350X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=156976350X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The President Is a Sick Man</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the multiple 500+ page options. It also helped me realize that I don’t really care to know much more about Cleveland. </span></p>\n<h3>Read Authors You Know You Enjoy!<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you find an author you really like, stick with ‘em! This is sort of an obvious point, and yet when it comes to choosing the next subject of my reading endeavors, I don’t factor it in often enough. Jean Edward Smith, for example, writes incredibly readable and insightful books that have been among my favorites in the biography category. What I haven’t done yet, but should, is take up his books on John Marshall and Lucius Clay—less sexy subjects—rather than dive into unknown authorial waters with more recognizable subjects. Ditto for other writers I admire, like Walter Isaacson, Ron Chernow, Robert Massie, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, this is a tactic I’ve only half-heartedly put into practice thus far, but have been immensely rewarded by and plan on doing more of in the coming year. </span></p>\n<p><em>For more reading tips and book recommendations, subscribe to <a href=\"http://readmorebooks.substack.com\">my weekly newsletter</a>. </em></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-choose-a-biography-to-read/\">How to Choose a Biography to Read</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/0z_vhhC7u28\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 17:11:03 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"42cdba6b17fff7142dcc5648860d4f28","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jeremy Anderberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/bio1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn99@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-45-960_f529c386f5f019c5.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-roberts.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-35-485_0fd39ed1f6c9b90b.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/nap-zam2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn52@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-346_3adf75918b1aec3f.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/napoleon-amazon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-36-762_c5c0caa2304ed703.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/0z_vhhC7u28":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn91@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-376_9143b63123fb260f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673611018},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:11","title":"Podcast #666: The Power of Brevity in a Noisy World","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=132358","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/get-better-at-getting-to-the-point/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Get Better at Getting to the Point\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Going all the way back to the laconic Spartans, the ability to be succinct in one’s communications has been to others a sign of strength and a well-appreciated gesture.

His name is Joseph McCormack, and we begin our conversation with how his work grew out of his development of a communications curriculum for the military’s special operators. We then discuss how being brief is not just about conciseness but first about achieving clarity, and the high costs of not shaping our communications with these qualities — especially in a world where attention is a scarce resource. Joe explains why it’s actually harder to exercise verbal discipline than it is to use lots of words, and four techniques to make your messaging clear and concise. We then discuss how to apply these techniques to shortening meetings, condensing emails, and distilling how you describe your role when people ask what you do. We end our conversation with how to create more meaningful interactions during fluid conversations by actually preparing for these encounters, rather than simply trying to wing it. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What are the costs of not being brief in your communication?</li>\n<li>Why concise messaging is so important in our modern world </li>\n<li>The illusion of “now” </li>\n<li>Why is it hard to be concise?</li>\n<li>What does it mean to map your communications?</li>\n<li>How to prioritize the information you’re passing along </li>\n<li>Why stories work so much better than rote information delivery</li>\n<li>Why you need to use the TRACs framework </li>\n<li>Using visuals as a boon and not a detriment </li>\n<li>Making meetings better</li>\n<li>Sending better emails </li>\n<li>How saying less makes good news more impactful, and bad news less disruptive </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119553377/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1119553377&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Noise</em></a> by Joe McCormack</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/email-tips/\">How to Manage Inbox Overload and Actually Get Stuff Done</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-580-why-people-do-or-dont-listen-to-you/\">Why People Do (or Don’t) Listen to You</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-649-thinking-for-yourself-in-an-age-of-outsourced-expertise/\">Thinking for Yourself in an Age of Outsourced Expertise</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-tell-better-stories/\">How to Tell Better Stories</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/3-simple-steps-to-telling-a-great-story-book-giveaway/\">3 Simple Steps for Telling a Great Story</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/tag/listen-up/\">AoM series on listening and craft good questions/responses</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/one-mistake-never-to-make-when-leading-a-meeting/\">One Mistake Never to Make When Leading a Meeting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-run-a-meeting/\">How to Run a Meeting</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-132360\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/brief-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/brief-1.jpg 363w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/12/brief-1-320x485.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Joe</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://thebrieflab.com\">BRIEF Lab</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

He was in despair, sitting “at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was at this point that the boy’s father sat next to him, put an arm around his shoulder, and offered some words of comfort and counsel:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since reading this anecdote a decade back, “Take it bird by bird” has become one of the most oft-repeated maxims around the McKay household. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often in life we feel overwhelmed by the enormity of certain undertakings — daunted by the sheer number of entries on our to-do lists, the magnitude of challenges required by a professional project, or the breadth of what we need to change about ourselves to become the people we wish to be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s so much to be done, and the nature of the tasks is so tedious or demanding, that the prospect of ever getting it all finished feels impossible. We are paralyzed into inaction before we’ve even begun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than trying to put your arms around the whole thing, attempting to see the end from the beginning, break it into parts. Focus on a single piece. What is the next action you can take? Get that knocked out.

And every year, I’d end up muttering swear words under my breath while Nat King Cole crooned in the background about the joys of a decked-out tannenbaum.</p>\n<p>I kept running into a set of perennial problems that made putting the lights on the tree an exasperating task. But over time, I slowly worked out remedies for each that have made the job easier and increasingly efficient. </p>\n<p>The first problem was that the lights wouldn’t work after I put them on; it’s a terrible feeling to get all the lights strung on a tree only to discover they’re defunct because a single bulb is burnt out. Thus, I now meticulously test each strand before it goes on the tree. </p>\n<p>Another problem that kept popping up was that when I strung the lights from the top of the tree to the bottom, by the time I got to the bottom, the lights would look too sparse. Since the bottom is wider, it takes more lights to fill it out, and I’d end up having to add some strands, but in a more haphazard way, since they weren’t part of the around-the-whole-tree flow. So now I begin to string the lights from the bottom, which allows me to plug them in before I start, and ensures that I can see how they look as I go and affirm that I have enough lights at the base before moving on up.</p>\n<p>A final reoccurring issue was that the lights wouldn’t look like they had enough depth. In years past, I’d just sort of hang the lights on the ends of the branches, resulting in a tree that didn’t have a look and brightness that was sufficiently three-dimensional, and again forcing me to add in more lights after I thought I was done. To solve the problem, I’ve learned to alternate stringing the lights in towards the trunk and out towards the tips of the branches as I work my way up the tree. </p>\n<p>By implementing these techniques, my annual lighting job now goes a lot smoother. Hopefully they’ll work for you too, so you can save your swearing for when you’re fixing the furnace. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storytellersworkshop.com/\"><em>Illustrated by Ted
