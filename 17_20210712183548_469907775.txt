A century later, James Baldwin echoed the sentiment in his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/08/james-baldwin-advice-on-writing/\">advice on writing</a>, observing: “Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance.”</p>\n<p>But for those of us who show up to do what we do day after day, inner rain or shine, as the days unspool into years &#8212; <em>Brain Pickings</em> turns 15 this year &#8212; there is something more than white-knuckle discipline making the steadfast labor not only bearable, not only sustainable, but vitalizing, inspiriting, joyful. What fuels the engine of endurance is a passionate enchantment &#8212; something of which Baldwin&#8217;s &#8220;love&#8221; reflects a glimmer but does not fully capture. </p>\n<p>The most marvelous part of it is this: It is an enchantment we cast upon ourselves.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72916\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642772_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=680%2C801&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72916\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=320%2C377&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=600%2C707&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=240%2C283&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=768%2C905&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.

If we connect a sense of joy with our writing, we may be inclined to explore further. What&#8217;s there to find out? Perhaps too much stock has been placed in big ideas or even small ones &#8212; a myth! &#8212; but regularity seems like a key. Don&#8217;t start with a big idea. Start with a phrase, a line, a quote. Questions are very helpful. Begin with a few you&#8217;re carrying right now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In consonance with John Steinbeck&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/02/john-steinbeck-working-days/\">life-tested, Nobel-earning conviction</a> that &#8220;in writing, habit seems to be a much stronger force than either willpower or inspiration,&#8221; she adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Small increments of writing time may matter more than we could guess. One thing leads to many &#8212; swerving off, linking up, opening of voices and images and memories. Nearby notebooks &#8212; or iPads or tablets or laptops &#8212; are surely helpful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With this, Nye turns to the ongoing dialogue between the magic of creation and the mechanics of discipline:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Make a plan, and return to it. It&#8217;s a party to which we keep inviting ourselves.</p>\n<p>And we have so many realms of material that are very close by:</p>\n<p>Families<br />\nNeighborhoods<br />\nChanges<br />\nMemories<br />\nSpoken language woven into poems &#8212; something someone said to you a long time ago and you still remember it &#8212; why, out of all the talk, do you remember that thing?<br />\nPets<br />\nLosses<br />\nFirst Times<br />\nLast Times<br />\nFears<br />\nFriends<br />\nBeing Sick, Being Well<br />\nWhat we see out our windows<br />\nGifts<br />\nHistory &#8212; what used to be in this very place where we are sitting now?</p>\n<p>Start anywhere.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although such constructed starting points might seem mechanistic, they are the lever that unlatches the expanse where the unexpected can begin to unfurl. That incubus where ideas collide with one another into <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/16/rilke-inspiration-creativity/\">the unconscious combinatorial process we call creativity</a> is also the place where the joy of all creative labor lives. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72914\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642738_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=680%2C979&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"979\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72914\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=320%2C461&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=600%2C864&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=240%2C346&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=768%2C1106&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.

You have no idea where this thing might be going. Write in nuggets &#8212; here are my questions, here are some details I saw within the last 24 hours, here are some quotes I heard people say today.

Now consider that our memory only retains a fraction of what we have attended to in moments past. In the act of recollection, we take these fragments of fragments and try to reconstruct from them a totality of a remembered reality, playing out in the theater of the mind &#8212; a stage on which, as neuroscientist Antonio Damasio has observed in his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/05/antonio-damasio-the-feeling-of-what-happens-mind-body/\">landmark work on consciousness</a>, we often &#8220;use our minds not to discover facts, but to hide them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We do this on the personal level &#8212; out of such selective memory and by such exquisite exclusion, we compose the narrative that is <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/01/15/oliver-sacks-identity-self-narrative/\">the psychological pillar of our identity</a>. We do it on the cultural level &#8212; what we call history is a collective selective memory that excludes far more of the past&#8217;s realities than it includes. Borges captured this with his characteristic poetic-philosophical precision when he observed that &#8220;we are our memory&#8230; that chimerical museum of shifting shapes, that pile of broken mirrors.&#8221; To be aware of memory&#8217;s chimera is to recognize the slippery, shape-shifting nature of even those truths we think we are grasping most firmly. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/22/the-book-of-memory-gaps-cecilia-ruiz/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thebookofmemorygaps_ceciliaruiz8.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Cecilia Ruiz from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/22/the-book-of-memory-gaps-cecilia-ruiz/\"><em>The Book of Memory Gaps</em></a>, inspired by Borges</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Nearly a century after Nietzsche admonished that what we call <em>truth</em> is <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/03/26/nietzsche-on-truth-and-lies-in-a-nonmoral-sense/\">&#8220;a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms&#8230; a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished,&#8221;</a> the great Japanese filmmaker <strong>Akira Kurosawa</strong> (March 23, 1910&#8211;September 6, 1998) created an exquisite cinematic metaphor for the slippery memory-mediated nature of truth in his 1950 film <em>Rashomon</em>, based on Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s short story &#8220;In a Grove&#8221; &#8212; a psychological-philosophical thriller about the murder of a samurai and its four witnesses, who each recount a radically different reality, each equally believable, thus undermining our most elemental trust in truth. </p>\n<p>As researchers in the second half of the twentieth century came to shed light on the foibles of memory, Kurosawa&#8217;s masterpiece lent its name to the amply documented unreliability of eyewitness accounts.

For there is only one solitude, and it is large and not easy to bear. It comes almost all the time when you’d gladly exchange it for any togetherness, however banal and cheap; exchange it for the appearance of however strong a conformity with the ordinary, with the least worthy. But perhaps that is precisely the time when solitude ripens; its ripening can be painful as the growth of a boy and sad like the beginning of spring&#8230; What is needed is only this: solitude, great inner solitude. Going within and meeting no one else for hours &#8212; that is what one must learn to attain. To be solitary as one was as a child. As the grown-ups were moving about, preoccupied with things that seemed big and important because the grown-ups appeared so busy and because you couldn’t understand what they were doing.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/25/ruth-krauss-maurice-sendak-open-house-for-butterflies/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/openhouseforbutterflies18.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration by Maurice Sendak from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/25/ruth-krauss-maurice-sendak-open-house-for-butterflies/\"><em>Open House for Butterflies</em></a> by Ruth Krauss.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Echoing Kierkegaard&#8217;s ever-timely insistence that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/05/kierkegaard-on-presence-unhappiness/\">&#8220;of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems&#8230; to be busy&#8221;</a> and Emerson&#8217;s observation that &#8220;our hurry &#038; embarrassment look ridiculous&#8221; the moment we pause <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/02/28/emerson-journals-surfaces/\">the headlong rush of sociality through which we try to escape from ourselves</a>, Rilke adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If one day one grasps that their busyness is pathetic, their occupations frozen and disconnected from life, why then not continue to see like a child, see it as strange, see it out of the depth of one’s own world, the vastness of one’s own solitude, which is, in itself, work and status and vocation?</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66748\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/solitude-by-maria-popova_print?sku=s6-11544229p4a1v2?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=680%2C907&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"907\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66748\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=240%2C320&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=320%2C427&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Solitude&#8221; by Maria Popova.

In another letter penned the following spring, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Don’t let your solitude obscure the presence of something within it that wants to emerge. Precisely this presence will help your solitude expand. People are drawn to the easy and to the easiest side of the easy. But it is clear that we must hold ourselves to the difficult, as is true for everything alive. Everything in nature grows and defends itself in its own way and against all opposition, straining from within and at any price to become distinctively itself. It is good to be solitary, because solitude is difficult, and that a thing is difficult must be even more of a reason for us to undertake it.</p>\n<p>To love is good too, for love is difficult. For one person to care for another, that is perhaps the most difficult thing required of us, the utmost and final test, the work for which all other work is but a preparation. With our whole being, with all the strength we have gathered, we must learn to love. This learning is ever a committed and enduring process.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64208\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/how-calm-how-solemn-it-grows-to-ascend-the-atmosphere-of-lovers_print?sku=s6-8967910p4a1v45?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=680%2C899&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"899\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64208\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=240%2C317&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=320%2C423&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=768%2C1015&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=600%2C793&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

It is a noble calling for the individual to ripen, to differentiate, to become a world in oneself in response to another. It is a great, immodest call that singles out a person and summons them beyond all boundaries. Only in this sense may we use the love that has been given us. This is humanity’s task, for which we are still barely ready.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>This more human love (endlessly considerate and light and good and clear, consummated by holding close and letting go) will resemble that love that we so arduously prepare &#8212; the love that consists of two solitudes that protect, border, and greet each other.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64219\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/11/leaves-of-grass-margaret-cook/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1543\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64219\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

But anything expected of us is hard. Almost everything that matters is hard, and everything matters&#8230; Come to your own relationship to sex, free of custom and convention. Then you need not fear to lose yourself and become unworthy of your better nature.</p>\n<p>Sexual pleasure is a sensory experience, no different from pure seeing or pure touch, like the taste of a fruit. It is a great, endless experience given to us, a natural part of knowing our world, of the fullness and brilliance of every knowing. And nothing we receive is wrong. What’s wrong is to misuse and spoil this experience and to use it to excite the exhausted aspects of our lives, to dissipate rather than connect.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Long before scientists shed light on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/14/bumbebees-glouson/\">how the sexuality of early flora and fauna gave our planet its beauty</a>, Rilke adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seeing the beauty in animals and plants is a form of love and longing; and we can see the animal, as we see the plant, patient and willing to come together and increase &#8212; not out of physical lust, not out of suffering, but bowing to necessities that are greater than lust and suffering and more powerful than will and resistance. </p>\n<p>Oh that humans might humbly receive and earnestly bear this mystery that fills the earth down to the smallest thing, and feel it as part of life’s travail, instead of taking it lightly. If they could only be respectful of this fertility, which is undivided, whether in spiritual or physical form. For this spiritual creativity stems from the physical, derives from that erotic essence, and is but an airier, more delightful, more eternal iteration of its lush sensuality.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69840\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/red-poppy-by-elizabeth-blackwell-from-a-curious-herbal-1737-benefits-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=680%2C986&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"986\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69840\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?w=1429&#38;ssl=1 1429w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=240%2C348&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=320%2C464&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=768%2C1114&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=600%2C870&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Red poppy from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/29/elizabeth-blackwell-curious-herbal/\"><em>A Curious Herbal</em></a> by Elizabeth Blackwell, 1737.

though hardly a surprise, that children&#8217;s minds are <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/19/james-geary-i-is-an-other-children-metaphor/\">machines for metaphor</a>. We are meaning-making creatures &#8212; from the moment we begin trying to make sense of the world, and even as we <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/01/alan-watts-wisdom-of-insecurity-3/\">face the terrifying prospect of its meaninglessness</a>, the familiar becomes our foothold for the unfamiliar; the images that already carry meaning, already invoke felt feeling-tones, become mirrors and magnifying glasses for those that don&#8217;t yet. Our entire experience of reality, bent through the lens of our meaning-hungry consciousness, becomes, as Nietzsche memorably put it, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/03/26/nietzsche-on-truth-and-lies-in-a-nonmoral-sense/\">&#8220;a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms.&#8221;</a> Out of that moving host, the entire ecosystem of meaning we call art is born.</p>\n<p>That is what <strong>Jane Hirshfield</strong> &#8212; a poet capable of compressing <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/15/today-another-universe-jane-hirshfield-ledger-jasmine/\">a universe of meaning into a mouthful of words</a>, a thinker of uncommon insight into <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/21/jane-hirshfield-concentration/\">how language concentrates and consecrates reality</a>, and an ordained Buddhist whose contemplative practice animates her creative practice &#8212; explores in this lovely animated meditation on the magic of metaphor from my friends at <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/ted-ed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TED-Ed</a>:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The art of the metaphor - Jane Hirshfield\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0edKgL9EgM?feature=oembed&#38;rel=0&#38;controls=0&#38;showinfo=0&#38;iv_load_policy=3\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>A good metaphor&#8230; is a way to let you feel and know something differently.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Metaphors give words a way to go beyond their own meaning. They are handles on the door of what we can know and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house and some new world that only that one handle can open. </p>\n<p>What&#8217;s amazing is this: By making a handle, you can make a world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She takes up the subject throughout her book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ten-Windows-Great-Poems-Transform/dp/0345806840/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Ten Windows: How Great Poems Transform the World</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/ten-windows-how-great-poems-transform-the-world/oclc/950635295&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; which gave us her soulful meditation on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/10/02/jane-hirshfield-ten-windows-poetry/\">how art transforms us</a> &#8212; and writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aristotle, in his <em>Rhetoric</em>, alludes to the kinship between metaphor and riddle, calling each a source for the other. Not only does solving a riddle depend on the ability to think metaphorically, all metaphor preserves some flavor of a puzzle. A metaphor is language that simultaneously creates and solves its own riddle; within that minute explosion of mind is both expansion and release. Perhaps this is why riddles abound among the earliest poems in many traditions and why spiritual teaching so often partakes of the riddling: it is how the mind instructs itself in a more complex seeing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with her short, splendid poems <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/14/jane-hirshfield-optimism-kelli-anderson-animation/\">&#8220;Optimism&#8221;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/23/the-weighing-jane-hirshfield/\">&#8220;The Weighing&#8221;</a> &#8212; both masterpieces of metaphor &#8212; then dwell with this <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/06/10/the-mirror-of-enigmas-borges-bloy/\">living metaphor for the riddle of life</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

Momentary loneliness, anyway. It comes from a vague core of the self &#8212; like a disease of the blood, dispersed throughout the body so that one cannot locate the matrix, the spot of contagion. </p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>This loneliness will blur and diminish, no doubt, when tomorrow I plunge again into classes, into the necessity of studying for exams. But now, that false purpose is lifted and I am spinning in a temporary vacuum&#8230; The routine is momentarily suspended and I am lost. There is no living being on earth at this moment except myself. I could walk down the halls, and empty rooms would yawn mockingly at me from every side.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Peering beyond the immediate situation, beyond this particular moment in life, she casts a darkly prognostic eye toward the rosary of moments stringing her uncertain future &#8212; a future that would soon include <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/25/sylvia-plath-meets-ted-hughes/\">a passionate but damaging love</a>, a future cut short by her lonely pain &#8212; and adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of “parties” with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter &#8212; they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship &#8212; but the loneliness of the soul in it’s appalling self-consciousness, is horrible and overpowering.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_62202\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian2.jpg?resize=680%2C777&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"777\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62202\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian2.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian2.jpg?resize=240%2C274&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian2.jpg?resize=320%2C366&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian2.jpg?resize=768%2C878&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sylviaplath_smithsonian2.jpg?resize=600%2C686&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Self-Portrait, late 1940s or early 1950s &#8212; one of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/17/sylvia-plath-one-life-smithsonian-visual-art/\">Sylvia Plath&#8217;s little-known paintings</a>.

But her concrete tragedy &#8212; which is a common tragedy: so often our unhealed wounds lead us to people whose claws fit those wounds and deepen them &#8212; is contoured by the luminous negative space of the opposite possibility: Some loves can unseal, irradiate, and heal those small dark old places in us where joy has been compacted into a hard dense loneliness. This possibility is folded into a glorious, maddening Möbius strip of trust: The very relationships in which we can begin to grow those twin roots of the soul require a level of trust to begin the terrifying process of being known &#8212; a process Adrienne Rich placed at the heart of every relationship in which two people have together earned the right to use the word &#8220;love,&#8221; a truly honorable relationship shaped by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/02/adrienne-rich-honorable-human-relationship/\">&#8220;a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other.&#8221;</a></p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

It takes a special grandeur of spirit to know the limits of your self-knowledge. </p>\n<p>A recent brush with those limits reminded me of a short, stunning essay by <strong>Jorge Luis Borges</strong> (August 24, 1899&#8211;June 14, 1986) titled &#8220;The Mirror of Enigmas,&#8221; found in his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Labyrinths-Directions-Paperbook-Jorge-Borges/dp/0811216993/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Labyrinths</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/labyrinths-selected-stories-other-writings/oclc/260942&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; the 1962 collection of stories, essays, and parables that gave us his timeless <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/06/borges-and-i/\">parable of the divided self</a> and his classic <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/19/a-new-refutation-of-time-borges/\">refutation of time</a>.</p>\n<p>Titling the essay after St. Paul&#8217;s famous cryptic statement <em>Videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate</em> &#8212; loosely translated as <em>We now see through a mirror, enigmatically</em> &#8212; Borges considers the tribe of thinkers who have perched their efforts to reconcile knowledge and mystery, the scientific and the spiritual, on the assumption that &#8220;the history of the universe &#8212; and in it our lives and the most tenuous detail of our lives &#8212; has an incalculable, symbolical value.&#8221; With his characteristic poetic precision, he condenses this common and somewhat tired hypothesis: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The outer world &#8212; forms, temperatures, the moon &#8212; is a language humans have forgotten or which we can scarcely distinguish.</p></blockquote>\n<p>No one, Borges argues, has taken this precarious hypothesis to more surefooted ground than the French novelist, poet, and philosophical pamphleteer <strong>Léon Bloy</strong> (July 11, 1846&#8211;November 3, 1917). </p>\n<p>Digging through the surviving fragments of Bloy&#8217;s written thought, he surfaces a passage emblematic of Bloy&#8217;s uncommon physics of the metaphysical &#8212; an 1894 passage fomented by his interest in the teachings of St. Paul. Translated by Borges himself, Bloy writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[St. Paul&#8217;s statement] would be a skylight through which one might submerge himself in the true Abyss, which is the soul of man. The terrifying immensity of the firmament&#8217;s abyss is an illusion, an external reflection of <em>our own</em> abysses, perceived &#8220;in a mirror.&#8221; We should invert our eyes and practice a sublime astronomy in the infinitude of our heart&#8230; If we see the Milky Way, it is because it <em>actually exists in our souls</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72737\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-thomas-wrights-an-original-theory-or-new-hypothesis-of-the-universe-1750_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=680%2C977&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"977\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72737\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=240%2C345&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=320%2C460&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=768%2C1103&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=600%2C862&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from Thomas Wright&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/02/16/thomas-wright-original-theory/\"><em>An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe</em></a>, 1750 &#8212; the first book to describe the spiral shape of the Milky Way.

On the line requesting the reason for resignation, she had stated plainly: &#8220;To devote my time to writing.&#8221; But she was also leaving for the freedom to use her public voice as an instrument of change, awakening the world&#8217;s ecological conscience with her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/08/rachel-carson-washington-post-letter-1953/\">bold open letters</a> holding the government accountable for its exploitation of nature. </p>\n<p>Fifteen years earlier, at age twenty-nine, <strong>Rachel Carson</strong> (May 27, 1907&#8211;April 14, 1964) had gotten her start at the lowest rungs of the government agency as a field aide hired at $6.50 an hour. Wading through tide pools and annual marine census reports as a junior aquatic biologist, she had found her voice as a writer with an uncommon gift for walking the teeming shoreline between the scientific and the poetic. In an unexampled essay that eventually bloomed into <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/08/21/rachel-carson-the-sea-around-us-blue/\"><em>The Sea Around Us</em></a>, which won her the National Book Award, she had <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/28/undersea-rachel-carson/\">invited the human imagination undersea</a>, into a world then more mysterious than the Moon. Now, forty-five and finally free from the day-job by which she had been supporting her mother, her sister, and the young nephew she adopted and raised as her son after her sister&#8217;s death, Carson set out to fulfill her childhood dream of living by the ocean. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_60151\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/rachel-carson/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachelcarson_undersea.jpg?resize=680%2C398&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"398\" class=\"size-full wp-image-60151\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachelcarson_undersea.jpg?w=850&#38;ssl=1 850w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachelcarson_undersea.jpg?resize=240%2C141&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachelcarson_undersea.jpg?resize=320%2C187&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachelcarson_undersea.jpg?resize=768%2C450&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachelcarson_undersea.jpg?resize=600%2C352&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rachel Carson</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After searching along the New England coast, she fell in love with West Southport &#8212; a picturesque island in Maine, nestled among evergreens and oaks in the estuary of the Sheepscot River, where seals frequented the beach and whales billowed by as though torn from the pages of her beloved Melville.

Watching the fog engulf the rocks beneath her study window as the night tide rolls in, she considers the totality of being, which the world&#8217;s oceans contour and connect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hearing the rising tide, I think how it is pressing also against other shores I know &#8212; rising on a southern beach where there is no fog, but a moon edging all the waves with silver and touching the wet sands with lambent sheen, and on a still more distant shore sending its streaming currents against the moonlit pinnacles and the dark caves of the coral rock. </p>\n<p>Then in my thoughts these shores, so different in their nature and in the inhabitants they support, are made one by the unifying touch of the sea. For the differences I sense in this particular instant of time that is mine are but the differences of a moment, determined by our place in the stream of time and in the long rhythms of the sea. Once this rocky coast beneath me was a plain of sand; then the sea rose and found a new shore line. And again in some shadowy future the surf will have ground these rocks to sand and will have returned the coast to its earlier state. And so in my mind’s eye these coastal forms merge and blend in a shifting, kaleidoscopic pattern in which there is no finality, no ultimate and fixed reality &#8212; earth becoming fluid as the sea itself.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73641\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-great-wave-off-kanagawa-by-hokusai-1831_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greatwave_hokusai.jpg?resize=680%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"457\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73641\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greatwave_hokusai.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greatwave_hokusai.jpg?resize=320%2C215&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greatwave_hokusai.jpg?resize=600%2C404&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greatwave_hokusai.jpg?resize=240%2C161&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greatwave_hokusai.jpg?resize=768%2C516&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</em> by Japanese artist Hokusai, 1831.

The meaning haunts and ever eludes us, and in its very pursuit we approach the ultimate mystery of Life itself.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73613\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/chart-from-geographical-portfolio-by-levi-walter-yaggy-18875256960_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yaggi_nature_sm.jpg?resize=680%2C460&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"460\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73613\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yaggi_nature_sm.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yaggi_nature_sm.jpg?resize=320%2C216&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yaggi_nature_sm.jpg?resize=600%2C406&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yaggi_nature_sm.jpg?resize=240%2C162&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yaggi_nature_sm.jpg?resize=768%2C519&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <em>Geographical Portfolio &#8212; Comprising Physical, Political, Geological, and Astronomical Geography</em> by Levi Walter Yaggy, 1887.

Once you have entered such a world, its fascination grows and somehow you find your mind has gained a new dimension, a new perspective &#8212; and always thereafter you find yourself remember[ing] the beauty and strangeness and wonder of that world &#8212; a world that is as real, as much a part of the universe, as our own.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_62269\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/rachel-carson/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rachelcarson_1951.jpg?resize=680%2C338&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"338\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62269\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rachelcarson_1951.jpg?w=700&#38;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rachelcarson_1951.jpg?resize=240%2C119&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rachelcarson_1951.jpg?resize=320%2C159&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rachelcarson_1951.jpg?resize=600%2C298&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rachel Carson, 1951</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Savor more of Carson&#8217;s lyrical reverence for the sea and the strange wonder of life in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/01/figuring/\"><em>Figuring</em></a></em>.

When the time came to settle on a permanent name, he invited the man in whose home was taking refuge &#8212; a free black man devoted to helping fugitive slaves &#8212; to choose for him, as a token of gratitude. His host suggested Douglas &#8212; the self-possessed Highlander hero of one of the era&#8217;s greatest literary blockbusters, Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s poem <em>The Lady of the Lake</em>.

Here was an orphan with no sense of roots, an aching ambivalence about his parentage, and a longing for communal belonging.

Growing up amid the intellectual ferment of abolition, she grasped the terrors of slavery only abstractly, as an idea and not a felt reality, not fully imagining how other children who looked like her lived very different lives, how people who looked like her parents died gruesome deaths. Then, as a young woman, she performed one of those rare, triumphal acts that signify true maturity and grandeur of spirit: changing one&#8217;s mind as it expands to take in a broader perspective and publicly acknowledging one&#8217;s previously limited views. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73691\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/flowers-and-scroll-1833_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rose_scroll.jpg?resize=680%2C835&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"835\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73691\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rose_scroll.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rose_scroll.jpg?resize=320%2C393&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rose_scroll.jpg?resize=600%2C737&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rose_scroll.jpg?resize=240%2C295&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rose_scroll.jpg?resize=768%2C943&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unsigned rose and scroll, likely by Sarah Mapps Douglass, from Amy Matilda Cassey&#8217;s friendship album.

She told the women gathered before her:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An English writer has said, ‘We must feel deeply before we can act rightly; from that absorbing, heart-rendering compassion for ourselves springs a deeper sympathy for others, and from a sense of our weakness and our own upbraidings arises a disposition to be indulgent, to forbear, to forgive.’ This is my experience. One short year ago, how different were my feelings on the subject of slavery! It is true, the wail of the captive sometimes came to my ear in the midst of my happiness, and caused my heart to bleed for his wrongs; but, alas! the impression was as evanescent as the early cloud and morning dew. I had formed a little world of my own, and cared not to move beyond its precincts. But how was the scene changed when I beheld the oppressor lurking on the border of my own peaceful home! I saw his iron hand stretched forth to seize me as his prey, and the cause of the slave became my own.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following year, in a friendship album compiled by her Philadelphian friend and fellow activist Amy Matilda Cassey, Sarah Mapps Douglass fused her twin loves of literature and nature with her artistic acumen in a series of consummate flowers she painted alongside selections from poems she transcribed in her lovely longhand. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73690\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/flowers-by-sarah-mapps-douglass-1833_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sarahmappsdouglass_flower.jpg?resize=680%2C844&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"844\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73690\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sarahmappsdouglass_flower.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sarahmappsdouglass_flower.jpg?resize=320%2C397&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sarahmappsdouglass_flower.jpg?resize=600%2C745&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sarahmappsdouglass_flower.jpg?resize=240%2C298&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sarahmappsdouglass_flower.jpg?resize=768%2C953&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flowers by Sarah Mapps Douglass, with transcribed anonymous poem.

an emissary of spacetime, reaching its rays across twenty-five lightyears to imprint the photographic plate with a image of the star as it had been twenty-five years earlier, immortalizing a moment already long gone. </p>\n<p>And yet in a cosmological sense, what exists is precious not because it will one day be lost but because it has overcome the staggering odds of never having existed at all: Within the fraction of matter in the universe that is not dark matter, a fraction of atoms cohered into the elements necessary to form the complex structures necessary for life, of which a tiny portion cohered into the seething cauldron of complexity we call consciousness &#8212; the tiny, improbable fraction of a fraction of a fraction with which we have the perishable privilege of contemplating the universe in our poetry and our physics. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/152474901X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Probable Impossibilities: Musings on Beginnings and Endings</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/probable-impossibilities-musings-on-beginnings-and-endings/oclc/1161997924&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>), the poetic physicist <strong>Alan Lightman</strong> sieves four centuries of scientific breakthroughs, from Kepler&#8217;s revolutionary laws of planetary motion to the thousands of habitable exoplanets discovered by NASA&#8217;s <em>Kepler</em> mission, to estimate that even with habitable planets orbiting one tenth of all stars, the faction of living matter in the universe is about one-billionth of one-billionth: If all the matter in the universe were the Gobi desert, life would be but a single grain of sand. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thelittleprince_morgan7.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/03/exupery-little-prince-morgan-drawings/\">original watercolors for <em>The Little Prince</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Along the way, Lightman draws delicate lines of figuring from Hindu cosmology to quantum gravity, from Pascal to inflation theory, from Lucretius to Henrietta Leavitt and Edwin Hubble &#8212; lines contouring the most elemental questions that have always animated humanity, questions that are themselves the answer to what it means to be human.</p>\n<p>Building on his lifelong passion for harmonizing our touching human partialities with the fundamental reality of an impartial universe &#8212;

he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we have struggled through the ages to fathom this strange and wondrous cosmos in which we find ourselves, few ideas have been richer than the concept of nothingness. For to understand anything, as Aristotle argued, we must understand what it is not. To understand matter, said the ancient Greeks, we must understand the “void,” or the absence of matter.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because we are self-referential creatures &#8212; the consequence of being creatures with selves, itself the consequence of consciousness and the ceaseless electrical storm of neural firings that gives rise to our sense of self &#8212; no void troubles us more than that of our own mortality: the notion of our absence from the scene of life. It is difficult enough to grasp how somethingness could have arisen from nothingness &#8212; how the universe can exist at all. It savages the mind and its animating selfhood to consider that everything &#8212; including the subset constituting the particular something of us &#8212; could dissolve to nothingness. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/10/song-of-two-worlds-alan-lightman-derek-dominic-dsouza/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/songoftwoworlds3.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Derek Dominic D’souza from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/10/song-of-two-worlds-alan-lightman-derek-dominic-dsouza/\"><em>Song of Two Worlds</em></a> by Alan Lightman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It is a discomposing notion &#8212; even for a physicist without delusion about the materiality of life, with a soulful reverence for the poetry of existence. Lightman closes his essay on the science of nothingness with a sentiment of touching, inescapable humanity:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What I feel and I know is that I am here now, at this moment in the grand sweep of time. I am not part of the void. I am not a fluctuation in the quantum vacuum. Even though I understand that someday my atoms will be scattered in soil and in air, that I will no longer exist, I am alive now. I am feeling this moment. I can see my hand on my writing desk. I can feel the warmth of the Sun through the window. And looking out, I can see a pine-needled path that goes down to the sea.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another essay, titled &#8220;Immortality,&#8221; explores this irreconcilable dissonance between the creaturely and the cosmic &#8212; the dissonance from which we make our most symphonic art as we try to fathom our existence. Lying in his hammock one summer day, Lightman observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A hundred years from now, I’ll be gone, but many of these spruce and cedars will still be here. The wind going through them will still sound like a distant waterfall. The curve of the land will be the same as it is now. The paths that I wander may still be here, although probably covered with new vegetation. The rocks and ledges on the shore will be here, including a particular ledge I’m quite fond of, shaped like the knuckled back of a large animal. Sometimes, I sit on that ledge and wonder if it will remember me. Even my house might still be here, or at least the concrete posts of its footing, crumbling in the salt air. But eventually, of course, even this land will shift and change and dissolve. Nothing persists in the material world. All of it changes and passes away.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73675\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/non-space-by-robert-fludd-1617_print?sku=s6-20687244p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/robertfludd_vacuum1.jpg?resize=680%2C672&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"672\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73675\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/robertfludd_vacuum1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/robertfludd_vacuum1.jpg?resize=320%2C316&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/robertfludd_vacuum1.jpg?resize=600%2C593&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/robertfludd_vacuum1.jpg?resize=240%2C237&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/robertfludd_vacuum1.jpg?resize=768%2C758&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Robert Fludd&#8217;s pioneering 1617 conception of non-space, long before the notion of the vacuum existed in cosmology.

With an eye to consciousness &#8212; &#8220;the seemingly strange experience&#8221; that furnishes &#8220;the most profound and troubling aspect of human existence&#8221; &#8212; he argues that death is not the life-switch in the off position but the gradual dimming of consciousness, of our experience of aliveness, through the deterioration of its physical infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Ever since Cecilia Payne <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/05/08/cecilia-payne-harvard-observatory-radio-talks/\">discovered the chemical fingerprint of the universe</a>, we have known that the atoms we are made of &#8212; seven thousand trillion trillion atoms in each of us, on average &#8212; were forged in the furnace of faraway stars. We know, too, that every cell in our bodies &#8212; the tendons that stiffen our fists and the cortices that kindle our tenderness &#8212; is made of atoms. Lightman writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To an alien intelligence, each of us human beings would appear to be an assemblage of atoms, humming with our various electrical and chemical energies.

A century after Virginia Woolf observed that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/06/virginia-woolf-soul-aging/\">“one can’t write directly about the soul [for] looked at, it vanishes,”</a> Lightman writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The soul, as commonly understood, we cannot discuss scientifically. Not so with consciousness, and the closely related Self. Isn’t the experience of consciousness and Self an illusion caused by those trillions of neuronal connections and electrical and chemical flows? If you don’t like the word <em>illusion</em>, then you can stick with the sensation itself. You can say that what we call the Self is a name we give to the mental sensation of certain electrical and chemical flows in our neurons. That sensation is rooted in the material brain. And I do not mean to diminish the brain in any way by affirming its materiality. The human brain is capable of all of the wondrous feats of imagination and self-reflection and thought that we ascribe to our highest existence. But I do claim that it’s all atoms and molecules. If the alien intelligence examined a human being in detail, he/she/it would see fluids flowing, sodium and potassium gates opening and closing as electricity races through nerve cells, acetylcholine molecules migrating between synapses. But he/she/it would not find a Self. The Self and consciousness, I think, are names we give to the sensations produced by all of those electrical and chemical flows.</p>\n<p>If someone began disassembling my brain one neuron at a time, depending on where the process began I might first lose a few motor skills, then some memories, then perhaps the ability to find particular words to make sentences, the ability to recognize faces, the ability to know where I was. During this slow taking apart of my brain, I would become more and more disoriented. Everything I associate with my ego and Self would gradually dissolve away into a bog of confusion and minimal existence. The doctors in their blue and green scrub suits could drop the removed neurons, one by one, into a metal bowl. Each a tiny gray gelatinous blob. Stringy with the axons and dendrites. Soft, so you would not hear the little thuds as each plopped in the bowl.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An understanding of death as &#8220;the name that we give to a collection of atoms that once had the special arrangement of a functioning neuronal network and now no longer does so&#8221; renders the boundary between life and death more like a shoreline redrawn by the receding tide pool than like a coastal cliff dropping off into the abyss. And yet even as a scientific materialist with no mystical inclinations and no belief in an afterlife, Lightman remains what we all are &#8212; fundamentally human in our special assemblage of atoms &#8212; and gives voice to that fundamental humanity with uncommon splendor of sentiment: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Despite my belief that I am only a collection of atoms, that my awareness is passing away neuron by neuron, I am content with the illusion of consciousness. I’ll take it. And I find a pleasure in knowing that a hundred years from now, even a thousand years from now, some of my atoms will remain in this place where I now lie in my hammock. Those atoms will not know where they came from, but they will have been mine. Some of them will once have been part of the memory of my mother dancing the bossa nova. Some will once have been part of the memory of the vinegary smell of my first apartment. Some will once have been part of my hand. If I could label each of my atoms at this moment, imprint each with my Social Security number, someone could follow them for the next thousand years as they floated in air, mixed with the soil, became parts of particular plants and trees, dissolved in the ocean and then floated again to the air. Some will undoubtedly become parts of other people, particular people. Some will become parts of other lives, other memories. That might be a kind of immortality.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72737\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-thomas-wrights-an-original-theory-or-new-hypothesis-of-the-universe-1750_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=680%2C977&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"977\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72737\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=240%2C345&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=320%2C460&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=768%2C1103&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=600%2C862&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from Thomas Wright&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/02/16/thomas-wright-original-theory/\"><em>An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe</em></a>, 1750 &#8212; the first book to describe the spiral shape of the Milky Way.

The cosmic brevity of &#8220;the era of life&#8221; is bookended on one end by the slow condensation of colossal gas clouds into the first stars that forged the first atoms large enough to form complex structures, after the universe had already existed for about one billion years, and bookended on the other by the eventual death of all stars when they burn out in several thousand billion years, leaving behind a dark lifeless expanse of pure spacetime. </p>\n<p>Here we each are, each existence a summer day suspended in the hammock of spacetime.</p>\n<p>And yet even in these cold unfeeling cosmic facts, Lightman finds reason to swell the brevity of existence with the warm feeling of kinship that makes life worth living. With an eye to his grain-of-Gobi-sand analogy, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Life in our universe is a flash in the pan, a few moments in the vast unfolding of time and space in the cosmos&#8230; A realization of the scarcity of life makes me feel some ineffable connection to other living things&#8230; a kinship in being among those few grains of sand in the desert, or present during the relatively brief era of life in the vast temporal sprawl of the universe.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>We share something in the vast corridors of this cosmos we find ourselves in. What exactly is it we share? Certainly, the mundane attributes of “life”: the ability to separate ourselves from our surroundings, to utilize energy sources, to grow, to reproduce, to evolve. I would argue that we “conscious” beings share something more during our relatively brief moment in the “era of life”: the ability to witness and reflect on the spectacle of existence, a spectacle that is at once mysterious, joyous, tragic, trembling, majestic, confusing, comic, nurturing, unpredictable and predictable, ecstatic, beautiful, cruel, sacred, devastating, exhilarating. The cosmos will grind on for eternity long after we’re gone, cold and unobserved. But for these few powers of ten, we have been. We have seen, we have felt, we have lived.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_68575\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/light-distribution-on-soap-bubble-from-le-monde-physique-1882_print?sku=s6-11475521p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?resize=680%2C993&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"993\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68575\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?w=2197&#38;ssl=1 2197w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?resize=240%2C351&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?resize=320%2C467&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?resize=768%2C1122&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?resize=600%2C876&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg?w=2040&#38;ssl=1 2040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Light distribution on soap bubble from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/08/20/amedee-guillemin-le-monde-physique/\"><em>Les phénomènes de la physique</em></a> by Amédée Guillemin, 1882.

It is the life-force by which visionaries survive the aloneness of their countercultural lives.</p>\n<p>That is what jazz legend <strong>John Coltrane</strong> (September 23, 1926&#8211;July 17, 1967) addressed in an extraordinary letter penned in the late spring of 1962, posthumously included in Cuthbert Ormond Simpkins&#8217;s excellent 1975 biography <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coltrane-Biography-Cuthbert-Ormond-Simpkins/dp/0933121202/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Coltrane</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/coltrane-a-biography/oclc/19749872?referer=br&#038;ht=edition\" target=\"_blabnk\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73841\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?resize=680%2C487&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"487\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73841\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?w=1968&#38;ssl=1 1968w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?resize=320%2C229&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?resize=240%2C172&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?resize=768%2C549&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?resize=1536%2C1099&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/johncoltrane.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Coltrane (Courtesy of <a href=\"http://johncoltrane.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">johncoltrane.com</a>.)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One June morning two years after the release of his epoch-making <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/01/26/synesthesia-music-visualization/\"><em>Giant Steps</em></a> and five years before his untimely death of cancer, Coltrane opened his mailbox to discover a package from the editor of <em>Downbeat</em> magazine, the premier journal of jazz, containing a gift: a copy of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Music-Imagination-Aaron-Copland/dp/B001JPF9KG/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Music and Imagination</em></a> &#8212; a book of the six lectures the great composer and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/09/aaron-copland-creative-experience/\">creativity-contemplator</a> Aaron Copland had delivered at Harvard a decade earlier. </p>\n<p>Coltrane&#8217;s letter of thanks for the gift unspools into one of those rare miracles when something small and seemingly peripheral prompts a sweeping yet succinct formulation of a visionary&#8217;s personal philosophy and creative credo &#8212; Coltrane&#8217;s most direct meditation on what it means to be an artist. </p>\n<p>Millennia after <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/02/pythagoras-sappho-music/\">Pythagoras&#8217;s revolutionary yet limited mathematics of music</a> forked the sonic path of the modern world by laying the structural foundation of the Western canon but failing to account for the intricate unstructured musical styles of the African diaspora and my own native Balkans &#8212; a cultural irony, given Pythagoras developed his theory on the island of Samos, a thriving cross-pollinator of the Ancient Greek world perched midway between Africa and the Balkans &#8212; Coltrane observes that Copland&#8217;s lectures, while erudite and philosophically insightful, speak more to musicians in the Western tradition than they do to jazz musicians. Against Copland&#8217;s concern about how difficult it can be for artists to find &#8220;a positive philosophy or justification&#8221; for their art, Coltrane holds up jazz as living counterpoint &#8212; a musical tradition that began as an affirmation of life amid unimaginable hardship, provided a lifeline for those who conceived it and partook of it, and has thrived on the wings of this inherent buoyancy. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/07/25/childrens-books-by-adult-authors-2/#langstonhughes\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/firstbookofjazz_hughes1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/07/25/childrens-books-by-adult-authors-2/#langstonhughes\"><em>The First Book of Jazz</em></a> by Langston Hughes, 1954</figcaption></figure>\n<p>He writes: </p>\n<blockquote><p>It is really easy for us [jazz musicians] to create. We are born with this feeling that just comes out no matter what conditions exist. Otherwise, how could our founding fathers have produced this music in the first place when they surely found themselves (as many of us do today) existing in hostile communities when there was everything to fear and damn few to trust. Any music which could grow and propagate itself as our music has, must have a hell of an affirmative belief inherent in it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since we read (and write) about other lives to make sense of our own, he reflects on a biography he has been reading of Van Gogh &#8212; an artist who spent his short, revolutionary, tragic life negotiating between <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/23/gauguin-van-gogh-ear/\">his private suffering</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/\">the irrepressible affirmative belief</a> that forever changed art. With an eye to Van Gogh, Coltrane writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Truth is indestructible&#8230; History shows (and it’s the same way today) that the innovator is more often than not met with some degree of condemnation; usually according to the degree of his departure from the prevailing modes of expression or what have you. Change is always so hard to accept.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73842\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vangogh_mulberry.jpg?resize=680%2C567&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"567\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73842\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vangogh_mulberry.jpg?w=1077&#38;ssl=1 1077w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vangogh_mulberry.jpg?resize=320%2C267&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vangogh_mulberry.jpg?resize=600%2C500&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vangogh_mulberry.jpg?resize=240%2C200&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vangogh_mulberry.jpg?resize=768%2C640&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vincent van Gogh: <em>The Mulberry Tree</em>, 1889.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a sentiment evocative of artist Egon Schiele&#8217;s observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/01/egon-schiele-letter/\">visionaries tend to come from the minority</a> and echoing the seventh of Bertrand Russell&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/05/02/a-liberal-decalogue-bertrand-russell/\">ten commandments of critical thinking</a> &#8212; <em>“Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.”</em> &#8212; Coltrane adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Innovators always seek to revitalize, extend and reconstruct the status quo in their given fields, wherever it is needed. Quite often they are the rejects, outcasts, sub-citizens, etc. of the very societies to which they bring so much sustenance. Often they are people who endure great personal tragedy in their lives.

Like Maier&#8217;s work, Austen&#8217;s was brought to light by a man who chanced upon it and knew he had chanced upon greatness. Unlike Maier, Austen was still alive. </p>\n<p>In 1950, while working on his book <em>The Revolt of American Women</em>, Oliver Jensen &#8212; a thirty-six-year-old former <em>Life</em> magazine editor and writer &#8212; discovered 3,500 of Alice&#8217;s glass-plate negatives in the basement of the Staten Island Historical Society and was instantly taken with their uncommon genius. Leafing through phone books, he was staggered to realize that Alice was still alive, then doubly staggered to learn that she was living at a poorhouse. </p>\n<p>Drawing on his magazine connections, he secured publication of Alice&#8217;s work in <em>Life</em>, which raised enough funds to migrate her to a nursing home. He then built on the initial visibility to organize an exhibition of her work at a local museum in 1951 &#8212; the first and only in her lifetime. When the show opened on October 7, now celebrated as Alice Austen Day, Alice was there with Gertrude by her side. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73785\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliceausten_expresswagon.jpg?resize=680%2C490&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"490\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73785\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliceausten_expresswagon.jpg?w=698&#38;ssl=1 698w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliceausten_expresswagon.jpg?resize=320%2C231&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliceausten_expresswagon.jpg?resize=600%2C432&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliceausten_expresswagon.jpg?resize=240%2C173&#38;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A friend&#8217;s young sons in what Alice called her &#8220;express wagon,&#8221; May 1889.

href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/19/simone-weil-attention-gravity-and-grace/\">&#8220;Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity,&#8221;</a> the great French philosopher Simone Weil wrote shortly before her untimely death. An epoch after her, Mary Oliver eulogized the love of her life with the observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/20/mary-oliver-molly-malone-cook-our-world/\">&#8220;attention without feeling… is only a report.&#8221;</a> Looking back on centuries of love poems by people of genius who dared to love beyond the cultural narrows of their time, the poet J.D. McClatchy observed that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/26/j-d-mcclatchy-love-speaks-its-name/\">&#8220;love is the quality of attention we pay to things.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>Because our attention shapes our entire experience of the world &#8212; this, after all, is the foundation of all Eastern traditions of mindfulness, which train the attention in order to anneal our quality of presence &#8212; the objects of our attention end up, in a subtle but profound way, shaping who we are. </p>\n<p>Because there is hardly a condition of consciousness that focuses the attention more sharply and totally upon its object than love, what and whom we love is the ultimate revelation of what and who we are. </p>\n<p>That is what the great Spanish philosopher <strong>José Ortega y Gasset</strong> (May 9, 1883&#8211;October 18, 1955) explores in a series of essays originally written for the Madrid newspaper <em>El Sol</em> and posthumously published in English as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Aspects-Single-Theme/dp/1614273383/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>On Love: Aspects of a Single Theme</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-love-aspects-of-a-single-theme/oclc/1031851786&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; a singular culmination of Ortega&#8217;s philosophic investigation of Western culture&#8217;s blind spots, biases, and touching self-delusions about love, that is, about who and what we are.</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/12/05/an-abz-of-love/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/abzlove19.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration from the vintage Danish handbook <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/12/05/an-abz-of-love/\"><em>An ABZ of Love</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Defining love as &#8220;that sense of spiritual perception with which one seems to touch someone else&#8217;s soul, to feel its contours, the harshness or gentleness of its character,&#8221; Ortega notes that love reveals &#8220;the most intimate and mysterious preferences which form our individual character.&#8221; He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are situations, moments in life, in which, unawares, the human being confesses great portions of his ultimate personality, of his true nature. One of these situations is love. In their choice<a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/06/06/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-love-choice/\">*</a> of lovers [human beings] reveal their essential nature. The type of human being which we prefer reveals the contours of our heart. Love is an impulse which springs from the most profound depths of our beings, and upon reaching the visible surface of life carries with it an alluvium of shells and seaweed from the inner abyss. A skilled naturalist, by filing these materials, can reconstruct the oceanic depths from which they have been uprooted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Defining attention as &#8220;the function charged with giving the mind its structure and cohesion,&#8221; Ortega places it at the center of the experience of love:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Falling in love&#8221; is a phenomenon of attention.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Our spiritual and mental life is merely that which takes place in the zone of maximum illumination. The rest &#8212; the zone of conscious inattention and, beyond that, the subconscious &#8212; is only potential life, a preparation, an arsenal or reserve. The attentive consciousness can be regarded as the very space of our personalities. We can just as well say that that thing dislodges a certain space in our personalities.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72914\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642738_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=680%2C979&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"979\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72914\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=320%2C461&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=600%2C864&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=240%2C346&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=768%2C1106&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.

Anyone who has ridden the intoxicating elation of early love has felt this, and yet Ortega intimates that this is an illusion of consciousness, masking the actual phenomenon at work, which is rather the opposite &#8212; everything is tinted with aspects of the beloved, blurring and tuning out the details that give the world its actuality. Ortega writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The person in love has the impression that the life of his consciousness is very rich. His reduced world is more concentrated. All of his psychic forces converge to act upon one single point, and this gives a false aspect of superlative intensity to his existence.</p>\n<p>At the same time, that exclusiveness of attention endows the favored object with portentous qualities&#8230; By overwhelming an object with attention and concentrating on it, the consciousness endows it with an incomparable force of reality. It exists for us at every moment; it is ever present, there alongside us, more real than anything else.

When paralyzed, it does not leave us any freedom of movement. In order to save ourselves, we would have to reopen the field of our consciousness, and to achieve that it would be necessary to introduce other objects into its focus to rupture the beloved&#8217;s exclusiveness. If in the paroxysm of falling in love we could suddenly see the beloved in the normal perspective of our attention, her magic power would be destroyed. In order, however, to gain this perspective we would have to focus our attention upon other things, that is, we would have to emerge from our own consciousness, which is totally absorbed by the object that we love.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nothing illustrates this contracting of the lens more clearly than the discomposing experience of emerging from the somnambulant state of in-loveness &#8212; an experience familiar to anyone who has ever surfaced from an infatuation or has deepened an infatuation into a calm and steady love. Ortega writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we emerge from a period of falling in love we feel an impression similar to awakening and emerging from a narrow passage crammed with dreams. Then we realize that normal perspective is broader and airier, and we become aware of all the hermeticism and rarefaction from which our impassioned minds suffered. For a time we experience the moments of vacillation, weakness, and melancholy of convalescence.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/03/exupery-little-prince-morgan-drawings/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thelittleprince_morgan10.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/03/exupery-little-prince-morgan-drawings/\">original watercolors</a> for <em>The Little Prince</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But despite its potential pitfalls, love remains at once the most interior and the most influential experience of our personhood. In a sentiment evocative of that exquisite line from <em>The Little Prince</em> &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/03/exupery-little-prince-morgan-drawings/\"><em>&#8220;What is essential is invisible to the eye.&#8221;</em></a> &#8212; Ortega considers how love, so invisible yet so essential a feature of our humanity, polishes the lens of our entire worldview:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The things which are important lie behind the things that are apparent.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Probably, there is only one other theme more inward than love: that which may be called &#8220;metaphysical sentiment,&#8221; or the essential, ultimate, and basic impression which we have of the universe. This acts as a foundation and support for our other activities, whatever they may be. No one lives without it, although its degree of clarity varies from person to person. It encompasses our primary, decisive attitude toward all of reality, the pleasure which the world and life hold for us. Our other feelings, thoughts, and desires are activated by this primary attitude and are sustained and colored by it. Of necessity, the complexion of our love affairs is one of the most telling symptoms of this primogenital sensation. By observing our neighbor in love we are able to deduce his vision or goal in life. And this is the most interesting thing to ascertain: not anecdotes about his existence, but the card upon which he stakes his life.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/26/the-well-of-being-jean-pierre-weill/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/thewellofbeing_weill0.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Jean-Pierre Weill from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/26/the-well-of-being-jean-pierre-weill/\"><em>The Well of Being</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>And yet our culture has a peculiar willful blindness to how love shapes life and the particular expression of aliveness that is our creative work &#8212; a peculiar denial of the elemental fact that because we love with everything we are, our loves imprint everything we make.

Ortega shares in this distaste for the cultural diminishment of love as a driving force of creative work. Observing that many persons of extraordinary creative power have tended to take their loves &#8220;more seriously than their work&#8221; &#8212; the very work for which they are celebrated as geniuses, and a choice for which they have suffered derision by their contemporaries and by posterity &#8212; he admonishes against this common cultural judgment: </p>\n<blockquote><p>It is curious that only those incapable of producing great work believe that the contrary is the proper conduct: to take science, art, or politics seriously and disdain love affairs as mere frivolities.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72560\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/unweaving-a-heart-to-weave-a-rainbow_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UnweavingAHeart_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C809&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"809\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72560\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UnweavingAHeart_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UnweavingAHeart_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C286&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UnweavingAHeart_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C381&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UnweavingAHeart_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C914&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UnweavingAHeart_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C714&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crochet mural by street artist <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/NaomiRAG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NaomiRAG</a>, Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

But the closer the question moves to the core of our being, the more clearly and catastrophically the illusion crumbles &#8212; nowhere more helplessly than in the most intimate realm of experience: love. Try to will yourself into &#8212; or out of &#8212; loving someone, try to will someone into loving you, and you collide with the fundamental fact that we do not choose whom we love. We could not choose, because we do not choose who and what we are, and in any love that is truly love, we love with everything we are. </p>\n<p><strong>James Baldwin</strong> (August 2, 1924&#8211;December 1, 1987) was a young man &#8212; young and brilliant and aflame with life, blazing against <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/20/james-baldwin-the-creative-process/\">society&#8217;s illusion of stability and control</a> &#8212; when he composed his stunning semi-autobiographical novel <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Giovannis-Room-James-Baldwin/dp/0345806565/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Giovanni&#8217;s Room</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/giovannis-room/oclc/907611889&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>), making the paradox of freedom its animating theme. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Giovannis-Room-James-Baldwin/dp/0345806565/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jamesbaldwin.jpg?resize=680%2C425&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"jamesbaldwin\" width=\"680\" height=\"425\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53759\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jamesbaldwin.jpg?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jamesbaldwin.jpg?resize=240%2C150&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jamesbaldwin.jpg?resize=320%2C200&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jamesbaldwin.jpg?resize=768%2C480&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jamesbaldwin.jpg?resize=600%2C375&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">James Baldwin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Baldwin writes: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To bear the unbearable, Baldwin intimates, we construct and cling to artificial structures of choice, personal and social &#8212; habits, routines, the contractual commitment of marriage, the moralistic frameworks that indict one kind of love as good and another as bad. Today, <em>Giovanni&#8217;s Room</em> is celebrated as a pioneering liberation and representation of LGBTQ+ love &#8212; a term that did not exist in Baldwin&#8217;s day, for it speaks to a cultural silence so deep then that there was no adequate language for it. (The language we use today is hardly adequate &#8212; but language is always a placeholder for a culture&#8217;s evolving understanding of itself, the space in which we work out our concepts as we learn how to think about them in learning how to speak of them.) Baldwin rose against a tidal force of cowardice from publishers at a time when the Bible of psychiatry &#8212; the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders &#8212; classified love as so many of us know it as a “sociopathic personality disturbance.” At the center of his act of courage and resistance is the recognition that the experience of love is our most primal confrontation with the illusion of freedom. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72916\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642772_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=680%2C801&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72916\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=320%2C377&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=600%2C707&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=240%2C283&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=768%2C905&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.
