This entry looks at the tired trope involving haunted houses built on an Indian burial ground.</i></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian Burial Ground, also known as the IBG, is a trope that has a history of mediocre usage in horror cinema. Many who think of the IBG immediately recall little Carol Anne (Heather O&#8217;Rourke) in <em><strong>Poltergeist</strong></em>; however, that 1982 film doesn&#8217;t have any ancient Native cause for its haunting. In fact, it goes out of its way to state that the mysterious happenings around the Freeling house are not caused by an IBG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-an-ibg-poem\">An IBG Poem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Death is a part of life, so the concept of funeral practices in some format has been around as long as humankind. A late 18th-century poem entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46094/the-indian-burying-ground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Indian Burying Ground</strong></a>&#8221; by Philip Freneau speaks to a ghostly afterlife believed by the unnamed Native community he observed. The poem is a romantic one; it ponders the existential question of an eternal spirit after the fleshly death.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freneau considers the ways of the Native people who at the time were being murdered, having their land taken, and losing their cultural ways. Obviously, Freneau didn&#8217;t do much in protest other than writing this flowery work, but it is the earliest use of the IBG that I could find.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-cinematic-beginning\">The Cinematic Beginning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cinematically, the IBG trope goes back to the story of <em><strong>The Amityville Horror</strong></em>. The book was released by Jay Asen in 1977, and the rest is history. There have been twenty-one movies (so far), and tons of controversy surrounds the ordeal. While a murder did occur at the house found at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York, the book was supposedly based on true events, many of which have been disproved. Some speculate the entire haunting of the Lutz family that followed the original murder was invented as a ploy for money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the original film adaptation, which debuted in 1979, George and Kathy Lutz, played by James Brolin and Margot Kidder, purchase a house whose previous owner murdered his entire family. Soon, glowing red eyes and a room full of flies are seen on the property. In a claim consistent with Asen&#8217;s book, Kathy finds out the house was built on a Shinnecock burial ground. OH NO!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All land is Native land, but the Shinnecock tribe <a href=\"https://amityvillemurders.com/the-haunting/the-amityville-files-facts-and-myths.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">never occupied the area</a> on which this infamous house was built. I mean, if you’re going to use a specific nation, then at least name the correct one.&#160;The erasure and inaccuracies of Native cultures within the movie industry are made worse by mixing up the names of our communities. Many might think that Navajos are like Mohawks or Ojibwes are like Cherokees, but our names are not interchangeable because each nation has its own unique histories, traditions, and cultural ways that exist today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-two-stephen-king-adaptations\">Two Stephen King Adaptations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>The Shining</strong></em>, a book by Stephen King, was first adapted by Stanley Kubrick in 1980. Several details were changed from the source material, one of which is Kubrick&#8217;s addition of an IBG backstory. A single line of dialogue explains everything while the Torrance Family is touring their new residence. “The site’s supposed to be on an Indian burial ground.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wall art and Native-inspired designs are found throughout the film. These Indigenous details have inspired a number of theories. Some say the entire plot is a metaphor for Native genocide, citing the waves of blood flowing from the elevators as a pathway to those who lay beneath.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate question remains: Is the IBG the reason Jack Torrance and the caretakers before him go mad and try to kill his wife and child? While <em>The Shining</em> never revisits the specifics of this detail mentioned in passing at the beginning of the film, the addition of the IBG by Kubrick is not a mistake. The filmmaker is known for his perfectionism as well as his repetitive nature that ensured no misstep would make its way into the final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next adaptation of King’s work with an IBG was <em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/31-days-of-horror-pet-semetary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pet Sematary</a></strong></em>, released in 1989 (and remade in 2019). Its story relies on an ancient burial ground that brings the dead back to life. This ritual is first demonstrated with a cat named Church who is hit on the nearby highway. Sure, Church comes back to life, but he is smelly, mangy, and an evil version of the pet he once was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some have reported that King used a tribe not originally from the Maine setting of the story, this is untrue. The Mi’kmaq, also spelled Micmac like in Pet Sematary, do have one federally recognized tribe in the United States: the Aroostook Band of Micmac. Of course, the setting of the story is a town near the University of Maine, which is the traditional homeland of the Penobscot Nation. While the Penobscot <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://umaine.edu/about/university-of-maine-land-acknowledgement/\" target=\"_blank\">are a part of the Wabanaki Confederacy</a> with the Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi&#8217;kmaq, however, these are all different peoples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interesting aspect of the IBG in <em>Pet Sematary</em> is that the Native connection is not what causes the malice in the beings brought back to life. As the story explains, the ground was made sour by a windigo. The windigo is a malicious demon spirit that is believed to be fueled by its lack of cultural roots. It feeds on anything and everything, including people, and its greed knows no satisfaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some believe that bankers and other investors that are involved with the oil industry, which is a constant threat to Native land, are under a windigo psychosis, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://mohawknationnews.com/blog/tag/windigo-psychosis/\" target=\"_blank\">which is why they display a constant need to devour and destroy.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-so-what-does-this-mean\">So, what does this mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a couple of outliers, like 2003’s <em><strong>Identity</strong> </em>and 2012’s <em><strong>Silent Hill: Revelation</strong></em>, most of the IBG stories in cinema came out of the 1980s. Big Hollywood features weren&#8217;t the only plots that utilized the trope, either. The low budget 1983 B-movie <em><strong>Scalps</strong></em> and the 1986 Italian slasher <em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/body-count-1986/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Body Count</a></strong></em> each dealt with an IBG. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The popularity in this era could be due to the current events at the time. The Indian Civil Rights Act was passed in 1968 which ensured concepts like freedom of speech and press, right to due process, and protection from double jeopardy. However, ideals like sovereignty and the right to fish and hunt are still issues that Native communities face to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1978, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act reversed the outlaw against specific practices and ceremonies. The fear of non-monotheistic religions and beliefs has ironically been evident since the first Americans settled on Native land for the reason of spiritual freedom. The sudden allowance, at least on paper, of practices that had once been seen as too mystical and esoteric could very well have led to the popularity of the IBG in the following decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, there’s been more a continuation of the trope on television. Many shows, like <em><strong>The Simpsons</strong></em>, specifically its second season <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> Halloween special, have included episodes with an IBG. Other series include<em><strong> Family Guy</strong></em>, <strong><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/supernatural-fans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Supernatural</a></em></strong>, all of which include an IBG in at least one episode. These are all works of fiction, but turn on any instance of <strong><em>Ghost Adventures</em></strong>, a paranormal investigator reality show, and every fifth episode or so deals with some sort of IBG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the specifics, all of these examples are annoying mainly because they are done without any Native involvement. Even in the case of Stephen King and the windigo, something he has used in more works than just <em>Pet Sematary</em>, the creature is taken out of context and put forth for a non-Native audience. Essentially, the IBG and all the stories that involve this underdeveloped explanation for a haunting presence is a form of cinematic cultural appropriation. It erases any sort of specific Native cultural belief about the afterlife while spreading false information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the IBGs don&#8217;t add something to the plot that a regular cemetery could not &#8212; as seen with <em>Poltergeist</em>. All final resting places have a creepy factor that could and should be utilized. So why has the IBG trope continued so specifically and exclusively? Native activist and writer Terri Jean <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://bluecorncomics.com/burial.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gives us five possible theories</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The IBG plot-line worked in one movie, so it&#8217;ll work in others, and so they&#8217;ll write it in as long as it sells.</li><li>Graveyards are well-marked, while an IBG could be anywhere. This allows for endless possibilities without explanation, so it&#8217;s a screenwriter&#8217;s dream.</li><li>A Native villain, or a Native inspired spirit that haunts the vicinity, plays into stereotypes that have been around since colonization. The attitude towards Native people as lesser than or as equal to evil is reinforced.</li><li>People are afraid of what they don&#8217;t know, and the general public is undereducated about Native people.</li><li>Guilt, specifically settler guilt. There is a fear that Native people killed by European settlers might come back for revenge on their murderer&#8217;s descendants.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The most frustrating aspect of the IBG is that we are talking about a bunch of dead Native people. This adds to the incorrect narrative that all Native Americans are extinct. The historical &#8212; and therefore non-existent in a modern time &#8212; image of the warrior chief and all his maidens and children that just need some flute music to play in the background is the common misconception of the Native American.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am here to tell you that we are still here, and I am evidence of that. We are not all buried in some unmarked grave, driving a stepfather to murder like in <em>The Amityville Horror</em>, or turning your dead cat into some sort of demonic being like in <em>Pet Sematary</em>. For the most part, we are working to fill the gaps where the American educational system has failed to teach about our existence and are attempting to reverse the harm from underdeveloped plot devices like the IBG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IBG is a watered-down portrayal of Native cultures as a monolith that existed in the historical past instead of the vibrant and diverse umbrella that the term &#8220;Native American&#8221; covers even today.&#160;This isn&#8217;t to say tropes can&#8217;t be used correctly. I am hopeful that eventually a Native filmmaker will use the IBG in a satirical way and point out some of the issues with using it in new media today.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/9xXQnzUDozw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 20:16:49 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"84b86f5711da73815d4dcd7c7f83fed4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Shea Vassar","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/9xXQnzUDozw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-44-52-358_ef5c7b172539b5d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866684812},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:44","title":"10 Creepiest, Yuckiest, Ickiest Bug Horror Movies","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357364","description":"<p><em>October is defined in Webster’s Dictionary as “31 days of horror.” Don’t bother looking it up; it’s true. Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article about the best bug horror movies is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n<p>Horror movies have a wide, potentially endless range of things that can be manipulated and shaped into terrifying objects, threats, and nightmares. Something that requires very little work on the part of a film/filmmaker to make creepy and disturbing, though, is our innate fear and disgust of bugs. It&#8217;s an easy jump from seeing them onscreen to imagining them crawling all over our skin, and horror movies know it.</p>\n<p>For our look at the ten best examples of bug horror on the big screen, we decided on a single rule: we&#8217;re ignoring the fact that spiders aren&#8217;t actually bugs. I know, we&#8217;re terrible. It&#8217;s not like we went nuts with it, though, as spiders only headline two of the ten films. Three feature ants, three are about roaches, one squirts worms in your eyes, and one of them stars carnivorous slugs. Which reminds me, neither worms nor slugs are bugs either.</p>\n<p>Anyway&#8230; for the duration of this post, let&#8217;s just remember that spiders &#8212; and worms and slugs &#8212; are &#8220;bugs.&#8221; Now please join me and the crew (<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/coffel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chris Coffel</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Valerie Ettenhofer,</a> <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\">Jacob Trussell</a>) as we point our magnifying glass towards ten of the best bug horror movies!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>10. Empire of the Ants (1977)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358477\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empire-of-the-ants.jpg\" alt=\"Empire Of The Ants\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empire-of-the-ants.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empire-of-the-ants-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empire-of-the-ants-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empire-of-the-ants-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve often thought of myself as the world&#8217;s biggest fan of animal attack movies, but if I&#8217;m being honest, that honor should actually go to Mister <strong>Bert I. Gordon</strong>. His particular niche was movies about larger than life animals, and his filmography includes the likes of <em>Beginning of the End</em> (giant grasshoppers!), <em>Attack of the Puppet People</em> (giant cat and rat &#8212; technically normal-sized animals but the people are shrunk!), <em>The Spider</em> (duh, a giant spider!), <em>The Food of the Gods</em> (giant rats!), and finally, <em>Empire of the Ants</em> with, well, I bet you can guess what&#8217;s giant here.</p>\n<p>This film is most remembered for the presence of Joan Collins, but I&#8217;m here to sing the praises of those ginormous damn ants. Big, hairy practical effects bring them to life along with some split-screen optic work to put real ant footage into the scenes. It&#8217;s effective! The story also stands out for throwing in a turn that goes beyond mere carnage to include the queen ant squirting humans with pheromones and turning them into workers. It&#8217;s big fun, and unrelated: can we get a shout out for ol&#8217; Bert who &#8212; as of this writing &#8212; is still alive! (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>9. Bug (1975)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358476 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bug.jpg\" alt=\"Bug horror\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bug.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bug-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bug-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bug-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written more extensively about this <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/bug-1975-amazon-prime-good-movie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">under-appreciated gem</a> elsewhere, but the short version is that <em>Bug</em> remains an effectively creepy slice of bug horror. They&#8217;re cockroaches, and if that&#8217;s not icky enough, they&#8217;re also prone to chewing your flesh, starting deadly fires, and spelling our ominous warnings &#8212; in English! &#8212; on the wall with their bodies. It&#8217;s low-budget, sci-fi/horror delivering killer bugs and an apocalyptic tease, and the scene where the woman is cooking in the kitchen as a bug sets her hair on fire? Still haunts my dreams&#8230; and not just because it was filmed in the kitchen from <em>The Brady Bunch</em>. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. The Nest (1988)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358475 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-nest.jpg\" alt=\"The Nest bug horror\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-nest.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-nest-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-nest-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-nest-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>You know what they say&#8230; if you&#8217;ve seen one movie about roaches on a list, there&#8217;s bound to be more. So here&#8217;s the second! (And spoiler, a third is directly below.) This entry sees science go wrong again, sending a horde of the buggers into the nightmares of a small town&#8217;s unlucky residents, and while they&#8217;re nasty creatures even when normal, they&#8217;re hideous monsters when they start taking human form. It&#8217;s a fun monster movie, and its back half descends into some gory, gooey goodness that satisfies your craving for some B-movie bug horror shenanigans. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>7. Mimic (1997)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358474 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mimic.jpg\" alt=\"Mimic bug horror\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mimic.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mimic-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mimic-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mimic-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Cockroaches are nasty, fat, not-really-little beasts covered in thick armor. You see one in your place, and your skin automatically ignites in gooseflesh. Now, let&#8217;s give them a deadly disease requiring a cure that ultimately transforms them into apocalypse-ushering titans. Yeah, it makes sense. That tracks with their gnarly biology. <strong>Guillermo del Toro</strong> knows the dark corners of our brain, and he easily reaches into them to pull out our most base fears. Is <em>Mimic</em> as mighty as <em>The Shape of Water</em> or <em>The Devil&#8217;s Backbone</em>? No way. You know it; he knows it. That&#8217;s okay. The film still crawls with wretched mini-nightmares, and when you do get a good look at the creature design, the film astonishes. These beasts are festering, hungry animals that don&#8217;t look or feel too far off the natural order. In 2020, we expect these critters to crawl out of the sewers.

Squirm (1976)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358473\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/squirm.jpg\" alt=\"Squirm\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/squirm.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/squirm-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/squirm-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/squirm-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Now, here’s a film that makes good on the promise of its title! What’s the matter? Afraid of worms!? This is a <strong>Roger Corman</strong> movie, with special make-up effects by Rick Baker, that premiered at Cannes, about millions of carnivorous worms descending on a small town in Georgia after knocked-down power lines call them to the surface and instill them with bloodlust. HELL YEAH. Since it’s initial lukewarm (lukeworm) critical reception, <em>Squirm</em> has been revitalized as a cult classic thanks to a memorable second-life on television. Sporting rubber worms, sandworms, and an ungodly amount of bloodworms, <em>Squirm</em> literally used so many worms that the production impacted the local fishing industry in Maine.</p>\n<p><em>Squirm</em> is one of the best nature-run-amok films of the &#8217;70s. Operating on a tight budget (which, again, went entirely towards the worms), the film relies on atmosphere and performances to yield one hell of a creepy film. Worms come out of showerheads, closets, crawlspaces, and people’s faces. Oh, right, and they scream. Did I mention that the worms scream in this movie? Because they do, with their tiny little worm mouths, and it’s very unsettling! If you haven’t had the chance to catch this one, seek it out, and it’ll worm its way into your heart in no time.

Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article about the best historical horror movies is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some may associate period pieces with classical narratives, costume dramas, and characters frolicking on the moors. But we know if you&#8217;re a horror fan what comes to mind are chilling gothic tales, historical haunts, and throwback thrills. Historical horror movies can come in a variety of forms and subgenres. Some films provide us with an exact date, others exist in a nebulous range of millennia past. In deciding on the cream of the crop, we found that some films were set centuries ago while others were as recent as the last few decades. Either way, with boundless historical narratives to choose from, it&#8217;s clear that period-piece horror is home to some of the best in the genre.</p>\n<p>Join us as we reflect on the best historical horror movies, as decided by <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/coffel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Coffel</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacob Trussell</a>, and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">myself</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>10. Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-355399\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/captain-kronos.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Kronos\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/captain-kronos.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/captain-kronos-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/captain-kronos-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/captain-kronos-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The 1970s marked Hammer’s commercial downturn, but it produced some of the studio’s finest creative output. In an effort to stay relevant in the changing landscape of horror at the time, the studio began experimenting, and the movies became more entertaining as a result. <em>Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter</em> added more swashbuckling and action to the period horror yarns the studio was synonymous with at the time. In the movie, the titular monster hunter and his hunchbacked assistant go after bloodsuckers in a pastoral 19th century England. The film was conceived with sequels in mind. The fact that they didn’t happen robbed horror fans of a potentially great series of pulpy adventures centered around a fantastic beast slayer. Kronos’ exploits have continued in the pages of comics, but he deserves more adventures on the screen. (Kieran Fisher)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>9. Viy (1967)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358511\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/viy.jpg\" alt=\"Viy historical horror\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/viy.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/viy-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/viy-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/viy-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>“You’re wrong to try to get out of here. It&#8217;s not the sort of place you can escape from whenever you feel like it.” This is the thesis to <em>Viy</em>, a Ukrainian film that is as much about superstition as it is about the violent history of the nation in which it was created. The first Soviet-era horror film released in the USSR, and based on a short story by Russian author Nikola Gogol, <em>Viy</em> follows Khoma (Leonid Kuravlyov), a seminary student in 16th century Ukraine who is called upon by the father of a young woman who, on her deathbed, requested that the student pray for her soul as she lay in repose in her rural village.</p>\n<p>What Khoma doesn’t realize before arriving is that he knows the young woman: she was a witch who terrorized him the night before. Keeping tight-lipped so as to reap the fortune offered by the woman’s father, the priest spends three nights locked in with the witch who continues her torment before unleashing literal hell on Khoma. Oddly enough, schlocky creature feature fans have a lot to enjoy in this intellectual exercise in horror as the climax finds the young Cossack besieged by multi-eye abominations, crawling humanoids, and gargantuan column-like hands that are insane looking, especially for a movie from 1967.</p>\n<p>By modern monster standards, sure, the demons are about as terrifying as the <em>Bear in the Big Blue House</em>, but how can you not marvel at the giant Henson-esque full-bodied puppet of the titular <em>Viy</em>? Remarkably, that absolute unit of a creature dates back to <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">R. Sheytan’s original 1901 illustrations</a> that accompanied Gogol’s story. What really separates Viy from other adaptations, like Mario Bava’s <em>Black Sunday</em>, is its striking cinematography full of muted hues that evoke an earthy deadness before being immediately contrasted by cosmic blues and hellish pinks that make the film visually astonishing. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. The Lighthouse (2019)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358512\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-lighthouse.jpg\" alt=\"The Lighthouse\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-lighthouse.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-lighthouse-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-lighthouse-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-lighthouse-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>I’m not sure why <em>The Lighthouse</em> is on this list considering it’s a documentary about my quarantine experience, but fine, we’ll allow it. <strong>Robert Eggers</strong>’ dark shanty about two farty lighthouse-keepers toiling, drinking, and going insane together is a tour de force of nautical chicanery. From using a rare aspect ratio from early sound cinema to bespoke architecture, to the woebegone Petzval lens, <em>The Lighthouse</em> commits to its time period in front of and behind the camera. This film is a testament to the power of detail: from the pitch-perfect rhythms of the 1890s dialogue to the litany of references to maritime mythology and superstition. It is impossible not to get into the mood as soon as that first foghorn sounds. Naturally, we expect nothing less from someone as meticulous as Eggers, who has carved out a cinematic space for himself as a director attuned to bringing the past to life on-screen.

Sleepy Hollow (1999)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358513\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sleepy-hollow.jpg\" alt=\"Sleepy Hollow historical horror\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sleepy-hollow.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sleepy-hollow-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sleepy-hollow-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sleepy-hollow-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tim Burton</strong>&#8216;s most effortlessly entertaining film is also one of the best historical horror movies, even if it doesn&#8217;t get credit on either count. The film tackles the classic Washington Irving tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman, and it&#8217;s never been told better. Yes, it stars <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>, but this was back when he still had talent, and he shows that with some fantastic physical comedy and expressive acting. It&#8217;s funny, thrilling, surprisingly gory, and the added presence of Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee, and more welcome faces makes for a fun time. Is it historically accurate? Hell no, but the details and production design do a beautiful job creating an immersive world and capturing a time long gone. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>6. The Others (2001)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357859\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001.jpg\" alt=\"The Others\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>A pastoral English country manor should be an idyllic place of escape from the terrors of the world. That is unless it&#8217;s immediately after World War II, your children have an extreme sensitivity to sunlight, and your house is haunted. In that case, this isn&#8217;t a reprieve from horror, it&#8217;s the cause of it. As Grace (Nicole Kidman in top form) does everything she can to protect her children from threats both natural and supernatural, she must reckon with the history of the estate she&#8217;s confined to, her own place in it, and what it will take for her own spirit to break.

Today, we&#8217;re watching a video about how James Gandolfini navigates emotion.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you seen any or all of <em>T<strong>he Sopranos</strong></em>? Well, then, my friend, congrats — you’ve seen the best performance you’re ever gonna see on television. Before there was Jon Hamm’s Don Draper or Bryan Cranston’s Walter White, there was one king of the small screen who paved the way for all of your antihero faves:<strong> James Gandolfini</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actor’s award-winning, six-season-long turn as Tony Soprano is a staple of noughties pop-culture and a wonder to behold to this day. Gandolfini embodied the New Jersey mob boss with every resource in an actor’s toolkit. He could turn on a dime — flipping from jovial to terrifying in a second, instilling fear in those around him as well as those of us watching at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gandolfini was also a master of building a performance, layering subtle gestures and minute details, steadily growing more and more agitated, and then snapping. He could trace Tony’s conscious thought process and unconscious impulses with a tilt of his head and a wave of his hand. And, of course, he made it look effortless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s been seven years since Gandolfini’s untimely passing, and it still feels impossible to fully accept his absence, he holds a place in the hearts of <em>Sopranos</em> fans, and his ongoing influence on TV is immeasurable. While it’s heartbreaking to think none of us will ever see a new Gandolfini performance for the first time, his portrayal of Tony Soprano is one worth returning to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a deeper dive into what made Gandolfini’s performance the gold standard, check out the video essay below. It singles out one scene in particular and details what exactly Gandolfini does as an actor that makes his performance so impactful and unforgettable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch &#8220;<strong>How James Gandolfini Navigates Emotion</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"How James Gandolfini Navigates Emotion\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLSm2RSpVKI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This video essay was created by <strong>The Nerdwriter</strong>, a.k.a.

This entry looks into the breathing television effect in Videodrome.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>When <strong>David Cronenberg</strong> directed <em><strong>Videodrome</strong></em> in the early &#8217;80s, he was coming off of a series of fiercely original indie horror films largely financed under Canada’s favorable tax-shelter laws. While <em>Videodrome</em> began life as a tax-shelter picture, early in production the project was picked up by Universal Studios. Working under more commercial auspices had drawbacks. But it also meant that Cronenberg was working with a much larger effects budget. Which, in the hands of the Baron of Blood, certainly did not go to waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Videodrome </em>follows Max Renn (<strong>James Woods</strong>), a small-time porn mogul who’s on the hunt for &#8220;tougher&#8221; programming. One of his minions dredges up a pirated broadcast of a plotless torture session called &#8220;<em>Videodrome</em>.&#8221; Sensing he’s on to something that could redefine entertainment, Max searches for the creators of the program. However, with each exposure to the <em>Videodrome</em> signal, Max’s grip on reality begins to blur into something entirely new…and fleshy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-3.gif\" alt=\"Videodrome Television Effect\" class=\"wp-image-358446\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-3.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-3-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Cronenberg was only a child when television first started to ingratiate itself into people’s homes. Anxious parents warned their children not to sit too close, fearing some pernicious radiation might affect attentive minds. In <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AyFKDXwCFd0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a video-interview with Mick Garris</a>, Cronenberg underlines that “it’s totally misleading” to describe <em>Videodrome</em> as a criticism of television. “It’s really an extension of what I’ve been doing all along,” explains Cronenberg. “Which is to see what happens when people go to extremes in trying to alter their total environment to the point where it comes back and starts to alter their physical selves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, <em>Videodrome</em> is interested not in any Michael Crichton-esque conflict with science and technology so much as in initiating a conversation about how we don’t always know what we’re building or how it&#8217;s affecting us. How media shapes our perception of reality, and in so doing actually changes reality for us. How mass media can become a literal outgrowth of our psyches and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long before interactive screens look over our lives, <em>Videodrome</em> envisioned a world where we wouldn’t just look at our devices, they’d look back at us. Where we’d touch them and, in turn, they’d touch us back.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-2-1.gif\" alt=\"Videodrome Television Effect\" class=\"wp-image-358445\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-2-1.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-2-1-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the central images in the film is of a swelling television screen engulfing a man&#8217;s head. In the scene, Max receives a tape from his secretary (it’s actually Betamax, <em>Videodrome</em>’s format of choice). After the tape swells unexpectedly in his hand, Max drops it to the floor. Finally, he regains his composure and plays the tape. On-screen, he sees media philosopher Marshall McLuhan—sorry: Brian O&#8217;Blivion (Jack Creley). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As O&#8217;Blivion warns Max that Videodrome is responsible for his death, a masked figure appears and strangles him. The figure removes their mask to reveal the visage of Max’s lover, Nicki Brand (<strong>Debbie Harry</strong>). The television begins to throb with leathery veins and unprecedented musculature. Brand’s televised lips pucker as the screen swells, her suggestive voice luring Max closer. Finally, Max caresses the screen and pushes his face into her swollen mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a compellingly disturbing scene in a film full of compellingly disturbing scenes. It is erotic in a way that somehow defies and rhymes with what conventionally registers as erotic. And, moreover, it is a remarkable and alarming special effect. Like Max, you might gape at the TV to verify that yes, that screen is in fact getting bigger. Glass metamorphosed into something stretchy and organic, that continues to convey a moving-image, unimpeded. So, while Max seems to have no difficulty, it&#8217;s a hard effect to wrap your head around. So let’s get into it: </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-d-they-do-that\">How’d they do that?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-long-story-short\">Long story short:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A film camera shot footage of a TV screen playing a video of Debbie Harry. This film was then rear-projected onto an inflatable airtight rubber chamber inside the television.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-long-story-long\">Long story long:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The “breathing screen” effect initially fell to the special makeup effects team. This consisted of <strong>Rick Baker</strong> and his small army of EFX inc. artists who had an average age of twenty-three. Ultimately, the effect became a collaboration between all three special effects units &#8212; makeup, physical, and video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Baker tells it, after the success of <em>An American Werewolf In London</em>, the assumption was that special effects makeup artists could do anything the script called for. “I got the script for <em>Videodrome</em>, and it had all this crazy-ass stuff in it,” recalls Baker in <a href=\"https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/rick-baker-interview-men-in-black-3-werewolves-and-videodrome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a 2012 interview with Den of Geek</a>. “I was like, ‘How the hell am I going to do this?’” In the Criterion bonus audio interview <em>Effects Men</em>, Baker describes <em>Videodrome</em> as “one of the strangest assignments [he&#8217;s] ever had.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The television itself is a TeleRANGER model. Baker and Cronenberg chose it because its size was large enough to accommodate the workings for a mechanical effect. The team built a number of models over the course of production for different effects and for testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-3-1.gif\" alt=\"Videodrome Television Effect\" class=\"wp-image-358447\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-3-1.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-3-1-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Baker experimented with various approaches for the screen effect. “I knew we would need a flexible material,” he <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/676-medium-cruel-reflections-on-videodrome\">recalls to Criterion</a>. “And we tested with a weather balloon first, stretching it over a frame the size of a TV screen, and pushed a hand through it to see how far it stretched.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the head of special video effects, <strong>Michael Lennick</strong>, the television prop required a lot of testing. “We were originally going to do it as a bluescreen effect,” he explains. “We were looking up various types of material…blue gelatin was one substance that we were working with, in which the actor could literally dunk his head into this stuff.” Unfortunately, before they could waterboard James Woods with Jell-O, they came up with a more elegant solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The suggestively heaving screen was ultimately created with a projector and a sheet of dental dam coated with highly reflective white paint. If a television screen made out of a common barrier for oral sex feels too Cronenbergian to be true, that’s because it is. As Baker reminds us, dental dam rubber was one of the first materials used for rear-projection screens: “It’s what they used in <em>King Kong</em>…It was a nice sensual thing that [Woods] could caress, and it would respond.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effect had “a tactility you don’t get with computer imagery,” Cronenberg muses on the commentary. It “allowed you to [&#8230;pause&#8230;] handle things on the set.” Or, as Woods evocatively puts it on <em>his</em> commentary track: the screen was “literally like a big breast.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-1.gif\" alt=\"Videodrome Television Effect\" class=\"wp-image-358443\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-1.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-1-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption>You don&#8217;t say.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-filmed video footage of Harry was rear-projected through an airtight plexiglass chamber onto the sheet of rubber, which in turn could be inflated with a bellows. Speaking of which: the effect called for certain parts of the television to expand and contract. Baker’s team had always used simple cable and pressure controls to puppeteer live performances. Airflow was often regulated by blowing air through an assortment of tubes. But the TV proved too large and complex for this approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical effects supervisor <strong>Frank Carere</strong> devised a solution. To grossly oversimplify, Carere outfitted a keyboard organ with a valved air compressor. The result was a device that could inflate air bladders in sequence when the operator pressed certain keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cronenberg shot <em>Videodrome</em> in Toronto in the late fall of 1981. And because Canadian government-funded films were beholden to non-negotiable cut-off dates, production had to wrap by the end of the calendar year. As a consequence, Cronenberg and his crew had to start shooting without a finished script. To be clear: Cronenberg did <em>have</em> a complete script when filming began. But it was, in a manner of speaking, a prototype. Albeit a wilder, more audacious, and by all accounts more shocking prototype. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several effects set pieces were cut, including one involving our good pal the TeleRANGER. The sequence would have seen a return to one of Cronenberg’s preferred locations: <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/from-the-drain-david-cronenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the bathtub</a>. The hallucination required the SFX team to waterproof the television, which, according to the script,  was to rise improbably out of the depths of the tub.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-point.gif\" alt=\"Videodrome Television Effect Point\" class=\"wp-image-358449\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-point.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Videodrome-television-effect-point-768x416.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The TeleRANGER does appear in a later effect in the film in a sequence where a hand, clutching a gun, juts out from behind the screen. The transitional effect, shifting between a real video image and a flesh-TV appliance, is relatively straightforward. Baker and his team built a variant of the breathing screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Lennick and his assistant, <strong>Lee Wilson</strong>, figured out a front projection process that featured a series of graduated filters that allowed the operators to fade-in and -out an image of video static without expensive post-production optical matting. Then it was just a matter of pushing the finger puppet forward in synch with the projected visuals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, in addition to looking better than an optical effect, the benefit of pulling off the TV-screen effects in-camera was that the effect was done once shooting wrapped. After all: the hope of the effects team was that they’d get to go home by Christmas &#8212; which some of them did, <em>barely</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-s-the-precedent\">What’s the precedent?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By Rick Baker’s estimation, most of the effects in <em>Videodrome</em> had no precedent. And around these parts, we’re liable to believe Rick Baker when it comes to the history of makeup effects. We’ve already covered the ins and outs of <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/rear-projection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rear-projection</a> on this column. So in an absence of preexisting piano-controlled dental dam televisions, let’s have a quick chat about Cronenberg’s philosophy around special effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When folks think of Cronenberg, they think about his infamous irreverence for the human body. From the vampiric appendage that grows out of Marilyn Chambers’ armpit in <em><strong>Rabid</strong></em>, to the exploding head in <em>Scanners</em>, to Samantha Eggar&#8217;s mutated external womb in <em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/stephen-r-bissette-the-brood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Brood</a></strong></em>: Cronenberg&#8217;s filmography offers no shortage of icky, memorable moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, while Cronenberg’s career-long interest with untrustworthy flesh is legendary, his films are never <em>about</em> the effects themselves. Not really. Despite how vividly Cronenberg’s creations stick in one’s mind, their impact is as much narrative as it is material. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is to say: while their appearance is certainly evocative and compelling, Cronenberg frames his effect in a context that’s meant to make us both uncomfortable and empathetic. You don&#8217;t &#8220;enjoy&#8221; effects in a Cronenberg film as an objective third party. In fact, more often than not, we experience effects in a Cronenberg film from the same pained perspective as the characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her book <em><a href=\"https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-deleuze-and-horror-film.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Deleuze and Horror Film</a></em>, Anna Powell asks, &#8220;Is there really a clear distinction between the &#8216;props&#8217; and the actors that inter(act) with them in <em>Videodrome</em>? When the television screen softens and bulges&#8230;can we really refer to it solely as a prop?&#8221; It&#8217;s a fair question. This prop is indeed a monstrous one. And it is monstrous precisely because it feels human in its unfolding mutations: from a seductive female form to a tortured body, to finally, a bloated mass of bleeding organs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The television effects in <em>Videodrome</em> are an enticing confluence of hard and soft, aluminum and flesh, consciousness and hallucination: a cancerous mass of contradictions, alive, breathing, and quite the sight to behold. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\"
