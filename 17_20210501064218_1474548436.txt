But&#8230; that silence is in order for you to perceive something other than yourself &#8212; what you&#8217;ve arranged as yourself to actually perceive this frontier between what you call your self and what you call other than your self, whether that&#8217;s a person or a landscape.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Echoing Susan Sontag&#8217;s observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/06/the-aesthetic-of-silence-susan-sontag/\">silence is a form of spirituality and a form of speech</a>, he considers poetry as a channel for contemplative silence: </p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the greatest arts of poetry is actually to create silence through attentive speech &#8212; speech that says something in such a way that it appears as a third frontier between you and the world, and invites you into a deeper and more generous sense of your own identity and the identity of the world&#8230; Poetry is the verbal art-form by which we can actually create silence.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/25/ruth-krauss-maurice-sendak-open-house-for-butterflies/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/openhouseforbutterflies18.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration by Maurice Sendak from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/25/ruth-krauss-maurice-sendak-open-house-for-butterflies/\"><em>Open House for Butterflies</em></a> by poet Ruth Krauss</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His essay on silence in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Consolations-Nourishment-Underlying-Meaning-Everyday/dp/1786897636/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Consolations</em></strong></a> harmonizes this sentiment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Silence is frightening, an intimation of the end, the graveyard of fixed identities. Real silence puts any present understanding to shame; orphans us from certainty; leads us beyond the well-known and accepted reality and confronts us with the unknown and previously unacceptable conversation about to break in upon our lives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And yet, echoing poet-philosopher Wendell Berry&#8217;s lovely insistence that in silence and solitude <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/17/wendell-berry-pride-despair-solitude/\">&#8220;one’s inner voices become audible [so that] one responds more clearly to other lives,&#8221;</a> he adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In silence, essence speaks to us of essence itself and asks for a kind of unilateral disarmament, our own essential nature slowly emerging as the defended periphery atomizes and falls apart. As the busy edge dissolves we begin to join the conversation through the portal of a present unknowing, robust vulnerability, revealing in the way we listen, a different ear, a more perceptive eye, an imagination refusing to come too early to a conclusion, and belonging to a different person than the one who first entered the quiet.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Reality met on its own terms demands absolute presence, and absolute giving away, an ability to live on equal terms with the fleeting and the eternal, the hardly touchable and the fully possible, a full bodily appearance and disappearance, a rested giving in and giving up; another identity braver, more generous and more here than the one looking hungrily for the easy, unearned answer.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73032\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?resize=680%2C1025&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1025\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73032\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?resize=320%2C482&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?resize=600%2C904&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?resize=240%2C362&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?resize=768%2C1157&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase2.jpg?resize=1019%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1019w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Moon at Magome</em> by Hasui Kawase from his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/22/hasui-kawase-prints/\">contemplative-poetic vintage woodblock prints</a>.

She would later write:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thousands of people who had within them a yearning toward nature, a deep-seated need to preserve its beauty, had been in very truth asleep. I know, for I was one of them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Until that point, her fierce wakefulness to justice had been channeled toward the plight of half of her own species, which culminated with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. But the multigenerational triumph left Edge &#8212; who had spent years composing pamphlets, delivering speeches, and serving as secretary-treasurer of the New York State chapter of the Woman Suffrage Party &#8212; with the postpartum hollowing of spirit that follows the completion of any project into which one has poured all of oneself. </p>\n<p>But a person of passion and brilliance is never bored for long.</p>\n<p>One night while traveling in Europe with her family, Edge found herself reading and rereading a sixteen-page pamphlet &#8212; the era&#8217;s primary whistleblowing medium &#8212; titled &#8220;A Crisis in Conservation.&#8221; It exposed the ties the nation&#8217;s network of Audubon Societies had to gun and ammunition makers and the consequent withholding of protection from species hunters considered pests or targets &#8212; including the bird, which this very nation had taken for its symbol and spirit animal: the North American bald eagle. </p>\n<p>Edge&#8217;s family summoned her for dinner, but she kept pacing the room in fiery disbelief, later recalling:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For what to me were dinner and the boulevards of Paris when my mind was filled with the tragedy of beautiful birds, disappearing through the neglect and indifference of those who had at their disposal wealth beyond avarice with which these creatures might be saved?</p></blockquote>\n<p>As soon as she returned to America, still thinking about the eagles, Edge turned her wakeful intellect and indomitable passion for justice toward the broader fate of feathered beings in the hands of the thumbed. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/eagle-owl-1893_print?sku=s6-11456508p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?resize=680%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"683\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?w=2082&#38;ssl=1 2082w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?resize=240%2C241&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?resize=320%2C322&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?resize=768%2C772&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?resize=600%2C603&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eagleowl.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eagle-owl from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/29/lydekker-royal-natural-history-owls/\"><em>The Royal Natural History</em></a>, 1893.

There, she calmly rose from the back to hold its leaders accountable for the practices revealed by the pamphlet. After a stunned silence, various men in power took turns with defensive stabs at her credibility, then derided the rhetorical style of the pamphlet without addressing its substance. </p>\n<p>To Edge, this was only evidence that something was amiss, that she must persist until it is righted. </p>\n<p>And so she did. Over the years that followed, Rosalie Edge &#8220;stood up very often,&#8221; as she later recalled. After seeing a photograph of hundreds of dead hawks neatly lined up on the Appalachian forest floor, she traveled to Eastern Pennsylvania to witness the barbaric tradition that had occasioned the horror: recreational hunters gathering every autumn to shoot thousands of migrating hawks, having stalked out the perfect summit from which to intercept the migration path and perform the mass slaughter. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73358\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rosalieedge_deadhawks.jpg?resize=680%2C528&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"528\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73358\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rosalieedge_deadhawks.jpg?w=1072&#38;ssl=1 1072w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rosalieedge_deadhawks.jpg?resize=320%2C249&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rosalieedge_deadhawks.jpg?resize=600%2C466&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rosalieedge_deadhawks.jpg?resize=240%2C186&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rosalieedge_deadhawks.jpg?resize=768%2C597&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Haws killed near Kempton, Pennsylvania.

Nearly a century later, it is the world&#8217;s most active site of raptor conservation and observation. </p>\n<p>For the remaining two decades of her life, Rosalie Edge went on to become one of the most vocal, visible, and effective champions of conservation, inspiring the founding of The Nature Conservancy, The Environmental Defense Fund, and The Wilderness Society; inspiring generations of ordinary citizens with her ethos that the protection of nature is not something to be awaited from above but a basic civic duty for each of us, echoing her contemporary and kindred spirit Eleanor Roosevelt&#8217;s insistence on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/02/eleanor-roosevelt-tomorrow-is-now/\">the power of personal responsibility in social change</a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73357\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RosalieEdge.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73357\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RosalieEdge.jpg?w=600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RosalieEdge.jpg?resize=320%2C480&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RosalieEdge.jpg?resize=240%2C360&#38;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rosalie Edge in her late years.

In Rosalie Edge&#8217;s lifetime, the paper&#8217;s sole headline containing her name &#8212; printed the year Olympic National Park was created largely thanks to the nationwide grassroots campaign Edge had spearheaded &#8212; hovers over a two-sentence report of a shoulder fracture that Edge, &#8220;known for establishing a mountain sanctuary for predatory birds,&#8221; had suffered upon slipping at a dance party. But she is redeemed at long last as one of the conservation heroes profiled and celebrated in Michelle Nijhuis&#8217;s altogether magnificent book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beloved-Beasts-Fighting-Life-Extinction/dp/1324001682/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Beloved Beasts: Fighting for Life in an Age of Extinction</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/beloved-beasts-fighting-for-life-in-an-age-of-extinction/oclc/1155069529&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>), in which Edge figures as an exquisite specimen of the species of visionaries Nijhuis interleaves into the broader story of conservation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Each person profiled here stood, or stands, at a turning point in the story of modern species conservation &#8212; a story which, for better and sometimes worse, still guides the international movement to protect life on earth&#8230; Though they often used pragmatic arguments to convert others to their cause, their personal motivations ran deeper, for many had started keeping company with members of other species to escape their own troubles. Some were painfully shy, or burdened with mental or physical illness. Some were separated from spouses at a time when divorce was a scandal, or drawn to their own gender when homosexuality was taboo. Most of them knew something about suffering, and they found consolation in the sights and sounds of other forms of life.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71983\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/crowned-eagle-by-george-edwards-1758-benefiting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_crowned_eagle_s6.jpg?resize=680%2C836&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"836\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71983\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_crowned_eagle_s6.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_crowned_eagle_s6.jpg?resize=240%2C295&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_crowned_eagle_s6.jpg?resize=320%2C394&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_crowned_eagle_s6.jpg?resize=768%2C945&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_crowned_eagle_s6.jpg?resize=600%2C738&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Crowned Eagle by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/11/18/george-edwards-gleanings-natural-history/\">George Edwards</a>, 1758.

The concept of the food chain, sometimes called the food web, had been proposed only three years earlier by the British ecologist Charles Elton. The word “ecosystem,” commonly used in ecology and conservation to describe an assemblage of interacting species and their physical surroundings, would not be coined until 1935. Many scientists &#8212; and most of the general public &#8212; continued to think of the living world as an assembly of relatively independent parts, not an interconnected whole. </p>\n<p>Edge’s understanding of ecological relationship&#8230; set her apart from most conservationists of her time. Her concern for all species and her opposition to most hunting were shared by animal welfare activists, including many of the women who opposed the plume trade. But while Edge hated cruelty to individual animals, she devoted most of her energy to preventing the extinction of species.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73364\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/american-sparrow-hawk-by-jl-ridgways-1901-proceeds-benefitting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/americansparrowhawk1.jpg?resize=680%2C1023&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1023\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73364\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/americansparrowhawk1.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/americansparrowhawk1.jpg?resize=320%2C481&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/americansparrowhawk1.jpg?resize=600%2C902&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/americansparrowhawk1.jpg?resize=240%2C361&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/americansparrowhawk1.jpg?resize=768%2C1155&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">American sparrow-hawk by J.L.

She had furnished Carson, who visited Hawk Mountain two decades earlier, with key DDT data about the pesticide&#8217;s savaging impact on birds. </p>\n<p>While Rosalie Edge did not have Rachel Carson&#8217;s poetic gift, her fierce devotion to hawks inspired it: Carson, who would soon popularize the esoteric word <em>ecology</em>, composed one of her most breathtaking essays about the interconnectedness of nature upon returning from Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in 1945:</p>\n<blockquote><p>They came by like brown leaves drifting on the wind. Sometimes a lone bird rode the air currents; sometimes several at a time, sweeping upward until they were only specks against the clouds or dropping down again toward the valley floor below us; sometimes a great burst of them milling and tossing, like the flurry of leaves when a sudden gust of wind shakes loose a new batch from the forest trees.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>On the horizon to the north, formed by a series of seven peaks running almost at right angles to the ridge on which we sit, an indistinct blur takes form against the sky. Second by second the outlines sharpen. Soon the unmistakable silhouette of a hawk is etched on the gray.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Here on the mountain top we are in the sweep of all the winds out of a great emptiness of sky, and the cold seeps through to the very marrow of my bones. But cold, windy weather is hawk weather, and so I am glad, although I shiver and my nose reddens, and I look speculatively at my thermos of hot coffee&#8230; Mists are drifting over the valley. A grayness overhangs all the sky and the clouds seem heavy with unshed rain. It is an elemental landscape &#8212; a great rockpile atop a mountain, nearby a few trees that have been stripped and twisted by the mountain winds, a vast, pale, arching sky.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it is not strange that I, who greatly love the sea, should find much in the mountains to remind me of it. I cannot watch the headlong descent of the hill streams without remembering that, though their journey be long, its end is in the sea. And always in these Appalachian highlands there are reminders of those ancient seas that more than once lay over all this land. Halfway up the steep path to the lookout is a cliff formed of sandstone; long ago it was laid down under shallow marine waters where strange and unfamiliar fishes swam; then the seas receded, the mountains were uplifted, and now wind and rain are crumbling the cliff away to the sandy particles that first composed it. And these whitened limestone rocks on which I am sitting &#8212; these, too, were formed under that Paleozoic ocean, of the myriad tiny skeletons of creatures that drifted in its water. Now I lie back with half closed eyes and try to realize that I am at the bottom of another ocean &#8212; an ocean of air on which the hawks are sailing.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/11/21/the-lost-spells-macfarlane-morris/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thriftwithflowers.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Jackie Morris from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/11/21/the-lost-spells-macfarlane-morris/\"><em>The Lost Spells</em></a> by Robert Macfarlane</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Complement with Helen Macdonald&#8217;s stunning <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/16/h-is-for-hawk/\"><em>H Is for Hawk</em></a>, then revisit Carson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/12/rachel-carson-scripps-college-commencement/\">ecological clarion call to the next generations</a> &#8212; that is, to us &#8212; delivered months before Edge&#8217;s death. </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

Creation and destruction. What do we pray for but the equation that helps us make sense of what happens in our daily lives? What do we believe in if not that which tells us we&#8217;re alive? Sex, laughter, sweat, and equations elegant enough to figure on our fingers. Math is spirit and spirit is faith in numbers; both take us to the edge but no further than we can imagine. You don&#8217;t believe in math? Try to figure the velocity of Earth&#8217;s orbit around the Sun to land a man on the Moon without it. You don&#8217;t believe in God? Try to use math to calculate what the eye does every second of any given moment. If Big Blue tried to work that differential equation in our lifetime, it couldn&#8217;t. Mysteries inside mysteries in our own bodies of which we can&#8217;t make sense, another world waiting for a religion or calculus to explain. Look into any mirror; it&#8217;s like sitting in a theater watching a silent movie, but you&#8217;re the one pantomiming your story. You think you have this world figured out, but you can&#8217;t tell which hand you&#8217;re using and using and using. And why do we try?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We try, of course, because curiosity is the true triumph of consciousness; because what Einstein called <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/12/einstein-passion-for-comprehension/\">&#8220;the passion for comprehension&#8221;</a> is the hallmark of our species. We comprehend by parsing the world into categories and classes, constantly computing the distances and differences between them. This, it <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/02/13/herman-melville-nathaniel-hawthorne-love-letters/\">bears repeating</a>, is a beautiful impulse &#8212; to contain the infinite in the finite, to wrest order from the chaos, to construct a foothold so we may climb toward higher truth &#8212; but it is also a limiting one, a dangerous one, nowhere more so than in the artificial binaries we create in trying to orient ourselves by differentiation. </p>\n<p>With an eye to the limiting binaries of our Cartesian inheritance, and perhaps with an eye to <a href=\"https://theithacan.org/news/award-winning-writer-and-poet-joins-ithaca-college/\">his own experience of love</a> &#8212; which every artist cannot but factor into their cosmogony &#8212; Jordan writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You cannot solve for the use of one side of the body over the other, so there is no single voice that emits from it. You cannot solve for the harmonics of a dual body, facing each other, both inquisitive. You cannot solve for the marriage of opposites, their fit, their match, their endlessness. You cannot solve for the morning stretch that calls to both sides, first this one, then that one, aligning the day. You cannot solve for the bass of one hand and the treble of the other, both keeping rhythm hostage under the skin of the bongo. You cannot solve for the balance of a locked door and a safe cracker&#8217;s ear against it and the move X number of clicks to the <strike>left</strike> and Y number of clicks back to the <strike>right</strike> and back past and back past till the latch clicks open in your mind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement this fragment of Jordan&#8217;s thoroughly wonderful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Lyrics-Poems-Van-Jordan/dp/0393333124/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Quantum Lyrics</em></strong></a> &#8212; which imagines the inner lives and animating forces of Einstein, Schrödinger, and other titanic scientific minds who have revolutionized our understanding of external reality &#8212; with Feynman on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/11/richard-feynman-science-religion/\">why uncertainty is essential for morality</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/10/17/richard-feynman-arline-letter/\">touching effort to reconcile what he knows about science with what he knows of love</a> after the death of his young wife, then revisit Ursula K.
