Whether it&#8217;s a surgical mask that needs to be disposed of entirely or a hard-shell mask with replaceable filter-inserts, every mask out there, reusable or not, generates some form of waste. While some would say that&#8217;s just the price humanity has to pay to keep us safe, the team at Vault Creation doesn&#8217;t believe in creating non-biodegradable waste as a by-product of human safety.</p>\n<p>Meet VoGuard, a mask with components that can be reused over and over. It comes with a flexible medical-grade PVC outer that fits on any face-type, and a unique filter you can wash and reuse multiple times. Unlike disposable fabric filters that get fitted into most masks, VoGuard actually uses a perforated polyester film that can be washed, sanitized, and reused over and over again. Vault Creation, the company behind VoGuard, develops these innovative polyester filters in-house. They use a patented plasma ion-beam dry-etching technique to create 5-micron perforations in the film, allowing it to trap particles and droplets that may contain viral inhalants and harmful particles, while letting clean air pass through. The polyester construction enables VoGuard&#8217;s filters to last much longer than regular fabric filters since they can be washed and reused multiple times (although you should switch the filters for a fresh pair every 6 months for sanitary reasons).</p>\n<p>VoGuard&#8217;s filters were made to be easy to clean and reuse. Simply wash them under running water with soap (as you would your hands) gently lathering up the surface before rinsing the soap off, and your filter is as good as new. If you&#8217;re in a bit of a rush, you could even use disinfecting wipes to wipe-down your filters, spray them with sanitizer, or rub sanitizer-gel onto them&#8230; Once clean, the plyester filters are good to use again. VoGuard&#8217;s filters use incredibly tiny perforations (measuring 5-microns in diameter) to trap particles, unlike fabric and melt-blown filters that trap particles using static electricity. Think of it as a fine-mesh sieve that prevents particles larger than the holes in it from passing through. Not only does this mean VoGuard&#8217;s filters last a whole lot longer than traditional static filters, but it also increases breathability by as much as 3x, allowing only clean air to flow through freely, and letting you breathe more comfortably than most other surgical or N95 masks. The presence of filters on both the left and right side of the face ensures that your air is filtered both while inhaling as well as while exhaling, keeping you as well as others around you safe.</p>\n<p>That impressive feat aside, VoGuard is a comfortable, portable mask that&#8217;s designed for battling bad air quality as well as staying safe from potentially infectious diseases. Its flexible soft-PVC body allows it to fold and fit into your pockets, and when opened, it conforms to the shape of your face to prevent the creation of air-gaps. The PVC outer body as well as the filters are easy to clean and maintain too, and can be sanitized with a spray or a wipe, or rinsed under running water with soap. This allows you to use VoGuard over and over without generating medical waste (those surgical masks don&#8217;t biodegrade, btw) or spending sums of money on new masks and filters every time. The masks come in a single size, in classic black and pristine white color options, and ship as early as November 2020. If VoGuard reaches its stretch goal, you&#8217;ll even get a free anti-bacterial pouch along with each mask!</p>\n<p>Designer: Vault Creation</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://voguard-washable-filter-mask.kckb.st/b53fafd9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $29</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-10-17T07:13:29+00:00\">$49</del> (40% off).

height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Your product’s packaging is arguably the first thing the consumer sees, as a part of the product experience. It forms the first ever interaction between product and consumer, and a successful interaction means a consumer will pick the product up off the aisle and add it to their cart. Bad packaging design can adversely affect a product’s success or its performance, while a well-packaged product allows it to stand out, prompting someone to pick it up and decide to purchase it. Packaging Design is more than just a box with artwork… it’s the product around the product, and deserves as much attention while designing as the item within it.</p>\n<p>Packaging Design forms just one of the various categories of the A’ Design Award and Competition, which spans the popular categories like Architecture, Lighting, and Consumer Electronics, as well as the obscure, lesser-known categories like Cybernetics, Prosumer Products, and Safety Apparel Design. The A’ Design Award’s ultimate goal is to be an umbrella that covers good design across all disciplines, which is why it has <a href=\"https://competition.adesignaward.com/design-award-categories.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">100 different categories</a> for submitting design projects, and <a href=\"http://www.awardjury.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">218 jury members</a> (comprising academics, design professionals, and press members) from all around the world collectively judging the works. Winners of the A’ Design Award don’t just secure a trophy and a certificate, but receive an entire PR Campaign dedicated towards pushing their career, clout, and even their projects to newer heights. A’ Design Award’s winners and even its participants are included in its annual award book and business network, while additionally contributing to their <a href=\"http://www.worlddesignrankings.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">country’s overall design ranking</a> that paints a holistic picture of how design-centric and design-forward each country is.</p>\n<p>The A’ Design Award is currently accepting entries for the 2021 edition of the award program, so go ahead and give your work and career the push it deserves!</p>\n<p>Here are some of our favorite Packaging Design winners from the A’ Design Award &#38; Competition 2020.

Wulianghong Liquor Packaging by Sisi Don</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282693\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /><br />\nInspired by the traditional ingredients and practices that come together to make the Wulianghong liquor experience, the bottle and packaging for this alcoholic beverage do a brilliant job of being not just aesthetic, but culturally relevant too. For starters, the bottle comes in this three-piece box, inspired by the screens often found in oriental architecture. Designed to not just encase the bottle, the box allows you to display it too, using two opening panels. The artwork on the box isn&#8217;t printed, but rather is embroidered, making it quite a collectible while also paying tribute to the national art-form of China. The bottle comes with a 3D design of a peony-flower too, the national flower of the country.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">02. Soulmate Perfume Packaging by Himanshu Shekhar Soni</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282694\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /><br />\nThis two-part perfume comes as one single unit that splits into the two separate perfume bottles. Designed to be a gift you&#8217;d give to your significant other, the Soulmate Perfume comes with both him-and-her (or them-and-them) perfumes that you can use together. The two bottles come interlocked as a pyramid, and split apart into separate perfume-bottles (sort of like Britney Spears&#8217; Fantasy fragrance) when you want to use them, reuniting into a single form once you&#8217;re done!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">03. Ouch! First Aid Kit by Xiaofei Liu</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282695\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /><br />\nThis unique-looking first-aid kit comes with biodegradable packaging, and a novel hexagon-form that opens up to reveal the medical kit within. Open up the Ouch! kit and it cleverly segregates into 3 separate parts &#8211; bandages/gauze, medicines/ointments, and other eqipment like gloves, cleaning towelettes, etc. Open it up and you can instantly access the box you want to use immediately, instead of rummaging around through items. Each individual box even has pamphlets with instructions on how to use the contents inside!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">04. Bakers Dozen 13-Pack Egg Carton by Randy Ludacer</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282696\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"701\" /><br />\nThe Bakers Dozen egg carton is a wonderful play on an old-time practice, where bakers would often add a 13th loaf to the batch of 12 loaves to avoid being penalized for selling underweight bread. The Bakers Dozen egg carton reinterprets that with its 13-egg tray made from papier-mache. The tray&#8217;s form is 6-sided (sort of like an elongated hexagon), allowing them to not only store 13 eggs but also enabling them to be tessellated like a honeycomb so as to efficiently pack them together!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">05. Greyder V Shoe Packaging Design by Musa Celik</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282698\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_66.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /><br />\nThe way the Greyder V shoes sit inside their box is influenced by how we walk. The shoes form a V-shape, emulating the way our feet are postured in between steps. The shoes rest on these inclined ramps that are suspended to the Greyder box using cords. To access the shoes, just pull out the ramps and they swivel out sort of like a drawbridge to reveal the sneakers within.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">06. Yagumitan Honey Packaging Design by Jiabo Lu and Kun Luo</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282699\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /><br />\nYou&#8217;d be wrong to think that the Yagumitan Honey is just like any regular honey. It comes from a wild colony of bees found living on the cliffs of the rocky Yunnan mountains, far from civilization. The word &#8220;YAGUMITAN&#8221;, which means &#8220;the honey seeker in the valley&#8221;, is an ode to these bees, and the packaging reflects exactly how rare and precious the contents within are. The box comes with a faceted design, almost like an obsidian stone, while the bottles inside look like cut diamonds, holding within some of the scarcest wild honey in China.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">07. Bonita Pour Femme Perfume Packaging Design by Vishal Vora</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282700\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /><br />\nThe objective of the Bonita perfume&#8217;s design was to represent fashion, class and tie to an object that was quintessentially feminine. Inspired by the hobo bag&#8217;s shape, the Bonita perfume comes with a crescent-shaped bottle, and a braided leather strap connecting its sides. The brown-tinted fragrance inside completes the illusion of it being a leather-made bag, and there&#8217;s even a leather tag hanging from the side for extra impact!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">08. Source One Vodka Spirits and Alcohol by Aether NY, LLC</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282701\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /><br />\nSource One&#8217;s bottle is interesting because it isn&#8217;t just faceted, it&#8217;s also a spiral (something you&#8217;ll probably notice after looking at it for the second or third time)! The bottle takes inspiration from greenhouse architectural elements and spiral staircases, creating something that is eye-catching and unusual to look at&#8230; not just architecturally, but even for a bottle of vodka!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">09. San Liang Jiang Beverage Packaging by Wen Liu and Xianwen Wu</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282702\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282703\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"650\" /><br />\nHow do you show that your product is not just premium, but precious too? You could, like the Yagumitan honey, make the bottle/packaging faceted and gem-like, or you could do something as bizarre and beautiful as the packaging for San Liang Jiang. The San Liang Jiang beverage comes in a bottle the shape of an ancient relic, but that isn&#8217;t all. It comes in a box, packaged in a compressed clay-like brick. In order to retrieve this antique bottle, one must quite literally excavate it by using the tools provided to shovel-away at the outer layer, revealing the relic within. The process is interactive, and rewarding as you use tools to remove the dirt and dust and reveal the precious item underneath it! This would make for an incredible unboxing video!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">10. 2019 National Card Collection Day Deck Playing Cards by Alexander Chin</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282704\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"851\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-282705\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/the-product-around-your-product-winning-packaging-designs-from-a-design-award-2020/adesign_packaging_2020_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /><br />\nInspired by the palaces of Morocco, the 2019 event design pays tribute to the iconic architecture of the region with traditionally decorated gates and exotic geometric patterns. The packaging is an interactive experience designed to mimic the exploration of a Moroccan palace. The experience rewards users with escalating stages based on their efforts in the journey. Lift up the gateway-inspired sleeve and stack multiple packs together and the gateways transform into an endless beautiful palace corridor!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Impressed? Inspired?

The concept of evenly cooking a piece of meat using a rotating method has existed for thousands of years and can be found in practically every cuisine. The job of rotating the meat was usually designated to a lowly individual known as the ‘spit jack’, and one of Da Vinci’s contraptions even tried to mechanize it, so that it would automatically rotate without needing someone to manually turn it. In fact, the complexities of Da Vinci’s contraption eventually went on to stimulate the invention of the clock! Eventually, the rotisserie was born, and it found its way into European cooking. The idea was to horizontally rotate the meat over a fire, and gradually it evolved into the rotisserie oven which cooked the meat from the top as well as the bottom, while a plate under the rotating meat helped collect the dripping fat. Heck, my mouth’s watering already.</p>\n<p>The ROTO-Q 360 helps evolve that setup a wee bit further by scaling it down and making it more affordable + accessible. Designed to slide right into any regular oven or be placed on a pellet grill, smoker, or even a campfire, the ROTO-Q 360 is a foldable spring-operated rotating spit that doesn’t use electricity, fuel, or gas. It comes with an easy-to-store foldable design that opens out and fits in any standard oven. The spring-loaded gearbox at one end lets you set the rotating time, while a set of skewers let you mount your meat right onto the ROTO-Q 360 and into the oven. All you do then is run the oven like you normally would, and your roast-chicken turns into a fancy rotisserie chicken. The rotating setup helps your meat cook evenly while staying incredibly juicy on the inside, because the fat with it keeps getting circulated within the meat. For the excess fats that drip off the meat, the ROTO-Q 360 features a nifty bed-tray below the rotating skewers… a design detail that has two-fold benefits. Not only does the dripping fat make your meat less oily (and more healthy), you can even layer the bed-tray with veggies and have them cook right in the fat, giving you rotisserie meat and roasted veggies all in one single cook!</p>\n<p>Things get even more interesting when the ROTO-Q 360’s add-ons come into play. The various add-ons help you cook more than just a whole chicken, allowing you to use your oven in a variety of interesting ways. Aside from the standard rotisserie rod, the ROTO-Q 360 packs newfangled attachments like multiple kebab skewers, sausage-cradles for hot-dogs, steak cages, and cylindrical rotisserie cages for baking stuff you’d normally fry, like chicken-wings. With a little bit of creativity, you could even roast your own coffee beans in your oven too! The attachments retrofit right onto the ROTO-Q 360, which universally fits in every household oven, giving you the ability to do more with it and take it to new levels.</p>\n<p>Designed to put a rotisserie in every home (because buying a special rotisserie oven could set you back a couple of grands), the ROTO-Q 360 costs a mere $49 and comes in all-metal and folds right down to easily fit into a drawer when not in use. Cleverly designed with spring-loaded mechanical components, the ROTO-Q 360 can rotate for a full 60 minutes at a time. When you’re done, the rotating gearbox slides right off, allowing you to put the rest of the rotisserie in a dishwasher, or even clean it in your kitchen sink. The entire setup weighs a little over 5 pounds, and can be used either at home, or carried over to a friend’s house or barbecue party. Along with those attachments, the ROTO-Q 360 lets you cook up a veritable storm, doing much more than making a 5-star rotisserie chicken, allowing you to foray into seafood, red meats, and even roast veggies in a variety of ways. Designed to upgrade your roasting repertoire, much like a good cast-iron skillet upgrades your pizza-baking repertoire, the ROTO-Q 360 helps you make great tasting, healthy food… right in your oven!</p>\n<p>Designer: Susie Wen</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://roto-q-360-non-electric-self.kckb.st/d5fefabd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $59</strong></a> <del>$105</del> ($46 off).

Since the ROTO-Q 360 brings down the cooking time, energy expenditure is also less which in turn saves your money.</p>\n<p>Traditional methods of rotisserie cooking require industrial-style appliances with electric driven motors. These devices are much more expensive (ranging from $250-$600) also not portable and take up a large amount of space in your kitchen.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, cooking chicken in a crockpot or tray by roasting or baking takes a long time to prep 5-6 hours, and sometimes leaves it uncooked or soggy from the bottom side. ROTO-Q 360 will never cause this problem because it cooks the food from all sides through its 360 degrees rotating mechanism. So there is no need for adjusting, stirring or flipping in the middle of cooking, and no more rubbing more butter or oil.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Non-Electric Design</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://roto-q-360-non-electric-self.kckb.st/d5fefabd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/362/556/e07ac301b5f01f2176ce2a985772def2_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1583675163&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=105515e5eee73b5de25fae9ac4586a76\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"590\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_264093\" style=\"width: 1060px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://roto-q-360-non-electric-self.kckb.st/d5fefabd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-264093\" class=\"size-full wp-image-264093\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/this-fully-mechanical-rotisserie-machine-fits-right-into-your-oven/roto_q10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"489\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-264093\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patent-Designed Gear Box</p></div>\n<p>Utilizing a gearbox that stores kinetic energy when the knob of the device is turned, the ROTO-Q 360 does not require any additional electricity or fuel to operate.

room with a <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/turntable/\">turntable</a> or <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/clock/\">analog clock</a>. But nowadays, any song from any artist can be played with the touch of a button. Hardly anyone who owns an analog clock looks at it before looking at their <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. Turntables and wall clocks seem to be technologies of the past, but still, we savor the crackly, crisp sound that comes from spinning records and we adorn our walls with mounted clocks because they bring us back to a time from our younger years. While all of this is true, turntables and analog clocks are a type of technological hardware that is just as reliably functional as it is sentimental. Joonho Sung designed the Vinyl Clock in order to bridge the constant functionality of a clock with the retro sound and lure of a turntable.</p>\n<p>When turntables aren’t in use, they have a tendency to just take up space. They have no purpose other than to play music, so by turning it into a dual-functioning house product, the machine operates on a round-the-clock basis, pun intended. The final product is a stand-up record player whose cartridge doubles as a second-hand for its other purpose of telling and keeping track of time. By incorporating a removable axial cap, the design’s clock can be deconstructed in order to transform into a turntable. Once you select the record you’d like to play, it’s easy to reconstruct the clock back to its practical display. Manually-automated control dials for both volume and time are positioned just above the Vinyl Clock’s speaker for easy, fine-tuning. Through a simple transference of duties, the product’s epitomic function is to play your favorite records, using the clock’s second hand as a cartridge, while also providing you with the time of day &#8211; no longer will your turntable not be in use.</p>\n<p>Just like the time, music is always around us, and with the popularity of turntables only increasing, a music player, that doubles as a multi-functioning design piece, makes for the perfect marriage of yesteryear’s appreciation for music with today’s innovative design energy. Joonho Sung created the Vinyl Clock in order to remind users of how precious parlor music once was, while also acknowledging the expectations of today’s vinyl listeners. The Vinyl Clock bridges value and manual labor with innovation and contemporary design so that the records can keep on spinning.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Long and sweet, short, and cute; curvy and elegant, thin, and broad &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/remote-control/\">remote controls</a> are available in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and designs. They usually come paired with a new set of television but are also sold standalone for their charm, convenience, and elegance. Not many remotes really fall in that category but we can spare a thought for Tech4Home’s expertise in the domain. Now the brand has commissioned <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/pedro-gomes-design/\">Pedro Gomes Design</a> to conceive a cutting-edge remote control that offers a state-of-the-art user experience. And boy isn’t what the latter has pulled off worth grabbing instantly?</p>\n<p>Tech4Home supplies remote controls to major brands worldwide. Now the idea here is to design a remote control and set-top box that is tailored to overcome the challenges in the content-driven interface. The solution is aesthetically appealing and almost unique in its own way yet apt to meet the evolving needs of worldwide Smart TV providers. This longish remote control has an ergonomic design, soft and welcoming shape that fills within the hand. It features a touchpad, a joystick, and also accepts gestures and voice commands. The accompanied round STB features detailing LEDs around its face and touch control buttons on the top. While the microphone on the remote lets you control the TV via voice, the touchpad allows you to swipe through menus very smoothly. Keeping in line with the present-day aesthetics of having your devices react to your commands, the remote&#8217;s interactive LED&#8217;s reacts to your voice command, and the action of the voice command is replicated on the set-top box&#8217;s LED&#8217;s &#8211; after all, getting a response to our actions is a basic pillar of our everyday communication.</p>\n<p>In addition to offering four discrete ways to interact with the Smart TV – touch, button, voice, and gestures – the wirelessly chargeable remote and STB come meticulously packed to make a mass appeal.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a
