I’m happy to unveil the latest one: a complete redesign of CodePen Settings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Settings is one of the last remnants of Old School CodePen<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. While I’ll miss the 2011 nostalgia, the new Settings page is a thing of beauty. Beyond the UI and UX we also ripped out another huge chunk of our Ruby on Rails stack and modernized to reusable React Components, expanded our GraphQL API, and refined our component library. The Settings codebase is a joy to work with!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-09.52AM.png?resize=1024%2C690&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14694\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-09.52AM.png?resize=1024%2C690&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-09.52AM.png?resize=300%2C202&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-09.52AM.png?resize=768%2C518&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-09.52AM.png?w=1440&#38;ssl=1 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a redesign of the settings area of CodePen isn&#8217;t particularly exciting to <em>you</em>, dear user.  Fair enough. But we really do hope that when you need to change settings, this new experience is much more snappy and clear. We revisited literally every single page and redesigned it for clarity and responsiveness. We&#8217;re particularly happy with how the billing information is presented. You should be able to easily see your current account status and billing history. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Before &#38; After</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now some fun! I love nothing more than before and after design unveilings, so buckle up y’all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Content Organization</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We flipped the tabbed navigation vertically. Which is the experience you&#8217;ll recognize from the rest of CodePen. We streamlined content where we could (For example, Customize is now within Profile, where it makes sense) but the tab names are almost exactly the same as before. It&#8217;s just far easier to absorb the beautifully laid out content from top to bottom. The permanent sidebar also makes it easier to remember where you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:73%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.03AM.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14702\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.03AM.png?w=689&#38;ssl=1 689w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.03AM.png?resize=300%2C101&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Before: Tabs on Top</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.06AM.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14705\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.06AM.png?w=229&#38;ssl=1 229w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.06AM.png?resize=90%2C300&#38;ssl=1 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>After: Tabs on Left</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Auto Save</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before, you&#8217;d have to click that pesky <strong>Save</strong> button for your updates to take affect.

We&#8217;ve got a few more phases of billing releases to go but this is a great start. For example, you no longer have to switch context to view your team&#8217;s billing information. We&#8217;ve got your personal billing tab up top with the rest of your personal settings. We created a new &#8220;Teams&#8221; section below to house your team billing tab alongside other team settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.11AM.png?resize=605%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14708\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.11AM.png?resize=605%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 605w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.11AM.png?resize=177%2C300&#38;ssl=1 177w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-at-10.11AM.png?w=693&#38;ssl=1 693w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Before: You had to switch contexts to manage team billing separately from personal billing.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanShot-2020-09-10-at-15.17.59@2x.png?resize=1024%2C775&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14671\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanShot-2020-09-10-at-15.17.59@2x.png?resize=1024%2C775&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanShot-2020-09-10-at-15.17.59@2x.png?resize=300%2C227&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanShot-2020-09-10-at-15.17.59@2x.png?resize=768%2C581&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanShot-2020-09-10-at-15.17.59@2x.png?resize=1536%2C1162&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanShot-2020-09-10-at-15.17.59@2x.png?resize=2048%2C1549&#38;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>After: Because I&#8217;m the owner of Team ChimeOn, I can see both my personal billing history and the Team billing history.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Team Account &#38; Members</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So many amazing changes, it&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite.

It involved a ton of design, client and server side work and support desk emails. So it feels especially good to finally have new Settings on production, giving all y&#8217;all out there an improved CodePen. I promise, you don&#8217;t want to know how many support tickets were caused by confusion in the Settings area. Don&#8217;t mind us as we self-high-five. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f64c-1f3fd.png\" alt=\"🙌🏽\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\"
