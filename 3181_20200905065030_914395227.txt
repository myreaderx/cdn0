Over the last few months, we've introduced a comprehensive collection of features that not only gives you more <strong>visibility</strong> into your backup usage, but also helps you take <strong>action</strong> to achieve <strong>significant cost savings</strong>.</p> \n<p>To help you get started with this journey, below are five&nbsp;steps you can take to optimize your backup costs, without needing to compromise on the safety of your data.</p> \n<h2>Clean up backups for your deleted resources</h2> \n<p>If you are backing up resources that do not exist anymore, verify if you still need to retain the backups for these resources. Deleting unnecessary backups can help you save on your backup costs.</p> \n<p>You can use the <strong>Optimize</strong> tab in our <strong>Backup Reports</strong> solution <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureBackupReportDeletedResourcesView\" target=\"_blank\">to gain visibility into all inactive resources</a>, across all types of workloads being backed up. Once you have identified an inactive resource, you can investigate the issue further by navigating to the Azure resource blade for that resource. If you discover that the resource doesn’t exist anymore, you can choose to stop protection and delete backup data for that resource by navigating to the backup item dashboard.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/72f98047-69a3-47bf-8938-6cbce40eb1df.png\"><img alt=\"Use optimize tab in Backup Reports to find inactive resources\" border=\"0\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/61a45e89-f370-4082-bc9f-fe0bc6756288.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<h2>Optimize your backup policies</h2> \n<h3>Use differential backup</h3> \n<p>If you backup SQL or SAP HANA databases inside Azure Virtual Machines, using <strong>daily differential backups along with weekly full backups</strong> is often more cost-effective than daily full backups. We now offer an <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureBackupCostEstimates\" target=\"_blank\">advanced pricing calculator</a> that helps you get an idea of the cost savings achievable by switching to differential backup.</p> \n<p>You can use the <strong>Optimize</strong> tab in our <strong>Backup Reports</strong> solution to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureBackupReportDailyFullBackupView\" target=\"_blank\">identify databases that are currently configured for daily full backup</a>. You can choose to navigate to a particular backup item and modify the policy to use daily differential backup with weekly full backup.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/0421f177-ba0f-48d7-b9a9-dede1365ba23.png\"><img alt=\"Use optimize tab in Backup Reports to view databases configured for daily full backup\" border=\"0\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/0666f92e-c435-4953-b0e3-cbdea0b73340.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<h3>Optimize your retention</h3> \n<p>Verify if you can potentially have <strong>shorter retention durations</strong> for your backup items while still meeting your compliance requirements. While this decision will depend on the specific needs of your organization, we help you gain easier visibility into items that have a large retention duration.</p> \n<p>You can use the <strong>Optimize</strong> tab in our <strong>Backup Reports</strong> solution to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureBackupReportLargeRetentionView\" target=\"_blank\">view all items with retention larger than a specified value</a>.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/d6522f11-be9a-4658-91b5-b551ca5502a5.png\"><img alt=\"Use optimize tab in Backup Reports to view backup items with large retention\" border=\"0\" height=\"215\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/4437d486-abfa-4b54-8336-3ec57f377fc1.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>You can further optimize your retention costs by reducing the retention of instant snapshots from the default period of five days to as low as two days.</p> \n<h2>Take advantage of selective disk backup</h2> \n<p>Often, you might only require the protection of certain disks within a machine and not the entire machine. Earlier, our Azure Vitual Machine backup solution required you to protect the entire virtual machine. But today, you can choose to <strong>exclude or include certain data disks</strong> in the virtual machine (VM) from being protected using the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/selective-disk-backup-restore\" target=\"_blank\">selective disk backup</a> feature.</p> \n<p>For example, if you only want to backup the OS disk of your VM, you can make use of this feature to exclude all other disks from being backed up, and achieve considerable cost savings.&nbsp; You will get cost saving on the Protected Instance fee when you opt for <strong>OS disk only</strong> backup option.&nbsp;The backup storage cost is calculated only for the included disks thereby giving storage cost optimization. Learn more on <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/selective-disk-backup-restore#billing\" target=\"_blank\">billing details of selective disk backup feature</a>.</p> \n<p>Moreover, using PowerShell or Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI), you can also modify the protection to exclude or include specific data disks for a virtual machine that is currently being protected by Azure Backup. This way, you can reduce the backup cost for currently protected virtual machines too, without stopping backup or fear of losing the past recovery points.</p> \n<p>You can use the <strong>Usage</strong> tab of <strong>Backup Reports</strong> to understand how the backup storage consumption for a machine can reduce significantly when you start selectively backing up disks in that machine.</p> \n<h2>Determine your required storage redundancy settings</h2> \n<p>By default, when you configure backup for resources, geo-redundant storage (GRS) replication is applied to these backups. While this is the recommended <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy\" target=\"_blank\">storage replication</a> option as it creates more redundancy for your critical data, you can choose to protect items using locally-redundant storage (LRS) if that meets your backup availability needs for dev-test workloads. Using LRS instead of GRS <strong>halves the cost</strong> of your backup storage.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/c1c90ebe-319c-4e50-9fe4-1266b4c2f2de.png\"><img alt=\"Choose the right storage redundancy settings for your vaults\" border=\"0\" height=\"584\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/0e36d360-88bd-4acf-8121-8345b06f9715.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<h2>Summary</h2> \n<p>Clearly establishing your backup objectives and paying only for the backups you need helps free up funds that can be put to better business use. At the same time, we continue to help you keep your data safe and recoverable. What’s more, you can now make use of Azure Backup&nbsp;enhanced security at no additional cost. You can enable the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">soft-delete capability</a> for all your vaults without needing to pay extra (available today for Azure Virtual Machines, SQL in Azure Virtual Machines, and SAP HANA in Azure Virtual Machines).</p> \n<p>We are continuously working on adding new features over the next few months to help you achieve even more cost efficiency with Azure Backup.

The Azure Spring Cloud capabilities complement and extend our existing Spring Cloud software factory, allowing us to focus on the development of core business functionalities.”—</em>Nicolas Van Kerschaver, CIO, <a href=\"https://www.liantis.be/nl\" target=\"_blank\">Liantis</a> (Belgium)</br></p> \n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><br> <em>“Production is the happiest place on earth. I love seeing my applications there. I do not love wearing the pager! Spring Boot and Spring Cloud give me a framework for building resilient, cloud-native software.&nbsp; Azure Spring Cloud builds on the rich ecosystems of Microsoft Azure, Spring, and Kubernetes to deliver a turnkey platform optimized for Spring-based applications and services. Spring and Azure Spring Cloud let me deliver valuable software without worrying as much about the pager. They get me to production.”</em> —Josh Long, Spring Developer Advocate, <a href=\"https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu\" target=\"_blank\">VMware</a></br></p> \n<h2>Distributed tracing</h2> \n<p>One of the Azure Spring Cloud features that customers have found particularly valuable is distributed tracing. Developers can easily identify issues in their applications and quickly troubleshoot and fix them.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/17c0e98d-2ec5-4be9-a90c-ad746339570f.jpg\"><img alt=\"Microservice transactions in Application Insights\" border=\"0\" height=\"737\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/816ab479-5c10-48ba-8084-c7816d2b6f1b.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p><i>Figure 1: Microservice transactions in Application Insights.</i></p> \n<p>The diagram above captures microservice transactions in Application Insights for 4 hours with 70 percent sampling rate. We purposely dropped one of the microservices, to showcase services that are operating correctly (green) and those with bottlenecks (red). You can use integrated distributed tracing in Azure Spring Cloud to troubleshoot those bottlenecks, plan capacities and keep an eye on production.</p> \n<h2>Azure Spring Cloud in Managed Virtual Network</h2> \n<p>Security is a key tenet of Azure Spring Cloud. Customers want to isolate Azure Spring Cloud from the internet or place it in their own corporate networks. We are happy to share the preview of Managed Virtual Network in Azure Spring Cloud. This feature allows you to be in control of inbound and outbound network communications for Azure Spring Cloud and enables Azure Spring Cloud to interact with systems in on-premises data centers or Azure services in virtual networks.</p> \n<p>In addition, the feature composes with Azure network resources such as Application Gateway, Azure Firewall, Azure Front Door and Express Route, and popular network products such as Palo Alto Firewall, F5 Big-IP, Cloudflare, and Infoblox. This way, you can secure the perimeters around your Spring Boot apps.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/be5b12f0-eae8-49e0-b494-f3d651eb01ec.jpg\"><img alt=\"Reference architecture of Managed Virtual Network and Azure Spring Cloud\" border=\"0\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/ac01d591-8942-42dc-a707-e6f70cb64b95.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p><i>Figure 2: Reference architecture of Managed Virtual Network and Azure Spring Cloud.</i></p> \n<h2>Drive higher utilization of apps in Azure Spring Cloud with Autoscale</h2> \n<p>Autoscale has been one of the most sought-after features from customers. We are excited to share the preview of Autoscale in Azure Spring Cloud. It enables you to be more productive and cost-efficient by automatically scaling apps up or down based on load or schedule. Once Autoscale is enabled, you can be rest assured that the service will take care of your underlying infrastructure and the load on your apps.</p> \n<p>In the load or metric-based mode, your apps will be horizontally scaled out to exactly how many apps and resources are needed for the load, but never go beyond the maximum limits that you set. Similarly, the number of apps and resources will be horizontally scaled-in to meet the minimum to meet your load, but never go below the minimum limits that you set. In the schedule-based mode, your apps will be scaled out and in based on your predefined schedule and limits.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/3761c05a-f80d-40b0-8a2b-3f4b964ac47f.jpg\"><img alt=\"Autoscaling In Azure Spring Cloud\" border=\"0\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/de841578-486e-44a6-947a-34b1424479ed.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p><i>Figure 3: Autoscaling in Azure Spring Cloud.</i></p> \n<h2>Build your solutions today</h2> \n<p>Azure Spring Cloud abstracts away the complexity of infrastructure management and Spring Cloud middleware management, so you can focus on building your business logic and let Azure take care of dynamic scaling, patches, security, compliance, and high availability. With a few steps, you can provision Azure Spring Cloud, create apps, deploy, and scale Spring Boot apps and start monitoring in minutes.</p> \n<p>We will continue to bring more developer-friendly and enterprise-ready features to Azure Spring Cloud.
